                    "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are monoclonal antibodies connected to a cytotoxic agent known as the payload via a chemical linker. It was hoped that ADCs would be \"magic bullets,\" delivering high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy directly to cancer cells without affecting surrounding normal tissues. However, this has not borne out in clinical practice. Though many factors affect toxicity, the toxicities of currently approved ADCs appear to be driven primarily by premature release of the payload into the bloodstream by the linker, by an excessively prominent bystander effect [1], or even payload released by the lysed tumor cells [2]. \n\nADC linkers can be divided broadly into two groups: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers such as hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers rely on physiologic factors (i.e., cathepsin, glutathione (GSH), and low pH) within the cell to cleave the linker. Because these conditions can occur independently of antigen internalization, cleavable linkers are often less stable in the blood, resulting in various off-target effects [3]. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as the thioether or maleimidocaproyl linkers, require internalization by the target cell, so that the antibody, rather than the linker, can be degraded by the lysosome before the drug is released. This latter mechanism does not produce efficient bystander killing and thus results in lower toxicity profiles [4]. For these reasons, other novel linkers, including conditionally released linkers, are currently in rapid development [5,6]. \n\nPreclinical studies have shown that compared to ADCs with non-cleavable linkers, those with cleavable linkers likely release free payload prematurely, leading to increased systemic toxicity. In this study, we sought to delineate the potential effect of linker design on systemic toxicity by analyzing the results of clinical trials using ADCs constructed with both types of linkers.",

                    "text": "In this review and meta-analysis, we sought to delineate how features of ADC design, including linker cleavability, DAR, and systemic free payload concentration, may contribute to their associated systemic toxicities. The results support the hypothesis that ADCs with cleavable linkers are associated with more systemic toxicities than those with non-cleavable linkers. Interestingly, even though higher DAR was associated with higher grade \u2265 3 toxicity, the apparent protective effect of the non-cleavable linker persisted even after adjusting for DAR. However, we found that the association between non-cleavable linkers and lower toxicity was not observed after adjusting for systemic free payload concentration. This suggests that systemic free payload concentration is the main factor driving toxicity in ADC-treated patients. \n\nNotably, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has a considerably higher systemic free payload concentration than the other agents studied here. T-DXd has a tetrapeptide cleavable linker that may make it more vulnerable to premature release of its payload. Such a prematurely released payload might explain why T-DXd may be effective in tumor control regardless of HER2 expression. Emerging clinical evidence supports this hypothesis. In a small trial of T-DXd in non-small cell lung cancer patients, the activity of T-DXd was shown to be independent of HER2 over-expression in HER3 + , 2 + , or 1 + tumors [47]. More recently, clinical trial data presented during the 2021 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium showed that T-DXd was active in breast cancer patients regardless of HER2 expression, including HER2 0 tumors [48]. \n\nBy contrast, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), another anti-HER2 ADC with a non-cleavable linker, has not been shown to have activity in patients with low HER2 tumor expression. This may partly explain why in the DESTINY-03 trial [35], T-DM1 (HER2 dependent) was shown to have lower efficacy compared to T-DXd (HER2 dependent and independent).",

Wynn, Tran Le, Martin McCandless, Yunxi Zhang, Ritesh Patel, Nita Maihle, William B. Hillegass\n## Abstract\nWhile in theory antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) deliver high-dose chemotherapy directly to target cells, numerous side effects are observed in clinical practice. We sought to determine the effect of linker design (cleavable versus non-cleavable), drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), and free payload concentration on systemic toxicity. Two systematic reviews were performed via PubMed search of clinical trials published between January 1998\u2014July 2022. Eligible studies: (1) clinical trial for cancer therapy in adults, (2)\u2009\u2265\u20091 study arm included a single-agent ADC, (3) ADC used was commercially available/FDA-approved. Data was extracted and pooled using generalized linear mixed effects logistic models. 40 clinical trials involving 7,879 patients from 11 ADCs, including 9 ADCs with cleavable linkers (N\u2009=\u20092,985) and 2 with non-cleavable linkers (N\u2009=\u20094,894), were included. Significantly more composite adverse events (AEs) \u2265 grade 3 occurred in patients in the cleavable linkers arm (47%) compared with the non-cleavable arm (34%). When adjusted for DAR, for grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 toxicities, non-cleavable linkers remained independently associated with lower toxicity for any AE (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Higher DAR was significantly associated with higher probability of grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 toxicity for any AE. There was also a significant interaction between cleavability status and DAR for any AE (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Finally, higher measured systemic free payload concentrations were significantly associated with higher DARs (p\u2009=\u20090.043). Our results support the hypothesis that ADCs with cleavable linkers result in premature payload release, leading to increased systemic free payload concentrations and associated toxicities. This may help to inform future ADC design and rational clinical application.\n## Introduction\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are monoclonal antibodies connected to a cytotoxic agent known as the payload via a chemical linker. It was hoped that ADCs would be \"magic bullets,\" delivering high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy directly to cancer cells without affecting surrounding normal tissues. However, this has not borne out in clinical practice. Though many factors affect toxicity, the toxicities of currently approved ADCs appear to be driven primarily by premature release of the payload into the bloodstream by the linker, by an excessively prominent bystander effect [1], or even payload released by the lysed tumor cells [2]. \n\nADC linkers can be divided broadly into two groups: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers such as hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers rely on physiologic factors (i.e., cathepsin, glutathione (GSH), and low pH) within the cell to cleave the linker. Because these conditions can occur independently of antigen internalization, cleavable linkers are often less stable in the blood, resulting in various off-target effects [3]. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as the thioether or maleimidocaproyl linkers, require internalization by the target cell, so that the antibody, rather than the linker, can be degraded by the lysosome before the drug is released. This latter mechanism does not produce efficient bystander killing and thus results in lower toxicity profiles [4]. For these reasons, other novel linkers, including conditionally released linkers, are currently in rapid development [5,6]. \n\nPreclinical studies have shown that compared to ADCs with non-cleavable linkers, those with cleavable linkers likely release free payload prematurely, leading to increased systemic toxicity. In this study, we sought to delineate the potential effect of linker design on systemic toxicity by analyzing the results of clinical trials using ADCs constructed with both types of linkers.\n...\nIn this study, we sought to delineate the potential effect of linker design on systemic toxicity by analyzing the results of clinical trials using ADCs constructed with both types of linkers. We hypothesized that ADCs with cleavable linkers would be associated with greater systemic toxicities than those with non-cleavable linkers. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a systematic review of adverse events (AEs) occurring in cancer patients treated with commercially available ADCs. We then carried out a meta-analysis on all eligible phase II-III clinical trials. We also evaluated the potential effect of drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and systemic free payload concentration on toxicity in the context of the cleavability of the linkers used.\n\n## Statistical analysis: meta-analysis of clinical toxicity rates\nTo compare the incidence of toxicities in patients treated with ADCs constructed with cleavable vs non-cleavable linkers, generalized linear mixed effects logistic models were conducted for each toxicity, including: 1. By linker type. Univariable mixed effects logistic regression models were constructed evaluating the association between frequency of each specific toxicity for the binary outcome variables (any grade vs none; grade \u2265 3 2. Linker type adjusted for drug-to-antibody ratio. Multivariable mixed effects logistic regression models were constructed evaluating the association between frequency of each specific toxicity for the binary outcome variables (any grade vs none; grade \u2265 3 vs grade \u2264 2) and ADC linker type (cleavable vs non-cleavable) plus drugto-antibody ratio (numeric predictor) with the potential interaction between ADC linker type and drug-to-antibody ratio when estimable. The model includes the interaction when estimable since cleavability status and drug-to-antibody ratio are not necessarily independent factors but arise from the design of each medication. \n\n3. Linker type adjusted for estimated systemic free payload concentration. Multivariable mixed effects logistic regression models were constructed evaluating the association between frequency of each specific toxicity for the binary outcome variables (any grade vs none; grade \u2265 3 vs grade \u2264 2) and ADC linker type (cleavable vs non-cleavable) plus systemic free payload concentration (numeric predictor) with the potential interaction between ADC linker type and payload systemic free concentration when estimable. Again, the model includes the interaction when estimable since cleavability status and systemic free payload concentration are not necessarily independent factors but arise from the design of each medication. \n\nHeterogeneity in the estimated probability of each specific toxicity between studies was assessed with the I [2] statistic, describing the percentage of variation in probability of each specific toxicity across the studies arising from differences in the included trials (heterogeneity) rather than sampling error (chance).\n\n## Discussion\nIn this review and meta-analysis, we sought to delineate how features of ADC design, including linker cleavability, DAR, and systemic free payload concentration, may contribute to their associated systemic toxicities. The results support the hypothesis that ADCs with cleavable linkers are associated with more systemic toxicities than those with non-cleavable linkers. Interestingly, even though higher DAR was associated with higher grade \u2265 3 toxicity, the apparent protective effect of the non-cleavable linker persisted even after adjusting for DAR. However, we found that the association between non-cleavable linkers and lower toxicity was not observed after adjusting for systemic free payload concentration. This suggests that systemic free payload concentration is the main factor driving toxicity in ADC-treated patients. \n\nNotably, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has a considerably higher systemic free payload concentration than the other agents studied here. T-DXd has a tetrapeptide cleavable linker that may make it more vulnerable to premature release of its payload. Such a prematurely released payload might explain why T-DXd may be effective in tumor control regardless of HER2 expression. Emerging clinical evidence supports this hypothesis. In a small trial of T-DXd in non-small cell lung cancer patients, the activity of T-DXd was shown to be independent of HER2 over-expression in HER3 + , 2 + , or 1 + tumors [47]. More recently, clinical trial data presented during the 2021 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium showed that T-DXd was active in breast cancer patients regardless of HER2 expression, including HER2 0 tumors [48]. \n\nBy contrast, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), another anti-HER2 ADC with a non-cleavable linker, has not been shown to have activity in patients with low HER2 tumor expression. This may partly explain why in the DESTINY-03 trial [35], T-DM1 (HER2 dependent) was shown to have lower efficacy compared to T-DXd (HER2 dependent and independent).",

Antibody conjugates (ADCs) have changed the way cancer is treated. However, because only a tiny fraction of patients experienced long-term advantages, current cancer preclinical and clinical research has been focused on combination trials. The complex interaction of ADCs with the tumor and its microenvironment appear to be reliant on the efficacy of a certain ADC, all of which have significant therapeutic consequences. Several clinical trials in various tumor types are now underway to examine the potential ADC therapy, based on encouraging preclinical results. This review tackles the potential use of ADCs in cancer therapy, emphasizing the essential processes underlying their positive therapeutic impacts on solid and hematological malignancies. Additionally, opportunities are explored to understand the mechanisms of ADCs action, the mechanism of resistance against ADCs, and how to overcome potential resistance following ADCs administration. Recent clinical findings have aroused interest, leading to a large increase in the number of ADCs in clinical trials.

Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Fig. 1 The development, purification, and production of antibody-drug conjugates cathepsins). pH-sensitive hydrazone (found in brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, trastuzumab deruxtecan, and sacituzumab govitecan) is another enzyme-cleavable peptide-based linker (T-DXd) [51,52].\n\nNon-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability [53]. T-DM1 with mafodotin belantamab is one of two FDA-approved ADCs with non-cleavable linkers [18].\n\nThe systemic stability of ADCs post administration is one of the crucial issues to ensure the efficacy of ADCs, and several strategic approaches are taken for overcoming this issue. ADCs should ideally remain stable or intact in the circulation before entering target cells, but there are cases where ADC catabolites are still biologically active [54,55]. ADC stability refers primarily to",

This combination enables targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents to tumor site through recognizing target antigens by antibody while minimizing off-target effects on healthy tissues. Clinically, ADCs overcome the limitations of traditional chemotherapy, which lacks target specificity, and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies, providing higher efficacy and fewer toxicity anti-tumor biopharmaceuticals. ADCs have ushered in a new era of targeted cancer therapy, with 15 drugs currently approved for clinical use. Additionally, ADCs are being investigated as potential therapeutic candidates for autoimmune diseases, persistent bacterial infections, and other challenging indications. Despite their therapeutic benefits, the development and application of ADCs face significant challenges, including antibody immunogenicity, linker instability, and inadequate control over the release of cytotoxic agent. How can ADCs be designed to be safer and more efficient? What is the future development direction of ADCs? This review provides a comprehensive overview of ADCs, summarizing the structural and functional characteristics of the three core components, antibody, linker, and payload. Furthermore, we systematically assess the advancements and challenges associated with the 15 approved ADCs in cancer therapy, while also exploring the future directions and ongoing challenges. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of next-generation ADCs for wider clinical applications.",

                    "text": "Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy. These linkers also tend to inhibit bystander effects, because the released catabolites have poor cellular permeability. Consequently, identifying alternatives to improve drug release and enhance therapeutic outcomes has become a major focus of ongoing research. \n\nCurrently, 73.3% (11/15) of approved ADCs and 75.0% (18/24) of phase III ADCs employ cleavable linkers, with peptide linkers being the most common subtype. These account for 46.7% (7/15) of approved ADCs and 58.3% (14/24) of those in phase III. In comparison to chemically cleavable linkers, enzyme-cleavable linkers exploit abundant intracellular hydrolases to facilitate controlled drug release. This enzymatic mechanism ensures greater stability in plasma, making enzyme-cleavable linker more competitive for future ADC development. To enhance linker solubility and mitigate polymerization, polar groups such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be incorporated into the linker structure. This strategy has been employed in the marketed ADCs loncastuximab tesirine and sacituzumab govitecan, as well as in phase III clinical candidates such as trastuzumab duocarmazine, ARX-788, and DP-303c. Additionally, designing linkers with multiple attachment sites for payloads enhances the number and diversity of the conjugated drugs, which not only improves therapeutic efficacy but also reduces the potential for resistance.",

These linkers enhance plasma stability, rendering them less susceptible to the chemical or enzymatic environment in vivo following the internalization of ADCs by target cells [144,145]. Once internalized, the antibody component of the ADCs is degraded within lysosomes, resulting in a complex of amino acids, linker, and cytotoxic agent. This mechanism ensures precise drug delivery to tumor cells, minimizing nonspecific drug release and reducing off-target effects [146]. Trastuzumab emtansine, the first ADC to utilize a non-cleavable linker, employs N-succinimidyl-4-(maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid (SMCC), a flexible dualreactive (amine/thiol) linker, to conjugate the cytotoxic agent DM1 (emtansine) to trastuzumab [147]. This ADC targets HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (HER2 + mBC) cells, and upon lysosomal degradation, releases lysine-MCC-DM1, leading to direct tumor cell killing [148]. Similarly, belantamab mafodotin, an approved ADC for R/R MM, utilizes the MC linker to attach cytotoxic agents to mAbs [149]. Furthermore, oxime-type and triazole-type linkers are now also employed in the design of non-cleavable linkers, such as in FS-1502, currently in phase III, which utilizes geranyl ketone pyrophosphate oxime to conjugate cytotoxins for HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2 + BC) [150].

This combination enables targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents to tumor site through recognizing target antigens by antibody while minimizing off-target effects on healthy tissues. Clinically, ADCs overcome the limitations of traditional chemotherapy, which lacks target specificity, and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies, providing higher efficacy and fewer toxicity anti-tumor biopharmaceuticals. ADCs have ushered in a new era of targeted cancer therapy, with 15 drugs currently approved for clinical use. Additionally, ADCs are being investigated as potential therapeutic candidates for autoimmune diseases, persistent bacterial infections, and other challenging indications. Despite their therapeutic benefits, the development and application of ADCs face significant challenges, including antibody immunogenicity, linker instability, and inadequate control over the release of cytotoxic agent. How can ADCs be designed to be safer and more efficient? What is the future development direction of ADCs? This review provides a comprehensive overview of ADCs, summarizing the structural and functional characteristics of the three core components, antibody, linker, and payload. Furthermore, we systematically assess the advancements and challenges associated with the 15 approved ADCs in cancer therapy, while also exploring the future directions and ongoing challenges. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of next-generation ADCs for wider clinical applications.\n## Non-cleavable linkers\nNon-cleavable linkers, including thioether and maleimidocaproyl (MC) types, offer significant advantages due to their stable chemical bonds, which prevent proteolytic cleavage and contribute to reduced off-target toxicity. These linkers enhance plasma stability, rendering them less susceptible to the chemical or enzymatic environment in vivo following the internalization of ADCs by target cells [144,145]. Once internalized, the antibody component of the ADCs is degraded within lysosomes, resulting in a complex of amino acids, linker, and cytotoxic agent. This mechanism ensures precise drug delivery to tumor cells, minimizing nonspecific drug release and reducing off-target effects [146]. Trastuzumab emtansine, the first ADC to utilize a non-cleavable linker, employs N-succinimidyl-4-(maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid (SMCC), a flexible dualreactive (amine/thiol) linker, to conjugate the cytotoxic agent DM1 (emtansine) to trastuzumab [147]. This ADC targets HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (HER2 + mBC) cells, and upon lysosomal degradation, releases lysine-MCC-DM1, leading to direct tumor cell killing [148]. Similarly, belantamab mafodotin, an approved ADC for R/R MM, utilizes the MC linker to attach cytotoxic agents to mAbs [149]. Furthermore, oxime-type and triazole-type linkers are now also employed in the design of non-cleavable linkers, such as in FS-1502, currently in phase III, which utilizes geranyl ketone pyrophosphate oxime to conjugate cytotoxins for HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2 + BC) [150]. Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy.\n...\nDespite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy. These linkers also tend to inhibit bystander effects, because the released catabolites have poor cellular permeability. Consequently, identifying alternatives to improve drug release and enhance therapeutic outcomes has become a major focus of ongoing research. \n\nCurrently, 73.3% (11/15) of approved ADCs and 75.0% (18/24) of phase III ADCs employ cleavable linkers, with peptide linkers being the most common subtype. These account for 46.7% (7/15) of approved ADCs and 58.3% (14/24) of those in phase III. In comparison to chemically cleavable linkers, enzyme-cleavable linkers exploit abundant intracellular hydrolases to facilitate controlled drug release. This enzymatic mechanism ensures greater stability in plasma, making enzyme-cleavable linker more competitive for future ADC development. To enhance linker solubility and mitigate polymerization, polar groups such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be incorporated into the linker structure. This strategy has been employed in the marketed ADCs loncastuximab tesirine and sacituzumab govitecan, as well as in phase III clinical candidates such as trastuzumab duocarmazine, ARX-788, and DP-303c. Additionally, designing linkers with multiple attachment sites for payloads enhances the number and diversity of the conjugated drugs, which not only improves therapeutic efficacy but also reduces the potential for resistance.",

Disulfide, thioether, and hydrazone functional groups combine antibodies to the cytotoxic agent through intermolecular interactions. Currently, available linkers based on mechanisms of payload release are classified as cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers depend on the physiological environment in the systemic circulation, such as pH or proteases available to release cytotoxic payload from the carrier.

In contrast, protease cleavable linker in Brentuximab Vedotin is cleaved by proteases such as Cathepsin-B and plasmin. The cleavage of disulfide linkers in mirvetuximab soravtansine depends on high glutathione concentrations [15]. Non-cleavable linkers form non-reducible covalent bonds with amino acids on the antibodies. Unlike cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are not affected by the physiological environment and are more stable in blood circulation [16]. In addition, these linkers depend on complete lysosomal degradation of the mAb for payload release, which necessitates an efficient internalisation process and optimal trafficking to lysosomes-for instance, thioether linker in T-DM1 [2]. This may be an advantage since it could lead to a lower risk of systemic toxicity. One of the popular non-cleavable linkers is the polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker due to its excellent water solubility, lack of toxicity and low immunogenicity.",

            "abstract": "Simple Summary Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are a rapidly expanding class of anti-cancer drugs, with twelve agents in current clinical use. Despite recent successes, many ADCs fail during clinical development due to excessive toxicities and unfavorable risk-benefit profiles. Even for those ADCs that have been approved for clinical use, a substantial fraction of treated patients require dose reduction, treatment delays, or treatment discontinuation due to intolerable ADC-associated toxicity. In this report, we review the mechanisms contributing to the clinical toxicity of ADCs, and we discuss strategies to improve ADC tolerability. Abstract Anti-cancer antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) aim to expand the therapeutic index of traditional chemotherapy by employing the targeting specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to increase the efficiency of the delivery of potent cytotoxic agents to malignant cells. In the past three years, the number of ADCs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tripled. Although several ADCs have demonstrated sufficient efficacy and safety to warrant FDA approval, the clinical use of all ADCs leads to substantial toxicity in treated patients, and many ADCs have failed during clinical development due to their unacceptable toxicity profiles. Analysis of the clinical data has demonstrated that dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are often shared by different ADCs that deliver the same cytotoxic payload, independent of the antigen that is targeted and/or the type of cancer that is treated. DLTs are commonly associated with cells and tissues that do not express the targeted antigen (i.e., off-target toxicity), and often limit ADC dosage to levels below those required for optimal anti-cancer effects. In this manuscript, we review the fundamental mechanisms contributing to ADC toxicity, we summarize common ADC treatment-related adverse events, and we discuss several approaches to mitigating ADC toxicity.",

                    "text": "Following ADC dosing, the released (i.e., \"free\") payload rapidly appears within the systemic circulation. Plasma exposure to free payload relates, in part, to premature deconjugation of the payload in the systemic circulation (e.g., due to inadequate linker stability) [24]. There are two main classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers contain chemical or enzymatic liable chemistries formulated to exploit specific conditions unique to the intracellular or tumor extracellular environments, with the goal of maintaining good stability in the systemic circulation and rapid cleavage at the target site [25,26]. In practice, cleavable linkers are often hydrolyzed in plasma at an appreciable rate, leading to the premature release of the payload in the extra-tumoral compartments. Lipophilic payloads exhibit high permeability through plasma membranes and, consequently, the released payload enters non-targeted cells efficiently (e.g., via membrane diffusion), potentially leading to unwanted cytotoxicity. For example, the hydrazone linker used in the first-generation, calicheamicin-based ADC, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, was designed to be cleaved in the acidic environment of cellular lysosomes (i.e., following cell entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis). However, this linker exhibits an appreciable rate of hydrolysis in plasma, leading to substantial payload release prior to the ADC's engagement with the targeted antigen, and decreasing the fraction of intact ADC delivered to targeted cells [25,27]. \n\nIt is important to note that ADCs with cleavable linkers may be considered to be prodrugs, and it may be expected that 100% of the administered drug (i.e., payload) is eventually liberated through linker hydrolysis.",

For instance, in a study by Polson et al., several ADCs were constructed by conjugating antibodies against a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigens to a DM1 payload via either a cleavable (SPP) or a non-cleavable (SMCC) linker and were tested for in vivo toxicity and efficacy [34]. The SMCC-ADCs showed efficacy against only two of the seven target antigens, while the SPP-ADCs were active against all targets. However, at the dose of 20 mg ADC/kg, the animals treated with an ADC bearing the cleavable linker SPP exhibited much more significant weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities when compared with the results observed following dosing with ADC employing the non-cleavable linker SMCC. \n\nIn addition to the entry of released payload into non-targeted cells via passive diffusion across plasma membranes, the non-specific endocytosis of the intact ADC may also contribute to the off-site delivery of payload. Non-specific endocytosis may be influenced by the physicochemical properties of ADCs, including hydrophobicity and charge. Since most of the drug-linker compositions utilized in ADC technology are highly lipophilic, the hydrophobicity of the ADCs is often proportional to the drug loading (i.e., drug-to-antibody ratio, DAR). In a study by Hamblett et al., several anti-CD30-vc-MMAE ADCs with DARs of two, four, and eight were evaluated for in vivo pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity [35]. It was observed that the ADCs with higher DAR values had a faster systemic clearance, a lower tolerability, and a narrower therapeutic index than the ADCs with a lower DAR.",

Balthasar\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are a rapidly expanding class of anti-cancer drugs, with twelve agents in current clinical use. Despite recent successes, many ADCs fail during clinical development due to excessive toxicities and unfavorable risk-benefit profiles. Even for those ADCs that have been approved for clinical use, a substantial fraction of treated patients require dose reduction, treatment delays, or treatment discontinuation due to intolerable ADC-associated toxicity. In this report, we review the mechanisms contributing to the clinical toxicity of ADCs, and we discuss strategies to improve ADC tolerability. Abstract Anti-cancer antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) aim to expand the therapeutic index of traditional chemotherapy by employing the targeting specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to increase the efficiency of the delivery of potent cytotoxic agents to malignant cells. In the past three years, the number of ADCs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tripled. Although several ADCs have demonstrated sufficient efficacy and safety to warrant FDA approval, the clinical use of all ADCs leads to substantial toxicity in treated patients, and many ADCs have failed during clinical development due to their unacceptable toxicity profiles. Analysis of the clinical data has demonstrated that dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are often shared by different ADCs that deliver the same cytotoxic payload, independent of the antigen that is targeted and/or the type of cancer that is treated. DLTs are commonly associated with cells and tissues that do not express the targeted antigen (i.e., off-target toxicity), and often limit ADC dosage to levels below those required for optimal anti-cancer effects. In this manuscript, we review the fundamental mechanisms contributing to ADC toxicity, we summarize common ADC treatment-related adverse events, and we discuss several approaches to mitigating ADC toxicity.\n## Off-Target Delivery of ADC Payloads\nFollowing ADC dosing, the released (i.e., \"free\") payload rapidly appears within the systemic circulation. Plasma exposure to free payload relates, in part, to premature deconjugation of the payload in the systemic circulation (e.g., due to inadequate linker stability) [24]. There are two main classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers contain chemical or enzymatic liable chemistries formulated to exploit specific conditions unique to the intracellular or tumor extracellular environments, with the goal of maintaining good stability in the systemic circulation and rapid cleavage at the target site [25,26]. In practice, cleavable linkers are often hydrolyzed in plasma at an appreciable rate, leading to the premature release of the payload in the extra-tumoral compartments. Lipophilic payloads exhibit high permeability through plasma membranes and, consequently, the released payload enters non-targeted cells efficiently (e.g., via membrane diffusion), potentially leading to unwanted cytotoxicity. For example, the hydrazone linker used in the first-generation, calicheamicin-based ADC, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, was designed to be cleaved in the acidic environment of cellular lysosomes (i.e., following cell entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis). However, this linker exhibits an appreciable rate of hydrolysis in plasma, leading to substantial payload release prior to the ADC's engagement with the targeted antigen, and decreasing the fraction of intact ADC delivered to targeted cells [25,27]. \n\nIt is important to note that ADCs with cleavable linkers may be considered to be prodrugs, and it may be expected that 100% of the administered drug (i.e., payload) is eventually liberated through linker hydrolysis.\n...\nBesides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues. For instance, in a study by Polson et al., several ADCs were constructed by conjugating antibodies against a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigens to a DM1 payload via either a cleavable (SPP) or a non-cleavable (SMCC) linker and were tested for in vivo toxicity and efficacy [34]. The SMCC-ADCs showed efficacy against only two of the seven target antigens, while the SPP-ADCs were active against all targets. However, at the dose of 20 mg ADC/kg, the animals treated with an ADC bearing the cleavable linker SPP exhibited much more significant weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities when compared with the results observed following dosing with ADC employing the non-cleavable linker SMCC. \n\nIn addition to the entry of released payload into non-targeted cells via passive diffusion across plasma membranes, the non-specific endocytosis of the intact ADC may also contribute to the off-site delivery of payload. Non-specific endocytosis may be influenced by the physicochemical properties of ADCs, including hydrophobicity and charge. Since most of the drug-linker compositions utilized in ADC technology are highly lipophilic, the hydrophobicity of the ADCs is often proportional to the drug loading (i.e., drug-to-antibody ratio, DAR). In a study by Hamblett et al., several anti-CD30-vc-MMAE ADCs with DARs of two, four, and eight were evaluated for in vivo pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity [35]. It was observed that the ADCs with higher DAR values had a faster systemic clearance, a lower tolerability, and a narrower therapeutic index than the ADCs with a lower DAR.",

Depending on the methods of releasing the payload in cells, there are two types of linkers, including cleavable and non-cleavable [22]. The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity [23]. Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level [24]. The enzyme sensitive linkers are sensitive to the lysosomal protease that is generally overexpressed in cancer cells, enabling an accurate drug release in the cells after internalization [25]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability [26,27], and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]. For instance, Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has a cleavable enzymatic linker as opposed to trastuzuma",

Topoisomerase inhibitors have been widely used as anti-cancer drugs for the past 20 years. Due to their selectivity as topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitors that trap TOP1 cleavage complexes, camptothecin and its derivatives are promising anti-cancer drugs. To increase accumulation of TOP1 inhibitors in cancer cells through the targeting of tumors, TOP1 inhibitor antibody\u2013drug conjugates (TOP1-ADC) have been developed and marketed. Some TOP1-ADCs have shown enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared to prototypical anti-cancer ADCs, such as T-DM1. Here, we review various types of camptothecin-based TOP1 inhibitors and recent developments in TOP1-ADCs. We then propose key points for the design and construction of TOP1-ADCs. Finally, we discuss promising combinatorial strategies, including newly developed approaches to maximizing the therapeutic potential of TOP1-ADCs.",

                    "text": "A vital component of an ADC is the linker that constitutes the connection between payload and antibody. Choosing the preferred crosslinker is crucial not only to provide stability for the ADC but also to assure optimal release of the payload at the desired location [33]. Both the type of crosslinker and the location of conjugation can affect the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and clinical tolerance of the ADC. The mechanism for drug release is also dependent on the type of linker, be it cleavable or non-cleavable (Figure 4). Examples of cleavable crosslinkers include: acid-sensitive linkers, glutathione-sensitive linkers, lysosomal protease-sensitive linkers, and \u03b2-glucuronide linkers [46]. \n\nA non-cleavable crosslinker is said to offer greater plasma stability because of its nonreducible amino acid linker and thioether bond, which reduces non-specific drug release compared to ADCs with cleavable linkers [47]. With a non-cleavable ADC, the drug is dissociated from the antibody after internalization and lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody [33,48]. The first generation of FDA-approved ADCs employed an acidcleavable hydrazone linker, which makes use of the lower pH of endosomal and lysosomal compartments. The linker is stable in blood at neutral pH; once the ADC is internalized into acidic endosomes and lysosomes (pH = 4-6), the linker is cleaved. The release of the drug after 24 h at 37 \u2022 C is 97% at pH = 4.5, whereas only 6% was freed at pH = 7.4 [49]. The pHsensitive linkers include hydrazone linkers, disulfide linkers, and the CL2A linker. Disulfide linkers are cleavable by both pH and glutathione [50].",

Lim, Brody J. Blackburn, Jina Yun, Charles W. Putnam, D. Bull, Young-Wook Won\n## Abstract\nDNA topoisomerases are essential enzymes that stabilize DNA supercoiling and resolve entanglements. Topoisomerase inhibitors have been widely used as anti-cancer drugs for the past 20 years. Due to their selectivity as topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitors that trap TOP1 cleavage complexes, camptothecin and its derivatives are promising anti-cancer drugs. To increase accumulation of TOP1 inhibitors in cancer cells through the targeting of tumors, TOP1 inhibitor antibody\u2013drug conjugates (TOP1-ADC) have been developed and marketed. Some TOP1-ADCs have shown enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared to prototypical anti-cancer ADCs, such as T-DM1. Here, we review various types of camptothecin-based TOP1 inhibitors and recent developments in TOP1-ADCs. We then propose key points for the design and construction of TOP1-ADCs. Finally, we discuss promising combinatorial strategies, including newly developed approaches to maximizing the therapeutic potential of TOP1-ADCs.\n## Selection of Linkers\nA vital component of an ADC is the linker that constitutes the connection between payload and antibody. Choosing the preferred crosslinker is crucial not only to provide stability for the ADC but also to assure optimal release of the payload at the desired location [33]. Both the type of crosslinker and the location of conjugation can affect the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and clinical tolerance of the ADC. The mechanism for drug release is also dependent on the type of linker, be it cleavable or non-cleavable (Figure 4). Examples of cleavable crosslinkers include: acid-sensitive linkers, glutathione-sensitive linkers, lysosomal protease-sensitive linkers, and \u03b2-glucuronide linkers [46]. \n\nA non-cleavable crosslinker is said to offer greater plasma stability because of its nonreducible amino acid linker and thioether bond, which reduces non-specific drug release compared to ADCs with cleavable linkers [47]. With a non-cleavable ADC, the drug is dissociated from the antibody after internalization and lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody [33,48]. The first generation of FDA-approved ADCs employed an acidcleavable hydrazone linker, which makes use of the lower pH of endosomal and lysosomal compartments. The linker is stable in blood at neutral pH; once the ADC is internalized into acidic endosomes and lysosomes (pH = 4-6), the linker is cleaved. The release of the drug after 24 h at 37 \u2022 C is 97% at pH = 4.5, whereas only 6% was freed at pH = 7.4 [49]. The pHsensitive linkers include hydrazone linkers, disulfide linkers, and the CL2A linker. Disulfide linkers are cleavable by both pH and glutathione [50].",

            "abstract": "Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is a common cancer characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite advancements in treatment, challenges such as recurrence and low response rates persist. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for various cancers, although their application in UC is currently limited. This review focuses on recent research regarding ADCs designed to treat UC by targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a surface antigen expressed on tumor cells. ADCs comprise three main components: an antibody, a linker, and a cytotoxic payload. The antibody selectively binds to tumor cell surface antigens, facilitating targeted delivery of the cytotoxic drug, while linkers play a crucial role in ensuring stability and controlled release of the payload. Cleavable linkers release the drug within tumor cells, while non-cleavable linkers ensure stability during circulation. The cytotoxic payload exerts its antitumor effect by disrupting cellular pathways. HER2 is commonly overexpressed in UCs, making it a potential therapeutic target. Several ADCs targeting HER2 have been approved for cancer treatment, but their use in UC is still being tested. Numerous HER2 ADCs have demonstrated significant growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in translational models of HER2-overexpressing bladder cancer. Ongoing clinical trials are assessing the efficacy and safety of ADCs targeting HER2 in UC, with the aim of determining tumor response and the potential of ADCs as a treatment option for UC patients. The development of effective therapies with improved response rates and long-term effectiveness is crucial for advanced and metastatic UC. ADCs targeting HER2 show promise in this regard and merit further investigation for UC treatment.",

                    "text": "Linkers play a crucial role in the pharmacokinetics, drug efficacy, and safety of ADCs. It is imperative for the stability of linkers within the circulatory system to prevent the premature release of cytotoxic drugs from ADCs, as this may result in off-target toxicity. However, these linkers must be designed to be unstable under specific conditions to facilitate the delivery of the drug payload into tumor cells. There are two main types of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers undergo hydrolysis, protease cleavage, or disulfide bond cleavage within early endosomes or secondary endosomes, allowing the release of potent cytotoxic drugs. A commonly utilized mechanism involves the action of glutathione, where cleavable linkers are designed to be sensitive to glutathione. This sensitivity leads to linker cleavage, subsequently releasing the therapeutic payload into the intracellular environment. This mechanism capitalizes on the reducing properties of glutathione, facilitating controlled drug release specifically within the intracellular space (Baah et al., 2021). Examples of ADCs utilizing this cleavable linker mechanism include brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, and polatuzumab vedotin, which employ a pH-sensitive hydrazone linker (Sonawane et al., 2017). On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are resistant to cleavage and remain intact after being fused to the lysosome. The acidic environment generated by the lysosomal proton pump promotes protein degradation through cathepsin B or plasmin-mediated pathways. Studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linkers exhibit greater stability in blood compared to cleavable linkers (Jain et al., 2015). Furthermore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers present a reduced risk of systemic toxicity caused by premature payload release when the drug payload is released within the lysosome. The FDA has approved T-DM1 and mafodotin belantamab as examples of ADCs utilizing non-cleavable linkers (Tong et al., 2021).",

Despite advancements in treatment, challenges such as recurrence and low response rates persist. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for various cancers, although their application in UC is currently limited. This review focuses on recent research regarding ADCs designed to treat UC by targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a surface antigen expressed on tumor cells. ADCs comprise three main components: an antibody, a linker, and a cytotoxic payload. The antibody selectively binds to tumor cell surface antigens, facilitating targeted delivery of the cytotoxic drug, while linkers play a crucial role in ensuring stability and controlled release of the payload. Cleavable linkers release the drug within tumor cells, while non-cleavable linkers ensure stability during circulation. The cytotoxic payload exerts its antitumor effect by disrupting cellular pathways. HER2 is commonly overexpressed in UCs, making it a potential therapeutic target. Several ADCs targeting HER2 have been approved for cancer treatment, but their use in UC is still being tested. Numerous HER2 ADCs have demonstrated significant growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in translational models of HER2-overexpressing bladder cancer. Ongoing clinical trials are assessing the efficacy and safety of ADCs targeting HER2 in UC, with the aim of determining tumor response and the potential of ADCs as a treatment option for UC patients. The development of effective therapies with improved response rates and long-term effectiveness is crucial for advanced and metastatic UC. ADCs targeting HER2 show promise in this regard and merit further investigation for UC treatment.\n## Linker\nLinkers play a crucial role in the pharmacokinetics, drug efficacy, and safety of ADCs. It is imperative for the stability of linkers within the circulatory system to prevent the premature release of cytotoxic drugs from ADCs, as this may result in off-target toxicity. However, these linkers must be designed to be unstable under specific conditions to facilitate the delivery of the drug payload into tumor cells. There are two main types of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers undergo hydrolysis, protease cleavage, or disulfide bond cleavage within early endosomes or secondary endosomes, allowing the release of potent cytotoxic drugs. A commonly utilized mechanism involves the action of glutathione, where cleavable linkers are designed to be sensitive to glutathione. This sensitivity leads to linker cleavage, subsequently releasing the therapeutic payload into the intracellular environment. This mechanism capitalizes on the reducing properties of glutathione, facilitating controlled drug release specifically within the intracellular space (Baah et al., 2021). Examples of ADCs utilizing this cleavable linker mechanism include brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, and polatuzumab vedotin, which employ a pH-sensitive hydrazone linker (Sonawane et al., 2017). On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are resistant to cleavage and remain intact after being fused to the lysosome. The acidic environment generated by the lysosomal proton pump promotes protein degradation through cathepsin B or plasmin-mediated pathways. Studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linkers exhibit greater stability in blood compared to cleavable linkers (Jain et al., 2015). Furthermore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers present a reduced risk of systemic toxicity caused by premature payload release when the drug payload is released within the lysosome. The FDA has approved T-DM1 and mafodotin belantamab as examples of ADCs utilizing non-cleavable linkers (Tong et al., 2021).",

            "abstract": "The efficacy of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is dependent on the properties of its linker-payload which must remain stable while in systemic circulation but undergo efficient processing upon internalization into target cells. Here, we examine the stability of a non-cleavable Amino-PEG6-based linker bearing the monomethyl auristatin D (MMAD) payload site-specifically conjugated at multiple positions on an antibody. Enzymatic conjugation with transglutaminase allows us to create a stable amide linkage that remains intact across all tested conjugation sites on the antibody, and provides us with an opportunity to examine the stability of the auristatin payload itself. We report a position-dependent degradation of the C terminus of MMAD in rodent plasma that has a detrimental effect on its potency. The MMAD cleavage can be eliminated by either modifying the C terminus of the toxin, or by selection of conjugation site. Both approaches result in improved stability and potency in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the MMAD metabolism in mouse plasma is likely mediated by a serine-based hydrolase, appears much less pronounced in rat, and was not detected in cynomolgus monkey or human plasma. Clarifying these species differences and controlling toxin degradation to optimize ADC stability in rodents is essential to make the best ADC selection from preclinical models. The data presented here demonstrate that site selection and toxin susceptibility to mouse plasma degradation are important considerations in the design of non-cleavable ADCs, and further highlight the benefits of site-specific conjugation methods.",

                    "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates are a promising class of antibody-based therapeutics that take advantage of antibody specificity and small molecule cytotoxicity. The combined approach can deliver cytotoxic agents more specifically to the target cells and minimize harmful side effects in anti-tumor treatments [1][2][3]. The cytotoxic drugs are typically linked to the antibody carrier through either cleavable or non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers contain a trigger that can release the cytotoxic agent after internalization and can utilize a change in pH, redox potential, or a proteolytic or other enzymatic event for linker processing [4,5]. Non-cleavable linkers, on the other hand, rely on the degradation of the antibody itself to release the drug-linker, typically with the amino acid residue it was conjugated to as the released species [4,6]. The choice of linker is one of the critical parameters of ADC design, and is usually experimentally determined for each target and cell type. Numerous examples of both linker types (cleavable and non-cleavable) are currently utilized in the clinic [7][8][9]. Regardless of its type, the ideal linker remains intact in systemic circulation, and releases the cytotoxic agent only after internalization in the target cell [9,10], either by the built-in trigger (cleavable linkers) or by degradation of the antibody (non-cleavable linkers). \n\nA number of non-cleavable linkers have been developed based on traditional conjugation methods using maleimide or N-hydroxysuccinimide ester coupling chemistry. The maleimide chemistry, although more specific due to lower number of potential target sites on the antibody, has been reported to uncouple in circulation, resulting in decreased exposure of the ADC relative to the total antibody [11][12][13]. Recently, several ways of reducing maleimide-based decoupling have been reported [12,14,15], overcoming a hurdle to future clinical development of those linkers.",

Rajpal\n## Abstract\nThe efficacy of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is dependent on the properties of its linker-payload which must remain stable while in systemic circulation but undergo efficient processing upon internalization into target cells. Here, we examine the stability of a non-cleavable Amino-PEG6-based linker bearing the monomethyl auristatin D (MMAD) payload site-specifically conjugated at multiple positions on an antibody. Enzymatic conjugation with transglutaminase allows us to create a stable amide linkage that remains intact across all tested conjugation sites on the antibody, and provides us with an opportunity to examine the stability of the auristatin payload itself. We report a position-dependent degradation of the C terminus of MMAD in rodent plasma that has a detrimental effect on its potency. The MMAD cleavage can be eliminated by either modifying the C terminus of the toxin, or by selection of conjugation site. Both approaches result in improved stability and potency in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the MMAD metabolism in mouse plasma is likely mediated by a serine-based hydrolase, appears much less pronounced in rat, and was not detected in cynomolgus monkey or human plasma. Clarifying these species differences and controlling toxin degradation to optimize ADC stability in rodents is essential to make the best ADC selection from preclinical models. The data presented here demonstrate that site selection and toxin susceptibility to mouse plasma degradation are important considerations in the design of non-cleavable ADCs, and further highlight the benefits of site-specific conjugation methods.\n## Introduction\nAntibody-drug conjugates are a promising class of antibody-based therapeutics that take advantage of antibody specificity and small molecule cytotoxicity. The combined approach can deliver cytotoxic agents more specifically to the target cells and minimize harmful side effects in anti-tumor treatments [1][2][3]. The cytotoxic drugs are typically linked to the antibody carrier through either cleavable or non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers contain a trigger that can release the cytotoxic agent after internalization and can utilize a change in pH, redox potential, or a proteolytic or other enzymatic event for linker processing [4,5]. Non-cleavable linkers, on the other hand, rely on the degradation of the antibody itself to release the drug-linker, typically with the amino acid residue it was conjugated to as the released species [4,6]. The choice of linker is one of the critical parameters of ADC design, and is usually experimentally determined for each target and cell type. Numerous examples of both linker types (cleavable and non-cleavable) are currently utilized in the clinic [7][8][9]. Regardless of its type, the ideal linker remains intact in systemic circulation, and releases the cytotoxic agent only after internalization in the target cell [9,10], either by the built-in trigger (cleavable linkers) or by degradation of the antibody (non-cleavable linkers). \n\nA number of non-cleavable linkers have been developed based on traditional conjugation methods using maleimide or N-hydroxysuccinimide ester coupling chemistry. The maleimide chemistry, although more specific due to lower number of potential target sites on the antibody, has been reported to uncouple in circulation, resulting in decreased exposure of the ADC relative to the total antibody [11][12][13]. Recently, several ways of reducing maleimide-based decoupling have been reported [12,14,15], overcoming a hurdle to future clinical development of those linkers.",

Conventional anti-cancer therapies are non-targeted and have systemic toxicities limiting their versatile applications in many cancers. So, there is an unmet need for more specific therapeutic options that will be effective as well as free from toxicities. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are suitable alternatives with the right potential and improved therapeutic index for cancer therapy. The ADCs are highly precise new class of biopharmaceutical products that covalently linked a monoclonal antibody (mAb) (binds explicitly to a tumor-associated surface antigen) with a customized cytotoxic drug (kills cancer cells) and tied via a chemical linker (releases the drug). Due to its precise design, it brings about the target cell killing sparing the normal counterpart and free from the toxicities of conventional chemotherapy. It has never been so easy to develop potential ADCs for successful therapeutic usage. With relentless efforts, it took almost a century for scientists to advance the formula and design ADCs for its current clinical applications. Until now, several ADCs have passed successfully through preclinical and clinical trials and because of proven efficacy, a few are approved by the FDA to treat various cancer types. Even though ADCs posed some shortcomings like adverse effects and resistance at various stages of development, with continuous efforts most of these limitations are addressed and overcome to improve their efficacy. In this review, the basics of ADCs, physical and chemical properties, the evolution of design, limitations, and future potentials are discussed.",

Effective linkers must ensure ADC stability in the circulation as well as efficient cleavage upon internalization by the tumor cells. Since premature drug release into the blood might increase in systemic toxicity with consequent reduced therapeutic index, effective linker design must achieve an equilibrium between the necessity for long-term stability in the circulation and effective cleavage upon internalization into the target cell (59,60). There has been significant progress in linker technology since the beginning of ADC research, which has contributed enormously to the clinical achievements of ADC formulations until now (60). For linkers, there are both noncleavable and cleavable linkers that ensure the requirements of ADC design mentioned above. Non-cleavable linkers are made up of stable bonds e.g., non-reducible thioether linkage (SMCC), maleimidocaproyl linkage etc. that can withstand the proteolytic degradation inside the cytosol and release of cytotoxic payloads only occurs after antigen-specific internalization of the conjugate and full breakdown of mAb by lysosomal proteolytic degradation (12,14,20). Thus, the resultant release of the cytotoxic drugs is linked to the antibody's linker and an amino acid residue, which specifically kills tumor cells and doesn't release at non-target locations to cause any damage to healthy cells. Additionally, the non-cleavable linkers have provision to modify the chemical characteristics of small molecules to enhance the affinity of the transporter and increase its effectiveness. Although they have lesser membrane permeability, these linkers are more stable than cleavable ones and increase the therapeutic window by minimizing the off-target toxicities. Examples of non-cleavable linkers include thioether linkers (used in T-DM1) and maleimidebased linkers (used in belantamab mafodotin) (61).",

It has never been so easy to develop potential ADCs for successful therapeutic usage. With relentless efforts, it took almost a century for scientists to advance the formula and design ADCs for its current clinical applications. Until now, several ADCs have passed successfully through preclinical and clinical trials and because of proven efficacy, a few are approved by the FDA to treat various cancer types. Even though ADCs posed some shortcomings like adverse effects and resistance at various stages of development, with continuous efforts most of these limitations are addressed and overcome to improve their efficacy. In this review, the basics of ADCs, physical and chemical properties, the evolution of design, limitations, and future potentials are discussed.\n## Linker\nThe biological molecules known as linkers used in ADCs are for the linkage between the antibody and the warhead. Effective linkers must ensure ADC stability in the circulation as well as efficient cleavage upon internalization by the tumor cells. Since premature drug release into the blood might increase in systemic toxicity with consequent reduced therapeutic index, effective linker design must achieve an equilibrium between the necessity for long-term stability in the circulation and effective cleavage upon internalization into the target cell (59,60). There has been significant progress in linker technology since the beginning of ADC research, which has contributed enormously to the clinical achievements of ADC formulations until now (60). For linkers, there are both noncleavable and cleavable linkers that ensure the requirements of ADC design mentioned above. Non-cleavable linkers are made up of stable bonds e.g., non-reducible thioether linkage (SMCC), maleimidocaproyl linkage etc. that can withstand the proteolytic degradation inside the cytosol and release of cytotoxic payloads only occurs after antigen-specific internalization of the conjugate and full breakdown of mAb by lysosomal proteolytic degradation (12,14,20). Thus, the resultant release of the cytotoxic drugs is linked to the antibody's linker and an amino acid residue, which specifically kills tumor cells and doesn't release at non-target locations to cause any damage to healthy cells. Additionally, the non-cleavable linkers have provision to modify the chemical characteristics of small molecules to enhance the affinity of the transporter and increase its effectiveness. Although they have lesser membrane permeability, these linkers are more stable than cleavable ones and increase the therapeutic window by minimizing the off-target toxicities. Examples of non-cleavable linkers include thioether linkers (used in T-DM1) and maleimidebased linkers (used in belantamab mafodotin) (61).",

Linkers are principally categorized into two: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers release the payload either upon interacting with the low pH environment of the (endo)-lysosome, e.g., hydrazone linkers [26], or upon direct cleavage via lysosomal cathepsins [27], e.g., peptide linkers. A subgroup of cleavable linkers contains disulfide bonds that are sensitive to intracellular glutathione, releasing the payload upon the chemical reduction in these bonds by glutathione [28]. Such linkers might prove useful for the development of future ADCs for many cancers, including ovarian, head and neck, and lung cancers, since increased tumor glutathione levels have been reported in the literature for these cancers [5,29]. Non-cleavable linkers generally present higher levels of plasma stability [26] but require the cytotoxic molecule to remain active after complete lysosomal degradation [27]. Although the latter might appear as a disadvantage at first sight, there are reports of enhanced ADC cytotoxicity when conjugated with a non-cleavable linker in comparison to cleavable ones [27]-as demonstrated by the development of Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (Trastuzumab emtansine) by Phillips et al. [30]. Site-specific degradation mechanisms of non-cleavable linkers are actively being researched to improve their efficacy over cleavable counterparts [31].\n...\nThe linker molecule connecting the antibody and the cytotoxic drug should keep the conjugate in bound form until the desired target site is reached [24] and is, hence, an important determinant of the pharmacokinetics and the therapeutic index of the conjugate [5].

ADC development is a rapidly expanding field of research, with over 80 ADCs currently in clinical development and eleven ADCs (nine containing small-molecule payloads and two with biological toxins) approved for use by the FDA. Compared to traditional small-molecule approaches, ADCs offer enhanced targeting of cancer cells along with reduced toxic side effects, making them an attractive prospect in the field of oncology. To this end, this tutorial review aims to serve as a reference material for ADCs and give readers a comprehensive understanding of ADCs; it explores and explains each ADC component (monoclonal antibody, linker moiety and cytotoxic payload) individually, highlights several EMA- and FDA-approved ADCs by way of case studies and offers a brief future perspective on the field of ADC research.",

Rahman\n## Abstract\nAntibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) are a family of targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. ADC development is a rapidly expanding field of research, with over 80 ADCs currently in clinical development and eleven ADCs (nine containing small-molecule payloads and two with biological toxins) approved for use by the FDA. Compared to traditional small-molecule approaches, ADCs offer enhanced targeting of cancer cells along with reduced toxic side effects, making them an attractive prospect in the field of oncology. To this end, this tutorial review aims to serve as a reference material for ADCs and give readers a comprehensive understanding of ADCs; it explores and explains each ADC component (monoclonal antibody, linker moiety and cytotoxic payload) individually, highlights several EMA- and FDA-approved ADCs by way of case studies and offers a brief future perspective on the field of ADC research.\n## Non-Cleavable Linkers\nWhile cleavable linkers undergo hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage, non-cleavable linkers do not fragment and, following antigen-specific internalisation, only release the cytotoxic payload after complete lysosomal degradation of the mAb [6]. Key advantages of non-cleavable linkers over their cleavable competitors are that non-cleavable linkers grant ADCs longer plasma half-lives, reduced off-target toxicity and-frequently-wider therapeutic windows [39]. Common types of non-cleavable linkers used in ADCs are those based on a maleimide-type structure such as the maleimidocaproyl (MC, found in AbbVie's depatuxizumab mafodotin [49]) and 4-maleimidomethyl cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (MCC, found in Kadcyla \u00ae [49]) linkers (Figure 3) [42]. The MC linker in particular has seen varied use, employed both alone as part of a non-cleavable ADC (e.g., AbbVie's depatuxizumab mafodotin [49]) or as a spacer unit separating a mAb and cleavable dipeptide linker sequence (e.g., Adcetris \u00ae [49]), and all marketed ADCs containing monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) or monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) warheads use this linker [42]. \n\nases, such as cathepsin B, which are overexpressed in several cancer cell types [45]. Examples include valine-citrulline (Val-Cit, found in Adcetris \u00ae [30]), valine-alanine (Val-Ala, found in ADC Therapeutics' loncastuximab tesirine [46]) and alanine-alanine (Ala-Ala, found in ImmunoGen's IMGN632 [47]) dipeptide linkers.",

The advantage of pretargeted RAIT over directly labeled MAbs is continuing to be validated in preclinical models of lymphoma and solid tumors. Importantly, the advantages of combining RAIT with radiation sensitizers, with immunotherapy, or a drug conjugate targeting a different antigen are being studied clinically and preclinically. The area of drug-conjugated antibodies is progressing with encouraging data published for the trastuzumab-DM1 conjugate in a phase I clinical trial in HER2-positive breast cancer. The Dock-and-Lock platform technology has contributed to the design and the evaluation of complex antibody-cytokine and antibody-toxin conjugates.

The greater efficacy and tolerability of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 with a stable linker vs. maytansinoid conjugates with cleavable disulfide linkers was noted in a previous section [68]. Polson et al. compared the conjugates of both maytansinoids as well as an auristatin group of tubulin polymerization-inhibiting drugs, using cleavable and noncleavable linkers in NHL models [78]. Conjugates of maytansinoids with a stable linker (MAb-MCC-DM1) or a cleavable disulfide bond (MAb-SPP-DM1) were evaluated. Likewise, in the auristatin group, MMAE conjugates contained a cleavable linker, while MMAF conjugates contained a stable linker. It was found that anti-CD22 conjugates of these drugs with noncleavable linkers were less toxic in rats than those with cleavable linkers with both groups of drugs, when administered at single i.v. dose of 20 mg protein dose per kilogram. The study also found that ADCs with cleavable linkers were effective in a broad range of targets, while those with noncleavable linkers were more selective in the tumor targets that could be treated. Thus, which type of linker to use is a function of the specific tumor target, the tolerability of drug to substitution, and the therapeutic window achievable.",

Goldenberg\n## Abstract\nTargeting of radiation, drugs, and protein toxins to cancers selectively with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) has been a topic of considerable interest and an area of continued development. Radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) of lymphoma using directly labeled MAbs is of current interest after approval of two radiolabeled anti-CD20 MAbs, as illustrated with the near 100% overall response rate obtained in a recent clinical trial using an investigational radiolabeled anti-CD22 MAb, 90Y-epratuzumab. The advantage of pretargeted RAIT over directly labeled MAbs is continuing to be validated in preclinical models of lymphoma and solid tumors. Importantly, the advantages of combining RAIT with radiation sensitizers, with immunotherapy, or a drug conjugate targeting a different antigen are being studied clinically and preclinically. The area of drug-conjugated antibodies is progressing with encouraging data published for the trastuzumab-DM1 conjugate in a phase I clinical trial in HER2-positive breast cancer. The Dock-and-Lock platform technology has contributed to the design and the evaluation of complex antibody-cytokine and antibody-toxin conjugates. This review describes the advances made in these areas, with illustrations taken from advances made in the authors' institutions.\n## Cleavable vs. Noncleavable Linker in Conjugates\nConjugates with a noncleavable linker may have an advantage of less toxicity vs. the conjugates with a cleavable linker, since these have to be specifically internalized for detachment from the carrier antibody, while the amino acid-appended metabolite of the drug, generated after intracellular metabolism, would be unable to diffuse through cell membranes. The greater efficacy and tolerability of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 with a stable linker vs. maytansinoid conjugates with cleavable disulfide linkers was noted in a previous section [68]. Polson et al. compared the conjugates of both maytansinoids as well as an auristatin group of tubulin polymerization-inhibiting drugs, using cleavable and noncleavable linkers in NHL models [78]. Conjugates of maytansinoids with a stable linker (MAb-MCC-DM1) or a cleavable disulfide bond (MAb-SPP-DM1) were evaluated. Likewise, in the auristatin group, MMAE conjugates contained a cleavable linker, while MMAF conjugates contained a stable linker. It was found that anti-CD22 conjugates of these drugs with noncleavable linkers were less toxic in rats than those with cleavable linkers with both groups of drugs, when administered at single i.v. dose of 20 mg protein dose per kilogram. The study also found that ADCs with cleavable linkers were effective in a broad range of targets, while those with noncleavable linkers were more selective in the tumor targets that could be treated. Thus, which type of linker to use is a function of the specific tumor target, the tolerability of drug to substitution, and the therapeutic window achievable.",

            "abstract": "Simple Summary Since the first antibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC) was approved in 2000, the landscape of these targeted drugs has evolved over the years, profoundly changing the treatment scenario of various advanced-stage cancers, including solid tumors. With a better understanding of the construct\u2019s mechanism of action and tumor biology, continuous efforts are made to fine-tune the ADC design and enhance the therapeutic index and tolerability of next-generation conjugates, promising to become the future of personalized cancer medicines. In this review, we outline the evolution of ADC development and discuss the existing challenges and future trends in the field. Abstract Introduced almost two decades ago, ADCs have marked a breakthrough in the targeted therapy era, providing clinical benefits to many cancer patients. While the inherent complexity of this class of drugs has challenged their development and broad application, the experience gained from years of trials and errors and recent advances in construct design and delivery have led to an increased number of ADCs approved or in late clinical development in only five years. Target and payload diversification, along with novel conjugation and linker technologies, are at the forefront of next-generation ADC development, renewing hopes to broaden the scope of these targeted drugs to difficult-to-treat cancers and beyond. This review highlights recent trends in the ADC field, focusing on construct design and mechanism of action and their implications on ADCs\u2019 therapeutic profile. The evolution from conventional to innovative ADC formats will be illustrated, along with some of the current hurdles, including toxicity and drug resistance. Future directions to improve the design of next-generation ADCs will also be presented.",

                    "text": "The linker, tethering the cytotoxic payload to the mAb, is another crucial factor influencing ADCs therapeutic index and PK, as it determines plasma stability and release profile of the payload [2,4,25,32]. Generally, most ADC drugs incorporate two types of covalent linkers, cleavable and non-cleavable, which differ in their intracellular processing and systemic stability. While both have been shown to be safe in preclinical and clinical settings, cleavable linkers currently dominate the ADC landscape. For a comprehensive overview of the topic, the readers are advised to refer to [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nCleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the cancer TME over healthy tissues or systemic circulation [2,25,32,43,44]. They can be either chemically or enzymatically labile. Chemical linkers include hydrazone-or disulfide-bond-based linkers. The first type, used in commercially available Mylotarg \u00ae and Besponsa \u00ae , is sensitive to low pH and can be hydrolyzed within acidic early endosomes post-uptake. The second one can undergo reduction via intracellular thiols such as glutathione (GSH), whose levels are generally elevated in cancer cells (1-10 mmol/L) than in blood (5 \u00b5mol/L) [45]. These linker types generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload able to promote bystander killing [1,2,32]. Notably, acid-sensitive linkers are insufficiently stable and can occasionally be hydrolyzed in the plasma, leading to premature drug release and off-target toxicity. This liability is one of the causes leading to the voluntary Mylotarg \u00ae withdrawal by Pfizer from the US market in 2000, following the severe liver toxicity seen in patients [46][47][48]. The subsequent linker redesign and dosing schedule optimization have led to ADC reapproval in 2017 [46,49,50].",

Engelholm\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Since the first antibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC) was approved in 2000, the landscape of these targeted drugs has evolved over the years, profoundly changing the treatment scenario of various advanced-stage cancers, including solid tumors. With a better understanding of the construct\u2019s mechanism of action and tumor biology, continuous efforts are made to fine-tune the ADC design and enhance the therapeutic index and tolerability of next-generation conjugates, promising to become the future of personalized cancer medicines. In this review, we outline the evolution of ADC development and discuss the existing challenges and future trends in the field. Abstract Introduced almost two decades ago, ADCs have marked a breakthrough in the targeted therapy era, providing clinical benefits to many cancer patients. While the inherent complexity of this class of drugs has challenged their development and broad application, the experience gained from years of trials and errors and recent advances in construct design and delivery have led to an increased number of ADCs approved or in late clinical development in only five years. Target and payload diversification, along with novel conjugation and linker technologies, are at the forefront of next-generation ADC development, renewing hopes to broaden the scope of these targeted drugs to difficult-to-treat cancers and beyond. This review highlights recent trends in the ADC field, focusing on construct design and mechanism of action and their implications on ADCs\u2019 therapeutic profile. The evolution from conventional to innovative ADC formats will be illustrated, along with some of the current hurdles, including toxicity and drug resistance. Future directions to improve the design of next-generation ADCs will also be presented.\n## The Linker-A Balancing Bridge\nThe linker, tethering the cytotoxic payload to the mAb, is another crucial factor influencing ADCs therapeutic index and PK, as it determines plasma stability and release profile of the payload [2,4,25,32]. Generally, most ADC drugs incorporate two types of covalent linkers, cleavable and non-cleavable, which differ in their intracellular processing and systemic stability. While both have been shown to be safe in preclinical and clinical settings, cleavable linkers currently dominate the ADC landscape. For a comprehensive overview of the topic, the readers are advised to refer to [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nCleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the cancer TME over healthy tissues or systemic circulation [2,25,32,43,44]. They can be either chemically or enzymatically labile. Chemical linkers include hydrazone-or disulfide-bond-based linkers. The first type, used in commercially available Mylotarg \u00ae and Besponsa \u00ae , is sensitive to low pH and can be hydrolyzed within acidic early endosomes post-uptake. The second one can undergo reduction via intracellular thiols such as glutathione (GSH), whose levels are generally elevated in cancer cells (1-10 mmol/L) than in blood (5 \u00b5mol/L) [45]. These linker types generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload able to promote bystander killing [1,2,32]. Notably, acid-sensitive linkers are insufficiently stable and can occasionally be hydrolyzed in the plasma, leading to premature drug release and off-target toxicity. This liability is one of the causes leading to the voluntary Mylotarg \u00ae withdrawal by Pfizer from the US market in 2000, following the severe liver toxicity seen in patients [46][47][48]. The subsequent linker redesign and dosing schedule optimization have led to ADC reapproval in 2017 [46,49,50].\n...\nDue to their resistance to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, these linkers enjoy the advantages of increased plasma stability, longer half-lives, and lower off-target toxicity than the cleavable counterpart, rendering them potentially superior for targeting homogenously expressed Ag [2,25,32,43,44]. Nonetheless, as most tumors display heterogenous Ag expression, constructs incorporating cleavable linkers with membranepermeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects, unlike the non-cleavable linker type [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nAs the ADC field evolves dynamically and the payload arsenal rapidly expands, linker optimization has become crucial to maximizing the therapeutic index while improving biodistribution and PK profiles [1,6,25,32,43]. The currently explored strategies include (1) increasing the linker hydrophilicity (e.g., by incorporating negatively charged groups, like sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), phosphate, or pyrophosphate groups) to enhance systemic stability by reducing payload hydrophobicity-driven ADC aggregation and clearance [43,44]; (2) polyvalent or branched hydrophilic linkers, such as Fleximer TM linkers or PEG chain additions, that enable high DAR without compromising the ADC physicochemical properties and PK [6]; and (3) tandem or dual-cleavage linkers requiring successive cleavage by lysosomal enzymes, which ensure tumor specificity while increasing both stability and tolerability [6,25,32]. Other recently emerged cleavable linker classes with higher plasma stability include lysosomal protease-cleavable linkers such as sulfatase-and legumain-cleavable linkers [53,54], while more innovative, albeit still exploratory, linker technologies include photo-sensitive and biorthogonal cleavable linkers, which widen up the opportunity for nonendocytic ADCs [32,43].",

Their conjugation mechanism, stability, and chemistry are crucial in preventing unintended drug release into the bloodstream and in facilitating easy cleavage upon internalization into the cancer cell, allowing the payload to be released exclusively at the intended site. They are essential in figuring out the ADCs' pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and therapeutic window. The currently FDA-approved ADCs use two classes of linkers, which differ in the payload release mechanism: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers [24,56,57]. \n\nThe four most used cleavable linkers are \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers, Glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide linkers, cathepsin B-sensitive linkers, and hydrazone linkers. The previously described bystander effect, which impacts normal cells in the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells with no or low target expression, is more likely to occur with ADCs that utilize cleavable linkers [58,59]. Non-cleavable linkers, as opposed to cleavable linkers, have better plasma stability, less off-target toxicity, and resistance to proteolytic degradation, as they have non-reducible bonds with the amino acid residues of the antibody. Generally, non-cleavable linkers are formed by thioether or Maleimidocaproyl groups. Non-cleavable linkers that are attached to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody must have the antibody moiety completely broken down by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases to release the payload following ADC internalization [60,61]. A general basic structure is illustrated in Figure 2 [62]. \n\nThe four most used cleavable linkers are \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers, Glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide linkers, cathepsin B-sensitive linkers, and hydrazone linkers.",

ADCs with linkers that are cleavable, via lysosomal proteases, acidic pH, or breakdown of disulfide bridges, run a higher risk of off-target toxicity, but may still be active for targets with poor internalization, whereas ADCs with noncleavable linkers must be internalized, so that the mAb can then undergo proteolytic degradation to release the warhead for action. 25 nother important consideration is the position of the linker on the mAb; control over the linker position enables site-specific conjugation of the warhead, allowing",

Results: In our analysis, dose reductions, dose delays, treatment discontinuations, and \u2265G3 toxicities were not significantly different across payload types. Similarly, no association was found between the payload mechanism of action and \u2265G3 toxicities, including anemia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and diarrhea. By exploring the specific toxicities of ADCs observed by organ, we identified that most were related to the payload mechanism of action, like the \u2265G3 diarrhea observed in 10% of patients treated with sacituzumab govitecan (the payload SN-38 is the active metabolite of irinotecan), and very few were related to the presence of the TAA in normal tissue (presence of Nectin-4 in skin and \u2265G3 rash toxicity in 14% of patients treated with enfortumab vedotin). In line with this, no major differences in \u2265G3 toxicities were identified in studies with different levels of the TAA (trastuzumab deruxtecan in Destiny Breast Studies with different HER2 expression levels).

Designing linkers requires a careful balance between chemical stability and the controlled release of the cytotoxic agent.

By leveraging antibodies\u2019 targeting properties, ADCs deliver cytotoxic drugs into tumor cells via endocytosis after identifying the tumor antigen. This precise method aims to kill tumor cells selectively while minimizing harm to normal cells, offering safe and effective therapeutic benefits. Recent years have seen significant progress in antitumor treatment with ADC development, providing patients with new and potent treatment options. With over 300 ADCs explored for various tumor indications and some already approved for clinical use, challenges such as resistance due to factors like antigen expression, ADC processing, and payload have emerged. This review aims to outline the history of ADC development, their structure, mechanism of action, recent composition advancements, target selection, completed and ongoing clinical trials, resistance mechanisms, and intervention strategies. Additionally, it will delve into the potential of ADCs with novel markers, linkers, payloads, and innovative action mechanisms to enhance cancer treatment options. The evolution of ADCs has also led to the emergence of combination therapy as a new therapeutic approach to improve drug efficacy.",

While primarily serving to link the antibody and effector molecule, the linker plays a multifaceted role beyond mere connection. 51 Various properties of the linker, such as conjugation chemistry, length, and steric hindrance, directly impact the toxicity, specificity, stability, and efficacy of ADCs. 52 An optimal linker should exhibit stability in circulation (with a half-life approximately 10 times longer than that of the ADC) and efficiently release the cytotoxic payload within the tumor post-internalization. 53,54 Additionally, the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of the linker can influence payload coupling and reduce immunogenicity. \n\nResearchers have explored different types of linkers, which can be broadly classified into two categories: cleavable and noncleavable linkers. 51,55,56 Cleavable linkers have the ability to release a metabolite of the effector molecules from the ADC, allowing it to enter cells, either at the tumor site or within endosomes and lysosomes. These cleavable linkers are further divided into chemically cleavable linkers and enzymatically cleavable linkers, such as peptide-based linkers, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers, and phosphate-based linkers. 51 Notably, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers consist of \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers and \u03b2-galactosidase-sensitive linkers. Premature cleavage of these linkers can lead to the effector molecules harming normal cells. 57 On the other hand, noncleavable linkers, such as thioether linkers and maleimido caproyl linkers, require internalization of the ADC into cells and subsequent breakdown by lysosomes to release the effector molecules. ADCs with noncleavable linkers depend on complete lysosomal enzymatic degradation of the antibody for payload release, resulting in simultaneous dissociation of the linker. 58",

By leveraging antibodies\u2019 targeting properties, ADCs deliver cytotoxic drugs into tumor cells via endocytosis after identifying the tumor antigen. This precise method aims to kill tumor cells selectively while minimizing harm to normal cells, offering safe and effective therapeutic benefits. Recent years have seen significant progress in antitumor treatment with ADC development, providing patients with new and potent treatment options. With over 300 ADCs explored for various tumor indications and some already approved for clinical use, challenges such as resistance due to factors like antigen expression, ADC processing, and payload have emerged. This review aims to outline the history of ADC development, their structure, mechanism of action, recent composition advancements, target selection, completed and ongoing clinical trials, resistance mechanisms, and intervention strategies. Additionally, it will delve into the potential of ADCs with novel markers, linkers, payloads, and innovative action mechanisms to enhance cancer treatment options. The evolution of ADCs has also led to the emergence of combination therapy as a new therapeutic approach to improve drug efficacy.\n## Linker\nThe linker is a crucial component in ADC design, facilitating the connection between the antibody and the cytotoxic payload through covalent coupling. While primarily serving to link the antibody and effector molecule, the linker plays a multifaceted role beyond mere connection. 51 Various properties of the linker, such as conjugation chemistry, length, and steric hindrance, directly impact the toxicity, specificity, stability, and efficacy of ADCs. 52 An optimal linker should exhibit stability in circulation (with a half-life approximately 10 times longer than that of the ADC) and efficiently release the cytotoxic payload within the tumor post-internalization. 53,54 Additionally, the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of the linker can influence payload coupling and reduce immunogenicity. \n\nResearchers have explored different types of linkers, which can be broadly classified into two categories: cleavable and noncleavable linkers. 51,55,56 Cleavable linkers have the ability to release a metabolite of the effector molecules from the ADC, allowing it to enter cells, either at the tumor site or within endosomes and lysosomes. These cleavable linkers are further divided into chemically cleavable linkers and enzymatically cleavable linkers, such as peptide-based linkers, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers, and phosphate-based linkers. 51 Notably, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers consist of \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers and \u03b2-galactosidase-sensitive linkers. Premature cleavage of these linkers can lead to the effector molecules harming normal cells. 57 On the other hand, noncleavable linkers, such as thioether linkers and maleimido caproyl linkers, require internalization of the ADC into cells and subsequent breakdown by lysosomes to release the effector molecules. ADCs with noncleavable linkers depend on complete lysosomal enzymatic degradation of the antibody for payload release, resulting in simultaneous dissociation of the linker. 58",

Non-cleavable linkers are more stable in circulation [115]; however, after proteolytic degradation, charged amino acid residues may be retained on the cytotoxic payload and can interfere with the overall efficacy of the drug [115]. The most commonly used type of non-cleavable linkers in ADCs is thioether linkers, currently used in T-DM1 [123]. Cleavable linkers depend on the physiological conditions of the cell and can be subdivided into two types: pH-sensitive and protease-cleavable linkers [35,115]. pH-sensitive linkers utilize the lower pH in the endosomes and lysosomes of target tumor cells to trigger hydrolysis of acid labile groups within a linker, while protease-cleavable linkers utilize common proteases, found in lysosomes of target tumor cells, for specific peptide sequence recognition and cleavage in the linker [35,115,124]. It is important to note, however, that cleavable linkers display nonspecific release of the cytotoxic drug [35,115]. The most commonly used cleavable linkers include acid-labile hydrazones, or disulfides [35,115].",

In addition to conjugation, the linkers maintain ADCs\u2019 stability during the preparation and storage stages of the ADCs and during the systemic circulation period. The design of linkers for ADCs is a challenge in terms of extracellular stability and intracellular release, and intracellular circumstances, such as the acid environment, the reducing environment and cathepsin, are considered as the catalysts to activate the triggers for initiating the cleavage of ADCs.

The greatest advantage of non-cleavable linkers compared to cleavable linkers is their increased plasma stability. Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug [45]. Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells [43,46]. In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability. \n\nYelena et al. synthesized the huC242-SMCC-DM1 conjugate binding DM1 to the humanized monoclonal antibody (huC242) via an N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 -carboxylate (SMCC) for non-cleavable thioether linker and tested the cytotoxicity of conjugate on COLO 205 cells and Namalwa cells. Compared with the cantuzumab mertansine (huC242-DM1) containing a cleavable disulfide linker, the huC242-SMCC-DM1 is efficacious only against tumors in which all proliferating cells express the target antigen, and displayed significantly lower in vivo activity in multiple xenograft tumor models (Figure 4) [47]. \n\nNon-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug [45].",

An appropriate linker between the antibody and the cytotoxic drug provides a specific bridge, and thus helps the antibody to selectively deliver the cytotoxic drug to tumor cells and accurately releases the cytotoxic drug at tumor sites. In addition to conjugation, the linkers maintain ADCs\u2019 stability during the preparation and storage stages of the ADCs and during the systemic circulation period. The design of linkers for ADCs is a challenge in terms of extracellular stability and intracellular release, and intracellular circumstances, such as the acid environment, the reducing environment and cathepsin, are considered as the catalysts to activate the triggers for initiating the cleavage of ADCs. This review discusses the linkers used in the clinical and marketing stages for ADCs and details the fracture modes of the linkers for the further development of ADCs.\n## Non-Cleavable Linkers\nMany non-cleavable linkers have been explored in ADC development. The greatest advantage of non-cleavable linkers compared to cleavable linkers is their increased plasma stability. Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug [45]. Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells [43,46]. In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability. \n\nYelena et al. synthesized the huC242-SMCC-DM1 conjugate binding DM1 to the humanized monoclonal antibody (huC242) via an N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 -carboxylate (SMCC) for non-cleavable thioether linker and tested the cytotoxicity of conjugate on COLO 205 cells and Namalwa cells. Compared with the cantuzumab mertansine (huC242-DM1) containing a cleavable disulfide linker, the huC242-SMCC-DM1 is efficacious only against tumors in which all proliferating cells express the target antigen, and displayed significantly lower in vivo activity in multiple xenograft tumor models (Figure 4) [47]. \n\nNon-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug [45].",

It is critical to understand the mechanisms employed by ADCs in navigating biological barriers and how these factors affect their biodistribution, delivery to tumors, efficacy, and toxicity. Thus, future studies are warranted to better understand the complex pharmacology and interaction between ADC carriers and biological systems, such as the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and tumor microenvironment.

For this type of linker to be effective, the cytotoxic agent must maintain its activity, despite still being attached to part of the linker [22]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are considered to have improved therapeutic index because of their greater plasma stability, although new designs of cleavable linkers have significantly improved stability [23]. \n\nIt is clear that the disposition of a mAb is dependent upon several factors (Figure 1), and not just the therapeutic entity conjugated to it, in the case of an ADC. While mAbs trigger an effector function on their own, ADCs act more like prodrugs, and may or may not exert an anti-cancer effect until the SM drug is released from the mAb carrier. Thus, the pharmacology of mAbs and ADCs are complex. As a result, analytical and PK studies must be performed to assess the disposition of not just conjugated and released forms of ADCs, but also the effects of modifications on the mAbs after administration. \n\nAntibodies 2018, 7, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 28 improve ADC solubility or reduce ADC aggregation [6,20]. Typically, linkers used in ADC formulations are classified as being either \"cleavable\" or \"non-cleavable\". Cleavable linkers respond to physiological stimuli, such as low pH or proteolytic cleavage, to release the cytotoxic drug from its ADC carrier [21]. In theory, these linkers are catalyzed in a tumor cells, due to the presence, or increased presence, of their catalyst, to allow for selective release of the cytotoxic agent [5,21]. An example of a cleavable linker is seen in brentuximab vedotin, where the monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) cytotoxic payload is released by protease activity (Adcetris, Settle Genetics, Seattle, WA, USA).",

Price, Allison N. Schorzman, Mallory Storrie, J. Piscitelli, Juan Razo, W. Zamboni\n## Abstract\nMajor advances in therapeutic proteins, including antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs), have created revolutionary drug delivery systems in cancer over the past decade. While these immunoconjugate agents provide several advantages compared to their small-molecule counterparts, their clinical use is still in its infancy. The considerations in their development and clinical use are complex, and consist of multiple components and variables that can affect the pharmacologic characteristics. It is critical to understand the mechanisms employed by ADCs in navigating biological barriers and how these factors affect their biodistribution, delivery to tumors, efficacy, and toxicity. Thus, future studies are warranted to better understand the complex pharmacology and interaction between ADC carriers and biological systems, such as the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and tumor microenvironment. This review provides an overview of factors that affect the pharmacologic profiles of ADC therapies that are currently in clinical use and development.\n## Linkers\nIn the lysosomal compartment, the process of intracellular proteolytic degradation reduces the ADC to the level of amino acids. For this type of linker to be effective, the cytotoxic agent must maintain its activity, despite still being attached to part of the linker [22]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are considered to have improved therapeutic index because of their greater plasma stability, although new designs of cleavable linkers have significantly improved stability [23]. \n\nIt is clear that the disposition of a mAb is dependent upon several factors (Figure 1), and not just the therapeutic entity conjugated to it, in the case of an ADC. While mAbs trigger an effector function on their own, ADCs act more like prodrugs, and may or may not exert an anti-cancer effect until the SM drug is released from the mAb carrier. Thus, the pharmacology of mAbs and ADCs are complex. As a result, analytical and PK studies must be performed to assess the disposition of not just conjugated and released forms of ADCs, but also the effects of modifications on the mAbs after administration. \n\nAntibodies 2018, 7, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 28 improve ADC solubility or reduce ADC aggregation [6,20]. Typically, linkers used in ADC formulations are classified as being either \"cleavable\" or \"non-cleavable\". Cleavable linkers respond to physiological stimuli, such as low pH or proteolytic cleavage, to release the cytotoxic drug from its ADC carrier [21]. In theory, these linkers are catalyzed in a tumor cells, due to the presence, or increased presence, of their catalyst, to allow for selective release of the cytotoxic agent [5,21]. An example of a cleavable linker is seen in brentuximab vedotin, where the monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) cytotoxic payload is released by protease activity (Adcetris, Settle Genetics, Seattle, WA, USA).\n...\nAn example of a cleavable linker is seen in brentuximab vedotin, where the monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) cytotoxic payload is released by protease activity (Adcetris, Settle Genetics, Seattle, WA, USA).

Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a novel class of anti-cancer therapeutic agents, and multiple ADCs have been approved for other types of cancer. In 2024, trastuzumab deruxtecan received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for cancer types and became the first ADC approved for the treatment of uterine malignancies. Many ADCs are currently being investigated in uterine malignancies, and therefore, there is a need to gain a deeper understanding of ADCs. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the advancements in ADCs. The contents of this article include the structure and mechanism of action, an analysis of recent clinical trials, and expected future clinical questions. This article also focuses on uterine sarcoma, which is not often highlighted as a target for ADC treatment.",

Ideal linkers should maintain the ADC's stability in plasma while ensuring payload release, specifically at the tumor site. This targeted release is essential for effectively delivering the cytotoxic payload to cancer cells, as premature release can result in systemic off-target toxicity [19]. Linkers can be classified into two types: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release their payloads in response to specific conditions, such as the pH of cancer cells, reducing agents, and enzymes. Cleavable linkers may increase the efficiency of payload release, causing a bystander effect, but they also have a higher risk of increasing toxicity in normal tissues. On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma, so they only release the drug after the antibody has been completely degraded in the lysosome. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are not expected to induce a bystander effect. Currently, most ADCs use cleavable linkers.",

Nishikawa, H. Yoshida\n## Abstract\nDespite recent advances in cancer treatment, the prognosis for uterine malignancies (carcinoma and sarcoma) requires further improvement. Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a novel class of anti-cancer therapeutic agents, and multiple ADCs have been approved for other types of cancer. In 2024, trastuzumab deruxtecan received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for cancer types and became the first ADC approved for the treatment of uterine malignancies. Many ADCs are currently being investigated in uterine malignancies, and therefore, there is a need to gain a deeper understanding of ADCs. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the advancements in ADCs. The contents of this article include the structure and mechanism of action, an analysis of recent clinical trials, and expected future clinical questions. This article also focuses on uterine sarcoma, which is not often highlighted as a target for ADC treatment.\n## Linker\nLinkers bind the antibody to the cytotoxic payload. Ideal linkers should maintain the ADC's stability in plasma while ensuring payload release, specifically at the tumor site. This targeted release is essential for effectively delivering the cytotoxic payload to cancer cells, as premature release can result in systemic off-target toxicity [19]. Linkers can be classified into two types: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release their payloads in response to specific conditions, such as the pH of cancer cells, reducing agents, and enzymes. Cleavable linkers may increase the efficiency of payload release, causing a bystander effect, but they also have a higher risk of increasing toxicity in normal tissues. On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma, so they only release the drug after the antibody has been completely degraded in the lysosome. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are not expected to induce a bystander effect. Currently, most ADCs use cleavable linkers.",

In addition, the ADCs with disulfide linkers take advantage of reduced glutathione with high intracellular concentrations to release free drug inside the cell. ADCs with reducible disulfide linkers generate uncharged metabolites that can diffuse into neighboring cells and elicit bystander killing, which is essential for killing heterogeneous tumors [51,53]. \n\nADCs with cleavable linkers have broader efficacy and faster rates of activating and releasing cytotoxic drugs for most cell lines.

The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, proteasecleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers. Acid-cleavable linkers such as hydrazine linkers are designed to be stable at a neutral pH of circulation but can be hydrolyzed in lysosomes with a low pH Enzyme-labile \u00df-Glucuronide linker Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, protease-cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers. Acid-cleavable linkers such as hydrazine linkers are designed to be stable at a neutral pH of circulation but can be hydrolyzed in lysosomes with a low pH environment. Mylotarg, for example, was generated by conjugating calicheamicin with mAb against the CD33 antigen through an acid-cleavable hydrazine linker [52]. Protease-cleavable linkers are also used to keep ADCs intact in systemic circulation and allow easy release of the cytotoxic drugs from ADCs by lysosomal enzymes within cancer cells.\n...\nProtease-cleavable linkers are also used to keep ADCs intact in systemic circulation and allow easy release of the cytotoxic drugs from ADCs by lysosomal enzymes within cancer cells. For example, valine-citrulline (Val-Cit) and phenylalanine-lysine (Phe-Lys), which confer excellent stability and PK/PD profile to ADCs, have been used in many ADCs for preclinical and clinical evaluations. In addition, the ADCs with disulfide linkers take advantage of reduced glutathione with high intracellular concentrations to release free drug inside the cell. ADCs with reducible disulfide linkers generate uncharged metabolites that can diffuse into neighboring cells and elicit bystander killing, which is essential for killing heterogeneous tumors [51,53]. \n\nADCs with cleavable linkers have broader efficacy and faster rates of activating and releasing cytotoxic drugs for most cell lines. In contrast, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers can possibly provide increased plasma stability, greater therapeutic window, and reduced off-target toxicity. To reduce aggregation and improve the solubility of some ADCs, hydrophilic linkers such as \u03b2-glucuronide linker, Sulfo-SPDB, and Mal-PEG4-NHS were investigated [54,55]. In short, each type of linker has advantages and disadvantages, and each can be modified to achieve a fine balance between target efficacies and undesired toxicities [54].",

                    "text": "An important consideration impacting the pharmacokinetics of an ADC is the stability of linker. Ideally the linker should be stable in circulation to minimize toxicity but release the active cytotoxin once it is internalized by the tumor cell. The linkers can be categorized as cleavable and non-cleavable, with varying degrees of stability (1,31). Cleavable linkers use mechanisms within the cells or cellular compartments to release active cytotoxin, such as low pH (acid labile linkers), glutathione levels (disulfide linkers), and lysosomal proteases (protease cleavable linkers). In contrast, for non-cleavable linkers (e.g. thioether linkers), the entire ADC has to be degraded to release the active cytotoxin. The three advanced ADCs all use different linker types (1,31): peptide based protease cleavable linker (Adcetris\u00ae, linker: MC-vc-PAB), non-cleavable thioether linker (Kadcyla\u00ae, linker: MCC), and acid-labile hydrazone linker (Mylotarg\u00ae, linker: AcBut).

Kamath, S. Iyer\n## Abstract\nAntibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging new class of targeted therapeutics for cancer that use antibodies to deliver cytotoxic drugs to cancer cells. There are two FDA approved ADCs on the market and over 30 ADCs in the clinical pipeline against a number of different cancer types. The structure of an ADC is very complex with multiple components and considerable efforts are ongoing to determine the attributes necessary for clinical success. Understanding the pharmacokinetics of an ADC and how it impacts efficacy and toxicity is a critical part of optimizing ADC design and delivery i.e., dose and schedule. This review discusses the pharmacokinetic considerations for an ADC and tools and strategies that can be used to evaluate molecules at the preclinical stage.\n## Linker\nAn important consideration impacting the pharmacokinetics of an ADC is the stability of linker. Ideally the linker should be stable in circulation to minimize toxicity but release the active cytotoxin once it is internalized by the tumor cell. The linkers can be categorized as cleavable and non-cleavable, with varying degrees of stability (1,31). Cleavable linkers use mechanisms within the cells or cellular compartments to release active cytotoxin, such as low pH (acid labile linkers), glutathione levels (disulfide linkers), and lysosomal proteases (protease cleavable linkers). In contrast, for non-cleavable linkers (e.g. thioether linkers), the entire ADC has to be degraded to release the active cytotoxin. The three advanced ADCs all use different linker types (1,31): peptide based protease cleavable linker (Adcetris\u00ae, linker: MC-vc-PAB), non-cleavable thioether linker (Kadcyla\u00ae, linker: MCC), and acid-labile hydrazone linker (Mylotarg\u00ae, linker: AcBut). The comparison of the Tab profile with the conjugated antibody profile allows for an assessment of linker stability as shown conceptually in Fig. 5, where the conjugated antibody concentrations for the more unstable linker decline much faster compared to that of the stable linker. \n\nDifferent types of linkers used on the same antibody can impact its pharmacokinetics as illustrated by the following examples. The pharmacokinetics of anti-HER2 ADCs was determined in mice using disulfide linkers with different hindered structures (32). The clearance of the ADC decreased with the increase in the degree of hindrance of the disulfide linker as follows: SPDP-DM1 (least hindered) > SPP-DM1 > SSNPP-DM3 > SSNPP-DM4 (most hindered).",

Non-cleavable linkers, e.g., the one in trastuzumab emtansine (Figure 3a), remain attached to the cytotoxic drug after proteolytic degradation of the antibody in the lysosome. The drug, with an attached linker and an amino acid or short proteolytic peptide to which the linker is conjugated, is released to the cytosol and exerts its cytotoxic activity [129,130]. Cleavable linkers, on the other hand, are cleaved by lysosomal enzymes, or by low pH or a reducing environment inside endosomes; the drug-attached fragment after cleavage is typically removed by self-immolative reaction, releasing the free cytotoxic payload [131]. Brentuximab vedotin, for example, has a cathepsin-cleavable linker (valine-citrulline linker), and MMAE is released by the self-immolative reaction of the remaining linker fragment [101]. \n\nRegardless of the type, the linker for ADC has to be highly stable in blood in order to minimize the release of highly cytotoxic free drugs into circulation and to maintain maximum amount of intact ADC molecules targeting cancer cells. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg\u2122) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa\u2122), for example, both have an acid-labile hydrazone linker, which is relatively stable at pH 7.4 but hydrolyzed with high efficiency in the acidic environment of lysosome [74]. However, the acid-labile hydrazone linker can be considerably less stable than some of the other types of cleavable linkers, which may contribute to the narrow therapeutic window and high toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin [132].",

            "abstract": "Simple Summary Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents a highly aggressive form of lung cancer. Although SCLC initially responds to chemoimmunotherapy, it inevitably relapses. Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising treatment approach. ADCs consist of antibodies targeting specific tumor antigens, delivering cytotoxic drugs directly to cancer cells, and reducing side effects. In this review, we collected the available data regarding ADCs evaluated in SCLC. While some ADCs yielded negative results, others, such as those targeting B7-H3, SEZ6, CEACAM5, and TROP2 ADC, show promise. Further research is needed to determine ADCs\u2019 role in SCLC treatment. Abstract Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive disease, accounting for about 15% of all lung cancer cases. Despite initial responses to chemoimmunotherapy, SCLC recurs and becomes resistant to treatment. Recently, antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic option for SCLC. ADCs consist of an antibody that specifically targets a tumor antigen linked to a cytotoxic drug. The antibody delivers the drug directly to the cancer cells, minimizing off-target toxicity and improving the therapeutic index. Several ADCs targeting different tumor antigens are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for SCLC. Despite the negative results of rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), other ADCs targeting different antigens, such as B7-H3, seizure-related homolog 6 (SEZ6), and CEACAM5, have also been investigated in clinical trials, including for SCLC, and their results suggest preliminary activity, either alone or in combination with other therapies. More recently, sacituzumab govitecan, an anti-TROP2 ADC, demonstrated promising activity in lung cancer, including SCLC. Furthermore, an anti-B7-H3 (CD276), ifinatamab deruxtecan (DS7300A), showed a high response rate and durable responses in heavily pretreated SCLC. Overall, ADCs represent an intriguing approach to treating SCLC, particularly in the relapsed or refractory setting. Further studies are needed to determine their efficacy and safety and the best location in the treatment algorithm for SCLC. In this review, we aim to collect and describe the results regarding the past, the present, and the future of ADCs in SCLC.",

Belluomini, M. Sposito, A. Avancini, J. Insolda, Michele Milella, Antonio Rossi, S. Pilotto\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents a highly aggressive form of lung cancer. Although SCLC initially responds to chemoimmunotherapy, it inevitably relapses. Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising treatment approach. ADCs consist of antibodies targeting specific tumor antigens, delivering cytotoxic drugs directly to cancer cells, and reducing side effects. In this review, we collected the available data regarding ADCs evaluated in SCLC. While some ADCs yielded negative results, others, such as those targeting B7-H3, SEZ6, CEACAM5, and TROP2 ADC, show promise. Further research is needed to determine ADCs\u2019 role in SCLC treatment. Abstract Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive disease, accounting for about 15% of all lung cancer cases. Despite initial responses to chemoimmunotherapy, SCLC recurs and becomes resistant to treatment. Recently, antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic option for SCLC. ADCs consist of an antibody that specifically targets a tumor antigen linked to a cytotoxic drug. The antibody delivers the drug directly to the cancer cells, minimizing off-target toxicity and improving the therapeutic index. Several ADCs targeting different tumor antigens are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for SCLC. Despite the negative results of rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), other ADCs targeting different antigens, such as B7-H3, seizure-related homolog 6 (SEZ6), and CEACAM5, have also been investigated in clinical trials, including for SCLC, and their results suggest preliminary activity, either alone or in combination with other therapies. More recently, sacituzumab govitecan, an anti-TROP2 ADC, demonstrated promising activity in lung cancer, including SCLC. Furthermore, an anti-B7-H3 (CD276), ifinatamab deruxtecan (DS7300A), showed a high response rate and durable responses in heavily pretreated SCLC. Overall, ADCs represent an intriguing approach to treating SCLC, particularly in the relapsed or refractory setting. Further studies are needed to determine their efficacy and safety and the best location in the treatment algorithm for SCLC. In this review, we aim to collect and describe the results regarding the past, the present, and the future of ADCs in SCLC.\n## Introduction\nThe linker in ADCs connects the antibody with the cytotoxic drug.

Drug dose escalation to therapeutically active levels is often impossible with chemotherapeutic drugs due to this toxicity. The selectivity of the treatment was improved with the introduction of monoclonal antibody drugs that are directed against targets that are selectively expressed in tumor cells [1-5]. Because antibodies bind specifically to their cognate antigen on the surface of cells, they can also be used as vehicles to selectively deliver the cytotoxic drug to the cancer cells. The class of therapeutic drug products where monoclonal antibody is conjugated with cytotoxic drug (pay load) are called Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) [6]. ADCs are powerful cancer therapeutics which provides high selectivity and efficacy towards cancer cells, and reduced toxicity to healthy cells [6,7].",

Cleavable linkers release the drug from MAb by hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage where as non-cleavable linkers release drug by MAb degradation after internalization. Cleavable linkers are sub characterized into peptide (amide) linkers, hydrazone linkers, and disulphide linkers. Peptide linkers are usually accommodated with protease cleavage sites and are sensitive to proteases in the host cells. A valine-citrullinepeptide linker with protease cathepsin D cleavage site is one successful example used in clinically approved brentuximab vedotin ADC for treatment of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) [20]. \n\nHydrazone linkers are susceptible to acidic pH conditions in endosomes and lysosomes, and release the drug by hydrolysis. Disulphide linkers are susceptible to reductive environment in the tumor cells due to high levels of glutathione produced in tumor cells [21]. Non-cleavable linkers release drug after ADC complex degradation post internalization. The antibody portion of ADC gets degraded in lysosomal and endosomal compartments releasing a linker bound drug molecules [22]. It is considered that non-cleavable linkers contribute to high stability in blood stream, longer half-life, and reduced toxicity to ADCs [23,24]. In contrast to cytotoxic drugs that require chemical conjugation to antibodies, antibody cytokine conjugates can be developed as fusion proteins.",

Drug dose escalation to therapeutically active levels is often impossible with chemotherapeutic drugs due to this toxicity. The selectivity of the treatment was improved with the introduction of monoclonal antibody drugs that are directed against targets that are selectively expressed in tumor cells [1-5]. Because antibodies bind specifically to their cognate antigen on the surface of cells, they can also be used as vehicles to selectively deliver the cytotoxic drug to the cancer cells. The class of therapeutic drug products where monoclonal antibody is conjugated with cytotoxic drug (pay load) are called Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) [6]. ADCs are powerful cancer therapeutics which provides high selectivity and efficacy towards cancer cells, and reduced toxicity to healthy cells [6,7].\n## Cancer Therapy & Oncology International Journal\nhave been adapted to insert reactive cysteine or lysine sites to generate homogeneous mixture of ADCs with predictable DAR ratios sufficient for cell cytotoxicity [19]. \n\nLinkers can be broadly categorized into cleavable and noncleavable linkers depending on their mechanism of drug release. Cleavable linkers release the drug from MAb by hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage where as non-cleavable linkers release drug by MAb degradation after internalization. Cleavable linkers are sub characterized into peptide (amide) linkers, hydrazone linkers, and disulphide linkers. Peptide linkers are usually accommodated with protease cleavage sites and are sensitive to proteases in the host cells. A valine-citrullinepeptide linker with protease cathepsin D cleavage site is one successful example used in clinically approved brentuximab vedotin ADC for treatment of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) [20]. \n\nHydrazone linkers are susceptible to acidic pH conditions in endosomes and lysosomes, and release the drug by hydrolysis. Disulphide linkers are susceptible to reductive environment in the tumor cells due to high levels of glutathione produced in tumor cells [21]. Non-cleavable linkers release drug after ADC complex degradation post internalization. The antibody portion of ADC gets degraded in lysosomal and endosomal compartments releasing a linker bound drug molecules [22]. It is considered that non-cleavable linkers contribute to high stability in blood stream, longer half-life, and reduced toxicity to ADCs [23,24]. In contrast to cytotoxic drugs that require chemical conjugation to antibodies, antibody cytokine conjugates can be developed as fusion proteins.",

Late detection of the disease means that in most cases the disease has advanced locally and/or metastasized, and curative surgery is not possible. Chemotherapy is still the first-line treatment however, this has only had a modest impact in improving survival, with associated toxicities. Therefore, there is an urgent need for targeted approaches to better treat pancreatic cancer, while minimizing treatment-induced side-effects. Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are one treatment option that could fill this gap. Here, a monoclonal antibody is used to deliver extremely potent drugs directly to the tumor site to improve on-target killing while reducing off-target toxicity. In this paper, we review the current literature for ADC targets that have been examined in vivo for treating pancreatic cancer, summarize current and on-going clinical trials using ADCs to treat pancreatic cancer and discuss potential strategies to improve their therapeutic window.",

Wittwer, Michael P Brown, Vasilios Liapis, A. H. Staudacher\n## Abstract\nPancreatic cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death, and the 5-year survival rate has only improved marginally over the last decade. Late detection of the disease means that in most cases the disease has advanced locally and/or metastasized, and curative surgery is not possible. Chemotherapy is still the first-line treatment however, this has only had a modest impact in improving survival, with associated toxicities. Therefore, there is an urgent need for targeted approaches to better treat pancreatic cancer, while minimizing treatment-induced side-effects. Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are one treatment option that could fill this gap. Here, a monoclonal antibody is used to deliver extremely potent drugs directly to the tumor site to improve on-target killing while reducing off-target toxicity. In this paper, we review the current literature for ADC targets that have been examined in vivo for treating pancreatic cancer, summarize current and on-going clinical trials using ADCs to treat pancreatic cancer and discuss potential strategies to improve their therapeutic window.\n## Background\nThese therapeutic effects have most recently been achieved, largely due to new ADC linker chemistries that stabilize the ADC in the bloodstream and maximize the tumorspecific delivery of the cytotoxic payload [11]. Linkers can be broadly classified as cleavable or non-cleavable, each with their own distinct mechanism of action [14]. Cleavable linkers, such as hydrazone, disulphide and peptide linkers, allow selective cleavage of the ADC within the tumor cell by exploiting environmental differences between healthy and malignant tissues, such as pH or the presence of specific enzymes [15]. Once the ADC is internalized by binding to its tumor-associated antigen, the linker can be cleaved to release the cytotoxic drug directly within the cancer cell. Depending on the payload drug chemistry, the drug can be cell-impermeant resulting in killing of only the targeted cell, or cell-permeant which enables killing of the surrounding, antigen-negative cells in a process called bystander killing. Similarly, a cleavable linker can be cleaved within the tumor microenvironment before cell internalization of the ADC, releasing the drug and also producing bystander killing [16]. Although bystander killing is undesirable for healthy cells, the process could allow eradication of antigennegative tumor cells that would otherwise not have been targeted by the ADC [17,18] and could also facilitate the maturation and activation of intratumoral immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), which are known to be activated by certain ADC payloads such as maytansines, aurostatins, and pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers [19][20][21]. Non-cleavable linkers such as thioether and maleimidocaproyl (MMC) linkers, are not susceptible to environmental or enzymatic cleavage and instead are only broken down to release the cytotoxic payload after tumor cell internalization and subsequent antibody degradation in the endosomes and lysosomes [14].",

            "text": "While in theory antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) deliver high-dose chemotherapy directly to target cells, numerous side effects are observed in clinical practice. We sought to determine the effect of linker design (cleavable versus non-cleavable), drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), and free payload concentration on systemic toxicity. Two systematic reviews were performed via PubMed search of clinical trials published between January 1998\u2014July 2022. Eligible studies: (1) clinical trial for cancer therapy in adults, (2)\u2009\u2265\u20091 study arm included a single-agent ADC, (3) ADC used was commercially available/FDA-approved. Data was extracted and pooled using generalized linear mixed effects logistic models. 40 clinical trials involving 7,879 patients from 11 ADCs, including 9 ADCs with cleavable linkers (N\u2009=\u20092,985) and 2 with non-cleavable linkers (N\u2009=\u20094,894), were included. Significantly more composite adverse events (AEs) \u2265 grade 3 occurred in patients in the cleavable linkers arm (47%) compared with the non-cleavable arm (34%). When adjusted for DAR, for grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 toxicities, non-cleavable linkers remained independently associated with lower toxicity for any AE (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Higher DAR was significantly associated with higher probability of grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 toxicity for any AE. There was also a significant interaction between cleavability status and DAR for any AE (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Finally, higher measured systemic free payload concentrations were significantly associated with higher DARs (p\u2009=\u20090.043). Our results support the hypothesis that ADCs with cleavable linkers result in premature payload release, leading to increased systemic free payload concentrations and associated toxicities. This may help to inform future ADC design and rational clinical application.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are monoclonal antibodies connected to a cytotoxic agent known as the payload via a chemical linker. It was hoped that ADCs would be \"magic bullets,\" delivering high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy directly to cancer cells without affecting surrounding normal tissues. However, this has not borne out in clinical practice. Though many factors affect toxicity, the toxicities of currently approved ADCs appear to be driven primarily by premature release of the payload into the bloodstream by the linker, by an excessively prominent bystander effect [1], or even payload released by the lysed tumor cells [2]. \n\nADC linkers can be divided broadly into two groups: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers such as hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers rely on physiologic factors (i.e., cathepsin, glutathione (GSH), and low pH) within the cell to cleave the linker. Because these conditions can occur independently of antigen internalization, cleavable linkers are often less stable in the blood, resulting in various off-target effects [3]. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as the thioether or maleimidocaproyl linkers, require internalization by the target cell, so that the antibody, rather than the linker, can be degraded by the lysosome before the drug is released. This latter mechanism does not produce efficient bystander killing and thus results in lower toxicity profiles [4]. For these reasons, other novel linkers, including conditionally released linkers, are currently in rapid development [5,6]. \n\nPreclinical studies have shown that compared to ADCs with non-cleavable linkers, those with cleavable linkers likely release free payload prematurely, leading to increased systemic toxicity. In this study, we sought to delineate the potential effect of linker design on systemic toxicity by analyzing the results of clinical trials using ADCs constructed with both types of linkers.",

When the drug loading increased, both clearance and volume of distribution increased, but the exposure (AUC) of ADC decreased, reflecting the significant attribute of DAR to PK properties of ADC. \n\nThe systemic stability of the antibody\u2212drug linker is also crucial for delivery of an intact ADC to targetexpressing tumors. Linkers stable in circulation but readily processed in the target cell are necessary for both safety and potency of the delivered conjugate [48]. In general, linker should be stable enough in systemic circulation to deliver drug into tumor cells, but labile to release this fully active payload drug inside the tumor cells. Otherwise, the toxic drug could be released in the bloodstream, causing systemic toxicity. Polson et al. demonstrated that non-cleavable linker (e.g.  is more stable than cleavable linker (e.g. T-DM1) [49]. The non-cleavable linker may have slower deconjugation or lower clearance than cleavable linker and reduced systemic toxicity of ADC in rats presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation [49]. This is because the cleavable linkers may release drug by lysosomal proteases without the degradation of the mAb component whereas non-cleavable linkers require catabolism of the mAb backbones to release the drug [9 and ref. therein]. In addition, the selection of attachment site can affect stability of cleavable antibody-drug conjugates, as demonstrated in the design of systemically stable cleavable auristatin-based conjugates, offering the means to overcome inherent linker instability by optimal attachment site [48]. \n\nInterestingly, Junutula et al. [50] recently reported a site-specific conjugation method called THIOMAB technology enabling near-uniform, low-level conjugation of cytotoxins (DAR=2) to antitumor antibodies, which displayed an increased tolerability or improved therapeutic index without compromising efficacy.",

            "text": "The specificity, efficacy, and safety of an ADC are determined by the design, structure, and chemistry of the linker that connects the cytotoxic payload to the antibody. Linkers are typically designed to be constant in the blood system (enabling for a prolonged timeframe of bloodstream), but labile enough to efficiently deliver the cytotoxic payload to the tumour [51].\n\nCleavable and non-cleavable linkers are the two types of linkers. Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Fig. 1 The development, purification, and production of antibody-drug conjugates cathepsins). pH-sensitive hydrazone (found in brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, trastuzumab deruxtecan, and sacituzumab govitecan) is another enzyme-cleavable peptide-based linker (T-DXd) [51,52].\n\nNon-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability [53]. T-DM1 with mafodotin belantamab is one of two FDA-approved ADCs with non-cleavable linkers [18].\n\nThe systemic stability of ADCs post administration is one of the crucial issues to ensure the efficacy of ADCs, and several strategic approaches are taken for overcoming this issue. ADCs should ideally remain stable or intact in the circulation before entering target cells, but there are cases where ADC catabolites are still biologically active [54,55].

They disengage their cytotoxic payload during the lysosomal degradation of the antibodydrug conjugate inside the tumor environment, bypassing the non-specific dispersion of the toxic preparation [37]. \n\nNon-cleavable linkers are an innovational array of first-generation linkers with more advanced plasma stability than many cleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers do not seem to contain a definable payload dispersion mode, and ADCs developed with this mechanism depend on the lysosomal proteolytic decomposition of the antibody after ingestion to deliver the cytotoxic medicine. Via this strategy, the non-cleavable linker transporting the medication is attached to the conjugation amino acid within the antibody. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers are more contingent on the membrane biology of the neoplasm than cleavable linkers. ADCs designed with non-cleavable linkers have amplified plasma stability via an enhanced therapeutic index [37]. Due to the bystander sequence, this opposition to extracellular cleavage improves the specificity of payload delivery. Numerous clinical data and in vivo studies prove ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers surpass the efficacy of those with cleavable linkers [38]. \n\nAnother advantage of non-cleavable linkers is heightened plasma stability. In vivo research studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linked ADCs outperform cleavable equivalents. mAb degradation contained in the lysosome after ADC ingestion is necessary for non-cleavable linkers to liberate their medical preparation. The payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs destroys the target cells, and non-cleavable linkers may theoretically offer a superior medicinal opportunity versus cleavable linkers. With a reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable ADCs, non-cleavable ADCs may offer improved stability and tolerability [39].",

Linker chemistry impacts various ADC properties including toxicity, specificity, stability and potency, and thus a wide range of possible linker structures have been investigated. Linkers can be broadly classified as either cleavable (the payload is able to separate from the mAb at the tumour site) or non-cleavable (payload and mAb remain bound together, mAb is degraded following internalisation), and this, in turn, effects the modes of action of individual ADCs [39].",

            "text": "We examined seven potential ADC targets for the treatment of NHL, and in all cases, the cleavable-linker ADC SPP-DM1 was  effective in xenograft models. Our observation that SPP-DM1 ADCs have activity even when the antibodies to the targets are poorly internalized seems to be a general characteristic of cleavable-linker ADCs with membrane-permeable drugs. For example, CD21 is poorly internalized (Supplemental Fig. S1; Fig. 3), yet anti-CD21-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE was effective in our model. Similarly, others have shown an anti-CD20-AcBut-calicheamicin, which also recognizes a poorly internalized target (Fig. 3) and uses an acidcleavable linker, is effective in a xenograft model, whereas anti-CD20-amide-calicheamicin with an uncleavable linker is not (27). A likely mechanism that would explain why cleavable linkers are broadly effective and less sensitive to the biology, particularly the trafficking, of the target, is that following antibody binding, the linker is cleaved in the extracellular space and free drug subsequently permeates the cell to reach it's target. One line of evidence for this mechanism is shown in Supplemental Fig. S1; anti-CD21-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE is efficacious, but substitution of MMAF for MMAE on this conjugate results in an inactive ADC. MMAF is a more potent drug than MMAE, but is charged and relatively membrane-impermeable (7); thus, the efficacy of the MMAE conjugate in this experiment must be due to extracellular cleavage of the linker followed by cell permeation of the liberated drug. Although the data presented suggest that cleavable linkers are broadly active, our data also show that the cleavable linkers are a double-edged sword; such ADCs are more toxic in an acute setting. Still, cleavable-linker ADCs are likely to be the format of choice for many targets, particularly those with less internalization, lower copy number, or heterogeneous tumor expression (5).",

Linkers, which are generally divided into cleavable and non-cleavable types, are designed to be stable in the bloodstream while allowing efficient release of the small molecule cytotoxin after internalization in the target cell [58]. The stability of antibody-drug linkers in systemic circulation has been a key focus in safety evaluations, since premature loss of the small molecule prior to ADC target cell internalization can result in off-target toxicity from non-specific drug release [59]. Strategies to develop ADCs with more stable linkers and lower levels of unconjugated mAbs have been viewed as critical to the effort to improve ADC pharmacokinetic properties, therapeutic indexes, and safety profiles [13,60]. \n\nAn insufficiently stable linker was thought to represent a possible liability for Mylotarg, although subsequent ADCs utilizing similar acid-labile hydrazone linkers, e.g., inotuzumab ozogamicin and milatuzumab-doxorubicin, have shown good stability in human plasma and serum [14]. However, a comparison of ADCs containing hydrazone linkers with those using protease-sensitive dipeptide linkers showed that the peptide-linked conjugates were much more stable in buffers and plasma than the corresponding hydrazone conjugates, and as a result exhibited more specific delivery and lower systemic toxicity [61]. These results illustrated the importance of conjugation and linker chemistry in achieving a favorable therapeutic index. \n\nSpecies differences in drug-linker stability can lead to difficulties in evaluating the therapeutic index of an ADC based on nonclinical studies.",

An ideal linker should possess high water solubility, preventing both aggregation of the ADC and premature payload release in systemic circulation (39). Regarding intracellular stability and degradation patterns, linkers are classified into two distinct categories: cleavable and non-cleavable (40). Cleavable linkers exhibit sensitivity to intracellular environmental conditions and could be cleaved by acid, protease, a reducing substance, and so on (40). Typically, these linkers, including hydrazone bonds, disulfide bonds, and polypeptides, are cleaved within endosomes or lysosomes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers undergo cleavage only within lysosomes, leading to the degradation of their associated payloads into amino acids (65). Significantly, non-cleavable linkers offer the benefits of an enhanced therapeutic index and reduced off-target toxicity (66). While each strategy presents its own advantages and drawbacks, the optimal linker and conjugation chemistry must be precisely tailored to align with the specific properties of the antibody, the drug molecule, and the disease profile being targeted.",

            "text": "Following ADC dosing, the released (i.e., \"free\") payload rapidly appears within the systemic circulation. Plasma exposure to free payload relates, in part, to premature deconjugation of the payload in the systemic circulation (e.g., due to inadequate linker stability) [24]. There are two main classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers contain chemical or enzymatic liable chemistries formulated to exploit specific conditions unique to the intracellular or tumor extracellular environments, with the goal of maintaining good stability in the systemic circulation and rapid cleavage at the target site [25,26]. In practice, cleavable linkers are often hydrolyzed in plasma at an appreciable rate, leading to the premature release of the payload in the extra-tumoral compartments. Lipophilic payloads exhibit high permeability through plasma membranes and, consequently, the released payload enters non-targeted cells efficiently (e.g., via membrane diffusion), potentially leading to unwanted cytotoxicity. For example, the hydrazone linker used in the first-generation, calicheamicin-based ADC, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, was designed to be cleaved in the acidic environment of cellular lysosomes (i.e., following cell entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis). However, this linker exhibits an appreciable rate of hydrolysis in plasma, leading to substantial payload release prior to the ADC's engagement with the targeted antigen, and decreasing the fraction of intact ADC delivered to targeted cells [25,27]. \n\nIt is important to note that ADCs with cleavable linkers may be considered to be prodrugs, and it may be expected that 100% of the administered drug (i.e., payload) is eventually liberated through linker hydrolysis.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are now established as an important class of therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. There are currently seven FDA-approved ADCs, with at least 60 more in clinical development. 1 The success of ADCs arises from the combination of the exquisite cell-selectivity of monoclonal antibodies and the cytotoxicity of small molecule chemotherapies. However, for the mAb and drug to exert their maximum therapeutic potential, the covalent linker between the two groups must exhibit the following properties: (1) high plasma stability; the long circulatory lifetimes (t 1/2 > 1 week) of ADCs places stringent stability requirements on the linker to avoid off-target payload release. (2) High aqueous solubility to aid bioconjugation of lipophilic payloads and avoid antibody aggregation. (3) Release of a potent cytotoxin from the antibody in the target cell. 2 The majority of ADCs employ antibodies that target internalising antigens, overexpressed on the surface of certain cancer cells. Upon antibody-antigen binding at the target cell, the ADC is endocytosed and trafficked to the highly hydrolytic lysosomal compartments, where the antibody is broken down into its constituent amino acids. 3 In the case of a non-cleavable linker, the active intracellular cytotoxin is released as the linker-payload with the terminal amino acid from the mAb still attached. 4 Conversely, a cleavable linker is designed to release the unmod-i\ue103ed drug at this point, or upon subsequent entry to the cytosol.\n\nCleavable linkers are generally preferred to non-cleavable linkers in ADC research for a number of reasons. 5 First, traceless drug release allows the unmodi\ue103ed payload to perform its intracellular function without an unwanted linker appendage, thereby maximising cytotoxicity. Second, the unmodi\ue103ed payload can be uncharged, allowing it to diffuse into 'bystander' tumour cells that may not be expressing the target antigen. This 'bystander effect' provides an important mechanism for eradicating tumours with heterogeneous antigen expression. 6 Enzyme",

On the contrary, non-cleavable linkers are connected as amino acid residues within the breakdown products of the antibody, displaying low activity in the general chemical and enzymatic environments within the body, ensuring high plasma stability.

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) consist of tumor-targeting mAbs, which are conjugated to cytotoxic payloads via chemical linkers. [42] Each component plays a crucial role in the efficacy and safety profile of ADCs. The mAb part of ADCs contributes to cancer cell selectivity, stability, and pharmacokinetic properties, while the payloads of ADCs exert anti-tumor effects by inducing cytotoxicity such as DNA damage or microtubule inhibition. For the chemical linker in ADCs, both cleavable and non-cleavable chemical structures have been utilized. Cleavable linkers enable controlled release of the cytotoxic payload intracellularly or within the tumor microenvironment. The cleavable ADC linkers can be categorized into three types: protease-sensitive linkers utilizing protease cleavable peptide sequences like cathepsin B sensitive valine-citrulline (VC) dipeptide, pH-sensitive linkers attached to acid-labile groups such as hydrazone, and glutathione-sensitive linkers containing disulfide bonds. Whereas, non-cleavable linkers, including thioether or maleimidocaproyl (MC) groups, exhibit enhanced plasma stability, and potentially improving the therapeutic index. [44] The extensive ADC research and its notable efficacy have resulted in the FDA approval for 12 ADCs, with over 260 undergoing clinical trials as of 2022. [45]  limitations of ADCs have arisen from their uniform payloads, which are driving ADC research towards payload diversification and prompting the development of degrader-antibody conjugates (DACs). [46] espite the promising potential of PROTACs, their development remains challenging due to their metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK). [47] To overcome these limitations, DACs have been developed by harnessing mAb-mediated PROTAC delivery. Given the pivotal role of BET family proteins in various cancers, [48][49][50] bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) targeting DACs have been developed. [34,51]",

            "text": "Linkers are divided into non-cleavable and cleavable linkers [108]. Non-cleavable linkers form stable bonds with antibodies and have a longer half-life in circulation. Further, after internalization, non-cleavable linkers should degrade in the lysozyme to release the drug molecule inside the targeted tumor cell. The stability of cleavable linkers depends on the physiological conditions in the tumor tissue and the expression of enzymes for cleavage of the linker to release the drug in the tumor site. The tumor toxicity of the ADC depends on the choice of payload (drug molecule) attached to the antibody. Conventional cancer drugs, such as DOX or mitomycin, have been used with ADCs. In general, the payload in ADCs is engineered to target either DNA or tubulin to interfere with cell division and proliferation. The conjugation chemistry affects the drug pharmacokinetics and therapeutic index of ADC. The conjugation of the payload largely occurs through the linker via the alkylation or acetylation of lysine side chains in the backbone of the antibody [106]. \n\nNanomaterials 2021, 11, 1755 15 of 25 binds with a high specificity to the antibody to minimize off-target toxic side effects to healthy cells. The number and density of target antigen molecules on the surface of CSCs affect the extent of the ADC engulfment by tumor cells. Further, antigen secretion by the CSCs to the circulation should be minimal to limit the circulatory detection of the ADCantigen and activation of the immune system. Table 1 summarizes the list of surface antigens on tumor cells used in designing antibody-drug conjugates for different types of cancers [104,106]. Another factor is the selection of an antibody to target the antigens on the surface of CSCs with a high specificity, strong binding affinity, and long circulation half-life for prolonged uptake and retention by the tumor tissue. The efficient internalization by CSCs and low immunogenicity of the ADC are important factors in the selection process [106,107].",

            "text": "linkers are a double-edged sword; such ADCs are more toxic in an acute setting. Still, cleavable-linker ADCs are likely to be the format of choice for many targets, particularly those with less internalization, lower copy number, or heterogeneous tumor expression (5). Indeed, the only marketed ADC, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, has an acid-cleavable linker (28). We and others (7) have hypothesized that uncleavable linker ADCs would be safer than ADCs with cleavable linkers. We tested this in a general way by using a rat model system in which the antibody was not targeted to any rat antigen, and found that, indeed, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity compared with their cleavable counterparts. The faster decrease in the amount of cleavable linker ADC compared with the total antibody suggests that this is due to the release of free drug or linker-drug metabolite(s). In the context of safety, it is also important to note that there are differences in the metabolites that arise from cleavable and uncleavable linkers. For example, the reported metabolite of Ab-MCC-DM1 is lysine-MCC-DM1, a charged molecule that is relatively impermeant to cells (8). If released into the circulation, this molecule would presumably permeate normal tissues to a lesser extent than free DM1, for example. Thus, the increased safety of uncleavable linkers observed in this study could be a combination of both reduced drug release as well as differing properties of the metabolites.\n\nAlthough cleavable SPP-DM1 resulted in efficacy in vivo when conjugated to antibodies to all seven NHL targets, uncleavable linker MCC-DM1 ADCs were only effective when targeted to two of them, CD22 and CD79b. These data suggest that ADCs targeted to CD22 and CD79b would be effective with a wide range of linker-drugs. However, it remains possible that the other antigens we tested could also be effective targets for uncleavable linker ADCs because different antibodies to the same target can sometimes",

Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), monoclonal antibodies conjugated with highly potent drugs (payloads) through chemical linkers, are an emerging class of therapeutic agents for cancer chemotherapy. Their clinical success has been demonstrated by the 4 ADCs already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and more than 60 promising ADCs now in clinical trials. Further advancement of this novel molecular platform could potentially revolutionize current strategies and regimens for treating cancers. The linker structure and antibody-linker conjugation modality critically contribute to ADC homogeneity, circulation stability, pharmacokinetic profiles, tolerability, and overall treatment efficacy. Despite extensive efforts to improve these parameters, most ADC linkers used to date possess linear structures, and therefore accommodate only single payloads. The clinical potential of branched ADC linkers, enabling the installation of two payload molecules, remains unexplored because of the lack of efficient conjugation methods. In addition, according to a recent report, the stability of enzymatically cleavable linkers in mouse circulation is another crucial factor for the successful evaluation of ADCs in preclinical studies. In this review, I present my research group's effort to develop both branched linkers and efficient conjugation methods for constructing dual-loading ADCs with high homogeneity and enhanced potency. I also present a novel tripeptide ADC linker with enhanced stability in mouse circulation. Multidisciplinary experience, approaches, and collaboration are key to successfully advancing our ADC research programs. I herein describe how my experience in the U.S. has helped to develop and manage complex biomedical research projects in a small academic laboratory setting.",

            "text": "The analysis of linker types was limited because only two approved ADCs-belantamab mafodotin and trastuzumab emtansine-utilize non-cleavable linkers, precluding meaningful comparisons across groups. Linkers are considered critical for ADC safety because they influence payload release. Designing linkers requires a careful balance between chemical stability and the controlled release of the cytotoxic agent. The ADC must remain stable in the bloodstream to prevent premature release of the cytotoxic component, which could result in off-target toxicity. At the same time, the linker must allow for the effective release of the cytotoxic agent within the target cell after the ADC is internalized. The chemical composition of the linker, along with the conjugation method and site, plays a critical role in determining the DAR, as well as influencing the therapeutic index, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the ADC. In general terms, cleavable linkers may lead to faster payload release, potentially increasing off-target effects, while non-cleavable linkers generally improve ADC stability in circulation. In this context, recirculation of the ADCs can be higher for those with non-cleavable linkers. Additionally, ADCs with homogeneous drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) exhibit reduced heterogeneity in blood levels, which may lower the risk of extra-exposure to the payload [17]. In addition, the optimization of linkers could increase efficacy and safety. For instance, exo-linkers provide a two-step activation mechanism, where the first cleavage event exposes a secondary recognition site, ensuring greater stability in circulation and precise drug release in the tumor microenvironment [18]. Tandem-cleavable linkers, on the other hand, incorporate multiple cleavage mechanisms (e.g., protease-sensitive + redox-responsive) to enhance payload release efficiency within tumors while minimizing systemic toxicity, offering a promising strategy for next-generation ADCs [19].",

            "text": "One of the fundamental lessons learned from the first gen- eration of ADCs is that a suitably stable linker is as vital as the antibody and payload for maximization of therapeutic efficacy of the ADC. The ideal linker is systemically stable so that biophysiochemcial property of ADC are similar to that of the unconjugated antibody, but are still able to release the payload at the target site. Extensive research is being conducted to develop novel linkers for ADCs, and the most broadly evaluated and utilized linker platforms include both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers.\n\nCleavable linkers: The cleavable linkers include chemically-labile (e.g., hydrazones and disulfides) and protease-labile linkers. These cleavable linkers are designed to be stable in circulation, but release the toxic payloads due to differences between the extracellular and intracellular microenvironment following internalization of the ADC. For example, the acidlabile hydrazone linker of Mylotarg \u00ae liberates calicheamicin when encountering an acidic pH environment such as found in lysosomes and endosomes (pH 4~6) (van Der Velden et al., 2001;Ulbrich and Subr, 2004). Similarly, disulfide linkers have the advantage of differential reduction potential in the cytosol, so that reduction of the disulfide bond can subsequently liberate payloads, as in the anti-CD56-maytansine conjugate (Saito et al., 2003;Erickson et al., 2006;Chanan-Khan et al., 2010 6 ). It is worth noting that the presence of a stericallyhindered carbon near the sulfur atom in the disulfide linker increases the stability of the disulfide bond, thus providing an equivalent or improved in vitro potency.\n\nThe peptide-based linkers are also designed to be retained in the ADC formin circulation, but to release their payload upon cleavage by specific intracellular proteases. For example, Adcetris \u00ae uses the valine-citrulline (vc) dipeptide linker, which is hydrolyzed by",

Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells [43,46]. In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability. \n\nYelena et al. synthesized the huC242-SMCC-DM1 conjugate binding DM1 to the humanized monoclonal antibody (huC242) via an N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1carboxylate (SMCC) for non-cleavable thioether linker and tested the cytotoxicity of conjugate on COLO 205 cells and Namalwa cells. Compared with the cantuzumab mertansine (huC242-DM1) containing a cleavable disulfide linker, the huC242-SMCC-DM1 is efficacious only against tumors in which all proliferating cells express the target antigen, and displayed significantly lower in vivo activity in multiple xenograft tumor models (Figure 4) [47].

It was demonstrated that cleavable linkers have the advantage of releasing the cytotoxic payload more efficiently. However, non-cleavable linkers may release their chemotherapy payloads with more specificity, but the antibody needs to be completely degraded in the lysosomes that might affect the payload. Non-cleavable linkers are associated with higher plasma stability and relatively longer half-lives [17][18][19]. \n\nThe ADCs can be categorized by an important indicator, the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR).

She presented data on weight loss in mice administered an antibody conjugated to DM4 through either a cleavable or non-cleavable linker. The difference in the highest non-toxic dose was nearly 3-fold, suggesting that the non-cleavable linker could increase the safety margin for an ADC. However, she also presented data on antitumor activity that suggested the cleavable linker may be active against a broader array of tumor types compared to the non-cleavable linker. Taken together, the data for the two types of linkers suggests that a compromise between safety and activity may be required.\n\nThe impact of the cytotoxic element on the safety and efficacy of ADCs was Dr. Blanc's final topic. She discussed clinical data for ADCs that included either a DNA-binding drug or a maytansinoid. These ADCs had differences in the maximum tolerated dose of 20-to 80-fold. She noted that no conclusions can be drawn from the data on adverse events. Dr. Blanc emphasized that achieving a sufficient pharmacological index was critical to ADC development, and that ADCs that included both types of drug have had issues with toxicity or efficacy, e.g., gemtuzumab ozogamicin, AVE9633. In the case of AVE9633, there were no dose limiting toxicities at 260 mg/m 2 , but the ADC was not effective despite the fact that all the sites on tumor cells were saturated. Dr. Blanc reiterated the point also made by Dr. Lutz that diversity of mechanism of action is desirable because not all tumors respond to the same drug. Dr. Blanc concluded by noting that the challenge of ADC development is to find the right targets, especially regarding the safety profile and capacity to internalize the drug; select the right cytotoxic agent based on the indication; select the best antibody, likely based on an empirical approach; and find a linker that is adapted to the type of tumor and provides the desired safety profile.\n\nCalicheamicin antibodies and beyond were discussed by Hans-Peter Gerber (Pfizer BioTherapeutics).

            "text": "The linker, tethering the cytotoxic payload to the mAb, is another crucial factor influencing ADCs therapeutic index and PK, as it determines plasma stability and release profile of the payload [2,4,25,32]. Generally, most ADC drugs incorporate two types of covalent linkers, cleavable and non-cleavable, which differ in their intracellular processing and systemic stability. While both have been shown to be safe in preclinical and clinical settings, cleavable linkers currently dominate the ADC landscape. For a comprehensive overview of the topic, the readers are advised to refer to [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nCleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the cancer TME over healthy tissues or systemic circulation [2,25,32,43,44]. They can be either chemically or enzymatically labile. Chemical linkers include hydrazone-or disulfide-bond-based linkers. The first type, used in commercially available Mylotarg \u00ae and Besponsa \u00ae , is sensitive to low pH and can be hydrolyzed within acidic early endosomes post-uptake. The second one can undergo reduction via intracellular thiols such as glutathione (GSH), whose levels are generally elevated in cancer cells (1-10 mmol/L) than in blood (5 \u00b5mol/L) [45]. These linker types generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload able to promote bystander killing [1,2,32]. Notably, acid-sensitive linkers are insufficiently stable and can occasionally be hydrolyzed in the plasma, leading to premature drug release and off-target toxicity. This liability is one of the causes leading to the voluntary Mylotarg \u00ae withdrawal by Pfizer from the US market in 2000, following the severe liver toxicity seen in patients [46][47][48]. The subsequent linker redesign and dosing schedule optimization have led to ADC reapproval in 2017 [46,49,50].",

Here, we systematically examine the potential targets and linker-drug combinations that could provide an optimal ADC for the treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We identified seven antigens (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD72, CD79b, and CD180) for potential treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with ADCs. ADCs with cleavable linkers mediated in vivo efficacy via all these targets; ADCs with uncleavable linkers were only effective when targeted to CD22 and CD79b. In target-independent safety studies in rats, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity, presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation. Thus, our data suggest that ADCs with cleavable linkers work on a broad range of targets, and for specific targets, ADCs with uncleavable linkers provide a promising opportunity to improve the therapeutic window for ADCs in humans.",

Recently, Burke et al reported PEGylated \u03b2-glucuronide-MMAE linkers that improved PK stability of ADCs with eight DARs, and increased potency in xenografts compared to the non-PEGylated controls (Burke et al., 2015 7 ). However, clinical improvement of the therapeutic window for ADCs using glucuronic acid-based linkers has yet to be demonstrated.\n\nNon-cleavable linkers: In contrast to the cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers that possess potent antitumor activity were unexpectedly discovered. Non-cleavable thioether and maleimidocaproyl (mc) linkers were initially synthesized for use as controls for the evaluation of cleavable linker conjugates. However, ADCs linked with these non-cleavable linkers, such as huC242-MCC-DM1 and cAC10-L4-MMAF, were as active as the conjugates with the cleavable linkers (Doronina et al., 2006;Erickson et al., 2006). Studies on the mechanism of action of the non-cleavable linker conjugates showed that antibody degradation of ADC components in lysosomes, following internalization, was necessary and resulted in release of \"active\" cytotoxic payload derivatives. Interestingly, the payload from non-cleavable ADCs remained covalently bonded to the linker via the residues to which the linkers were conjugated (Doronina et al., 2006;Erickson et al., 2006;Alley et al., 2008). This payload derivative then subsequently killed the target cells. Thus, non-cleavable linkers can provide greater stability and tolerability, as well as potentially greater therapeutic windows compared to the conjugates with cleavable linkers. However, additional efficacy from bystander effects are not",

            "text": "In the lysosomal compartment, the process of intracellular proteolytic degradation reduces the ADC to the level of amino acids. For this type of linker to be effective, the cytotoxic agent must maintain its activity, despite still being attached to part of the linker [22]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are considered to have improved therapeutic index because of their greater plasma stability, although new designs of cleavable linkers have significantly improved stability [23]. \n\nIt is clear that the disposition of a mAb is dependent upon several factors (Figure 1), and not just the therapeutic entity conjugated to it, in the case of an ADC. While mAbs trigger an effector function on their own, ADCs act more like prodrugs, and may or may not exert an anti-cancer effect until the SM drug is released from the mAb carrier. Thus, the pharmacology of mAbs and ADCs are complex. As a result, analytical and PK studies must be performed to assess the disposition of not just conjugated and released forms of ADCs, but also the effects of modifications on the mAbs after administration. \n\nAntibodies 2018, 7, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 28 improve ADC solubility or reduce ADC aggregation [6,20]. Typically, linkers used in ADC formulations are classified as being either \"cleavable\" or \"non-cleavable\". Cleavable linkers respond to physiological stimuli, such as low pH or proteolytic cleavage, to release the cytotoxic drug from its ADC carrier [21]. In theory, these linkers are catalyzed in a tumor cells, due to the presence, or increased presence, of their catalyst, to allow for selective release of the cytotoxic agent [5,21]. An example of a cleavable linker is seen in brentuximab vedotin, where the monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) cytotoxic payload is released by protease activity (Adcetris, Settle Genetics, Seattle, WA, USA).",

This targeted release is essential for effectively delivering the cytotoxic payload to cancer cells, as premature release can result in systemic off-target toxicity [19]. Linkers can be classified into two types: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release their payloads in response to specific conditions, such as the pH of cancer cells, reducing agents, and enzymes. Cleavable linkers may increase the efficiency of payload release, causing a bystander effect, but they also have a higher risk of increasing toxicity in normal tissues. On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma, so they only release the drug after the antibody has been completely degraded in the lysosome. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are not expected to induce a bystander effect. Currently, most ADCs use cleavable linkers.",

            "text": "They may not release drugs into the extracellular space and cannot kill neighboring tumor cells through the bystander effect [18]. Furthermore, optimal linker selection depends on the chosen target antigen. Protease-cleavable linkers are also designed to be stable in plasma, but rapidly release the active drug within lysosomes in cancer cells upon cleavage by lysosomal enzymes [19]. They take advantage of the high levels of protease activity inside lysosomes and include a peptide sequence recognized and cleaved by these proteases. The primary goal of all linkers in ADCs is to ensure the specific release of the active drug within target cells, which is essential for controlling the toxicity of the highly potent drugs used to construct ADCs. However, the balance between efficacy and toxicity changes for the above-mentioned linkers. Moreover, the ideal linker chemistry choice ultimately depends on experimentally determining the optimal combination of the suitable linker, the ideal target antigen, and the desired payload [20,21]. A comprehensive understanding of the structural integrity of the linker, the payload and the conjugation site during biological exposure is crucial throughout the process of novel linker-payload design and optimization of the PK profile [22]. This understanding represents a key aspect in maximizing efficacy while minimizing toxicity in preclinical testing and it is essential for ensuring the successful translation to the clinical setting [23,24]. \n\nThis bioconjugate modality's complexity is a source of significant challenge for analytical investigation and analysis, especially in vivo [25]. Nowadays, both Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Liquid Chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have been employed to support ADC discovery and development projects [26,27]. Ligand-binding assays (LBAs) are considered the golden standard to measure antibody concentration (both total and conjugated antibody analytes), whereas LC-MS methods are usually employed to quantify both free and conjugated toxin [28,29].",

Thus, non-cleavable linkers can provide greater stability and tolerability, as well as potentially greater therapeutic windows compared to the conjugates with cleavable linkers. However, additional efficacy from bystander effects are not expected with non-cleavable drug conjugates, presumably due to the cell's impermeability to the \"hydrophilic\" drug-linker complex. However, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates was observed .\n\nSome ADCs with non-cleavable linkers showed in vivo efficacy that was better than ADCs with cleavable linkers. For example, the anti-CD70-mcMMAF conjugate demonstrated an improved therapeutic index, as a result of higher MTD and antitumor efficacy in various renal cell carcinoma models compared with anti-CD70-vcMMAF conjugates (Oflazoglu et al., 2008). Similarly, the thioether-linked trastuzumab-DM1 (trastuzumab-MCC-DM1) conjugate showed improved efficacy, PK, and tolerability compared to the disulfide-linked trastuzumab-DM1 (Lewis Phillips et al., 2008). The thioetherlinked huC242-MCC-DM1 conjugate, however, showed more unfavorable in vivo efficacy in xenograft tumor models than the disulfide-linked huC242-SPDB-DM4 conjugate, even though the thioether-linked conjugate had improved stability with comparable in vitro efficacy as did the huC242-SPDB-DM4 conjugate (Tolcher et al., 2003;Kellogg et al., 2011). Therefore, the ultimately achieved therapeutic window of the ADC with non-cleavable linkers will likely be dependent on the biology of the target, the target cells, and the delivery of antibody for subsequent lysosomal degradation. Nonetheless, the expectation of potential enhancement of stability and tolerability for ADCs with non-cleavable linkers",

            "text": "Unique challenges exist when formulating an ADC compared to a naked mAb. As detailed earlier, sample complexity plays a major role in making formulation of a non-site-specific ADC exceptionally difficult due to the diverse array of post conjugation species. In addition, the drugs that are attached to ADCs and the linker by which the drug is attached also instill added complexity to formulate an ADC [65,66]. The drugs associated with ADCs often have less than desirable aqueous solubility characteristics themselves. These drugs have the propensity to cause inter-antibody aggregation through either exposure of protected aggregation-prone regions within the antibody backbone upon conjugation or through drug-drug mediated interactions [67][68][69]. This greatly limits longitudinal stability as well as high concentration formulation capabilities. The drugs that are conjugated to form ADCs are also not the same from ADC to ADC making generalizable formulation protocols difficult to establish [3,4]. \n\nThe means by which the drugs are attached to the antibody is also a unique hurdle that needs special attention when considering formulation of an ADC compared to a naked mAb. Linkers vary in chemical composition providing the ADC with differing cleavable capabilities. Cleavable linkers fall into two primary categories that allow for cleavage either enzymatic digestion or exposure to pH extremes [70][71][72][73][74][75][76]. There is an ever growing list of linker chemistries with distinctive capabilities that are being tested in diverse ADC applications [77]. These desirable delivery characteristics subsequently make the drug and linker susceptible to premature degradation and cleavage during storage which limits the potential formulation compositions considerably when compared to that of formulation of a naked mAb [75,78]. Depending upon the selected linker and the method of conjugation of the linker to the antibody, critical antibody characteristics that directly affect solubility, including surface charge and zeta-potential, can be negatively impacted. For these reasons, drug, linker composition and antibody target are all critical components specifically selected to address the unique demands of the intended therapeutic application and unfortunately result in significantly more complex formulation demands.",

Cleavable linkers rely on the physiological environment, such as there being high glutathione concentrations, low pH, and special protease, which could assist the linkers in enabling chemical or biochemical reactions by way of hydrolyzation or proteolysis [3,43]. Non-cleavable linkers despond on the monoclonal antibody degradation after ADCs' internalization within the lysosomes and endosomes to generate the metabolites containing the active cytotoxic drugs with or without a portion of the linkers. On account of different mechanism strategies, differences between the potential ADC metabolisms and the varying characteristics of cytotoxic drugs should be taken into consideration [44]. \n\nEach release strategy must account for many factors: the various activities of cytotoxic drugs, the characteristics of monoclonal antibodies, and the particular disease.

In comparison with cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers were found to have improved stability in the bloodstream allowing ADCs with such linkers to have longer half-lives and pose a reduced risk from side effects while retaining the activity of the cytotoxic drug [127]. This knowledge was reflected in the clinical development of T-DM1, originally designed to have a valine-citrulline dipeptide linker but was instead produced with a non-cleavable thioether linker [128]. Despite the successful use of non-cleavable linkers, it is important to note that their dependence on lysosomal degradation means they can only be used in ADCs targeting antigens that undergo efficient intracellular internalization.\n\nOnce an optimal linker for a particular ADC is chosen, it is important to determine the ideal number of drugs to be conjugated to a mAb [i.e., the drug-antibody ratio (DAR)]. Because of potential linker instability and poor ADC internalization, several drugs are required to be linked to each mAb to achieve adequate cytotoxicity. On the other hand, excessive drug conjugation might result in increased clearance and/or immunogenicity as the ADC is more likely to aggregate and be recognized as a damaged, malformed or foreign protein [129]. In a study conducted by Hamblett et al. [130], the in vivo efficacy of ADCs containing four drugs per antibody was found to be equivalent to that of ADCs with eight drugs per mAb. Heavily modified ADCs (i.e., those with eight conjugated drugs) were associated with increased . . toxicity and underwent faster clearance from the circulation. Additionally, it was found that ADCs containing only two drugs per mAb had a much wider therapeutic window and therefore a higher maximum tolerated dose. The study consequently concluded that ADCs loaded with 2-4 drugs per mAb achieved the best balance between slow clearance and maximal potency [130].\n\nA critical aspect of linker function is the presence or absence of a phenomenon known as the by",

            "text": "The conjugating linkers in ADCs are generally classified into cleavable and non-cleavable ones, which behave quite differently in a biological system, and produce distinct in vivo forms of released toxin. Specifically, cleavable linkers (e.g., valine-citrulline dipeptide, hydrazine, and disulfide bridge) could be sensitive to cancer cell-specific intracellular properties, such as expression of certain protease, pH, and glutathione, and thus carrying the potential to achieve selective release of payloads [3]. By comparison, non-cleavable linkers contain no specific release mechanism and rely on intracellular proteolytic degradation following ADC internalization [3]. From an analytical perspective, while ADCs with cleavable linkers release free payload in a biological system, those with non-cleavable linkers usually release active payload-linker-amino acid moieties that are produced after the complete degradation of ADCs [3]; consequently, different analytes should be targeted. \n\nDue to the high complexity of ADCs, analysis of these compounds is uniquely challenging, especially in a biological system. For instance, both the small-molecule payloads and the protein portion need to be analyzed. In addition, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) is an important parameter describing the number of payloads conjugated to the antibody since the DAR species could dynamically change in vivo, which brings additional challenges for bioanalysis. Compared to other traditional methods, liquid chromatographyemass spectrometry (LC-MS) has the unique capability in ADC analysis, since it can broadly analyze small molecules, intact proteins, digested proteins, as well as specific domain of proteins with the molecule-level resolution. Therefore, LC-MS represents a highly versatile and valuable tool and has played an indispensable role in ADC characterization, both quantitatively and qualitatively. \n\nIn the initial development stage, especially for linker and payload discovery, LC-MS is highly valuable in providing structureactivity relationship information [4]. LC-MS has also been widely employed in characterization of the physicochemical properties of ADCs, which have profound effects on the safety and efficacy profile [5].",

            "text": "The specificity, efficacy, and safety of an ADC are determined by the design, structure, and chemistry of the linker that connects the cytotoxic payload to the antibody. Linkers are typically designed to be constant in the blood system (enabling for a prolonged timeframe of bloodstream), but labile enough to efficiently deliver the cytotoxic payload to the tumour [51]. \n\nCleavable and non-cleavable linkers are the two types of linkers. Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Non-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability [53]. T-DM1 with mafodotin belantamab is one of two FDA-approved ADCs with non-cleavable linkers [18]. \n\nThe systemic stability of ADCs post administration is one of the crucial issues to ensure the efficacy of ADCs, and several strategic approaches are taken for overcoming this issue. ADCs should ideally remain stable or intact in the circulation before entering target cells, but there are cases where ADC catabolites are still biologically active [54,55]. ADC stability refers primarily to metabolic stability or integrity. To improve ADC stability, several approaches involving conjugation site selection and linker modification have been developed [54]. In general, modifications to each component (e.g., antibody, linker, and payload) can be performed for this purpose. The conjugation site, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are effective general approaches for site-specific ADCs and should be more broadly applicable to a variety of ADC platforms [54].",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are therapeutic modalities composed of a target-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) connected via a chemical linker to a small molecule drug (payload) that has cell-killing (cytotoxic) activity. 1 The production of these therapeutic modalities relies on the chemical conjugation of a linker-payload (LP) to a specific natural or unnatural amino acid on the antibody. 2 Depending on the conjugation chemistry and site of LP attachment, the molecular structure of the ADC could be very complex and heterogeneous. 3 urthermore, the linker chemistry can be \"cleavable\" or \"noncleavable\". ADCs with cleavable linkers rely on protease cleavage, 4 acid hydrolysis 5 or other mechanisms to release the unmodified payload as active species, whereas ADCs with noncleavable linkers 6 rely on the degradation of antibody to release the active species. Both the cleavability as well as the sites of conjugation have a substantial effect on the analytical strategy for ADC characterization. \n\nConventional conjugation chemistries typically involve cysteine or lysine residues. Cysteine conjugation is well established, [7][8] and usually the hinge-region cysteines that are used for the formation of interchain disulfide bonds are targeted for conjugation. There are four interchain disulfide bonds in the IgG1 molecule and, after partial reduction, conjugation can occur randomly at any of these cysteine residue pairs ranging from zero LP additions to a maximum drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. Typically, these hinge-region cysteine-conjugated ADCs have an even-number distribution of LP moieties with an average DAR of approximately 4. Even with missing interchain disulfide bonds, the molecule is held together by noncovalent bonds.",

            "text": "ADCs are composed of three integral components: a monoclonal antibody that selectively targets tumor antigens, a cytotoxic payload designed to disrupt DNA or tubulin within the targeted cancer cells, and a linker that covalently attaches the antibody to the payload. The efficacy of ADCs depends on the specificity and affinity of the antibody, the potency of the payload, and the stability of the linker in circulation, as well as its rapid release within the targeted cells (Figure 1). \n\nOver the years, various conjugation modalities and linker chemistries have been investigated to optimise ADC development. Early ADCs primarily relied on lysine-based or cysteine-based chemical conjugation methods, which resulted in heterogeneous products with variable drug-antibody ratios (DARs) (24,25). This heterogeneity often negatively impacted ADC efficacy and therapeutic windows, leading to failures in clinical trials. To overcome these issues, researchers have turned to alternative strategies, such as engineered cysteines, non-natural amino acids, and enzymatic conjugation using sortase or transglutaminase (26)(27)(28). These techniques enable the production of homogeneous ADCs with con trolled DARs that exhibit improve d pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes. Linker properties play a vital role in ADC stability, cytotoxicity, and pharmacokinetics. Traditionally, cleavable linkers have been used, which are designed to release payloads intracellularly in response to pH changes or the action of specific enzymes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers necessitate complete antibody degradation for payload release. Current research is focused on developing novel linkers that offer optimal stability, solubility, and release profiles, as well as site-specific conjugation methods (24,25). \n\nIn addition to linker design, the selection of appropriate target antigens and payloads is crucial to the potency of ADCs. An ideal target antigen is highly and uniformly expressed on tumor cells, but minimally expressed on healthy cells. However, antigen density does not always correlate well with ADC potency due to differences in internalisation rates.",

Two main types of linkers exist: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers, while cleavable linkers include chemically unstable and enzyme-sensitive linkers. Among them, chemically unstable linkers can undergo cleavage in the acidic environment of tumors to release drugs efficiently, but their stability in the blood circulation is relatively poor, which usually leads to premature drug delivery [73,81,82]. The emergence of enzyme-sensitive linkers has solved this problem by improving stability and delivery efficiency through specific cleavage using specific enzymes overexpressed in tumors [83,84]. Non-cleavable linkers release the drug by enzymatic complete degradation within the lysosome, which has the advantage of high stability and low off-target toxicity, but their low release efficiency and inability to produce a bystander effect need to be optimized by optimizing the payload structure to improve the efficacy [85].",

Effective linkers have to guarantee ADC stability in the bloodstream as well as to allow an efficient cleavage upon internalization into tumor cells. Linkers can be classified into cleavable and non-cleavable according to their chemical properties [2,6]. Non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds resistant to proteolytic degradation, so that cleavage occurs only after lysosome internalization and complete degradation of the antibody. These linkers have higher stability than cleavable ones, but can suffer from lower membrane permeability. Conversely, cleavage of cleavable linkers can depend on external pH (acid-labile linkers), specific lysosomal proteases (protease-cleavable linkers) or glutathione reduction (disulphide linkers) [2,[6][7][8]. All aspects of ADC pharmacology can be influenced by the specific design of the linker, as drug stability into circulation, tumor cell permeability, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR, i.e. the number of payload moleculas carried by each antibody), and extent of the bystander effect [2,7].",

            "text": "Almost neglected at the beginning of the ADC era, linker design has today become an independent chapter in the ADC pipeline, especially because, along with MAbs and cytotoxic drugs, the type of linker, its stability, site of conjugation, and the final drug/antibody ratio (DAR) are crucial parameters which affect ADC biophysical properties, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy. The junction between the antibody and the payload is generally a covalent bond or a chemical linker, while a fusion construct, including the MAb fragment and the effector joined by a peptide linker, can be devised in the case of an immunotoxin conjugate molecule; thus, expression of the entire polypeptide can be performed in a host. \n\nLinkers are classified into two categories: cleavable and uncleavable (Figure 3). They need to be stable in the circulation and must be cleaved, ideally, only inside the cells, thus preventing the drug payload from being shed before reaching the tumoral cell target. When the linker is unstable in the extracellular space, the free drug subsequently permeates the cell to reach its target. 22 This can be a useful mechanism to enhance on-target activity, but it can also be the cause of offtarget toxicity, which is absent with uncleavable linkers. 21 ncleavable linkers are cut by complete degradation of the MAb component in the lysosome, which leaves an active unit formed by the drug, the linker, and a lysine residue. 23,24 leavable linkers are selectively cleaved upon change of a biophysical property (eg, pH in the case of hydrazone linkers), 21 or when an appropriate protease is found. For example, lysosomal proteases (eg, cathepsin and plasmin) are present at elevated levels in certain tumor tissues. 25 hough established conjugation chemistries and linkers for antibody arming have already led to a significant improvement in therapeutic outcome, 26 a rapid evolution of both into a second generation is already under way.",

For both maleimide and disulfide cleavable linkers, the steric hindrance created by the proximity of the cleavage site is critical and can be introduced by chemical modifications to modulate stability of the conjugate. \n\nTogether, conjugation site, linker length, linkage/conjugation chemistry, cleavable/non-cleavable linkage and steric hindrance are the key parameters for consideration to optimize ADC stability. Undesired payload metabolism/release in circulation could lead to reduced efficacy and/or increased toxicity.",

Another interesting observation was different metabolite profiles for different linker types, with the cleavable linkers releasing cytotoxic drug, and the non-cleavable linkers releasing the drug attached to an amino acid: e.g., maytansinoid ADCs with the non-cleavable linker MCC-DM1 produced only lysine-MCC-DM1 whereas ADCs with cleavable linkers SPP-DM1 and SPDB-DM4 produced multiple metabolites including lysine-SPP-DM1, DM1, S-methyl-DM1, S-methyl-DM1-sulfoxide and S-methyl-DM1-sulfone (for mAb-SPP-DM1), and lysine-SPDB-DM4, DM4, S-methyl-DM4, S-methyl-DM4-  sulfoxide and S-methyl-DM4-sulfone (for mAB-SPDB-DM4) (35). Some these metabolites could also enhance anti-tumor activity via bystander killing mechanisms where the cytotoxic agent released in one cell diffuses to neighboring cells and exerts its effect (34,35).

Ideally, the linker should not interfere with the chemotherapeutic agent cytotoxicity, since the cytotoxic agent-linker by-product is what generates the innocent bystander effect. 16 In addition, the linker may serve to counteract resistance to the cytotoxic drug, since hydrophilic linkers generate metabolites that are not substrates for efflux or drug-expulsion active pumps, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). 17 wo main types of linkers are currently used in the development of ADCs: cleavable and non-cleavable. 17 leavable linkers are stable for as long as they are circulating and efficiently release the drug after the ADC is endocytosed by the tumor cell. Non-cleavable linkers remain bound to an amino acid of the antibody after its lysosomal degradation. This type of linker is unsuitable for inducing the innocent bystander effect, since the amino acid-linker-cytotoxic agent complex does not spread outside the tumor cell. 16 oth types of linkers take advantage of lysines or cysteines reactivity in the antibody to form covalent bonds. Conjugation to lysines is efficient, but it generates multiple antibody species with differences in the number of cytotoxic drug molecules and their localization. 18 In addition, since many reactive lysines are found in the C H 2 domain, conjugation increases ADC aggregation. 19 Conjugation to cysteines requires for them to be in their reduced form and, thus, if those that form interchain disulfide bridges are employed, linkers with two reactive groups must be used in order to allow the bridge to regenerate. This strategy allows better control of the number of molecules of the conjugated cytotoxic drug, but still, more than 100 ADC different species can be generated. 18 he diversity of species affects ADC's stability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 20",

In particular, linker design plays a critical role in modulating ADC stability in the systemic circulation and payload release efficiency in the tumors, which thus affects ADC pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy and toxicity profiles. Previously, we have investigated key linker parameters such as conjugation chemistry (e.g., maleimide vs. disulfide), linker length and linker steric hindrance and their impacts on PK and efficacy profiles. Herein, we discuss our perspectives on development of integrated strategies for linker design to achieve a balance between ADC stability and payload release efficiency for desired efficacy in antigen-expressing xenograft models. The strategies have been successfully applied to the design of site-specific THIOMABTM antibody-drug conjugates (TDCs) with different payloads. We also propose to conduct dose fractionation studies to gain guidance for optimal dosing regimens of ADCs in pre-clinical models.",

            "text": "Linkers are the most important and intricate part in the development of a successful ADC, since they form the link between the therapy and antibody. Their conjugation mechanism, stability, and chemistry are crucial in preventing unintended drug release into the bloodstream and in facilitating easy cleavage upon internalization into the cancer cell, allowing the payload to be released exclusively at the intended site. They are essential in figuring out the ADCs' pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and therapeutic window. The currently FDA-approved ADCs use two classes of linkers, which differ in the payload release mechanism: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers [24,56,57]. \n\nThe four most used cleavable linkers are \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers, Glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide linkers, cathepsin B-sensitive linkers, and hydrazone linkers. The previously described bystander effect, which impacts normal cells in the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells with no or low target expression, is more likely to occur with ADCs that utilize cleavable linkers [58,59]. Non-cleavable linkers, as opposed to cleavable linkers, have better plasma stability, less off-target toxicity, and resistance to proteolytic degradation, as they have non-reducible bonds with the amino acid residues of the antibody. Generally, non-cleavable linkers are formed by thioether or Maleimidocaproyl groups. Non-cleavable linkers that are attached to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody must have the antibody moiety completely broken down by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases to release the payload following ADC internalization [60,61]. A general basic structure is illustrated in Figure 2 [62]. \n\nThe four most used cleavable linkers are \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers, Glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide linkers, cathepsin B-sensitive linkers, and hydrazone linkers.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates are a promising class of antibody-based therapeutics that take advantage of antibody specificity and small molecule cytotoxicity. The combined approach can deliver cytotoxic agents more specifically to the target cells and minimize harmful side effects in anti-tumor treatments [1][2][3]. The cytotoxic drugs are typically linked to the antibody carrier through either cleavable or non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers contain a trigger that can release the cytotoxic agent after internalization and can utilize a change in pH, redox potential, or a proteolytic or other enzymatic event for linker processing [4,5]. Non-cleavable linkers, on the other hand, rely on the degradation of the antibody itself to release the drug-linker, typically with the amino acid residue it was conjugated to as the released species [4,6]. The choice of linker is one of the critical parameters of ADC design, and is usually experimentally determined for each target and cell type. Numerous examples of both linker types (cleavable and non-cleavable) are currently utilized in the clinic [7][8][9]. Regardless of its type, the ideal linker remains intact in systemic circulation, and releases the cytotoxic agent only after internalization in the target cell [9,10], either by the built-in trigger (cleavable linkers) or by degradation of the antibody (non-cleavable linkers). \n\nA number of non-cleavable linkers have been developed based on traditional conjugation methods using maleimide or N-hydroxysuccinimide ester coupling chemistry. The maleimide chemistry, although more specific due to lower number of potential target sites on the antibody, has been reported to uncouple in circulation, resulting in decreased exposure of the ADC relative to the total antibody [11][12][13]. Recently, several ways of reducing maleimide-based decoupling have been reported [12,14,15], overcoming a hurdle to future clinical development of those linkers.",

Their results showed that agents with a high DAR (average 10, range 7-14) using both linker formats had faster distribution and clearance rates and decreased efficacy in vivo (Figure 4) [79,83]. On the other hand, ADCs with a DAR less than 6 displayed similar clearances, superior in vivo efficacy, and were well tolerated [79,83]. Hambelet et al. demonstrated similar conclusions in a study evaluating MMAE conjugated to a CD30 antibody using a MC-vc-PAB linker [78]. When DARs were manipulated to increase the cytotoxic payload with either 2, 4, or 8 drugs per antibody, the clearance increased [78]. These results may be related to the difference in the rate of uptake of these agents by the MPS and other non-target cells. \n\nAdditionally, the site of conjugation can play a role in augmenting the pharmacology of an ADC. Strop et al. created an ADC with an average DAR ~1.7, but directed conjugation using a novel enzymatic conjugation to precise points on the antibody backbone to create homogenous solutions [84]. Their study reported how the site of conjugation affected linker stability in a species-dependent manner, where conjugation on the light chain appears to be cleaved more quickly compared to heavy chain conjugation in mice, but stable in rats [84]. Additionally, heavy chain conjugation demonstrated dramatically different PK and faster rate of drug loss, compared to either light chain conjugated ADCs or naked mAbs in rats [84]. The uses of such technologies can allow for increased studies of the role of the linker, linker position, and cytotoxic payload to optimize the pharmacology and improve the therapeutic index of these agents.",

Choosing the preferred crosslinker is crucial not only to provide stability for the ADC but also to assure optimal release of the payload at the desired location [33]. Both the type of crosslinker and the location of conjugation can affect the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and clinical tolerance of the ADC. The mechanism for drug release is also dependent on the type of linker, be it cleavable or non-cleavable (Figure 4). Examples of cleavable crosslinkers include: acid-sensitive linkers, glutathione-sensitive linkers, lysosomal protease-sensitive linkers, and \u03b2-glucuronide linkers [46]. \n\nA non-cleavable crosslinker is said to offer greater plasma stability because of its nonreducible amino acid linker and thioether bond, which reduces non-specific drug release compared to ADCs with cleavable linkers [47]. With a non-cleavable ADC, the drug is dissociated from the antibody after internalization and lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody [33,48]. The first generation of FDA-approved ADCs employed an acidcleavable hydrazone linker, which makes use of the lower pH of endosomal and lysosomal compartments. The linker is stable in blood at neutral pH; once the ADC is internalized into acidic endosomes and lysosomes (pH = 4-6), the linker is cleaved. The release of the drug after 24 h at 37 \u2022 C is 97% at pH = 4.5, whereas only 6% was freed at pH = 7.4 [49]. The pHsensitive linkers include hydrazone linkers, disulfide linkers, and the CL2A linker. Disulfide linkers are cleavable by both pH and glutathione [50].",

For maximum clinical efficacy, they should be chosen in conjunction with the payload and antibody [32]. The point at which the payload is offloaded is determined by the linker design (deconjugated). The selection of coupling chemistry and linker has an impact on the DAR of an ADC. Cleavable linkers comprise motifs that are susceptible to enzymatic cleavage by proteases, hydrolysis at acidic pH, or redox processes taking place in lysosomes or early or late endosomes. Lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody backbone is required for non-cleavable linkers to liberate the payload, as is the case with succinimidyl 4-N-maleimidocaproyl, which is utilized in T-DM1 (ado-trastuzumab emtansine). The electric charge and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the payload may thus be influenced by linkers [33]. This has two consequences, one of which is to impair the capacity of the payload to diffuse across membranes, thereby avoiding or inducing a bystander effect on adjacent cells that do not express the antigen. As a result, intracellular concentrations of the payload may be altered, and primary or acquired drug resistance may develop. While existing linkers in clinical trials are specifically engineered to facilitate the internalization of ADCs, efforts are underway to develop new linkers that are designed to target ADCs that do not require internalization [34].",

            "text": "The efficient internalization by CSCs and low immunogenicity of the ADC are important factors in the selection process [106,107]. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ADC is affected by the choice of linker that connects the antibody to the drug molecule. The linker should stabilize the ADC in circulation but provide a mechanism for the release of the payload when the ADC reaches the tumor site. Linkers are divided into non-cleavable and cleavable linkers [108]. Non-cleavable linkers form stable bonds with antibodies and have a longer half-life in circulation. Further, after internalization, non-cleavable linkers should degrade in the lysozyme to release the drug molecule inside the targeted tumor cell. The stability of cleavable linkers depends on the physiological conditions in the tumor tissue and the expression of enzymes for cleavage of the linker to release the drug in the tumor site. The tumor toxicity of the ADC depends on the choice of payload (drug molecule) attached to the antibody. Conventional cancer drugs, such as DOX or mitomycin, have been used with ADCs. In general, the payload in ADCs is engineered to target either DNA or tubulin to interfere with cell division and proliferation. The conjugation chemistry affects the drug pharmacokinetics and therapeutic index of ADC. The conjugation of the payload largely occurs through the linker via the alkylation or acetylation of lysine side chains in the backbone of the antibody [106]. ADCs possess a higher tumor selectivity and cytotoxicity, compared to other targeted delivery approaches [103]. In a recent study, natural phospholipids were mixed with PTX and SLM conjugated to monoclonal antibody 2C5 to form PTX/SLM-ADC immunoliposomes for targeted delivery to bulk tumor cells and CSCs in TNBC. The in vitro studies with MDA-MB-231 TNBCs and HER2-positive SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells showed a specific uptake of PTX-ADC and SLM-ADC by bulk tumor cells and CSCs, respectively [109].",

This new antibody-based molecular platform enables selective delivery of a potent cytotoxic payload to target cancer cells, resulting in improved efficacy, reduced systemic toxicity, and preferable pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) and biodistribution compared to traditional chemotherapy. Boosted by the successes of FDA-approved Adcetris\u00ae and Kadcyla\u00ae, this drug class has been rapidly growing along with about 60 ADCs currently in clinical trials. In this article, we briefly review molecular aspects of each component (the antibody, payload, and linker) of ADCs, and then mainly discuss traditional and new technologies of the conjugation and linker chemistries for successful construction of clinically effective ADCs. Current efforts in the conjugation and linker chemistries will provide greater insights into molecular design and strategies for clinically effective ADCs from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints. The development of site-specific conjugation methodologies for constructing homogeneous ADCs is an especially promising path to improving ADC design, which will open the way for novel cancer therapeutics.",

Key advantages of non-cleavable linkers over their cleavable competitors are that non-cleavable linkers grant ADCs longer plasma half-lives, reduced off-target toxicity and-frequently-wider therapeutic windows [39]. Common types of non-cleavable linkers used in ADCs are those based on a maleimide-type structure such as the maleimidocaproyl (MC, found in AbbVie's depatuxizumab mafodotin [49]) and 4-maleimidomethyl cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (MCC, found in Kadcyla \u00ae [49]) linkers (Figure 3) [42]. The MC linker in particular has seen varied use, employed both alone as part of a non-cleavable ADC (e.g., AbbVie's depatuxizumab mafodotin [49]) or as a spacer unit separating a mAb and cleavable dipeptide linker sequence (e.g., Adcetris \u00ae [49]), and all marketed ADCs containing monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) or monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) warheads use this linker [42]. \n\nases, such as cathepsin B, which are overexpressed in several cancer cell types [45].

Non-cleavable linkers rely on complete degradation of the antibody component of ADC by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases, which eventually liberates a payload molecule linked to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody (Fig. 8). As such, when coupled with a non-cleavable linker, the payload structure must be carefully selected and designed so that payload can exert comparable or even better anti-tumor potency in such a modified form. For that purpose, it may be necessary to examine PK/PD and toxicity profiles of all possible metabolites of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers. A successful example of ADCs using a non-cleavable linker is the humanized anti-HER2 antibody-maytansine conjugate trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, or Kadcyla \u00ae ) (LoRusso et al., 2011;Verma et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates are targeted agents that link a cytotoxic drug (also known as payload) to a monoclonal antibody. The antibody recognizes an antigen on the tumor and releases the cytotoxic drug into the cell, thereby reducing toxicity and improving efficacy [20]. The cytotoxic drug and the antibody are joined by a connector (linker). The linker is a critical component in the structure of ADCs; there are two types, \"cleavable\" and \"non-cleavable\". Linkers have to remain stable in circulation and be easily cleavable in the intracellular space to deliver the payload. \"Cleavable\" linkers release the drug by hydrolysis or proteolysis. \"Non-cleavable\" linkers depend on degradation of the antibody to release their cytotoxic payload. The average number of drugs conjugated per antibody is known as the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), and is an important feature of ADCs since it is relevant for potential efficacy and toxicity [21]. \n\nThe ADC-antigen complex is usually taken up by endocytosis or pinocytosis after binding to its target. An early endosome is created as a result of internalization by budding inward from the cell membrane. Before binding to lysosomes, early endosomes become late endosomes [21]. Cleavage processes of ADCs with cleavable linkers, such as hydrolysis, proteolytic cleavage or reductive cleavage, take place in early or late endosomes, but ADCs with non-cleavable linkers need sophisticated proteolytic cleavage by cathepsin B and plasmin in lysosomes. The cytotoxic payload is discharged from lysosomes to the cytoplasm after cleavage. Cytotoxic payloads target DNA and cause single-or doublestrand DNA breaks, or interfere with microtubules, leading to cell apoptosis [22].",

Cleavable linkers are used in combination with payloads being only fully active after lysosomal degradation (e.g., MMAE or calicheamicin) [38]. To prevent the cleavage of the linker in blood circulation resulting in unspecific cytotoxicity, the ADC linker has to be stable until the ADC reaches its target cell. To this end, cleavable linkers are usually sensitive to conditions specifically found in lysosomes (e.g., acidic condition or lysosomic proteases (cathepsin B, glycosidase, phosphatase)) or high intracellular glutathione concentrations [38] and thereby release the payload only after endocytosis is achieved, leading to death of the target cell [38] (Figure 2). \n\nRegarding non-cleavable linkers, the drug is active after internalization and enzymatic digestion of the antibody into the lysosome, allowing the release of an active metabolite, amino acid-linker-drug complex (e.g., trastuzumab emtansine) [7]. Non-cleavable linkers allow increased ADC stability, leading to reduced toxicity in non-target tissues [7]. Payloads such as MMAF or DM1 are classically used in this setting.",

If the payloads are released systemically prematurely, the efficacy of the remaining circulating ADCs may be reduced, leading to off-target toxicity. Tandem cleavable linkers are novel linkers that incorporate a \u03b2-glucuronide moiety and require tandem enzymic cleavage events (47). These linkers reduce payloads release during circulation and off-target toxicity. \n\nSilencing the Fc portion of the ADCs. Whereas the Fc domain of the antibody induces immunogenicity, the internalisation of ADCs into non-targeted cells via Fc\u03b3 receptors on immune cells may provoke off-target toxicities. By silencing the Fc domain, Fc-mediated offtarget cytotoxicity was reduced (48). \n\nNovel site specific conjugation technologies. Conventional antibody conjugates have been constructed through cysteine or lysine residue side chains. These approaches were stochastic, non-specific conjugation and generated heterogenous ADCs. To overcome the drawback of non-specific conjugation, intense research to realise site specific conjugation has been conducted. Chemo-enzymatic methods include transglutaminase and glycan-mediated conjugation, and chemical methods include selective reduction of disulfides and N-terminal amine modifications (49).",

A linker must be stable enough in systemic circulation and be able to rapidly and efficiently release the cytotoxic agent upon internalization of the ADC within cancer cells [50]. According to the drug release mechanism, linkers for ADCs are generally categorized into cleavable linkers (acid-labile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers (Table 1) [51]. The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, proteasecleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers. Acid-cleavable linkers such as hydrazine linkers are designed to be stable at a neutral pH of circulation but can be hydrolyzed in lysosomes with a low pH Enzyme-labile \u00df-Glucuronide linker Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, protease-cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers. Acid-cleavable linkers such as hydrazine linkers are designed to be stable at a neutral pH of circulation but can be hydrolyzed in lysosomes with a low pH environment. Mylotarg, for example, was generated by conjugating calicheamicin with mAb against the CD33 antigen through an acid-cleavable hydrazine linker [52]. Protease-cleavable linkers are also used to keep ADCs intact in systemic circulation and allow easy release of the cytotoxic drugs from ADCs by lysosomal enzymes within cancer cells.",

            "text": "The used linkers should comply with two requirements: to have sufficient stability to allow prevent premature cleavage in the bloodstream and to be rapidly cleaved after ADC internalization to release the antineoplastic [63][64][65]. There are two different categories based on the release mechanism of the antineoplastic: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. The release mechanism of cleavable linkers is based on several characteristics of the physiological environment: (i) low pH values of the intracellular compartment compared to the neutral pH of the extracellular compartment (acid-labile linkers), (ii) the presence of proteases that release the drug at the area of junction (proteasecleavable linkers) and (iii) the high glutathione concentrations that reduce disulphide bridges (disulphide-linkers) [66]. On the contrary, for non-cleavable linkers, there is no inbuilt chemical trigger to break the linker and release the cytotoxic payload. After ADC internalization in the target cells, the monoclonal antibody is metabolized by the lysosomal proteolytic machinery into aminoacids, triggering the release of the antineoplastic bound to the linker and the amino acid appendages [67] (Figure 3). It should be considered that the ADCs developed using non-cleavable linkers are more stable. Moreover, this release mechanism prevents a premature drug release, reducing systemic toxicity [68]. Nevertheless, it is required and efficient internalization and lysosomal trafficking. This release mechanism could also affect the drug effect, specially comparing with the use of cleavable linkers. In fact, the most used linkers in ADCs are cleavable linkers: acidcleavable linkers, protease-cleavable linkers (specially cathepsin cleavable-linkers), and disulfide-containing-reducible linkers [69]. \n\nThe selection of the linker depends on the antineoplastic payload, the monoclonal antibody, and the antigen target.",

            "text": "Linkers are short bridges that bind the drug to the antibody covalently. The stability of linkers is a significant challenge faced in ADC use. In blood circulation, a stable linker will keep the drug tightly intact to the antibody and perform intercellular cleavage after reaching the targeted cell. Linker acts as a critical parameter in ADC designation as it influences the safety and efficacy of the drug in patients. An unstable linkage will degrade and release the drug before reaching the targeted cell, leading to off-target cytotoxicity. Thus, an ADC's safety and efficacy will significantly reduce with an unstable linkage. The two main types of linkers include cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Although non-cleavable linkage performs better than the cleavable, the most suitable linkage for each ADC will be selected mainly based on its stability with the functional group of ADC and environment [149]. \n\nTo exert their cytotoxic effects, Ado-trastuzumab emtansine, an ADC drug with a noncleavable linker such as thioether, must be internalised by the target cell for the antibody and degraded before drug release. But since this type of ADC often comprises a potent tubulinbinding maytansine derivative which is DM1, the cleaved drug product would not reach neighbouring cells to exhibit bystander killing activity due to the low drug penetration (positively charged drug). As a result, non-cleavable ADCs are indeed efficacious against target antigen-expressing cells after internalisation and are favourable to malignancies with high and homogeneous antigen expression [145]. Despite the unpredictable translational consequences from pre-clinical to clinical trials, obtaining the most optimal dose would lead to a more precise therapeutic index assumption. It is recommended to use integrated linker design approaches to attain the highest intratumoural payload PK profiles by driving above the threshold dose [151].",

This is achieved through the disruption of the chemical linkage between the antibody and the toxic payload. Thus, the choice of the linker used may have an impact on ADC efficacy and several different types have been synthesized. Acid-labile hydrazone linkers are designed to be stable within the neutral pH extracellular environment, but become cleaved within the low pH environment of intracellular endosome and lysosome compartments. 60 Peptide linkers, such as citruline-valine, are designed to be selectively cleaved by lysosomal proteases (e.g., cathepsin or plasmin). 61 Another linker that has been developed is disulfidebased which is selectively cleaved in the reductive environment of the cell cytosol. 61 Non-cleavable linkers, such as thioether or amide bonds, have been utilized more recently and are intended to retain stability throughout the plasma and most of the intracellular space. Thus, when using a non-cleavable linker, liberation of the payload relies on the degradation of the antibody within the lysosome, however it is important to note that thioether linkers can be less stable in the plasma due to thiol exchange reactions. 62 DCs with cleavable disulfide linkers, such as the disulfide linker N-succinimydyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)-pentanoate (SPP), can form lipophilic drug metabolites within the lysosome which possess the ability to exit the target cell and re-enter neighboring cells which may lead to improved efficacy through bystander killing of neighboring tumor cells, but can also cause off-target toxicity. 60,63",

Due to the limited bioavailability of ADCs-only approximately 2% reach the target tumor site following intravesical administration-the payload compounds must possess high toxicity, typically with IC50 values in the nM to pM range [18]. The efficacy of an ADC in delivering cytotoxic agents depends on three primary factors: the number of target cell surface antigens available for antibody binding, the internalization efficiency of the antigen-antibody complex, and the release of active cytotoxic agents from the intracellular antigen-antibody complex. Currently, ADC payloads exert their therapeutic effects primarily by disrupting microtubule polymerization and inducing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage [31]. This approach emphasizes the targeted and precise mechanism of ADCs in eliminating cancer cells. \n\nLinkers. Cytotoxic payloads in ADCs are conjugated to the antibody via a linker, which must remain stable in vivo to ensure ADC integrity until it reaches the tumor cell. However, this linkage should be easily cleaved upon internalization. Maintaining ADC stability during circulation is essential to prevent premature payload release due to linker degradation, which could cause damage to healthy tissues. Simultaneously, ADCs must be capable of efficiently releasing their cytotoxic payloads once internalized by the target cells. Linkers are classified as cleavable or non-cleavable. Non-cleavable linkers include two main categories: thioether and maleimidocaproyl [32]. Cleavable linkers are further divided into three types: acid-cleavable, reducible disulfides, and those cleaved by exogenous stimuli [33]. Within the cleavable category, linkers can be potential of pH-sensitive, protease-sensitive, or glutathione-sensitive, based on their specific characteristics [34,35]. Cleavable linkers are designed to break down in response to the distinct conditions of the tumor microenvironment, promoting the release of small molecule payloads.",

            "text": "The biological molecules known as linkers used in ADCs are for the linkage between the antibody and the warhead. Effective linkers must ensure ADC stability in the circulation as well as efficient cleavage upon internalization by the tumor cells. Since premature drug release into the blood might increase in systemic toxicity with consequent reduced therapeutic index, effective linker design must achieve an equilibrium between the necessity for long-term stability in the circulation and effective cleavage upon internalization into the target cell (59,60). There has been significant progress in linker technology since the beginning of ADC research, which has contributed enormously to the clinical achievements of ADC formulations until now (60). For linkers, there are both noncleavable and cleavable linkers that ensure the requirements of ADC design mentioned above. Non-cleavable linkers are made up of stable bonds e.g., non-reducible thioether linkage (SMCC), maleimidocaproyl linkage etc. that can withstand the proteolytic degradation inside the cytosol and release of cytotoxic payloads only occurs after antigen-specific internalization of the conjugate and full breakdown of mAb by lysosomal proteolytic degradation (12,14,20). Thus, the resultant release of the cytotoxic drugs is linked to the antibody's linker and an amino acid residue, which specifically kills tumor cells and doesn't release at non-target locations to cause any damage to healthy cells. Additionally, the non-cleavable linkers have provision to modify the chemical characteristics of small molecules to enhance the affinity of the transporter and increase its effectiveness. Although they have lesser membrane permeability, these linkers are more stable than cleavable ones and increase the therapeutic window by minimizing the off-target toxicities. Examples of non-cleavable linkers include thioether linkers (used in T-DM1) and maleimidebased linkers (used in belantamab mafodotin) (61).",

To demonstrate the effect of linker instability of ADC on toxicity, she presented the case study from Polson et al. 15 In this case, anti-CD22 antibody was conjugated to DM1 using linkers with various stabilities, and it was shown that: (1) un-cleavable linkers resulted in slower deconjugation and drug release in the systemic circulation, (2) cleavable linkers resulted in higher magnitude of weight loss in rats compared with non-cleavable linkers, and (3) more stable linkers resulted in reduced systemic toxicity of ADCs in rats as monitored by changes in AST, ALT, WBC, platelet, and neutrophil levels. As a case study to demonstrate the effect of ADC catabolism on ADC toxicity, Dr Schutten presented results showing increase in toxicity of trastuzumab-mc-vc-PAB-MMAF ADC by increasing the DAR. She also presented data from Junutula et al. 16 comparing THIOMAB-drug conjugates (TDC) with ADC, where it was shown that TDC resulted in slower catabolism of antibody compared with ADC, resulting in better toxicity profile for TDC conjugate. \n\nTo explain the unwanted ADC-mediated cytotoxicity, Dr Schutten first focused on the toxicity resulting from targeted binding of ADC to normal tissues expressing antigen. She presented a case study with the ADC-targeting leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), which is a marker for colon stem cells and postulated marker for colon cancer stem cells. It was observed that the LGR5-targeting ADC resulted in an on-target (intestinal stem cell-targeted) toxicity, leading to blunted or fused villi. She also presented data from CD22-targeting ADCs, where target-dependent depletion of replicating B cells by anti-CD22-vcMMAE ADC was observed in the monkeys.",

            "text": "Linkers are grouped into two classes (Table IV). They are either cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers can be dipeptide linkers, such as valine-citrulline, and are cleaved by proteases (i.e. Cathepsin B), which results in the release of the cytotoxic drug. Cleavable linkers can also be acid labile, such as hydrazones and hindered disulfides, where the lysosomal environment results in the release of the cytotoxic drug. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are degraded in the lysosome, which results in the formation of an amino acid-drug combination (i.e. Cys-mcMMAF). Although the linkers can be processed by the enzymes or environment of the lysosome, some linkers such as maleimide linkers, can transfer the cytotoxic drug to free sulfhydryls such as the cysteine on human serum albumin (HSA) or glutathione via a retro-michael reaction (54,55). This can cause a 25% or greater decrease in the tumor exposure of the ADC (54). This decrease in tumor exposure may reduce the effectiveness of the ADC. \n\nThe linker/drug combination can influence the pharmacokinetics and the toxicology profile of the ADC. A humanized antibody (huC242) against CanAg/MUC1 was conjugated to the SPP-DM1 and SPDB-DM4 linker/drug combinations and evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies (Table V). The serum half-life in humans for the huC242-SPP-DM1 (Cantuzumab Mertansine), using a Q3W dosing schedule, ranged between 18 and 48.5 hrs while the serum half-life for huC242-SPDB-DM4 (IMGN242) was between 60 and 120 hrs (56). In addition to the apparent differences in the half-lives of the ADCs, the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were also different.",

            "text": "Linkers are grouped into two classes (Table IV). They are either cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers can be dipeptide linkers, such as valine-citrulline, and are cleaved by proteases (i.e. Cathepsin B), which results in the release of the cytotoxic drug. Cleavable linkers can also be acid labile, such as hydrazones and hindered disulfides, where the lysosomal environment results in the release of the cytotoxic drug. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are degraded in the lysosome, which results in the formation of an amino acid-drug combination (i.e. Cys-mcMMAF). Although the linkers can be processed by the enzymes or environment of the lysosome, some linkers such as maleimide linkers, can transfer the cytotoxic drug to free sulfhydryls such as the cysteine on human serum albumin (HSA) or glutathione via a retro-michael reaction (54,55). This can cause a 25% or greater decrease in the tumor exposure of the ADC (54). This decrease in tumor exposure may reduce the effectiveness of the ADC. \n\nThe linker/drug combination can influence the pharmacokinetics and the toxicology profile of the ADC. A humanized antibody (huC242) against CanAg/MUC1 was conjugated to the SPP-DM1 and SPDB-DM4 linker/drug combinations and evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies (Table V). The serum half-life in humans for the huC242-SPP-DM1 (Cantuzumab Mertansine), using a Q3W dosing schedule, ranged between 18 and 48.5 hrs while the serum half-life for huC242-SPDB-DM4 (IMGN242) was between 60 and 120 hrs (56). In addition to the apparent differences in the half-lives of the ADCs, the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were also different.",

            "text": "The chemical linker in ADC conjoins cytotoxic payload to the antibody, stabilising the circulating ADC in the bloodstream upon administration. The functional group of linkers and the conjugation site determine the performance of ADCs in terms of circulating half-life, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profiles, and therapeutic window [14]. Disulfide, thioether, and hydrazone functional groups combine antibodies to the cytotoxic agent through intermolecular interactions. Currently, available linkers based on mechanisms of payload release are classified as cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers depend on the physiological environment in the systemic circulation, such as pH or proteases available to release cytotoxic payload from the carrier. For example, the acid-labile linker in Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin is cleaved under low pH conditions. In contrast, protease cleavable linker in Brentuximab Vedotin is cleaved by proteases such as Cathepsin-B and plasmin. The cleavage of disulfide linkers in mirvetuximab soravtansine depends on high glutathione concentrations [15]. Non-cleavable linkers form non-reducible covalent bonds with amino acids on the antibodies. Unlike cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are not affected by the physiological environment and are more stable in blood circulation [16]. In addition, these linkers depend on complete lysosomal degradation of the mAb for payload release, which necessitates an efficient internalisation process and optimal trafficking to lysosomes-for instance, thioether linker in T-DM1 [2]. This may be an advantage since it could lead to a lower risk of systemic toxicity. One of the popular non-cleavable linkers is the polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker due to its excellent water solubility, lack of toxicity and low immunogenicity.",

Cleavable linkers release the drug from MAb by hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage where as non-cleavable linkers release drug by MAb degradation after internalization. Cleavable linkers are sub characterized into peptide (amide) linkers, hydrazone linkers, and disulphide linkers. Peptide linkers are usually accommodated with protease cleavage sites and are sensitive to proteases in the host cells. A valine-citrullinepeptide linker with protease cathepsin D cleavage site is one successful example used in clinically approved brentuximab vedotin ADC for treatment of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) [20]. \n\nHydrazone linkers are susceptible to acidic pH conditions in endosomes and lysosomes, and release the drug by hydrolysis. Disulphide linkers are susceptible to reductive environment in the tumor cells due to high levels of glutathione produced in tumor cells [21]. Non-cleavable linkers release drug after ADC complex degradation post internalization. The antibody portion of ADC gets degraded in lysosomal and endosomal compartments releasing a linker bound drug molecules [22]. It is considered that non-cleavable linkers contribute to high stability in blood stream, longer half-life, and reduced toxicity to ADCs [23,24]. In contrast to cytotoxic drugs that require chemical conjugation to antibodies, antibody cytokine conjugates can be developed as fusion proteins.",

            "text": "Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy. These linkers also tend to inhibit bystander effects, because the released catabolites have poor cellular permeability. Consequently, identifying alternatives to improve drug release and enhance therapeutic outcomes has become a major focus of ongoing research. \n\nCurrently, 73.3% (11/15) of approved ADCs and 75.0% (18/24) of phase III ADCs employ cleavable linkers, with peptide linkers being the most common subtype. These account for 46.7% (7/15) of approved ADCs and 58.3% (14/24) of those in phase III. In comparison to chemically cleavable linkers, enzyme-cleavable linkers exploit abundant intracellular hydrolases to facilitate controlled drug release. This enzymatic mechanism ensures greater stability in plasma, making enzyme-cleavable linker more competitive for future ADC development. To enhance linker solubility and mitigate polymerization, polar groups such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be incorporated into the linker structure. This strategy has been employed in the marketed ADCs loncastuximab tesirine and sacituzumab govitecan, as well as in phase III clinical candidates such as trastuzumab duocarmazine, ARX-788, and DP-303c. Additionally, designing linkers with multiple attachment sites for payloads enhances the number and diversity of the conjugated drugs, which not only improves therapeutic efficacy but also reduces the potential for resistance.",

Since Mylotarg's first approval, 15 ADcs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of both solid and hematological cancers (table 1, Sasso et al. 2023)-including Mylotarg which returned to the market in 2017 with a lower suggested dose and a revised dosing schedule-and over 100 ADcs are currently in clinical trials, with more than 200 ADcs in preclinical development. \n\nwhat we have learned over two decades of research, is that each component of an ADc (the antibody, linker, and payload) confers pharmacokinetics and biodistribution properties that provide more on-target activity, but also a concomitant exposure to the rest of the body that results in off-target toxicities (colombo and Rich 2022; Sasso et al. 2023). to expand the therapeutic window, much research has been devoted to the development of cleavable and non-cleavable linkers that improve the stability, hydrophobicity, and specific release of the cytotoxic payloads. ideally, linkers are stable in circulation and release payload in cancer cells. to achieve this dual functionality, linkers with diverse release triggers have been developed including pH sensitive linkers, enzyme cleavable linkers (i.e. specifically cleaved by cathepsins, glycosidases, or sulfatases), and photo-sensitive linkers. the unique properties of these linkers convey functionality to ADcs, but an in-depth analysis of these is beyond the scope of this review (Su et al. 2021). in addition, a collection of different cytotoxins with various mechanisms of action and potencies have been used to reduce off-target effects (Beck et al. 2017). A critical consideration when designing an ADc is how protein engineering and the chemistry of conjugation can determine the individual components of the conjugate, and consequently, affect its overall stability, PK, efficacy, and safety. Here we discuss advances in protein engineering strategies and emerging technologies that are being developed to improve the functional properties of ADcs.",

            "text": "Diverse ADC properties are also impacted by linker chemistry, including specificity, stability, potency, and toxicity [21]. Depending on the methods of releasing the payload in cells, there are two types of linkers, including cleavable and non-cleavable [22]. The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity [23]. Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level [24]. The enzyme sensitive linkers are sensitive to the lysosomal protease that is generally overexpressed in cancer cells, enabling an accurate drug release in the cells after internalization [25]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability [26,27], and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]. For instance, Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has a cleavable enzymatic linker as opposed to trastuzuma",

            "text": "Linkers that connect payloads to antibodies are another critical feature of ADCs [6,15,17,18,31]. They must be stable in circulation and able to release the drugs in active form in the targeted location. The intrinsic features of the linkers and the payloads determine the physicochemical properties of ADC metabolites in nearby cells. As a result, the linkers induce a \"bystander effect\" to kill neighboring cells [6,15,17,18,31]. They can be classified into non-cleavable (like the one in trastuzumab emtansine) and cleavable (like the one in brentuximab vedotin). Non-cleavable linkers remain attached to the drugs after proteolytic degradation of the antibody in lysosome, which with linkers and an amino acid or short peptide are released into the cytosol to exert their activities [162]. The most common example of a non-cleavable linker is the thioether linker. For cleavable linkers, they exploit the differences between bloodstream and cytoplasm of targeted tissues. They can be cleaved by certain specific proteases found in lysosomes, or by low pH (acidic environment), or by a reducing environment (high glutathione concentrations in cytoplasm) to release free drugs [163]. Peptide linkers, hydrazone, and disulfide are a typical type of cleavable linkers. \n\nConjugation strategy is another important aspect for ADCs. Linker-payload moieties are typically conjugated to antibodies via lysine or cysteine residues. Ideally, the conjugation process should maintain the integrity of antibodies and the activity of drugs, as well as produce homogeneous batches that remain stable during the storage and lyophilization process [17]. Because the IgG scaffold has over 80 lysine residues, about 20 of which are highly solvent-accessible [164], the conjugation process results in highly heterogenous mixtures.",

            "text": "First, Dr. Zacholski introduced the landscape of ADCs in the United States and the pharmacology of ADCs. Currently, there are 13 FDAapproved ADCs: six ADCs are approved for solid tumor cancers, and seven are approved for hematologic malignancies (Table 2). ADCs have been on the US market for over a decade with the first antibody-drug conjugate, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, receiving FDA approval for acute myeloid leukemia in 2000; however, the majority of ADCs have been approved within the last five years. ADCs are comprised of three components (Fig. 1) which are integral to the overall efficacy and safety of the drug. The first component is a monoclonal antibody that is highly selective for a tumor-associated antigen that has low to no expression on other tissues. The second component is the drug conjugate also known as the payload, which is typically a conventional chemotherapy agent that causes cell death after cell internalization and payload release. Commonly used drug conjugates include anti-microtubule inhibitors, topoisomerase inhibitors, and DNA intercalating agents. These are extremely potent compounds that cannot be safely given outside of the ADC system. The last component is the linker, which attaches the monoclonal antibody and the drug conjugate together. The linker maintains the stability of the drug conjugate to the monoclonal antibody in the systemic circulation but it can efficiently release the payload within the target cell. Off-target, off-tumor effects or toxicities may occur as a result of linker degradation or instability in systemic circulation. Linkers can be cleavable or non-cleavable, which relates to the release mechanism. Cleavable linkers release their conjugate in a physiologically optimal environment such as low pH or high glutathione concentrations. Non-cleavable linkers form bonds with amino acid residues on monoclonal antibodies, and as a result, are more stable in the bloodstream. Non-cleavable linkers depend on lysosomal degradation of the monoclonal antibody in lysosomes.",

By contrast, only the ADCs targeted to CD79b and CD22 were effective with the uncleavable linker MCC-DM1 conjugates (blue lines, Figs. 1D and 2B).\n\nIn light of the relative specificity for the MCC-DM1 ADCs observed for CD22 and CD79, we decided to further explore these two antigens as targets. We tested anti-CD22 and anti-CD79b MC-vc-PAB-MMAE and MC-MMAF conjugates in relevant xenograft   (Fig. 4).\n\nCD79b and CD22 are expressed only in the B-cell compartment and are both expressed on the surface of most NHL cells (21,23). Furthermore, ADCs targeted against CD22 or CD79b worked with all linker-drug combinations tested, suggesting that these two antigens are particularly robust and attractive targets.\n\nADCs with uncleavable linkers exhibit reduced toxicity in rats when compared with cleavable linkers. ADCs with uncleavable linkers might be expected to be better tolerated than ADCs with cleavable linkers, as they should release less drug into systemic circulation, reducing the risk of toxicity (7,8). However, this may not necessarily be the case, as even uncleavable linker ADCs are metabolized and may result in bioconcentration of the cytotoxin or its metabolites. We therefore evaluated the toxicity of ADCs with uncleavable and cleavable linker-drug combinations in rats. We used anti-CD22 conjugated to the maytansinoids, SPP-DM1 (cleavable) and MCC-DM1 (uncleavable); and the auristatins, MC-vc-PAB-MMAE (cleavable) and MC-MMAF (uncleavable), as these linker-drug combinations are already in or likely to soon enter the clinic for indications other than NHL (25).

On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation to release the cytotoxic payload after an ADC has been internalized by the cell [21]. In the lysosomal compartment, the process of intracellular proteolytic degradation reduces the ADC to the level of amino acids. For this type of linker to be effective, the cytotoxic agent must maintain its activity, despite still being attached to part of the linker [22]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are considered to have improved therapeutic index because of their greater plasma stability, although new designs of cleavable linkers have significantly improved stability [23]. \n\nIt is clear that the disposition of a mAb is dependent upon several factors (Figure 1), and not just the therapeutic entity conjugated to it, in the case of an ADC. While mAbs trigger an effector function on their own, ADCs act more like prodrugs, and may or may not exert an anti-cancer effect until the SM drug is released from the mAb carrier. Thus, the pharmacology of mAbs and ADCs are complex. As a result, analytical and PK studies must be performed to assess the disposition of not just conjugated and released forms of ADCs, but also the effects of modifications on the mAbs after administration.",

As might be expected, the drug plays a major role in ADC activity and characteristics. What might be less intuitive is that the linker between the antibody and drug also is very important. An ideal linker should be stable in circulating blood, but allow rapid release of active free drug inside tumor cells. If a linker is not stable in blood, drug will be lost and ADC activity will be decreased. 15,26 Current linker formats that are being evaluated can be broadly categorized into two groups: cleavable linkers (acidlabile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers. Acid-labile linkers are designed to be stable at pH levels encountered in the blood, but become unstable and degrade when the low pH environment in lysosomes is encountered (e.g., gemtuzumab ozogamicin). Protease-cleavable linkers are also designed to be stable in blood/plasma, but rapidly release free drug inside lysosomes in cancer cells upon cleavage by lysosomal enzymes. They take advantage of the high levels of protease activity inside lysosomes and include a peptide sequence that is recognized and cleaved by these proteases, as occurs with a dipeptide Val-Cit linkage that is rapidly hydrolyzed by cathepsins (e.g., brentuximab vedotin).\n\nA third type of linker under consideration contains a disulfide linkage.

For example, valine-citrulline (Val-Cit) and phenylalanine-lysine (Phe-Lys), which confer excellent stability and PK/PD profile to ADCs, have been used in many ADCs for preclinical and clinical evaluations. In addition, the ADCs with disulfide linkers take advantage of reduced glutathione with high intracellular concentrations to release free drug inside the cell. ADCs with reducible disulfide linkers generate uncharged metabolites that can diffuse into neighboring cells and elicit bystander killing, which is essential for killing heterogeneous tumors [51,53]. \n\nADCs with cleavable linkers have broader efficacy and faster rates of activating and releasing cytotoxic drugs for most cell lines. In contrast, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers can possibly provide increased plasma stability, greater therapeutic window, and reduced off-target toxicity. To reduce aggregation and improve the solubility of some ADCs, hydrophilic linkers such as \u03b2-glucuronide linker, Sulfo-SPDB, and Mal-PEG4-NHS were investigated [54,55]. In short, each type of linker has advantages and disadvantages, and each can be modified to achieve a fine balance between target efficacies and undesired toxicities [54].",

            "text": "In addition to the linker, the conjugation site can also have a significant influence on the stability of an ADC during circulation, and hence, its overall pharmacological activity. The availability of many different site-specific conjugation methods [51] has made it possible to choose suitable sites on the antibody for payload attachment. The thiol-maleimide Michael addition chemistry is a commonly used method because of its robustness and chemospecificity. The reaction leads to a succinimide thioether linkage formed with either native or engineered cysteine residues in the antibody. However, the maleimide exchange with thiols present in certain plasma components can result in deconjugation, which negatively affects ADC efficacy and safety. The succinimide ring can also undergo hydrolysis to produce a stable linkage which cannot further undergo retro-Michael elimination and is therefore beneficial for ADC activity. Shen et al. have shown that the different solvent accessibility and chemical environment of different conjugation sites can have different effects on the above-mentioned two reactions, which in turn affects the stability and efficacy of the corresponding ADCs [52]. It is interesting to note that conjugation site-dependent payload loss in plasma was observed not only with the ValCit-PABC linkers, but also with the non-cleavable linkers. The results from this study seem to show that the decrease in DAR was due to chemical deconjugation; however, one may not completely exclude the possibility that the enzymatic cleavage of the ValCit-PABC linker also played a role, though likely to a much lesser extent. Bioconjugation using microbial transglutaminase (mTG) has been used to assess how the stability of the antibody-drug linker is influenced by the site of the conjugation. In a study conducted by Dorywalska et al., it is shown that the conjugation site critically affects the enzymatic susceptibility of the ValCit-PABC linker to unidentified serine proteases in mouse plasma (likely Ces1C), of which there is a positive correlation between linker stability and ADC cytotoxic potency both in vitro and in vivo [53].",

Linkers should be highly stable in the blood circulation to allow the release and internalization of the ADC, though only upon antibody binding with the antigen. Unstable linkers may release the cytotoxic drug prematurely before reaching the tumor, hence, reducing the efficacy of the ADC treatment and increasing chances of off-target toxicity [35]. \n\nA linker can be classified as either cleavable or non-cleavable depending on its composition and susceptibility to proteolytic degradation within the cell. Non-cleavable linkers are more stable in circulation [115]; however, after proteolytic degradation, charged amino acid residues may be retained on the cytotoxic payload and can interfere with the overall efficacy of the drug [115]. The most commonly used type of non-cleavable linkers in ADCs is thioether linkers, currently used in T-DM1 [123]. Cleavable linkers depend on the physiological conditions of the cell and can be subdivided into two types: pH-sensitive and protease-cleavable linkers [35,115]. pH-sensitive linkers utilize the lower pH in the endosomes and lysosomes of target tumor cells to trigger hydrolysis of acid labile groups within a linker, while protease-cleavable linkers utilize common proteases, found in lysosomes of target tumor cells, for specific peptide sequence recognition and cleavage in the linker [35,115,124]. It is important to note, however, that cleavable linkers display nonspecific release of the cytotoxic drug [35,115]. The most commonly used cleavable linkers include acid-labile hydrazones, or disulfides [35,115].",

The stability of the linker can exert a considerable influence on the toxicities that might be associated with the active component of the ADC [11]. The most stable linkers will only release the chemotherapeutic component of the ADC in a target-specific manner; however, less stable linkers are prone to non-specific cleavage, resulting in a broader toxicity profile [11]. In addition, linkers can be classified as cleavable or non-cleavable, with cleavable linkers being those that are cleaved from the active component of the ADC by any of a variety of mechanisms including acidic degradation (hydrazones), protease cleavage by cathepsin B (dipeptide), and thiol-disulphide exchange reactions (disulphide), most of which occur in the endosomes of lysosomal compartments [19]. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as maleimidocaproyl and thioether linkers, require complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the targeting antibody to occur, leaving the active component attached to the linker and a charged lysine or cysteine residue [19]. Importantly, an analysis of Phase I study data for several ADCs in development that was conducted by the FDA noted that ADCs utilising the same linker, but distinct target antigens, exhibited similar toxicity profiles, highlighting the importance of linker selection in agent development [3,16].",

Linkers can be categorized into cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers can for example be split in the acidic environment of the lysosomes and therefore ensure a controlled releasing of the payload from the antibody. Aiming a higher bystander effect, the use of cleavable linkers is often favorable due to the ability to retain membrane-permeable properties of the payload. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers must undergo a complete proteasomal degradation before the payload is released. In some cases, this degradation does not lead to a complete separation of the payload from the antibody, so residues of the antibody can remain attached to the drug molecule. The remaining antibody residues could potentially interact with the function of the drug [16,19].",

For example, the MCC amine-to-sulfhydryl bifunctional cross-linker contains a cyclohexane ring structure that through steric hindrance protects the resulting thioether bond from hydrolysis [46]. The greatest advantage of non-cleavable versus cleavable linkers is their improved plasma stability; that results in reduced off-target toxicity in comparison to conjugates with cleavable linkers and thus provides greater stability and tolerability [47,48]. It is noteworthy that non-cleavable ADCs often have less activity against tumors due to the heterogeneity of target antigen expression where a bystander effect is an important contributor to therapeutic efficacy [49]. As described earlier, non-cleavable linkers require mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization to release the drug to the site of pharmacological activity in the cytosol. If the payload is linked to a charged amino acid such as lysine) with a Pi < 9.5, this will prevent escape of the drug by diffusion through the cell membrane and result in higher levels of drug-accumulation in the tumor cell which as a consequence should overcome the limitations of any bystander effect. In summary the major advantage of non-cleavable linkers is that they minimize drug release into the circulation thus limiting non-specific toxicity whilst maintaining, good in vivo stability [50]. \n\nUsually, non-cleavable linkers contain a thioether or maleimidocaproyl group. Examples of non-cleavable linker-based ADCs containing monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), an anti-mitotic drug, where it was demonstrated that the drug is more potent if linked via a simple alkyl chain to the antibody. Conjugation effected with a non-reducible thioether linker demonstrated very good activity in both in vitro and in vivo [51].",

The mAbs carry ADCs to target cells by affinity binding to antigens expressed on cell surface, and subsequently become internalized, undergo degradation followed by the release of toxic payloads within target cells. This design confers increased specificity and reduced toxicity compared to conventional pharmaceutics such as genotoxic drugs 1e3 .\n\nAs a novel class of therapeutics, ADCs are embracing everevolving technologies in linker and payload chemistry. Specifically, linkers can be classified as cleavable chemical spacers involving hydrozone, disulfide and di/tri/tetra-peptide bonds and noncleavable spacers such as thioether and pyrophosphate diester 4 . The differences in chemical stability conferred by linkers lead to varied catabolic profiles and hence ADC therapeutic efficacies in target cells or organelles. Moreover, highly potent cytotoxic agents with defined mechanisms of action such as maytansinoid and auristatin with microtubule inhibitory functions or DNA double-strand breakers, cross-linkers and alkylators are often selected as payloads 5 . In addition, the site of conjugation, lysine or cysteine residues, also affects ADC catabolic and pharmacokinetic liabilities 6 . Collectively, the plethora of choices offered by conjugation site, linkers and payloads confers versatile combinations, leading to currently over 100 ADCs in clinical trials and numerous ADCs as preclinical candidates 7,8 . Therefore, the concomitant task of druggability screening and quality assessment for ADC candidates becomes challenging, necessitating an approach that efficiently and comprehensively evaluates ADC attributes before proceeding to expensive and time-consuming in vivo experiments 8,9 . Nevertheless, conventional in vitro assaying techniques such as cytotoxicity assay merely provides a final functional readout while lacking a comprehensive evaluation of how each step ranging from antigen binding, internalization, trafficking to lysosomal proteolysismediated payload release functions and affects payload release and the ensuing cell killing effect 4 .

            "text": "The linker molecule connecting the antibody and the cytotoxic drug should keep the conjugate in bound form until the desired target site is reached [24] and is, hence, an important determinant of the pharmacokinetics and the therapeutic index of the conjugate [5]. Aside from circulatory stability and targeted release, one other key characteristic of a good linker is its low hydrophobicity, due to the fact that hydrophobic linkers can interact with the hydrophobic payloads, leading to aggregates that can possibly cause an immune reaction [25]. Linkers are principally categorized into two: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers release the payload either upon interacting with the low pH environment of the (endo)-lysosome, e.g., hydrazone linkers [26], or upon direct cleavage via lysosomal cathepsins [27], e.g., peptide linkers. A subgroup of cleavable linkers contains disulfide bonds that are sensitive to intracellular glutathione, releasing the payload upon the chemical reduction in these bonds by glutathione [28]. Such linkers might prove useful for the development of future ADCs for many cancers, including ovarian, head and neck, and lung cancers, since increased tumor glutathione levels have been reported in the literature for these cancers [5,29]. Non-cleavable linkers generally present higher levels of plasma stability [26] but require the cytotoxic molecule to remain active after complete lysosomal degradation [27]. Although the la er might appear as a disadvantage at first sight, there are reports of enhanced ADC cytotoxicity when conjugated with a noncleavable linker in comparison to cleavable ones [27]-as demonstrated by the development of Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (Trastuzumab emtansine) by Phillips et al. [30]. Sitespecific degradation mechanisms of non-cleavable linkers are actively being researched to improve their efficacy over cleavable counterparts [31].",

            "text": "The linker is a crucial component in ADC design, facilitating the connection between the antibody and the cytotoxic payload through covalent coupling. While primarily serving to link the antibody and effector molecule, the linker plays a multifaceted role beyond mere connection. 51 Various properties of the linker, such as conjugation chemistry, length, and steric hindrance, directly impact the toxicity, specificity, stability, and efficacy of ADCs. 52 An optimal linker should exhibit stability in circulation (with a half-life approximately 10 times longer than that of the ADC) and efficiently release the cytotoxic payload within the tumor post-internalization. 53,54 Additionally, the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of the linker can influence payload coupling and reduce immunogenicity. \n\nResearchers have explored different types of linkers, which can be broadly classified into two categories: cleavable and noncleavable linkers. 51,55,56 Cleavable linkers have the ability to release a metabolite of the effector molecules from the ADC, allowing it to enter cells, either at the tumor site or within endosomes and lysosomes. These cleavable linkers are further divided into chemically cleavable linkers and enzymatically cleavable linkers, such as peptide-based linkers, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers, and phosphate-based linkers. 51 Notably, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers consist of \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers and \u03b2-galactosidase-sensitive linkers. Premature cleavage of these linkers can lead to the effector molecules harming normal cells. 57 On the other hand, noncleavable linkers, such as thioether linkers and maleimido caproyl linkers, require internalization of the ADC into cells and subsequent breakdown by lysosomes to release the effector molecules. ADCs with noncleavable linkers depend on complete lysosomal enzymatic degradation of the antibody for payload release, resulting in simultaneous dissociation of the linker. 58",

            "text": "The Val-Ala linker of typical ADCs connects with payloads via p-aminobenzyl (PAB) as the spacer, a methylsulfonyl modification was applied on the PAB group to enhance the plasma stability of FZ-AD005. FZ-AD005 exhibited excellent plasma stability in vitro compared with DS-8201 and precise DXd release upon internalization into the lysosomes (Figs. 2B and 4B). In vivo, minimal differences were observed between the ADC and total antibody pharmacokinetic profiles, further demonstrating the stability of this innovative linker-payload (Fig. 7). Moreover, low plasma concentrations of free DXd resulted in minimal systemic exposure, with an AUC 0-t of approximately 18.6 \u00b1 8.82 (hour \ufffd ng/mL) at 10 mg/kg (Supplementary Table S3). The reduced exposure may account for the reduced toxicity of FZ-AD005 in monkeys. Linker plays a critical role in influencing ADC stability, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity profiles (35,36). Stabilized linkers may mitigate offtarget toxicity associated with linker cleavage: a problem often encountered in conventional ADCs. For instance, DS-8201 demonstrated higher stability and lower free drug release than conventional ADCs (37,38) and exhibited a compelling safety profile in clinical applications (39,40). \n\nFc-silencing technology was introduced in FZ-AD005 to eliminate binding to Fc\u03b3Rs (Supplementary Fig. S4A-S4C; Supplementary Table S2), as most dose-limiting toxicities are thought to be caused by irrelevant uptake-mediated off-target toxicity in normal cells (41)(42)(43). The Fc-silencing mutation was also applied in durvalumab, an anti-PDL1 antibody, and clinical data of durvalumab demonstrated that Fc-silencing mutation do not induce severe immunogenicity which may affect efficacy and safety of the drug. In vitro studies showed that FZ-AD005 exhibited negligible ADCC, CDC, and ADCP effects (Fig. 3).",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) consist of a small-molecule drug (payload) covalently bound to a monoclonal antibody via a chemical linker. By merging the specific binding properties of antibodies to the potency of small molecules, ADCs are designed to selectively deliver cell-killing agents to targeted pathogenic tissues, while limiting systemic toxicity. Most of the ADCs developed so far are potential anticancer agents and nine of them were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of various types of cancer (Table 1). Many other ADCs are currently in advanced clinical trials not only for anticancer applications [1][2][3][4][5] but also to treat intracellular Staphylococcus aureus bacterial infection [6], for the targeted delivery of kinase inhibitors [7], as well as ADCs with anti-inflammatory properties [8,9]. \n\nIn most approved and clinical-stage ADCs, the toxic payloads are microtubule disruptors or DNA-damaging agents [10,11]. In the first and second generations of ADCs, those payloads were conjugated to antibody component in a stochastic manner, leading to heterogeneous mixtures of chemically distinct molecules varying in both drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and conjugation sites [1]. This last decade, with the aim to better control the position and the number of drug loads, new conjugation strategies were developed to access a new generation of ADCs with improved homogeneity [1,2,12,13]. Those site-specific reactions rely on the insertion of engineered cysteine residues [14] or unnatural amino acids within the antibodies core [15,16], enzymatic conjugation [17][18][19], cross-link of the reduced interchain disulfides with rebridging chemical reagents [20], and glycan-mediated conjugation [21]. The conjugating linkers between payload and antibody are generally classified into cleavable and noncleavable ones, which can behave quite differently in a biological system [22].",

However, low levels of glutathione is also present within the circulation (2.8\u02d80.9 \u00b5M) [23]. Increasing levels of disulphide steric hindrance through the insertion of methyl groups has proportionally reduced their untimely release within the circulation [24]. Lorvotuzumab mertansine (IMGN901) is the most clinically advanced ADC employing a hindered disulphide linker. This anti-CD56 targeting ADC with a maytanisinoid (DM1) payload has shown efficacy against Merkel cell carcinoma in early phase trials and has been granted orphan status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [25].\n\nThe second class of ADC linking strategies involves the use of non-cleavable thioether linkers that require the post-internalisation degradation of the ADC complex within the lysosomal and endosomal compartments. This disintegration results in the release of a cytotoxic agent still attached with the linker and an amino acid from the original antibody attachment site [26]. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) has successfully used a non-cleavable linker to combine a maytansinoids toxic to the anti-HER2 trastuzumab antibody [27]. Non-cleavable linkers have improved stability in the bloodstream, longer half-lives, and hence reduced risk of off-target toxicity [28]. T-DM1, for example, has a serum stability of more than three days [29]. The success of each linking strategy is context-dependent, with advantages and disadvantages for each. The conjugation method used to combine the linker to exposed residues on the surface of antibody is another pivotal step in the manufacture of a successful ADC.",

The linker should be sufficiently stable in circulation to allow the payload to remain attached to the antibody while in circulation as it distributes into tissues (including solid tumor tissue), yet should allow efficient release of an active cell-killing agent once the ADC is taken up into the cancer cells [5]. Linkers can be characterized as either cleavable, where a chemical bond (or bonds) between the payload and the attachment site on the antibody (usually an amino acid) can be cleaved intracellularly [16][17][18], or as non-cleavable, where the final active metabolite released within the cell includes the payload and all elements of the linker still attached to an amino acid residue of the antibody, typically a lysine or a cysteine residue, following complete proteolytic degradation of the ADC within the lysosome of the cell [19][20][21]. \n\nThe design goal for an ADC is to harness the potent tumor cell-killing action of the payload to an antibody, while retaining the favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties of the immunoglobulin, as well as any intrinsic biologic or immunologic activity it may have [5-7, 21, 22]. Much of the selection of the optimal antibody, the ideal linker-payload chemistry, and the optimal number of payload molecules linked per antibody molecule, are determined empirically, with a focus on maximizing the therapeutic index of the ADC [5,22].",

            "text": "Cancer remains the 2nd leading cause of death globally (reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/data/types.htm). Metastatic disease is the most common cause of cancerrelated mortality and remains a therapeutic challenge. For the past two decades, engineered monoclonal antibodies have provided a clinical approach to specifically target cancer cells, and are often combined with chemotherapy. The clinical advantage of these therapeutic antibodies comes from the fact that they target surface antigens that are expressed at equivalent or higher levels with higher or equivalent expression levels on tumor as compared to normal cells, but side effects associated with elimination of the normal cell population is clinically manageable. Anti-tumor efficacy can be achieved through downstream signaling events such as growth and proliferation inhibition initiating apoptosis [1] or by activating the patient's immune system, resulting in complement or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) [2]. \n\nSeveral therapeutic antibodies have been redeployed as the antibody component of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). While these antibodies primarily function as carriers of the drug to the cancer cells, some of them, like Trastuzumab in T-DM1 also act through ADCC. ADCs are composed of a humanized or chimeric antibody chemically linked to a cytotoxic drug (Fig. 1a) allowing the delivery of cytotoxic drug specifically to antigen-positive malignant cells [3]. The antibody's specificity and the local release of cytotoxic drug are the main parameters that provide increased anti-tumor efficacy and decreased systemic toxicity. Therefore, ADCs have a wider therapeutic window compared to traditional chemotherapy [4,5]. A chemical linker is used to attach the cytotoxic drug to the antibody, and the physicochemical properties of the linker largely determine the pharmacokinetics of an ADC [6,7]. Linkers are usually classified as \"cleavable\" and \"non-cleavable\". They are designed to be highly stable in the circulation to limit systemic toxicity and to be readily cleavable once the ADC reaches its intracellular destination to deliver the payload [8].",

We show that these ADCs are synthesised almost exclusively as DAR 4 species (by HIC and mass spec), have stability in blood serum and are selective and potent against HER-2 expressing tumour cells. Moreover, we demonstrate for the \ue103rst time that both NGM-and PD-based ADC potency and selectivity translate well into therapeutic efficacy in an in vivo mouse model. Both ADC formats showed excellent tumour regression. \n\nBoth NGM and PD based ADCs are prepared by a common and simple method (Scheme 1). The four solvent accessible disul\ue103de bonds in an IgG1 are reduced using tris-2carboxyethylphosphine (TCEP), followed by functional rebridging with either a NGM or a PD molecule. Conjugation with NGM is followed by hydrolysis to stabilise the conjugate, whereas PD conjugates themselves are stable. \n\nWe chose trastuzumab as our antibody platform to demonstrate disul\ue103de modi\ue103cation with PDs. Trastuzumab (Herceptin\u2122) is a monoclonal IgG1 antibody targeting HER2 and is used for breast cancer therapy both as antibody alone 39 and as the antibody component of ADC Kadcyla\u2122. 40 We chose anti-cancer drug MMAE as a suitable payload for ADC design. 9,38,41 Lastly, we chose to  compare cleavable and non-cleavable linker designs. The cleavable linker design is the widely used cathepsin B labile valine-citruline linker. 8,9,38,42,43 t has been suggested that MMAE requires release as a free drug from the antibody linker conjugate to reach anywhere near its full potency inside the target cell. 44 However, our previously reported NGM-MMAE ADC 1 showed high potency in vitro despite using a non-cleavable linker. 26",

The previously described bystander effect, which impacts normal cells in the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells with no or low target expression, is more likely to occur with ADCs that utilize cleavable linkers [58,59]. \n\nNon-cleavable linkers, as opposed to cleavable linkers, have better plasma stability, less off-target toxicity, and resistance to proteolytic degradation, as they have nonreducible bonds with the amino acid residues of the antibody. Generally, non-cleavable linkers are formed by thioether or Maleimidocaproyl groups. Non-cleavable linkers that are attached to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody must have the antibody moiety completely broken down by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases to release the payload following ADC internalization [60,61]. A general basic structure is illustrated in Figure 2 [62]. General basic structure of an ADC. An ADC consists of a chimeric or humanized (less immunogenic) antibody that has strong binding activity to an antigen expressed on the surface of a lymphoma cancer cell. Antibodies should have a higher half-life in circulation to be delivered to the target cell surface. Antibodies are linked to payloads of different structures (mainly, tubulin inhibitors or DNA interacting), which are highly effective drugs with ideal drug/antibody ratio. The linkage between the antibody and payload is through cleavable or non-cleavable linkers, which should have precise binding, stability in circulation, and ensure efficient payload distribution at their targets.

            "text": "sterically hindered SPDB linker showed superior activity compared with the SPP linker (Erickson et al, 2010), and in some cases these cleavable linkers result in more potent ADCs than their counterpart non-cleavable linkers (Polson et al, 2009;Erickson et al, 2010). Although ADCs using these linkers can cause bystander killing, it is believed that internalisation, reduction of the disulphide bond, and further modification to the drug within the target cell are required for modifying the potency of the drug once released from the cell to cause bystander killing (Erickson et al, 2006(Erickson et al, , 2010Kovtun et al, 2006;Golfier et al, 2014).\n\nHowever, there are studies that indicate that internalisation of these cleavable linker-based ADCs may not be essential for their anti-tumour activity. For example, conjugation of the tubulinbinding maytansine (DM1) to antibodies targeting poorly internalising antigens (CD20, CD21, CD72) via the cleavable SPP linker were effective in xenograft models and were more effective than ADCs with the same antibody/drug using the non-cleavable thioether linker succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) (Polson et al, 2009). In another example, the ADC targeting the carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) used a cleavable disulphide linker, which is not internalised or slowly internalising, and was effective in the treatment of colon and pancreatic xenografts (Govindan et al, 2009).\n\nThe recent 'traceless' technology uses a direct, unhindered disulphide bond between a drug and an antibody or a small immune protein (SIP). The resulting drug conjugates do not require internalisation by the target cell because the drug is released upon reduction or hydrolysis of the disulphide bond within the tumour microenvironment. This technology has used a SIP",

However, conjugates containing cleavable linkers have been shown to be more effective than the corresponding analogs containing non-cleavable linkers [20,35]. The linker must be carefully selected to remain intact during circulation, and to release the drug at the site of disease. Premature drug release often leads to systemic toxicity, as well as decreased drug efficacy. An example is neutropenia, a commonly reported toxicity in ADCs containing the valine-citruline protease cleavable linker, due to the premature release of the drug and action of the cytotoxic payload in the bone marrow [36]. Another frequently employed cleavable linker is the disulfide bond, which is cleaved under reductive conditions. Tumor cells contain a higher concentration (100-1000\u00d7 fold higher) of glutathione (GSH) compared to the extracellular concentration. GSH is a potent reductive agent, reacting readily with disulfide bonds [37,38]. A GSH stability assay was used to mimic the intracellular release of the cytotoxic payload. We determined that DM1 was fully released from ePSMA-DM1 within 6 h. Compared to other DM1-containing SMDCs, the release of the payload takes longer for our compound, even though the disulfide linker is not sterically hindered [30].\n\nUsing an NAALADase enzymatic assay to evaluate binding to PSMA, we determined that ePSMA-DM1 had an IC 50 value approximately 20-fold worse than the IC 50 value of PSMA-617 (45.3 \u00b1 1.84 nM vs. 2.19 \u00b1 0.78 nM). While both compounds are based on the EuK binding moiety, structural modifications in the linker region and the addition of the drug affected the binding due to steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions inside the binding pocket of the protein [39,40]. The radiochemical evaluation of ePSMA-DM1 with In-111 and Lu-177 also showed that the compounds were stable in formulation",

Noncleavable linkers are stable from early to late endosome transition and their cytotoxic partner is just released by degradation of antibody in lysosomes, e.g. MCC and MC linkers that link Ab to the payload via thioether linkage 190 .\n\nCharacteristics of ADC target such as copy number, internalization rate and level of homogeneity should be considered in conjugation method and linker selection. For instance, ADC with disulfide-linkage has been shown to have more cytotoxic activity than the same ADC with thioether linkage when they were directed to the tumor cell lines expressing a low copy number of targeted antigen 17 .\n\nCleavable linkers may increase the possibility of bystander effect 27 .

            "text": "Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues. For instance, in a study by Polson et al., several ADCs were constructed by conjugating antibodies against a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigens to a DM1 payload via either a cleavable (SPP) or a non-cleavable (SMCC) linker and were tested for in vivo toxicity and efficacy [34]. The SMCC-ADCs showed efficacy against only two of the seven target antigens, while the SPP-ADCs were active against all targets. However, at the dose of 20 mg ADC/kg, the animals treated with an ADC bearing the cleavable linker SPP exhibited much more significant weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities when compared with the results observed following dosing with ADC employing the non-cleavable linker SMCC. \n\nIn addition to the entry of released payload into non-targeted cells via passive diffusion across plasma membranes, the non-specific endocytosis of the intact ADC may also contribute to the off-site delivery of payload. Non-specific endocytosis may be influenced by the physicochemical properties of ADCs, including hydrophobicity and charge. Since most of the drug-linker compositions utilized in ADC technology are highly lipophilic, the hydrophobicity of the ADCs is often proportional to the drug loading (i.e., drug-to-antibody ratio, DAR). In a study by Hamblett et al., several anti-CD30-vc-MMAE ADCs with DARs of two, four, and eight were evaluated for in vivo pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity [35]. It was observed that the ADCs with higher DAR values had a faster systemic clearance, a lower tolerability, and a narrower therapeutic index than the ADCs with a lower DAR.",

            "text": "In this review and meta-analysis, we sought to delineate how features of ADC design, including linker cleavability, DAR, and systemic free payload concentration, may contribute to their associated systemic toxicities. The results support the hypothesis that ADCs with cleavable linkers are associated with more systemic toxicities than those with non-cleavable linkers. Interestingly, even though higher DAR was associated with higher grade \u2265 3 toxicity, the apparent protective effect of the non-cleavable linker persisted even after adjusting for DAR. However, we found that the association between non-cleavable linkers and lower toxicity was not observed after adjusting for systemic free payload concentration. This suggests that systemic free payload concentration is the main factor driving toxicity in ADC-treated patients. \n\nNotably, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has a considerably higher systemic free payload concentration than the other agents studied here. T-DXd has a tetrapeptide cleavable linker that may make it more vulnerable to premature release of its payload. Such a prematurely released payload might explain why T-DXd may be effective in tumor control regardless of HER2 expression. Emerging clinical evidence supports this hypothesis. In a small trial of T-DXd in non-small cell lung cancer patients, the activity of T-DXd was shown to be independent of HER2 over-expression in HER3 + , 2 + , or 1 + tumors [47]. More recently, clinical trial data presented during the 2021 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium showed that T-DXd was active in breast cancer patients regardless of HER2 expression, including HER2 0 tumors [48]. \n\nBy contrast, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), another anti-HER2 ADC with a non-cleavable linker, has not been shown to have activity in patients with low HER2 tumor expression. This may partly explain why in the DESTINY-03 trial [35], T-DM1 (HER2 dependent) was shown to have lower efficacy compared to T-DXd (HER2 dependent and independent).",

Non-cleavable linkers, being the most stable type, generally result in better tolerability, but ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate superior efficacy, partly attributable to the bystander effect. 14 The payload typically consists of a highly potent small molecule with nanomolar to picomolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. The payloads of FDA-approved ADCs for solid tumors currently fall into three classes: microtubular inhibitors (auristatins, maytansinoids), topoisomerase inhibitors (deruxtecan, SN-38-active form of irinotecan), and alkylating agents (duocarmazine). 15 The drug-antibody ratio (DAR) refers to the average number of drug molecules conjugated to an antibody in an ADC. \n\nIt is a critical parameter in ADC design, influencing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the conjugate. A higher DAR may increase the drug payload, potentially enhancing therapeutic efficacy, but it could also impact stability and increase the risk of off-target effects. On the other hand, a lower DAR may provide better stability but may limit the overall drug payload. Finding the optimal DAR is crucial in ADC development to balance therapeutic benefits and potential challenges. 16 ADCs were first approved for hematologic malignances (lymphoma, multiple myeloma), breast cancer, and gastric cancer. 17 Among gynecological cancers, mirvetuximab soravtansine has been recently approved by the FDA for relapsed platinum resistant ovarian cancer. 17 ncerning CC several targets are under evaluation, but TF is the most investigated.",

            "text": "The linker in ADCs connects the antibody with the cytotoxic drug. It plays a critical role in the stability of ADCs and the release profiles of payloads, consequently influencing the therapeutic index of ADCs. An ideal linker should limit premature payload release in plasma while facilitating the active release of drugs at the desired target sites. Most ADCs employ two types of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. The first ones are designed to cleave under specific conditions, such as in a low-pH environment or in the presence of proteolytic enzymes [5]. \n\nThe cytotoxic payload is the active component that exerts cytotoxicity upon the internalization of ADCs into cancer cells. These compounds must remain stable under physiological conditions and possess functional groups suitable for conjugation with the antibody. To date, the cytotoxic payloads utilized in ADCs primarily comprise potent tubulin inhibitors and DNA-damaging agents [8,9]. In this light, the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) represents the average number of payload molecules (ranging from 2 to 8) attached to each monoclonal antibody. While ADCs with higher DARs exhibited greater potency in vitro, preclinical evidence demonstrated that they may have higher toxicity and a lower therapeutic index [10]. \n\nFollowing intravenous injection, ADCs bind to their target antigens and undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis for internalization within the cell. Once inside the cell, the cytotoxic payload carries out its cytotoxic role through its interaction with microtubules or DNA. In addition, apoptotic cells or ADCs may release the cytotoxic component into the extracellular space, potentially inducing cell death in neighboring cells, a phenomenon known as the \"bystander effect\" [11]. \n\nThe current review aims to explore the past, the present, and the future of ADCs as therapeutic agents for the treatment of advanced SCLC (Figure 1).",

            "text": "In one study, an ADC using a PEG 4 Mal linker with DM1 was markedly more effective in eradicating MDR-expressing xenograft tumors than the ADC with the MCC-DM1 linker (10). In a manner, an ADC using the sulfo-SPDB linker DM4 was considerably more potent against an MDR expressing cell line with an 50 =7-20 pM vs >3000 pM for the ADCs with SPDB or MCC linkers (28). \n\nTo reiterate, linkers can be classified as cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers possess functionalities susceptible to degradation through lysosomal processes (protease-sensitive, acid-sensitive, and reduction-sensitive). ADCs made with non-cleavable linkers, in comparison, have extended plasma half-life which is a desirable attribute. The activity of these non-cleavable linkers in the tumor cells relies on the degradation of the total antibody, ultimately releasing an amino-acid-linker-cytotoxin construct. Examples of well-established non-cleavable linkers include maleimidocaproyl (mc), used with MMAF, and MCC, often used with DM1 conjugates. (29). The acyl hydrazide is produced by the displacement of the methyltrisulfide moiety of \u03b3-calicheamicin with 3-mercapto-3-methylbutyryl hydrazide, termed N-acetyl \u03b3-calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide. It is worth noting that this linker construct was also utilized in Mylotarg\u00ae. Once internalized to the lysosome of the tumor cell, the payload undergoes a two-stage activation process. First, the acid-sensitive hydrazone is hydrolyzed and the aryl tetra saccharide portion of the drug binds to the minor groove of DNA (30).",

            "text": "The linker acts to join the cytotoxic agent to the antibody via the conjugation sites in the antibody heavy chains. Two crucial characteristics must be present for the Linker to be functional. Firstly, the linker must ensure the antibody and cytotoxic agent remain firmly bound, particularly in the plasma during circulation. An unstable linker may lead to premature delivery of the cytotoxic agent into the systemic circulation leading to unwanted toxicity and reduced therapeutic efficacy [32]. Secondly, the linker must be able to deliver the drug once at the tumour site [33].\n\nThere are two main sub-classes of linkers; cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers rely on factors in the tumour microenvironment to stimulate the breakdown and release of the ADC cytotoxic agent [34]. Mechanisms of linker cleavage are diverse; one such mechanism is driven by glutathione (highly represented in the cytoplasm compared to the extracellular space), which leads to the release of the cytotoxic agent via breakage of disulphide bonds [35,36]. A second type of mechanism involves linkers that cleave in environments with an acidic pH, such as hydrazone. This type of linker exploits the acidic pH found in endosomes and lysosomes. However, premature cleavage of these linkers into the circulation may lead to hepatotoxicity such as that described in gemtuzumab ozogamicin [32,37]. A third type of linker is those that are protease-dependent and are degraded by lysosomal proteases after recognition of a specific peptide sequence. These linkers allow the ADC to be remarkably stable within the plasma and thus avoid a premature release of the cytotoxic agent. Examples of this type of linker include enfortumab vedotin, ADC directed against nectin-4, and sacituzumab govitecan (SG) directed against the human trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) [38].\n\nCleavable linkers are less stable than non-cleavable linkers.

            "text": "There are two types of linkers, cleavable and noncleavable. An appropriate linker is not only required to prevent degradation during systemic circulation but also to facilitate the quick and efficient release of the drug inside the tumor cells [35]. Non-cleavable linkers release their conjugated drug only after antibody degradation. For example, for Kadcyla which has a non-cleavable thioether linker, lysosomal membrane proteins are required to first transport the drug catabolite out of the lysosomal compartment & then exert a therapeutic effect [36]. Barok et al. [37] established that non-cleavable linkers are more susceptible to ADC resistance in tumor cells because any faulty linker degradation will not lead to functional drug release. \n\nBV is composed of protease-cleavable valine-citrulline peptide, where the MMAE does not depend on the degradation of the antibody backbone. Thus, it leads to much faster payload release after ADC internalization compared to a non-cleavable linker [38]. However, a faulty linker cleaving or non-cleaving can lead to an ineffective payload discharge. As per a study conducted by Caculitan et al. [39], valine-citrulline (Val-Cit) linker showed broad-spectrum specificity to different types of cathepsins, including cathepsin B, cathepsin L, cathepsin K, etc. [39]. Since only cathepsin B is postulated to be highly expressed in HL cells, and normal cells have other kinds of cathepsins, this phenomenon could be very deleterious as it would induce toxic side effects on other normal cells [40]. \n\nA defective linker thereby affects the cytotoxic drug delivery in many ways from the drug not reaching the target, to off-target toxicity and the drug not being able to dissociate from the mAb and the linker, thereby overall promoting resistance.

Furthermore, very recently a strategy combining two site-specific conjugation methods was described for the attachment of two distinct cytotoxic drugs [117]. \n\nNot only the conjugation method but also the linker itself is an integral and customizable element of ADCs. Apart from physically linking drug and antibody it also has the potential to contribute to characteristics like linkage stability, drug release and aggregation behavior [118]. Currently approved ADCs utilize either non-cleavable, chemically cleavable or cathepsin-cleavable linkers for intracellular liberation of cytotoxins. Non-cleavable linkers liberate the attached drug upon proteasomal degradation of the internalized antibody [119]. In this case the drug remains attached to the conjugated amino acid which can affect its bio-distribution and potency [120]. Cleavable linkers on the contrary allow triggered release. Currently approved ADCs are designed to exploit the distinct environment in lysosomes to trigger drug release. For example, pH sensitive or thiol-containing reduction-labile linker elements, found in gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg [121]) and inotuzmab ozogamicin (Besponsa [122]), exploit the acidic and reductive milieu in lysosomes.",

Non-cleavable linkers mainly depend on sufficient processing of mAbs within the lysosome after ADC internalization to release the toxin due to the lack of cell permeability. These linkers are accompanied by limited bystander effect and have lower membrane permeability. \n\nThe attachment between mAb and linker is a crucial parameter of ADCs as it determines the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and consequently the stability, efficacy, and homogeneity of the ADCs.

            "text": "We discovered that a shorter linker typically results in better ADC stability by tethering the payload further inside the steric shield of the antibody relative to a longer linker. Ideally, the linker that connects the antibody to the drug should be stable in circulation and cleaved enzymatically (by a protease such as cathepsin B) or chemically (by reducing agents such as cysteine and GSH) inside the cell to release the attached payload to act on the intended target (Zhang et al., 2016a;Zhang et al., 2016b;Ponziani et al., 2020;Poreba, 2020) In the absence of linker stability in serum, premature release of the payload can result in systemic toxicity. Whereas the low stability of Trodelvy \u00ae bearing an unstable linker seems to avoid this effect with manageable safety likely due to the selected toxicity profile of its topisomerase I inhibitor payload (Bardia et al., 2017;Sahota and Vahdat, 2017;Bardia et al., 2021). On the other hand, inefficient cleavage of the linker inside the cell may not produce the intended antitumor activity (Zhang et al., 2016a;Zhang et al., 2016b;Ma et al., 2016;Poreba, 2020). Different linker chemistry and linker modifications have been explored. Maleimide and disulfide linkages represent two major types of linker chemistry. Maleimide has been widely utilized as an antibody connection modality and has been employed with both cleavable or non-cleavable linkers. Accordingly, the pharmacologically efficacious component could be the payload itself or that with partial or full-length linkers depending on the mechanism of action of the payload (Su et al., 2019;Poreba, 2020). Either for cleavable or noncleavable linkers, the efficient release of the active component would be the desired result, which can be achieved through the optimal linker design. Disulfide-based antibody connections have recently been developed as a new strategy for the generation of cleavable linkers (Pillow et al., 2017;Sadowsky et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Selecting a linker between the mAb and the cytotoxic agent is also important for ADC development. A linker must be stable enough in systemic circulation and be able to rapidly and efficiently release the cytotoxic agent upon internalization of the ADC within cancer cells [50]. According to the drug release mechanism, linkers for ADCs are generally categorized into cleavable linkers (acid-labile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers (Table 1) [51]. The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Another modification, using cysteine bridging bifunctional groups is to reduce the maximum number of cytotoxic drugs attached to a mAb from eight to four. Recently, a variety of approaches have been developed to obtain site-specific conjugations where sites of attachment of the cytotoxic agent to the antibody are precisely defined. These technologies are as follows: (a) applying engineered cysteine (such as THIOMAB enabling site-specific conjugation on only the heavy chain of the antibody) [38]; \n\n(b) introducing unnatural amino acids through mutagenesis to proteins and antibodies (such as incorporating p-acetylphenylalanine or selenocysteine into an IgG1) [39]; (c) using enzymatic and chemoenzymatic methods to generate site-specific conjugations (such as using engineered glycotransferases, transglutaminases, transpeptidase sortase, or formyl glycine generating enzymes to form the site-specific functionalization of antibodies) [40][41][42][43][44][45]; and (d) using tubulin-tag labeling strategies [46][47][48].",

            "text": "The advancement of self-immolative linker chemistry has also improved the stability and tolerability of ADCs utilizing cleavable linkers. In the early 1980s, the paraaminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) self-immolate linker chemistry was developed by Carl et al. for use in prodrug design [196]. Since then, the PABC linker type has been extensively utilized in ADC linker technology, particularly for MMAE-conjugated ADC. Upon cleavage by lysosomal enzymes after ADC internalization into the target cells, the PABC spacer in the vc-PAB-MMAE linker/payload goes through a cascade of disassembly reactions and facilitates the release of untethered MMAE intracellularly [197]. The vc-PABC linker exhibits superior plasma stability and improved toxicity profile compared to the earlier cleavable linker generations, such as the pH-sensitive hydrazone linker used in calicheamicin-based ADCs or disulfide reducible linker used in DM1-based ADCs [198]. This linker technology has achieved significant success with its application in four MMAE-ADCs out of the twelve approved ADCs. In addition, the PABC spacer also has been used in the development of PBD-based ADCs, including the approved ADC loncastuximab tesirine. Recently, Pillow et al. have developed sophisticated self-immolative spacer chemistry that enabled direct conjugation of a cytotoxic payload to engineered cysteine residues [30]. This spacer facilitates a stable disulfide bridge, leading to enhanced plasma PK while allowing a rapid traceless release of free payloads intracellularly. This technology improved the tolerability of PBD-ADCs compared to the conventional peptide-PABC linker technology [199]. In this study, both the conventional peptide-ADC and the self-immolative disulfide-ADC displayed similar in vivo potency.",

A linker must be stable enough in systemic circulation and be able to rapidly and efficiently release the cytotoxic agent upon internalization of the ADC within cancer cells [50]. According to the drug release mechanism, linkers for ADCs are generally categorized into cleavable linkers (acid-labile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers (Table 1) [51]. The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Another modification, using cysteine bridging bifunctional groups is to reduce the maximum number of cytotoxic drugs attached to a mAb from eight to four. Recently, a variety of approaches have been developed to obtain site-specific conjugations where sites of attachment of the cytotoxic agent to the antibody are precisely defined. These technologies are as follows: (a) applying engineered cysteine (such as THIOMAB enabling site-specific conjugation on only the heavy chain of the antibody) [38]; \n\n(b) introducing unnatural amino acids through mutagenesis to proteins and antibodies (such as incorporating p-acetylphenylalanine or selenocysteine into an IgG1) [39]; (c) using enzymatic and chemoenzymatic methods to generate site-specific conjugations (such as using engineered glycotransferases, transglutaminases, transpeptidase sortase, or formyl glycine generating enzymes to form the site-specific functionalization of antibodies) [40][41][42][43][44][45]; and (d) using tubulin-tag labeling strategies [46][47][48].",

Out of the six ADCs in clinical trials currently for TNBC, three carry auristatin (Glembatumumab Vedotin (NCT01997333), and PTK7-ADC (NCT03243331), and PF-06647020 (NCT02222922) and one carries a maytansinoid, Anetumab maytansine (NCT02485119). \n\nThe next parameter evaluated was the linker that attaches the cytotoxic agent to the antibody. The linker must remain stable in circulation and be selectively released when the drug is intracellular at the target tumor. There are two forms of linkers: cleavable (e.g., via enzymatic cleavage) or non-cleavable. We compared seven different linkers, and one non-cleavable (RED-106). The different cleavable linkers contained dipeptide motifs targeted by cathepsin B and other proteases. The efficacy of linkers containing Val-Cit or Val-Ala sequences, and the effects of solubilizing motifs including the use of positively-and negatively-charged groups (Figure 2) were compared. The Val-Cit cleavable linkers are designed to be cleaved by cathepsin B. Caculitan et al. [52] found that that knockout of cathepsin B did not affect the activity of Val-Cit linker based ADCs in vitro (BT-474M1, SK-BR-3, BJAB, KPL-4, WSUDLCL2 and, GNE-293T) and that proteases other than cathepsin B can also cleave the Val-Cit linker with varying degrees of efficiency. Our studies showed the Val-Cit cleavable linker RED-244 conjugating 2G10 the MMAE, gave the highest effect in vivo, suggesting that cell-based assays though useful as an initial screen for activity, are not predictive of in vivo efficacy.",

            "text": "The linker, a crucial component of ADCs, precisely conjugates cytotoxic agents to mAbs. Its design is essential for achieving targeted delivery and maximizing therapeutic efficacy. An ideal linker should remain stable in systemic circulation to ensure that ADCs maintain a stable connection between the antibody and payload during systemic circulation, thereby minimizing premature drug release and reducing off-target toxicity. Upon entry into tumor cells, the linker should facilitate efficient and timely release of the payload, ensuring that cytotoxic effects are confined to the tumor microenvironment. Linkers with appropriate hydrophilic/lipophilic properties can bind to the characteristics of effective payloads and mitigate immune responses. Hydrophobic linkers coupled with hydrophobic payloads often promote the aggregation of ADC molecules. Aggregated ADCs may act as immunogenic substances, potentially triggering undesired immune responses during circulation in the bloodstream [119]. Additionally, the linker must not induce ADC aggregation, as this could impair antibody functionality, decrease stability, and affect pharmacokinetics [120]. Linkers are generally categorized into two main types: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers (Fig. 5).",

            "text": "ADC efficacy is determined by the systemic stability of the antibody-drug linkage prior to internalization and its efficient intracellular processing to allow toxin release within the target cell. The high stability of the transglutaminase-generated antibody-drug amide linkage [17,21] provided us with a unique opportunity to investigate metabolic processes that may be acting upon conjugates with purportedly more stable non-cleavable linker-payloads. Initially, we generated a series of conjugates using the Amino-PEG6-Propionyl-MMAD payload (PEG6-C2-MMAD), a potent analogue of the antimitotic agent Dolastatin 10 [22], attached to specific sites across the anti-M1S1 C16 antibody (Fig 1a and 1b). To evaluate linker-payload stability, we performed comparative in vitro plasma stability assays by incubating conjugates in mouse plasma, purifying them and comparing their drug-antibody ratio (DAR) to that of untreated conjugates. Unlike the cleavable Aminocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzylcarbamate (C6-VC-PABC) linker [21], the non-cleavable PEG6-C2-MMAD-derived conjugates remained stable across most of the sites tested over a 4.5 day incubation period in mouse plasma, with both the transglutaminase linkage and the Amino-PEG6 linker intact. However, we discovered a position-dependent degradation of the C terminus of MMAD (Fig 1b, Table 1), initially observed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) as a decrease in retention time of the ADC following plasma exposure. We subsequently identified the degradation by mass spectrometry as a loss of 186 Da, which is consistent with the hydrolytic cleavage of the C-terminal dolaphenine residue of MMAD (Fig 2a  In contrast to the cleavage observed in mouse plasma, the degradation of the MMAD C terminus was minimal to undetectable in rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human plasma in vitro under the conditions studied (Fig 3).",

            "text": "The first step in linker design is choosing two functionalities that will allow for covalent bond formation between the antibody on one end and the payload on the other. Thus, the chemistry of the linker must be compatible with whichever conjugation site and drug are selected.\n\nAn important property of these two reactive ends is the extent to which their conjugated products are cleavable by lysosomal proteases, acidic pH, and reducing conditions. Ideally, both antibody-linker-payload linkages would be completely stable in the blood, and only efficiently cleaved after delivery to the target cell. One strategy to release the warhead within the cell is to use dipeptide linkers such as valine-citrulline, which are C-terminally cleaved by cathepsin B in the lysosome. 230,231 Brentuximab vedotin is an ADC in clinical use with such a linker. A second strategy is to incorporate pH-sensitive linkages that allow for drug release specifically in the lysosome; for example, the hydrazone group which was mentioned previously for its acid lability. 230 Although ADCs like gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin have shown efficacy using such a linker, it is now appreciated that hydrazone groups may release the payload prematurely to increase off-target toxicity. 61,230 Thirdly, disulfide linkers are cleaved much more efficiently in the reducing environment within cells, and therefore also allow for targeted drug release. Sterically masking the disulfide bond may help to decrease reduction by low concentrations of reductant in the serum. 232 In contrast to cleavable linkers, linkers containing thioethers and other noncleavable groups may be used to decrease the chances of unintended systemic drug exposure. 230 For trastuzumab emtansine, drug release from the antibody does not occur until the antibody has been proteolytically degraded. Because the metabolic product contains the payload linked to an antibody-derived amino acid, it is vital that the payload retain activity even with the added bulk and charge. In one comparison of linker types, it was found that ADCs containing a non-cleavable linker",

Since it maintains the https://doi.org/10.4143/crt.2024.714 pISSN 1598-2998, eISSN 2005-9256 Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are a novel class of therapeutics that structurally are composed by an antibody directed to a tumor epitope connected via a linker to a cytotoxic payload, and that have shown significant antitumor activity across a range of malignancies including lung cancer. In this article we review the pharmacology and design of ADCs, as well as we describe the results of different studies evaluating ADCs in lung cancer directed to several targets including HER2, HER3, TROP2, MET, CEACAM5 and DLL3. \n\nADCs stability within the bloodstream, in plays a double role in both the toxicity and the activity profile of ADCs. Linker instability in this setting can lead to inappropriate or premature release of the cytotoxic payload and, in consequence, considerable toxicity. Conversely, an effective linker must also successfully release the cytotoxic payload once the ADC is internalized by the targeted cell; instead, the clinical activity of the ADC can be rather diminished [10]. \n\nLinkers are categorized into cleavable or non-cleavable according to their mechanism of payload release [11]: cleavable linkers degrade and release the cytotoxic payload on the basis of certain intracellular factors, such as acidity, glutathione reduction or the presence of lysosomal proteases leading to peptide cleavage [12,13]; on the other side, noncleavable linkers are formed by non-reducible bonds with the antibody amino-acid residues, leading to higher stability within the systemic circulation, and they release the payload through lysosomal-dependent degradation of the entire antibody-linker complex [14].",

The nature of the linker and spacer determines important features of ADCs, such as hydrophobic or lipophilic properties of payload, nontarget payload delivery, systemic toxicity, and most importantly, bystander killing [44]. The success of second-generation ADCs, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-Dxd) is largely attributed to cleavable linker technology. However, there is no consensus on which linkers are more promising. Selection of a linker depends on a variety of factors, including the target indication, payload size and toxicity, and the desired pharmacokinetics of the ADC. There are two large categories of linkers currently in use, including cleavable and non-cleavable ones. Cleavable linkers are further subdivided into three categories: peptide linkers (lysosomal enzyme sensitive), such as valine-citrulline linker (or vc linker), disulfide linkers (sensitive to reducing agents like glutathione), and hydrazone linkers (acid-sensitive). \n\nCleavable linkers have two major advantages compared to the non-cleavable moiety; increased site-specific activation and bystander killing effect. The first FDA-approved ADC, Mylotarg \u00ae , used a hydrazine-based acid-cleavable linker.

            "text": "The linker molecule connecting the antibody and the cytotoxic drug should keep the conjugate in bound form until the desired target site is reached [24] and is, hence, an important determinant of the pharmacokinetics and the therapeutic index of the conjugate [5]. Aside from circulatory stability and targeted release, one other key characteristic of a good linker is its low hydrophobicity, due to the fact that hydrophobic linkers can interact with the hydrophobic payloads, leading to aggregates that can possibly cause an immune reaction [25]. Linkers are principally categorized into two: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers release the payload either upon interacting with the low pH environment of the (endo)-lysosome, e.g., hydrazone linkers [26], or upon direct cleavage via lysosomal cathepsins [27], e.g., peptide linkers. A subgroup of cleavable linkers contains disulfide bonds that are sensitive to intracellular glutathione, releasing the payload upon the chemical reduction in these bonds by glutathione [28]. Such linkers might prove useful for the development of future ADCs for many cancers, including ovarian, head and neck, and lung cancers, since increased tumor glutathione levels have been reported in the literature for these cancers [5,29]. Non-cleavable linkers generally present higher levels of plasma stability [26] but require the cytotoxic molecule to remain active after complete lysosomal degradation [27]. Although the latter might appear as a disadvantage at first sight, there are reports of enhanced ADC cytotoxicity when conjugated with a non-cleavable linker in comparison to cleavable ones [27]-as demonstrated by the development of Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (Trastuzumab emtansine) by Phillips et al. [30]. Site-specific degradation mechanisms of non-cleavable linkers are actively being researched to improve their efficacy over cleavable counterparts [31].",

Because Labetuzumab govitecan lacks internalization, this ADC drug will produce certain toxicity after entering Phase I studies [8,172]. Most studies have shown that the toxic effects caused by ADCs in clinical settings are mainly related to the payload. \n\nDifferent ADC components have markedly distinct AE spectra, as observed in the comparison between noncleavable and cleavable linkers. Noncleavable linkers are stable in plasma but have limited efficacy at the target cell, while cleavable linkers are unstable in plasma, leading to off-target toxicity, but have higher efficacy at the target cell [8,173]. Our meta-analysis showed that ADCs with cleavable linkers resulted in a higher overall incidence of any-grade and grade \u2265 3 AEs compared with noncleavable linkers. ADCs with both cleavable and noncleavable linkers are associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal and hematological AEs; however, ADCs with only cleavable linkers mainly cause neurological AEs while ADCs with noncleavable linkers are mainly associated with ophthalmic AEs. We did not carry out any further investigation to determine if specific AEs were more common in particular cancer types (e.g., pneumonitis in lung cancer or colitis in gastrointestinal cancer). \n\nPayload analysis revealed the highest difference in the overall incidence of any-grade and grade \u2265 3 AEs. Most payloads used in ADCs are highly cytotoxic and mediate the AEs of most ADCs. Our results showed that various payload was associated with an increased risk of any-grade AEs, and PBD dimer SG3199 and calicheamicin were associated with increased risks of grade \u2265 3 AEs. SN-38, PBD dimer SG3199, and MMAEs cause adverse respiratory effects, such as pneumonia, skin toxicity, and neurotoxicity, while deruxtecan, camptothecin, SN-38, and calicheamicin mainly cause hematologic toxicity and MMAF causes ophthalmic toxicity.",

The payloads are potent chemotherapy agents that belong to distinct drugs classes including microtubule disrupters, DNA intercalators, and topoisomerase 1 inhibitors. It is estimated that only 0.1% of the delivered ADC reaches the tumoral area, on average, indicating that effective payloads can induce cytotoxicity at subnanomolar concentrations [5].

The release mechanism is believed to occur via internalization of the ADC, followed by the degradation in the lysosome, resulting in the release of the drug while still attached to the linker. As such, when the payloads could maintain the antitumor effects even if being chemically modified, the non-cleavable linker is a good choice. \n\nEarly studies that described non-cleavable linkers were aimed at amine-to-thiol coupling. One advantage of these linkers is their greater stability in the circulation compared with cleavable linkers, which can potentially improve the therapeutic index because it may be better tolerated. Senter found that MMAF, conjugated to a MAb via a non-cleavable maleimidocaproyl linker (cAC10-L4-MMAF), was approximately as potent as when conjugated via a cleavable peptidic linker (cAC10-L1-MMAF) against a large panel of cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, cAC10-L4-MMAF was tolerated at a dose more than three times higher than the MTD of cAC10-L1-MMAF. The half-lives of such non-cleavable linkers in circulation are much longer than those of earlier-generation cleavable linkers (Figure 8). Nearly all animals that received single ADC injections at 2 mg antibody component/kg body weight were cured. When lowering the dose to 1 mg/kg, there were two of six and three of six animals cured by cAC10-L1-MMAF4 and cAC10-L4-MMAF4 ADCs, respectively [81,82]. \n\nThe structural formulas of cAC10-L1-MMAF and cAC10-L4-MMAF.

ADCs have been used in many patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies. To date, twelve ADCs have received FDA approval, with numerous others in different clinical research stages [101,102]. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies (payloads) that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linkers have a key role in ADC outcomes because their characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and noncleavable, and both have been proven to be safe in preclinical and clinical trials. Cleavable linkers have been used in many ADCs, such as hydrazone linkers in gemtuzumab ozogamicin targeting CD33 for patients with AML, dipeptide (VC) MMAE linkers in brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) targeting CD30 for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, and SMCC linkers in trastuzumab emtansine targeting HER2 for HER2-positive breast cancers [101,102].\n\nThe cytotoxic drugs used as payloads are highly potent agents used to kill cancer cells. The microtubule inhibitors auristatins and maytansinoids are the drugs most frequently used for ADC development, in addition to the DNA synthesis inhibitors calicheamicin, doxorubicin and duocarmycins [101,103].\n\nAs the most important component of ADCs, the antibody can specifically identify and bind to a well-characterized tumor antigen receptor and deliver the payload to the tumor cell in the process. Currently, Nectin4, CD79b, CD22, CD33, HER2, CD30, FOLR1, and TROP2 are the antigens most often targeted by ADCs. In addition, over 70 other antigens are in different stages of clinical development [101,[103][104][105][106].",

Similarly, it needs to be considered that the inherent properties of the antibody, together with the conjugation chemistry, the linker, and the cytotoxic molecule used, strongly influence the druglike properties of the resulting conjugates and their stability. 5 It is known that reactive thiols present in plasma molecules, for example, in glutathione or Cys-34 in albumin, may react with the conjugates and reduce their stability in vivo. 6,7 In the context of artificial enzymes, for example, it is well known that the engineering of proximal amino acids in the active site can affect their activity significiantly. 8,9 Similarly, it is known that the chemical and steric environment of the conjugation site is known to modulate both the conjugation and deconjugation properties of the linkers and thus, in the latter case, their stability and efficacy. 10,11 Vollmar et al. reported that modulation of the pK a of the thiol of a cysteine residue could affect the stability of ADCs. Specifically, conjugates that present a higher thiol pK a yielded more stable conjugates. 12 On the other hand, the steric influence on the stability of conjugates attached by disulfide chemistry was studied by Steiner et al. Derivatives with longer linkers, and thus less steric hindrance, were reported to be more prone to reduction and concomitant drug release, resulting in a decreased stability of the conjugates. 13 The site of conjugation has also been reported to affect the extent of off-target cleavage of valinecitrulline linkers by serum proteases. 11",

            "text": "In the case of non-cleavable linkers, the antibody has to be completely degraded in lysosomes to allow cytosolic escape of the active metabolite which consists of the payload still attached by the linker to the single amino acid residue it has been conjugated to. For most ADCs, the payload is conjugated via maleimide or succinimide ester derivatization to \u03b5-amino groups of lysine residues or to free thiol-groups of reduced cystine disulfides naturally occurring in the targeting antibody. However, in recent years, site-specific conjugation has been achieved by recombinant substitution of certain antibody residues with cysteines or non-natural amino acids, like p-acetylphenylalanine or selenocysteine. Site-specific conjugation results in a more uniform drug-antibody ratio, and for certain conjugation sites, it produces better drug-linker stability leading to improved overall pharmacokinetic properties, efficacy, and safety of the ADC. \n\nThe payloads used for ADCs comprise two broad classes of agents: microtubule-disrupting and DNA-damaging agents. The former class is represented by auristatin analogs, maytansinoids, and tubulysins, all of which inherently only kill rapidly dividing cells by inducing mitotic arrest. While this property limits off-target toxicities in non-dividing normal cells, it also allows tumor stem cells to escape from treatment effects. By contrast, DNA-damaging agents represented by calicheamicins, duocarmycins, and pyrrolo-benzodiazepines (PBDs) bind to the minor groove of DNA and exert their mode of action independent of the cell cycle. While they all also kill tumor stem cells, their molecular modes of action differ. Calicheamicins, originally isolated from Actinomyces bacteria, induce site-specific DNA double-strand breaks. Duocarmycins, first isolated from Streptomyces bacteria, disrupt DNA architecture by irreversibly alkylating the nucleobase adenine at the N3 position.",

One of the main aims for the effective systemic delivery of an ADC is that the drug is released only at the target site; the linker, thus, must be stable enough in a biological environment (i.e., blood circulation) to avoid unwanted release of the pharmacological molecule. \n\nThere are two types of linkers available: cleavable and non-cleavable (Figure 3). The former can be used either in the design of either an internalizing or not internalizing ADC, because the release of the payload is required to take place in either the extracellular tumor environment, or within the lysosome or cytosol. This is possible because the extracellular environment of the tumor is highly reducing due to the presence of glutathione, which allows the release of payloads linked to the antibody via thiolic bonds. It also allows payload release via the degradation of peptide bonds in the presence of proteases such as Cathepsin B, whose overexpression in cancer drives its normal lysosomal localization towards extracellular secretion [24]. A cleavable linker, therefore, exploits differential conditions of reducing power or enzymatic degradation that can be present either outside or inside the target cell. Due to the chemical reactions needed to release the payload, the site of conjugation on the antibody is crucial to induce both stability in the plasma and availability to reduction or degradation on/into the target cell [25,26]. Non-cleavable linker-based ADC must, however, be internalizing, because to release their cytotoxic payload, the antibody component needs to be degraded by lysosomal or cytoplasmic proteases [27]. Furthermore, drugs linked to such linkers usually cannot exert a by-stander effect because upon degradation of the antibody by cellular proteases, they are released as fragments of antibody peptides that have a poor ability to permeate the cells.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is a therapeutic modality that aims to improve payload delivery specificity and reduce systemic toxicity. Considering the complex structure of ADCs, various bioanalytical methods by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), ligand binding assay (LBA) and hybrid LBA-LC-MS approaches have been established for ADC characterization and quantification. LCMS-based assays enable drug-antibody ratio (DAR) sensitive quantification of the conjugated payload. Typically, for quantitative, DAR-sensitive, assessment by LC-MS/MS,the conjugated payload is enzymatically liberated and quantified. Despite recent advances in ADC bioanalytical methods, the DAR-sensitive quantification of noncleavable linker ADCs by LC-MS/MS remains challenging. Thus, we developed a novel digestion-free middle-down mass spectrometry (DF-MDMS) using a collision-induced dissociation approach for absolute quantification of conjugated payload from four different ADCs in a biological matrix with minimum sample preparation. These results demonstrate that ADCs with different linker-payload structures can be quantified, including a noncleavable linker ADC, trastuzumab emtansine. It also shows that the assay sensitivity is comparable to the conventional ADC quantification method by linker-payload cleavage using enzyme, while the assay dynamic range depends on factors including payload ionization and dissociation efficiency, DAR and its distribution, and species abundance. By demonstrating absolute quantification of both cleavable and noncleavable linker ADCs, this novel middle-down ADC approach demonstrates its potential application in bioanalysis and analytical characterization, especially for early discovery where high-throughput screening is required as the new approach saves time and resources by not requiring enzymatic digestion for cleavable ADCs or development of anti-payload antibodies for noncleavable linker ADCs.",

            "text": "Chemical linkers are a fundamental component to attach a cytotoxic payload to a mAb and derive the efficient delivery of the payload but is also a key factor that describes the toxicity of an ADC. These linkers are comprised of various functional groups in order to conjugate the cytotoxic payload to the mAb as well as ideally controlling the distribution and release of the payload into the targeted cell [15,43]. This matter of release from the antibody carrier can cause potent off-target toxicities if released before entering the tumor and instead injuring healthy tissues. As these chemical linkers are an essential component in influencing the PK and TI of an ADC, the linker needs to be stable enough to allow for efficient drug release, but only at or in the targeted cells. The chemical linkers used currently are broadly grouped into two categories: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. As there are 100+ patents on various forms of chemical linkers, we refer readers to key review articles and discuss the core properties to consider below [44,45]. \n\nBy definition, cleavable linkers are characterized by a cleavage site located between the cytotoxic payload and the mAb. This cleavage can occur by physiological stimuli and by multiple different mechanism based on the specific linker chemistry: acid-labile hydrolysis, enzymatic, or reductive being the most employed [41, 45,46]. Acid-labile linkers, commonly containing hydrazones, are sensitive to the acidic pH environment of a lysosome and are employed by inotuzumab ozogamicin. These linkers typically show the best stability at a neutral pH, such as in circulation; however, extravascular cellular compartments can be slightly acidic and have been shown to cause premature release of the payload in clinical studies. Enzymatic cleavage, usually designed to be due to a lysosomal protease (e.g., a valine-citrulline bond), is employed by brentuximab vedotin. Finally, reduction of disulfide bonds is carried out by glutathione within the cytosol.",

Cleavable linkers were designed with a built-in chemical trigger to cleave the linker. They exploit the distinct characteristics between tumor cells and the systemic circulation to precisely release cytotoxic drugs. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers were usually designed with amino acid functional group to connect to the payload. Upon entering into the cells and particularly lysosomes, the amino acid-based linkage is cleaved via a proteolytic reaction to release the payload with an amino acid appendage 20 . The chemical properties of the linker affect the stability of the ADCs and the release of the payloads, which is also the major factor determining the toxicity of the ADCs 21 . An ideal linker is expected to be stable in the blood circulation and the anticancer drug payload should not be released prematurely in the blood to avoid causing non-specific toxicity to healthy tissues. When the ADCs reach the tumor surface and are transported into the lysosome, the linker should be rapidly disassembled to release the payload and exert an antitumor effect 7,22 . Another important property of the linker is hydrophilicity. It has been shown that linkers with too many hydrophobic groups tend to promote aggregation of the ADC molecules and cause severe hepatotoxicity 23,24 .",

Preliminary results in non-rituximab refractory patients are encouraging, with overall response rates in the 75-85% range and complete responses in the 50-60% range for both FL and DLBCL patients.\n\nDr. Gerber then discussed the properties of successful ADCs and the challenges associated with ADC development. He emphasized that successful ADCs show a trend toward longer half-life, higher copy number of the antigen and faster rate of internalization. In particular, the increased antigen copy number and rate of internalization are important because both affect the amount of drug entering the cell. He noted that the location of the release of the drug in the cell is important for success also. Dr. Gerber noted that challenges in ADC development include the lack of \"clean\" targets, i.e., those with no or limited expression on normal tissues, which ensures that the potent drugs used in ADCs are delivered selectively, target expression levels that are not predictive of pharmacology, liver metabolism and the empirical ADC lead selection process that results from a limited understanding of factors affecting pharmacology and safety. He suggested several strategies to address key ADC limitations, such as use of in vitro and in vivo biopanning and function first assays to identify tumor selective, fast internalizing ADC targets, use of site-specific conjugation technology to minimize off-target toxicity/liver metabolism of ADCs and sequential use of high throughput screening and rational drug design for payloads and linkers to help optimize the therapeutic index.\n\nIgG-based ADC in a mouse xenograft model despite the faster clearance (25-to 34-fold faster) of the diabody.\n\nDr. Blanc then discussed differences between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers that may affect safety and efficacy.

            "text": "In recent years, antibody-drug conjugates have become valuable assets in the field of molecularly targeted medicine. Antibody-drug conjugates are complex biological entities that combine a surface receptor-targeting antibody with a cytotoxic chemical [24]. This reduces the adverse effects on healthy cells/tissue that expresses minimal or no levels of the targeted antigen and enables the targeted distribution and internalization of a toxic payload by tumor cells that express the antigens targeted by the ADC (Fig. 2) [25]. Additionally, the chemical structure of the linker imparts distinct qualities to the various ADCs [24,25]. Antigen-depleting drugs featuring noncleavable thioether linkers necessitate internalization and degradation by lysosomes to exhibit their antitumor properties without causing harm to adjacent antigennegative cells [25]. In contrast, ADCs including cleavable linkers have the potential to discharge a portion of their lethal payload into the tumor microenvironment, resulting in the death of antigen-positive target cells as well as adjacent antigen-negative cells through the bystander effect. A multitude of tumor-antigens that are differently expressed in ovarian cancers are amenable to this innovative approach [26]. ADCs consist of three constituent elements: a synthetic chemical linker, a cytotoxic payload, and an antibody. Each component of an ADC contributes to a distinct characteristic, namely tumor selectivity, cytotoxicity, and biodistribution. The selection and formulation of individual components are critical in determining the therapeutic efficacy of an ADC.",

            "text": "ADCs consist typically of an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic payload through a linker (Fig. 2A). The underlying mechanism for all approved ADCs is the recognition of a cell surface antigen by the antibody moiety, internalization, payload release in the lysosome and tumour cell death. ADCs can also block oncogenic signalling pathways or induce antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) via their Fc region [35]. The field of ADC development is exploding, fuelled by antibody moieties targeting unique tumour associated antigens, and by technological innovations in ADC design. \n\nThere are currently 14 ADCs with FDA approval composed of 11 unique antibody targets (Table 1). Furthermore, ADCs with more than 50 unique targets are in different phases of clinical development and of these, approximately 85% focus on solid tumour indications, emphasizing the broad clinical scope of ADCs [36]. \n\nDespite their enormous potential for targeting a wide range of cancer types, ADC treatment is prone to toxicity-related side effects that arise from the antibody targeting healthy tissues as well as the premature, off-target release of their cytotoxic payload (Fig. 2B), narrowing expected therapeutic windows [37]. Additionally, ADCs can form long-lasting albumin-linker adducts, unintentionally increasing their halflife and systemic exposure [38]. \n\nTo address these challenges newer generations of ADCs incorporate structural innovations in their antibody, linker, and payload (reviewed in [39]; Figure 2C). These include bi-specific ADCs that simultaneously target two tumour antigens [40] and probody-drug conjugates, where the antigen-binding domain is only activated in the tumour microenvironment [41]. Advances in cleavable and non-cleavable linkers include variations in lengths and chemistry, enabling optimization of different drug-antibody ratios and the delivery of more than one payload class. Apart from potent chemotherapeutic agents, novel ADCs explore the potential of different payloads including immune-stimulating antibody conjugates [42] and proteolysis-targeting chimeras [43] (Fig. 2C).",

            "text": "The choice of suitable linkers is likewise the challenge for the development of effective ADCs. As a small and central part of ADCs, a linker is designed to be stable in the bloodstream and subsequently release the drug in its active form within or close to the target cells [32,33]. The role of linker is fundamental for efficient delivery of the cytotoxic drug, but it is also the determinant factor to the toxicity of an ADC product. Premature release of drugs in the circulation can result in systemic toxicity and a lower therapeutic index. \n\nNeutropenia is a kind of common toxicity for many ADCs conjugated to MMAE via protease cleavable valine-citrulline linkers such as Brentuximab vedotin, ASG-5ME, Glembatumumab vedotin, Indusatumab vedotin, Polatuzumab vedotin and PSMA-targeting ADC [20,[34][35][36][37][38]. Results showed that vc-MMAE-based ADC-induced neutropenia is due to a direct cytotoxic effect of released payload on differentiated neutrophils in the bone marrow [39]. Peripheral neuropathy is another important target-independent clinical toxicity associated with microtubule inhibitor ADCs leading to treatment discontinuation and/or dose reduction [40]. Microtubule inhibitors disrupt interphase microtubule function critical for the active transport of key essential proteins from the neuron cell body to distal synapses and ultimately result in peripheral neuropathy [41]. \n\nThe mechanism of drug release is an important consideration in linker selection. Both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers have been used in approved second-generation ADCs and in third-generation ADCs that are currently being investigated in clinical trials [42,43]. Collectively, linker stability during several days in the circulation and efficient cleavage upon delivery into the target cell, should be considered for effective linker design.",

            "text": "One area that has received much attention in ADC development is the chemistry of drug attachment. Factors important here include selection of a linker attachment site that retains antibody activity, linker length and composition and the design of drug analogs for attachment to the linker [51,53,54,82,90]. Two methods are commonly used for conjugating drugs to antibodies: alkylation of reduced interchain cysteine disulfides through an enzymatically non-cleavable maleimido or simple and cleavable disulfide linker (Figure 1a) and acylation of lysines by cleavable linear amino acids (Figure 1b). Spacers are usually essential extensions of the drug linkage and are responsible for avoiding the shielding of the active site of the antibody as well as improving solubility properties of ADCs (for example in by the use of polyethylene glycol). Cathepsin-cleavable linkers are also utilized (for example Val-Cit, or Phe-Lys) bound to self-emulative moiety PABA (p-aminobenzyl alcohol), enabling selective drug release in cancer cells [54], Notably, the linkage technologies used in ADCs are also applicable in PDCs enriching their conjugation repertoire as will be discussed later due course There are 8 interchain cysteines and up to 100 lysines available for conjugation on IgG1 antibodies and conjugation to these sites results in heterogeneous mixtures. Cysteine conjugates provide a greater degree of uniformity than lysine-based conjugates [91,92] while recombinant methods in which cysteines are introduced into the antibody backbone at specific sites result in still more uniform conjugation [93,94]. In some instances, it has been observed that the location of the conjugated drug is not as important as the stoichiometry of drug attachment, although this is difficult to ensure [91,93]. ADCs with two to four drugs per antibody are generally superior to more heavily loaded conjugates that tend to be cleared very rapidly from the circulation [95].",

            "text": "Non-cleavable linkers, including thioether and maleimidocaproyl (MC) types, offer significant advantages due to their stable chemical bonds, which prevent proteolytic cleavage and contribute to reduced off-target toxicity. These linkers enhance plasma stability, rendering them less susceptible to the chemical or enzymatic environment in vivo following the internalization of ADCs by target cells [144,145]. Once internalized, the antibody component of the ADCs is degraded within lysosomes, resulting in a complex of amino acids, linker, and cytotoxic agent. This mechanism ensures precise drug delivery to tumor cells, minimizing nonspecific drug release and reducing off-target effects [146]. Trastuzumab emtansine, the first ADC to utilize a non-cleavable linker, employs N-succinimidyl-4-(maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid (SMCC), a flexible dualreactive (amine/thiol) linker, to conjugate the cytotoxic agent DM1 (emtansine) to trastuzumab [147]. This ADC targets HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (HER2 + mBC) cells, and upon lysosomal degradation, releases lysine-MCC-DM1, leading to direct tumor cell killing [148]. Similarly, belantamab mafodotin, an approved ADC for R/R MM, utilizes the MC linker to attach cytotoxic agents to mAbs [149]. Furthermore, oxime-type and triazole-type linkers are now also employed in the design of non-cleavable linkers, such as in FS-1502, currently in phase III, which utilizes geranyl ketone pyrophosphate oxime to conjugate cytotoxins for HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2 + BC) [150]. Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy.",

            "text": "Linkers connect the antibody to the payload and are a key factor related to the stability of ADC and payload release profiles. Linkers are classified as cleavable and non-cleavable based on their cleavage mechanisms 20,21 , and are important for the eventual therapeutic index of the ADC 20 . Cleavable linkers are designed to break down and release the cytotoxic payload of the ADC in response to factors associated with the tumor; thus, by using the disparities between tumor cells and the systemic circulation, the payload is released in a guided, precise way. Cleavable linkers are divided into two classes, chemical (which include disulfide and hydrazone bond) and enzyme linkers (peptide and glucuronide bond) 20 . Hydrazone is a pH-sensitive linker, which allows for the ADC to remain stable in the systemic circulation and is hydrolyzed at specific pH (e.g., pH 4.8 induces release of the payload in lysosomes 20,22 . The degradation of cleavable linkers, therefore, can vary depending on a number of specific features, either outside or inside the target cell, such as external pH (acid-labile linkers), specific lysosomal proteases (protease-cleavable linkers) or glutathione reduction (disulfide linkers) 23 . Recent cleavable linkers (e.g., enfortumab vedotin, sacituzumab govitecan, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd)) 21 are stable in the systemic circulation, in contrast to non-cleavable linkers, e.g., ado-trastuzumab emtansine (TDM1). Non-cleavable linkers, meanwhile, are comprised of stable bonds which are more resistant to proteolytic cleavage in blood; following the internalization of ADCs by lysosomes or proteases, and subsequent antibody degradation, cleavage then occurs which then leads to release of the payload 23 .",

            "text": "Conjugates with a noncleavable linker may have an advantage of less toxicity vs. the conjugates with a cleavable linker, since these have to be specifically internalized for detachment from the carrier antibody, while the amino acid-appended metabolite of the drug, generated after intracellular metabolism, would be unable to diffuse through cell membranes. The greater efficacy and tolerability of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 with a stable linker vs. maytansinoid conjugates with cleavable disulfide linkers was noted in a previous section [68]. Polson et al. compared the conjugates of both maytansinoids as well as an auristatin group of tubulin polymerization-inhibiting drugs, using cleavable and noncleavable linkers in NHL models [78]. Conjugates of maytansinoids with a stable linker (MAb-MCC-DM1) or a cleavable disulfide bond (MAb-SPP-DM1) were evaluated. Likewise, in the auristatin group, MMAE conjugates contained a cleavable linker, while MMAF conjugates contained a stable linker. It was found that anti-CD22 conjugates of these drugs with noncleavable linkers were less toxic in rats than those with cleavable linkers with both groups of drugs, when administered at single i.v. dose of 20 mg protein dose per kilogram. The study also found that ADCs with cleavable linkers were effective in a broad range of targets, while those with noncleavable linkers were more selective in the tumor targets that could be treated. Thus, which type of linker to use is a function of the specific tumor target, the tolerability of drug to substitution, and the therapeutic window achievable.",

Optimal linkers are stable in the circulation, which prevents premature payload release and systemic toxicities, but then rapidly cleaved once internalised in malignant cells, promoting efficient cell death [19,20]. There are two types of linkers, classified based on the payload release mechanism: cleavable and noncleavable [21]. Cleavable linkers are designed to be degraded intracellularly, in response to a change from the extracellular environment to the intracellular environment [20]. There are a variety of triggers for the degradation of cleavable linkers, including specific lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B (which cleaves Val-Cit and Val-Ala linkers coupled with PABC), acidic pH (which cleaves hydrazone), and glutathione (which cleaves disulfide bonds) [20]. The majority of currently approved ADCs use cleavable linkers, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and inotuzumab ozogamicin [6,21]. The advantages of cleavable linkers are the intracellular release of the payload and stability in the circulation, while disadvantages include potential premature cleavage in the peripheral circulation [20,[22][23][24]. \n\nIn contrast, non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds that are resistant to proteolysis [21]. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers rely on the near complete degradation of the antibody component by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases, which leaves the payload attached to the linker and an amino acid residue derived from the antibody [21].",

            "text": "The basic principle of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) is to enhance the tumor selectivity of cancer treatment with highly cytotoxic small molecules by covalently linking them to antibody molecules directed against tumor-specific cell surface antigens. Although it sounds simple, this underlying principle has proven very difficult to implement in practice, as illustrated by the fact that two decades of ADC development efforts by biotech and pharma companies have so far only yielded four FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved, commercially available products. Currently, more than 150 ADC programs are being actively pursued in different stages of preclinical and clinical development [1]. Although few, the success stories prove that a therapeutic window can be achieved with ADCs despite the required use of payloads that are 100-1000 fold more cytotoxic than standard chemotherapeutics. Such extremely high cytotoxic potency of the payloads is necessary because only a very small portion of the applied dose of an ADC is actually delivered to the targeted tumor (depending on the antibody used between 0.003%-0.08% of injected dose/g tumor), while the vast remainder distributes throughout the body, where it is antigen-independently taken up and catabolized by non-target cells. Therefore, it is not too surprising that clinical dosing is limited by adverse effects that are typically off-target and are determined primarily by the combined effect of the linker/conjugation chemistry and the payload used. \n\nADC linkers are either non-cleavable or cleavable. In the latter case, depending on the chemical nature of the linker, either low pH or lysosomal enzymes or reducing conditions promote cleavage, which allows the payload to escape from endosomes or lysosomes to the cytosol and to exert its cytotoxic effect. In the case of non-cleavable linkers, the antibody has to be completely degraded in lysosomes to allow cytosolic escape of the active metabolite which consists of the payload still attached by the linker to the single amino acid residue it has been conjugated to.",

            "text": "Furthermore, induction by the payloads of potentially immunogenic cell death in treated tumors [15] suggests a rationale for combining ADCbased therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. \n\nThe field of ADCs is rapidly expanding with currently more than 50 ADCs at different stages of clinical development. Of note, the majority of these ADCs employ a cleavable linker to attach an antibody to a tubulin-targeted payload. Cleavable linkers are associated with a Bbystander effect,^whereby cleavage of the linker results in the release of a membrane-permeable, active toxin, which mediates killing of target-positive cells, but also induction of Bbystander^death in neighboring, nonantigen-expressing cells. PF-06263507 was selected to comprise a 5T4 antibody linked to MMAF via a noncleavable mc linker, as this particular construct showed an improved therapeutic potential compared with several other conjugates that used cleavable auristatins or other payloads [2,29]. A further reduction in off-target toxicity may be achieved with antibody-drug conjugates generated by drug conjugation to genetically encoded antibody sites (site-specific conjugation), which minimizes heterogeneity, increases stability, and enhances PK properties and overall efficacy of the immunoconjugates [30]. \n\nIn conclusion, the 5T4 ADC PF-06263507 was generally well tolerated at the estimated MTD of 4.34 mg/kg on a once-every-3-week schedule. At higher doses, ocular toxicities were dose-limiting. The RP2D for future studies of PF-06263507 in patients selected for 5T4 tumor expression is 4.34 mg/kg.",

            "text": "The immense research effort put into ADC linker-payload design during the past decade has contributed to a sharp increase in regulatory approvals. However, ADC development still faces dose-limiting toxicity issues during clinical trials, which could be partly attributed to the systemic release of the payload and poor PK properties. The development of more stable linker systems in mouse and rat plasma would accelerate the preclinical evaluation of the ADC drug candidates. In particular, the identification of new peptide/peptidomimetic sequences will allow highly specific cleavage, which can greatly reduce premature cleavage of the linker at non-tumor sites, hence increasing the safety profiles of the ADCs. Obviously, the linker systems reviewed herein apply only to typical ADCs which rely on binding to an internalizing antigen and subsequent receptor-mediated endocytosis to release the payload via lysosomal degradation. Nevertheless, recent years have also seen growing interest in developing an atypical class of ADCs targeting poorlyor non-internalizing antigens on cancer cells or components of surrounding tumor stroma. For these ADCs, the linkers are cleaved extracellularly within the tumor microenvironment to release the payload, which can then diffuse into nearby cancer cells for selective killing. However, the design of such linker systems is beyond the scope of the current review. The readers are advised to refer to an excellent recent review article by Ashman et al. for a comprehensive account on this topic [55]. In addition to linker design, site-specific conjugation using engineered antibodies and enzyme systems now enables the development of homogeneous ADCs with superior PK properties. The use of a site-specific conjugation method also allows for payload attachment at sites that can enhance systemic stability of the prepared ADCs. The use of improved linker-payload designs and highly active payloads in combination with site-specific conjugation chemistry will lead to more successes in the ADC field in the future.",

            "text": "Specific site conjugation has significantly enhanced ADC development by allowing for precise control over drug linkage sites, thus improving product uniformity and therapeutic profile. While cysteine conjugation currently dominates among clinically approved ADCs, emerging strategies like AJICAP and AJICAP-M hold promise to further enhance the quality and versatility of ADCs [37]. The AJICAP and AJICAP-M technologies are prominent examples of advanced conjugation techniques. AJICAP utilizes maleimidebased chemistry to conjugate drugs to specific cysteine residues on antibodies. AJICAP-M expands this technology to accommodate a broader range of drugs and antibodies with varying specificities and affinities [38]. These conjugation methods offer significant advantages, including the enhanced reproducibility and uniformity of conjugates, reduced drug quantities required for conjugation with process optimization, improved purification, and a minimized risk of free drug in the final product [38,39]. AJICAP-M enables the conjugation of a wider array of drugs using the same technique, thereby facilitating payload diversification without significant procedural changes [38][39][40]. \n\nLinkers must maintain the ADC's stability in the bloodstream to ensure it reaches the cancer cell intact, but they must also be able to be easily cleaved upon internalization (cleavable linkers) to release the payload. Alternatively, non-cleavable linkers should form an innocuous element after releasing the payload, allowing it to still exert its therapeutic effect [6,22,23,[25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. Cleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the tumor microenvironment over healthy tissues or systemic circulation. They can be released from the antibody by changes in pH or by enzymes present in the intercellular and intracellular space. These types of linkers generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload capable of promoting bystander killing [31,[41][42][43][44][45].",

            "text": "An important consideration impacting the pharmacokinetics of an ADC is the stability of linker. Ideally the linker should be stable in circulation to minimize toxicity but release the active cytotoxin once it is internalized by the tumor cell. The linkers can be categorized as cleavable and non-cleavable, with varying degrees of stability (1,31). Cleavable linkers use mechanisms within the cells or cellular compartments to release active cytotoxin, such as low pH (acid labile linkers), glutathione levels (disulfide linkers), and lysosomal proteases (protease cleavable linkers). In contrast, for non-cleavable linkers (e.g. thioether linkers), the entire ADC has to be degraded to release the active cytotoxin. The three advanced ADCs all use different linker types (1,31): peptide based protease cleavable linker (Adcetris\u00ae, linker: MC-vc-PAB), non-cleavable thioether linker (Kadcyla\u00ae, linker: MCC), and acid-labile hydrazone linker (Mylotarg\u00ae, linker: AcBut). The comparison of the Tab profile with the conjugated antibody profile allows for an assessment of linker stability as shown conceptually in Fig. 5, where the conjugated antibody concentrations for the more unstable linker decline much faster compared to that of the stable linker. \n\nDifferent types of linkers used on the same antibody can impact its pharmacokinetics as illustrated by the following examples. The pharmacokinetics of anti-HER2 ADCs was determined in mice using disulfide linkers with different hindered structures (32). The clearance of the ADC decreased with the increase in the degree of hindrance of the disulfide linker as follows: SPDP-DM1 (least hindered) > SPP-DM1 > SSNPP-DM3 > SSNPP-DM4 (most hindered).",

            "text": "First generation oncology ADCs in the 1990s were based on murine or chimeric antibodies which were plagued with immunogenicity issues [16] and linker instability [17]. Immunogenicity of protein therapeutics has a critical impact on the pharmacokinetics and drug disposition and ultimately clinical success [18,19]. These molecules were designed to deliver a variety of protein toxins [20] and microtubule binding drugs [21] as the cytotoxic payloads. Limited antigen density on tumors, low potency of the payloads, and the low average drug-antibody-ratio (DAR ~3-4) prevented efficacious quantity of drug delivered, which was proposed to be one of the reasons for initial ADC failures, while higher DAR conjugates suffered from toxicity and low therapeutic index. Second generation ADCs from the last 10+ years approved by the FDA were armed humanized antibodies coupled to stabilized linkers and more potent payloads, such as auristatins, calicheamicins, and maytansinoids (Table 1). \n\nIn an ideal situation, ADC payloads should be inactive in circulation when conjugated to an antibody via a linker and remain stably conjugated until the conjugate reaches the target of interest. Upon internalization of the conjugate-target complex, active payload is released inside target cells after lysosomal degradation of the linker or the antibody itself. In addition to reducing target-independent uptake, conjugate stability remains crucial for specific delivery and distribution of payload to the target tissue from systemic circulation. Conjugation sites, chemistries and linker designs coupled with DAR load greatly affect plasma stability, biophysical properties, and consequently pharmacokinetics of the conjugate. Next generation ADCs will likely incorporate fully human antibodies with site-specific conjugation and novel linkers to reduce immunogenicity and optimize biodistribution and payload delivery. These topics will be discussed in this review.",

            "text": "A novel type of therapy that has recently been investigated in the clinical setting is the antibody drug conjugates (ADC). ADC are mAb against a specific tumor target on the surface of malignant cells that carry a small cytotoxic agent (payload), such as microtubule inhibitors and agents damaging DNA, utilizing a cleavable or non-cleavable linker [139,140]. When it reaches its target, the ADC is internalized with eventual release of the payload into the cytoplasm of malignant PCs, leading to cell death [140] (Figure 3). Cleavable linkers are degradated by enzymes in the cytoplasm of the malignant cells, whereas non-cleavable linkers require processing and degradation of the mAb complex into the lysosomes in order to release the toxic payload [140]. The target of ADC should ideally be a molecule highly expressed on the surface of malignant PCs with very low or no expression on other cell types, including hematopoeitic cells, to avoid systemic toxicity [141]. ADC can also exert their effects via ADCC, ADCP, or CDC [142,143]. a chimeric antigen receptor on their surface, which targets specific tumor antigens of malignant plasma cells. Similarly, bispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies targeting both an antigen on the malignant MM cells and simultaneously an antigen on the surface of physiologic T cells, creating an immunologic bridge. ADC are monoclonal antibodies against antigenic epitopes on the surface on MM cells, carrying a cytotoxic payload. The binding of the above agents to their antigenic targets on malignant MM cells leads to activation of the immune system, with subsequent destruction of the MM cells.",

DM1 was coupled to the lysine residue of trastuzumab via a non-cleavable linker, succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) [21]. Since the linker was non-cleavable, T-DM1 could turn to an active state only by digestion in the lysosome after internalization. T-DM1 was an effective drug for HER2-positive breast cancer; hence, it was approved by the FDA in 2013 [22]. Linker improvements in second-generation ADCs achieved better plasma stability and harmonized DAR distribution. The cytotoxicity and coupling of payloads in second-generation ADCs were also improved, and the increase of payloads' water solubility reduced the occurrence of antibody aggregation. \n\nIn addition, some of the second-generation ADCs utilized cleavable linkers, such as Adcetris and Polivy for lymphoma treatment [23,24]. These ADCs with cleavable linkers can cause a bystander effect in vivo, referring to the phenomenon that payloads can be released and kill surrounding cells. Despite the considerable safety advances of second-generation ADCs, the shadow therapeutic window due to off-target toxicity is still a challenge for ADCs [25].",

            "text": "The linker plays a major role in ADC design since it strongly impacts on the safety, potency and activity of the ADC. Most importantly, the linker is expected to remain stable in circulation to avoid premature detachment of the drug while allowing its release within the targeted cell. Two categories of linkers have been developed and can be distinguished based on their cleavability. Cleavable linkers are either sensitive to pH for hydrazone linkers, to glutathione or disulfide isomerase for disulfide linkers and to proteases such as cathepsin B for dipeptide bonds. Non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation of the antibody moiety, thereby conserving at least one amino acid, most commonly lysine or cysteine, attached to the payload-linker complex. This approach improves the linkage stability since antibody digestion is required for payload release. While it is emphasized that the more stable the linker is, the less off-target toxicity it triggers, these technologies were often found to be too stringent to support anti-tumoral activity. Safety of ADCs remains a major challenge in their design and ontarget in addition to off-target toxicity is not only driven by the instability of the linker-payload. On-target toxicity is rather always driven by the mAb and its affinity/avidity to the target, together with the payloads' mechanism of action, again illustrating how important the match between tumor type, target antigen and ADC construction is recent interest in linker design improvement has led to the development of hydrophilic linkers to balance payload hydrophobicity [26][27][28][29]. Sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polysarcosine (PSAR) or more recently DNA-based linkers have significantly improved ADC stability and pharmacokinetics, leading to less toxic and more active ADCs [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37].",

            "text": "The linker is a very essential part of protein conjugation, especially for ADCs. Linker chemistry can be tuned to impart adequate stability for protein drugs [150]. As mentioned above, PEGylation is an example of using hydrophilic PEG linkers to improve drug efficacy [151]. There are many factors to consider when choosing linkers for ADCs. Nevertheless, one of the most important of them is the stability of the linker throughout its presence in the plasma, while it must break down as soon as it enters the target cell (in the form of a conjugate with ADCs) and leads to the activation of the released anti-cancer drugs [152]. There are cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. The cleavable linkers are cleaved by chemical or biochemical changes in the environment such as acidic changes for hydrozone linkers and glutathione or high pH values for disulfide linkers. Some other cleavable linkers contain enzymatic digestion sites and are sensitive to the enzymes inside the vesicle such as valine-citrulline di-peptides for cathepsin B enzyme. On the other hand, the non-cleavable linkers depend on the complete digestion of the antibody after entering the vesicle [153]. \n\nAmong the important reasons that led to the removal of Mylotarg from the marketing list in 2010 were items such as the instability of the hydrazine linker and its payload release [154,155]. More recently, Trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) 1 with a non-cleavable linker is the first generation of ADCs approved for the treatment of HER2 (human epider-mal growth factor receptor 2)-positive breast cancer. Second-generation ADCs targeting HER2, trastuzumab duocarmazine (SYD985), was characterized to supersede T-DM1 by overcoming all resistance using a cleavable linker and a more potent payload, duocarmycin (DUBA) via different conjugation chemistry.",

            "text": "The structure of an ADC involves three major components, the mAb, the cytotoxic drug (payload) and a linker molecule [13,14]. The antibody binds to a specific antigen on the surface of cancer cells, followed by internalization of the conjugate by endocytosis and release of its cytotoxic payload after lysosomal degradation [13,14]. To ensure appropriate delivery of the drug to the target, it is important to ensure that the target is specific, thus expressed at high levels in tumor tissues and sparing as much as possible normal cells. High binding affinity and ability of the antigen-antibody complex to internalize after binding are also crucial steps, otherwise risk of toxicity from release to neighboring non-target cells increases [13,14]. Homogenous expression of the antigen within tumors as well as accessibility of the antigen from the bloodstream are important to maximize the availability of ADC to the target [13,14]. Immunogenicity of the antibody has been a limitation before due to mouse-derived antibodies; however development of humanized and fully human antibodies has minimized this concern [13]. \n\nCertain characteristics of the linker are also critical for the success of ADC-based therapy. Stability of the linker in the bloodstream enables the drug to be released only after binding to the target and avoid systemic toxicities. Depending on their intracellular stability and way of degradation, linkers are divided into cleavable and non-cleavable [13]. Cleavable linkers become unstable under the low pH, protease-enriched environment of lysosomes or high intracellular level of glutathione. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers are stable and solely depend on lysosomal degradation to release their payload [13,23]. \n\nThe payload is the cytotoxic drug which is responsible for the antitumor effect and reaches high concentrations in the tumor.",

            "text": "Linkers play a crucial role in the pharmacokinetics, drug efficacy, and safety of ADCs. It is imperative for the stability of linkers within the circulatory system to prevent the premature release of cytotoxic drugs from ADCs, as this may result in off-target toxicity. However, these linkers must be designed to be unstable under specific conditions to facilitate the delivery of the drug payload into tumor cells. There are two main types of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers undergo hydrolysis, protease cleavage, or disulfide bond cleavage within early endosomes or secondary endosomes, allowing the release of potent cytotoxic drugs. A commonly utilized mechanism involves the action of glutathione, where cleavable linkers are designed to be sensitive to glutathione. This sensitivity leads to linker cleavage, subsequently releasing the therapeutic payload into the intracellular environment. This mechanism capitalizes on the reducing properties of glutathione, facilitating controlled drug release specifically within the intracellular space (Baah et al., 2021). Examples of ADCs utilizing this cleavable linker mechanism include brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, and polatuzumab vedotin, which employ a pH-sensitive hydrazone linker (Sonawane et al., 2017). On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are resistant to cleavage and remain intact after being fused to the lysosome. The acidic environment generated by the lysosomal proton pump promotes protein degradation through cathepsin B or plasmin-mediated pathways. Studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linkers exhibit greater stability in blood compared to cleavable linkers (Jain et al., 2015). Furthermore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers present a reduced risk of systemic toxicity caused by premature payload release when the drug payload is released within the lysosome. The FDA has approved T-DM1 and mafodotin belantamab as examples of ADCs utilizing non-cleavable linkers (Tong et al., 2021).",

            "text": "The use of EVCit or similar peptide linkers (e.g., EVA, DVCit, DVA) could serve as a simple but powerful solution to salvage many types of ADCs previously abandoned due to linker instability in mouse models. The high polarity of the EVCit linker could also help mitigate the aggregation and fast clearance issues associated with hydrophobic high-DAR ADCs 38 . In addition, EVCit linkers may be preferentially chosen over non-cleavable linkers in the future design of various ADCs. Non-cleavable linkers are designed to withstand proteolytic degradation in circulation. They have been successfully used for constructing potent ADCs along with MMAF 39 , monomethyl auristatin D (MMAD) 40 , and emtansine (DM1) 7,8 . However, the use of non-cleavable linkers reportedly attenuates or nullifies ADC potency of some payload molecules including doxorubicin 39 , monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) 34,39 , a hydrophilic auristatin derivative 41 , and a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer (PBD) 34 . Attenuation of ADC potency arises because non-cleavable linkers lack a defined cleavage mechanism; after intracellular protein degradation, final active metabolites retain the linker component. It has been demonstrated that this drawback can be circumvented in some cases by fine-tuning the chemical structures of the linker and payload 42,43 . However, the success of such efforts depends on the choice of the linker installation sites, conjugation modality, and payload. Indeed, as we have demonstrated in this and previous reports 29 , our branched linker technology requires both adequate spacers and cleavable mechanisms within the linker scaffold for maximal ADC potency. These components are critical to alleviate the structural congestion and to ensure rapid payload release in an active form from each linker arm. \n\nIn summary, our findings support the conclusion that the EVCit linker technology is a significant contribution to efforts for developing next-generation ADCs and other drug conjugates.",

Less immunogenic and more selective high affinity antibody carriers have been designed and selected. Toxic payloads have evolved from radio isotope and conventional chemotherapeutics to more potent cytotoxic agents, such as calicheamicin, maytansinoids and auristatins. Several types of cleavable (labile) or non-cleavable (stable) linkers, for example, disulfide linkers and acid-and peptidase-labile linkers, have been developed [31] . The conjugation technologies have advanced to a point where both the site and stoichiometry of drug attachment to the carrier antibody can be controlled. In the near future, the research focus of the area will be to identify even more potent payloads and to develop better conjugation strategies including further improvement in linker design and conjugation chemistry and efficiency. Other areas that critically need to be addressed include establishment of analytic platforms for manufacturing and process development (chemistry, manufacturing and control, CMC) and clinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assays, and development of preclinical toxicology and pharmacology assessment protocols to satisfy the regulatory and safety requirement.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) consist of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) and a cytotoxic drug (small molecule drug) associated through a linker. The target antigen should be expressed at high density on malignant cells and have limited expression on cells of normal tissues. The cytotoxic drug (most frequently auristatins, maytansinoids, and calicheamicins) must be highly potent to kill tumor cells at the intracellular concentrations that can be achieved with mAb-mediated delivery. They are designed to induce tumor cell death by causing irreversible DNA damage or interfering with the mechanism of cell division. ADCs are designed with linkers that release biologically-active drug following antigen-specific internalization and trafficking to lysosomes. The \"cleavable\" linkers rely on intracellular processes to release the cytotoxic drug, such as reduction of disulfide bonds mediated by glutathione (GSH) in the cytoplasm, exposure to acidic conditions (pH ~4) in the lysosome, or cleavage by specific proteases. Conversely, \"non-cleavable\" or \"stable\" linkers require catabolic degradation of the antibody to release the cytotoxic drug. Following administration in patients, ADCs consist of a sum of antibody species carrying different numbers of cytotoxic molecules, varying from zero (unconjugated) to ~7-8, for which the average value is the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). In principle, the distribution and elimination of the different entities varies, translating to decreasing average DAR during the course of the dosing interval. \n\nPhase 1 studies of ADCs generally enroll patients with advanced cancer, whose disease is usually refractory to available treatment, in order to evaluate the safety and toxicity of new therapeutic agents; document the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of those agents; determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), which is defined as the highest dose with a relatively low risk of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT); and to determine an appropriate dose level/regimen for phase 2 trials.",

This toxicity can be categorized into target-dependent toxicity (also known as on-target toxicity, Figure 1(b)), resulting from low target expression in healthy cells, and target-independent toxicity (off-target toxicity), arising from premature payload release, nonspecific endocytosis, or ADC receptor-mediated endocytosis (Figure 1(c)). Detailed mechanisms of ADC toxicity were extensively reviewed in previous articles. 2,17 l three components of ADCs-mAb, payload, and linker-can contribute to their toxicity, though the payload is primarily responsible for the majority of reported adverse effects. 18,19 imilar toxicities have been frequently reported with ADCs utilizing the same payloads. For example, grade \u2a7e3 anemia, neutropenia, and peripheral neuropathy were frequently observed in ADC with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payloads, such as enfortumab vedotin (EV), brentuximab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, and pinatuzumab vedotin. 20 Furthermore, thrombocytopenia and hepatic toxicity were commonly noted with ADC with mertansine (DM1), such as T-DM1. 20 Common payload-related toxicities are summarized in Table 1. \n\nWhile the linker appears nontoxic, its stability profoundly influences the overall toxicity profile. Linkers are categorized as either cleavable or noncleavable, depending on the presence of a chemical trigger within their structure. 21 A non-cleavable linker, lacking a chemical trigger, remains stable in systemic circulation until lysosomal release following internalization into target cells. By contrast, cleavable linkers possess a chemical trigger within their structure, enabling cleavage by envi-release in extra-tumoral compartments. 22 This instability enhances ADC efficacy through bystander effects 22 ; however, premature payload release is associated with increased off-target toxicity. 2,19,23",

ADCs combine the targeting property and favorable pharmacokinetics (PK) of a mAb with the cytotoxic properties of highly potent cytotoxic agents to provide a class of drugs with an improved therapeutic window. Currently, two ADCs, ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla \u2122 ) (1) and brentuximab vedotin (ADCETRIS \u2122 ) (2) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and at least 20 investigational ADCs are in different stages of development for treating solid tumors and hematological malignancies (3,4). The linker component, which links the antibody with the cytotoxic agent, is an essential part of ADC design and determines the stability of an ADC in vivo (3). Several linker types, including acid labile linker, protease labile linker, noncleavable linker and disulfide linker have been used for these ADCs (3). \n\nSeveral monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) containing ADCs using the protease-labile di-peptide linker (maleimidocaproylvaline-citrulline-p-aminobenzoyloxycarbonyl [MC-VC-PABC]) (Genentech data on file) are in clinical development (Fig. 1). Each MMAE containing ADC is administered as a mixture of components with different drug to antibody ratios (i.e., different DAR species), ranging from 0 to 8 molecules of cytotoxic drugs per antibody molecule, with an average DAR of approximately 3.5-3.6 (Genentech data on file). \n\nADCs demonstrate a unique mechanism of action and complex composition and their distribution, catabolism and elimination processes are not yet well understood.",

            "text": "ADCs are the main hub gathering most of the site-specific protein modification approaches due to their therapeutic potential in cancer (Chau et al., 2019). ADCs combine the specific recognition of tumor-expressing antigens by antibodies with the cellular toxicity of drugs (also named payloads) into a targeted therapeutic construct. Many aspects of ADCs design are essential for their function and are not covered in this perspective but have been thoroughly addressed in recent reviews (Rodrigues andBernardes, 2016, 2018;Thomas et al., 2016;Chau et al., 2019). We focused instead, in the linker development, the part of the ADCs that require site-specific protein modification methods. Linkers are especially important and required careful consideration if good stability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are envisioned (Jain et al., 2015;Mccombs and Owen, 2015;Tsuchikama and An, 2018). To allow the ADC to achieve maximum therapeutic potential linkers have to connect the payload to the antibody and be able to resist premature cleavage (cleavable and non-cleavable linkers) whilst promoting the rapid release (cleavable linkers) of the payload once the ADC is internalized, a multifaceted task (Beck et al., 2017). Linker chemistries are plenty and focused mostly on modification of lysines and cysteines. Initially, stochastic modification of lysines was employed but proved to be rather suboptimal, as some of the random modifications altered the ADCs' antigen-binding properties, which highlighted the need to control the exact site of modification (Panowski et al., 2014;Matos et al., 2018). In this context, cysteine conjugation offers more space to decrease linker heterogeneity and allow site-specific modifications due to its relative low abundance. Methods to achieve these features include the use of next generation maleimides (NGMs) to produce ADCs via functional disulfide bridging and the development of cysteine-specific carbonylacrylic reagents (Nunes et al., 2015;Bernardim et al., 2016Bernardim et al., , 2019)).",

            "text": "ADCs are mAbs with covalently bound cytotoxic drugs via a linker, which are designed to target tumor antigens selectively and offer the hope of cancer treatment to decrease the off-target toxicity, thereby, improving the therapeutic index of the cytotoxin [41,46]. ADCs are usually comprised of 0 to 8 cytotoxic payloads with an average DAR of 2 to 4 per mAb, which are thus heterogeneous mixtures of conjugates. Given that low payloads reduce potency and high payloads negatively impact PK, the DARs can have a significant impact on ADC efficacy [3]. Structurally, the antibody component of the ADC accounts for the majority of the therapeutic agent (approximately 98 % of total ADC by molecular weight). Biologically, the PK of ADCs is strongly influenced by the underlying antibody backbone conferring properties such as target specific binding, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-dependent recycling and Fc (fragment, crystallizable) effector functions [24]. Compared with the unconjugated antibody, ADCs can exhibit somewhat higher clearance due to introduction of an additional metabolic pathway (i.e. cleavage of the drug from the antibody by lysosomal peptide degradation). Furthermore, linker stability, DAR and site of drug conjugation can largely impact PK behaviors and distribution as well. Conjugation with higher DAR tends to have faster clearance than conjugation with lower DAR as an example of cAC10-vc MMAE ADCs with high DARs exhibiting a faster total antibody clearance than lower DAR ADCs [47]. Variable DARs and attachment sites by a consequence of current random conjugation methods result in heterogeneous ADCs with PK parameters that can vary substantially compared to the unconjugated antibody [24]. Hamblett et al. compared ADCs with different drug loading (MMAE conjugated to the anti-CD30 mAb) and concluded that the therapeutic index was increased by decreasing drug loading per antibody, demonstrating that drug loading is a key design parameter for antibody-drug conjugates [47]. It was shown that the terminal half-lives did not directly correlate with drug loading.",

There is probably no universal conjugate-linkage strategy optimal for all antibody-drug conjugates. It is necessary that each pair of antibody/drug be optimized to obtain the best therapeutic outcome. New linkers can be designed to improve water solubility (e.g. PEGylation) and tumor selectivity (e.g. enzymatic-cleavable, photocleavable, proton cleavable) [72]. This will substantially reduce the heterogeneity of ADCs and toxicity. Based on current development of the ADCs using DNA-damaging agents, we summarize that the ideal properties for a linker are as follows: (1) stable during circulation and (2) cleavable after binding to the target or internalization.",

For instance, cleavable pyrophosphate-diester linkers in site-specific, glucocorticoid-bearing ADCs outside of oncological setting [51]; \u03b2-galactosidase-cleavable linkers for trastuzumab-MMAE conjugates [52] and dual enzyme-cleavable linkers (e.g., 3-O-sulfo-\u03b2-galactose linker), subjects of sequential cleavage by distinct lysosomal enzymes (e.g., arylsulfatase A and \u03b2-galactosidase) have demonstrated encouraging findings [53]. In the construction of dual-drug ADCs, flexible linkers contribute in the successful co-delivery of payloads with synergistic cytotoxic mechanisms [54]. Recently, Spangler et al. described a novel linker format, named as Fe(II)-reactive 1,2,4-trioxolane (TRX), which reacts with labile ferrous iron in cancerous tissue to induce a more tumor-selective drug release [55]. This TRX-linker limits the on-target-off-tumor toxicity upon uptake by adjacent healthy cells. A first-inclass platinum (II)-based metal-organic linker (Lx) was designed to surpass conventional linkage pitfalls, such as premature release. In preclinical studies, Lx-based ADCs have shown favorable safety profile and potency [56]. At the end, additional linkers including non-covalent DNA linkers (e.g., based on complementary oligonucleotide hybridization and base-pairing) [57] as well as photo-cleavable linkers on UV light-controlled ADCs [58], are also under clinical testing. \n\nConjugation affects the ADC stoichiometry and homogeneity, crosslinking the cytotoxic drug-linker moiety to the antibody vehicle.",

            "text": "The simplified picture presented in Figure 1b might lead to the false understanding that taking an antibody and a toxic payload connected through some simple linker would give a drug. The facts that the first ADC (Mylotarg) was approved in 2000 (and following withdrawal in 2010 reapproved in 2017) and that the second ADC (Adcetris) received accelerated approval in 2011 and full approval in 2015 (Table 1) suggest otherwise. The third (Kadcyla) and fourth (Besponsa) ADCs were approved in 2013 and 2017, respectively. The slow start is proof of a long and complex learning phase, but the sustained efforts of the pharmaceutical industry seem to bear fruit. Since 2019, the number of approved ADCs more than doubled with five approvals in 2019-2020, signifying a better understanding of both the biology and chemistry of ADCs. Although in the present review we focus on conjugates bearing small molecules, it is important to note that conjugates with peptide toxins are also of therapeutic value exemplified by the approved drugs listed at the end of Table 1. \n\nThere are several changing parts in an ADC and apparently there is no generic formula to succeed. Thus, questions remain concerning: how to select the right antibody, where and how to attach the linker to the antibody, what kind of chemical linker to use to connect the antibody to the drug payload, how many drug molecules to attach per antibody, how to connect the linker and the drug payload, and what is the optimal drug payload like? Presuming that the biological background is robust, if we want to succeed in ADC development, we need to get the answer to all the above questions right, resulting in a unique combination of A-antibody, D-drug payload, and C-linker. In the following chapters, we review some of the key challenges and recent learnings focusing on the diverse aspects of ADC development where chemistry plays an important role.",

            "text": "Linkers for ADCs can be classified into cleavable and non-cleavable ones. Non-cleavable linkers, e.g., the one in trastuzumab emtansine (Figure 3a), remain attached to the cytotoxic drug after proteolytic degradation of the antibody in the lysosome. The drug, with an attached linker and an amino acid or short proteolytic peptide to which the linker is conjugated, is released to the cytosol and exerts its cytotoxic activity [129,130]. Cleavable linkers, on the other hand, are cleaved by lysosomal enzymes, or by low pH or a reducing environment inside endosomes; the drug-attached fragment after cleavage is typically removed by self-immolative reaction, releasing the free cytotoxic payload [131]. Brentuximab vedotin, for example, has a cathepsin-cleavable linker (valine-citrulline linker), and MMAE is released by the self-immolative reaction of the remaining linker fragment [101]. \n\nRegardless of the type, the linker for ADC has to be highly stable in blood in order to minimize the release of highly cytotoxic free drugs into circulation and to maintain maximum amount of intact ADC molecules targeting cancer cells. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg\u2122) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa\u2122), for example, both have an acid-labile hydrazone linker, which is relatively stable at pH 7.4 but hydrolyzed with high efficiency in the acidic environment of lysosome [74]. However, the acid-labile hydrazone linker can be considerably less stable than some of the other types of cleavable linkers, which may contribute to the narrow therapeutic window and high toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin [132].",

            "text": "Although peptide motifs represent the majority of cleavable linkers used in clinical-stage antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), the sequences are often sensitive to cleavage by extracellular enzymes, such as elastase, leading to systemic release of the cytotoxic payload. This action reduces the therapeutic index by causing off-target toxicities that can be dose-limiting. For example, a common side-effect of ADCs made using peptide-cleavable linkers is myelosuppression, including neutropenia. Only a few reports describe methods for optimizing peptide linkers to maintain efficient and potent tumor payload delivery while enhancing circulating stability. Herein, we address these critical limitations through the development of a tandem-cleavage linker strategy, where two sequential enzymatic cleavage events mediate payload release. We prepared dipeptides that are protected from degradation in the circulation by a sterically-encumbering glucuronide moiety. Upon ADC internalization and lysosomal degradation, the monosaccharide is removed and the exposed dipeptide is degraded, liberating the attached payload inside the target cell. We used CD79b-targeted monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugates as our model system, and compared the stability, efficacy, and tolerability of ADCs made with tandem-cleavage linkers to ADCs made using standard technology with the vedotin linker. The results\u2014where rat studies showed dramatically improved tolerability in the hematopoietic compartment\u2014highlight the role that linker stability plays in efficacy and tolerability, and offer a means of improving an ADC\u2019s therapeutic index for improved patient outcomes.",

DM1 was coupled to the lysine residue of trastuzumab via a non-cleavable linker, succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) [21]. Since the linker was non-cleavable, T-DM1 could turn to an active state only by digestion in the lysosome after internalization. T-DM1 was an effective drug for HER2-positive breast cancer; hence, it was approved by the FDA in 2013 [22]. Linker improvements in second-generation ADCs achieved better plasma stability and harmonized DAR distribution. The cytotoxicity and coupling of payloads in second-generation ADCs were also improved, and the increase of payloads' water solubility reduced the occurrence of antibody aggregation. \n\nIn addition, some of the second-generation ADCs utilized cleavable linkers, such as Adcetris and Polivy for lymphoma treatment [23,24]. These ADCs with cleavable linkers can cause a bystander effect in vivo, referring to the phenomenon that payloads can be released and kill surrounding cells. Despite the considerable safety advances of secondgeneration ADCs, the shadow therapeutic window due to off-target toxicity is still a challenge for ADCs [25].",

            "text": "Due to their resistance to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, these linkers enjoy the advantages of increased plasma stability, longer half-lives, and lower off-target toxicity than the cleavable counterpart, rendering them potentially superior for targeting homogenously expressed Ag [2,25,32,43,44]. Nonetheless, as most tumors display heterogenous Ag expression, constructs incorporating cleavable linkers with membranepermeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects, unlike the non-cleavable linker type [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nAs the ADC field evolves dynamically and the payload arsenal rapidly expands, linker optimization has become crucial to maximizing the therapeutic index while improving biodistribution and PK profiles [1,6,25,32,43]. The currently explored strategies include (1) increasing the linker hydrophilicity (e.g., by incorporating negatively charged groups, like sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), phosphate, or pyrophosphate groups) to enhance systemic stability by reducing payload hydrophobicity-driven ADC aggregation and clearance [43,44]; (2) polyvalent or branched hydrophilic linkers, such as Fleximer TM linkers or PEG chain additions, that enable high DAR without compromising the ADC physicochemical properties and PK [6]; and (3) tandem or dual-cleavage linkers requiring successive cleavage by lysosomal enzymes, which ensure tumor specificity while increasing both stability and tolerability [6,25,32]. Other recently emerged cleavable linker classes with higher plasma stability include lysosomal protease-cleavable linkers such as sulfatase-and legumain-cleavable linkers [53,54], while more innovative, albeit still exploratory, linker technologies include photo-sensitive and biorthogonal cleavable linkers, which widen up the opportunity for nonendocytic ADCs [32,43].",

            "text": "Several issues with this approach exist, however. First, the thioether bond formed by the reaction is unstable. It can undergo hydrolysis in dilute solutions, as demonstrated for immunoconjugates formed by the maleimide-sulfhydryl method [181]. The drug can be released in human plasma from thioether linked ADCs through sulfoxide formation and elimination [182]. Second, the ring structure is not stable and the thioether-maleimide has been reported to undergo complete hydrolysis of the maleimide ring (ring opening reaction) at pH 8 in 4 h at 37 \u00b0C [183]. \n\nThese issues, along with the challenge in balancing the stability in blood and cleavability within the target cells, led to the design of many other different types of cleavable linkers, such as dipeptide linkers; valine-citrulline [184], Val-Cit, and Phe-Lys [185]. The limited in vivo stability of cleavable linkers in plasma led to the design and testing of non-cleavable leakers, which are generally more stable, such as maleimidocaproyl linker [186]. Presumably, due to the increased stability of the linker, reduced toxicity was observed relative to conjugates with cleavable linkers [187]. If the linkers are non-cleavable, release of the drug has to occur through degradation of the antibody protein in the lysosome, and the linker-retained drug needs to be active. Indeed, ADCs can be adequately processed to release the active form of the drug in the lysosomes of the target cells, such as mAb-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker or a thioether linker [188]. The superior efficacy and reduced toxicity of a trastuzumab-maytansinoid (mAb-DM1) conjugate eventually led to the approval of T-DM1 this year as the first ADC with a non-reducible thioether linker, following demonstration of both safety and efficacy [167].",

Non-cleavable linkers tend to be more stable than their cleavable counterparts, but they rely on lysosomal degradation of the entire antibody-linker construct for payload release. This often results in retention of charged amino acids on the payload, which may affect its action or cell permeability. In human plasma, Kadcyla \u00ae catabolites, MCC-DM1, lysine-bound emtansine (Lys-MCC-DM1), and DM1 have been detected at low levels. Cytotoxic effects of Kadcyla \u00ae result from DM1-containing catabolites (primarily Lys-MCC-DM1) binding to tubulin, which disrupts microtubule networks, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death at sub-nanomolar concentrations [72]. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that Kadcyla \u00ae mediates ADCC [69]. \n\nUndoubtedly, the approval of Kadcyla \u00ae in 2013 was a big win for Swiss drug maker, Roche. In 2019, annual sales surpassed US$1 billion, deeming Kadcyla \u00ae the first ADC to achieve blockbuster status.",

            "text": "The level of conjugated payload is generally considered as a valuable indicator related to ADC efficacy and toxicity [119]. As mentioned previously, LC-MS based quantitative analysis of conjugated ADCs is usually coupled with immunoaffinity pull-down [57,68,91,97]. For ADCs with cleavable linkers, conjugated payload is quantified after isolation of small molecules from proteins and then linker cleavage. For example, for the ADC utilizing an enzymesensitive dipeptide Val-Cit linker (e.g., brentuximab vedotin), the release of payload can be achieved by digestion with proteases such as cathepsin B and papain [67,68,93,94,120e122]. For the ADC with a disulfide bond linker (e.g., coltuximab ravtansin), reducing agent such as DTT and TCEP is employed for cleavage [123,124]. Conventionally, conjugated antibody and conjugated payload are measured by two independent assays using two aliquots of the same samples. Xu et al. [125] introduced an LC-MS approach enabling simultaneous measurement of total antibody and antibody-conjugated drug in plasma samples, followed by immunocapture enrichment. The strategy utilizes sequentially enzymatic digestion with cathepsin B and then Lys-C to release conjugated payload and then signature peptide of the antibody component. The assay platform was further applied in another ADC containing a polymer linker via an ester bond, which was cleaved by sodium hydroxide [99]. \n\nAs mentioned previously, quantification of conjugated payloads of ADCs with cleavable linkers can be achieved after linker cleavage, which is an alternative method to intact LC-MS-based DAR measurement in biological samples [67,68,91,93,94]. The average DAR is calculated as the molar ratio of conjugated payload vs. total antibody, and the change of average DAR could indicate ADC deconjugation in vivo [94].",

            "text": "Despite the significant development of drugs along with the novel treatment methods available in clinical cancer therapy, the prevalence of cancer still remains to be a formidable challenge, and huge obstacles are there to be solved. The increasing risk of toxicity on patients and limited therapeutic window are the major problems in the current chemotherapies. Various drug delivery systems have been developed to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these drugs in order to effectively address these issues. \n\nDrug conjugate or prodrug is one of the most successful approaches for these strategies, using various linkers to mask the activity of the drug and connect with drug carrier and targeting agents, which effectively increase the selectivity of the drugs and, very importantly, improve the ADME properties to subtly circumvent all sorts of difficulties of the complex biological system to deliver the potent payload at the right place and at the right time. Linker, as its name implies, is the structural hub for assembly of the other essential components for becoming a complete pro-drug and also plays a significant role in practice to release the payload. \n\nIn recent years, photocleavable linkers have been developed as a non-invasive technology, allowing the controlled release of the active substance with high spatiotemporal precision. Along with the utilization of carriers that take advantage of active targeting strategies such as monoclonal antibodies, this strategy of drug delivery becomes a powerful tool in clinical cancer therapy. As seen from the research on the photoremovable linkers so far, the drug conjugates, especially ADC, have shown minimal off-target toxicity without irradiation and increased stability compared to other conventional ADCs utilizing an internal trigger linker strategy. In addition, the linker modulates ADC stability in the systemic circulation and payload release efficiency, in the meantime affecting ADC pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy and toxicity profiles. Conjugation chemistry, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are among the key linker parameters to be considered in order to achieve a balance between stability and efficacy in the integrated strategies. This orthogonal release approach, which has demonstrated its potential from previous applications, will be further explored in future research.",

            "text": "The treatment of cancer remains a formidable challenge. 1 For many tumors, chemotherapy achieves significant clinical benefit, however these agents suffer from lack of specificity for cancer cells and high toxicity, often resulting in adverse effects, poor quality of life, early discontinuation and reduced clinical efficacy. 1 Targeted treatments in the form of tumor antigenspecific and checkpoint inhibitor antibodies, envisioned for over 100 years since Ehrlich proposed the concept of \"the magic bullet\", have now been established in clinical oncology and have earned their place alongside chemotherapeutic agents and small molecule inhibitors in the care of cancer patients. 1 However, antibodies targeting tumor-associated antigens also suffer from limitations. These include limited tissue penetrance and blocking target-associated pathways due to intrinsic and acquired resistance. 2 Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are designed to combine the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with the cytotoxic potential of chemotherapeutic drugs. 3 ADCs are tripartite drugs, comprising of a tumor antigen-specific mAb conjugated to a potent cytotoxin via a stable chemical linker. 3 The three components together give rise to a powerful oncolytic agent, capable of delivering normally-intolerable cytotoxic drugs directly and specifically to cancer cells, guided by the exquisite specificity and high affinity of antibodies for their targets in tumors (Fig. 1). 3 ADCs have a well-described mechanism of action, namely binding of the mAb to the target antigen resulting in complex internalization through receptor-mediated endocytosis. 4 Upon fusion of two internalized vesicles, an early endosome is formed whereby cargo is sent through two pathways: recycling which results in trafficking back to the plasma membrane, 5 or endolysosomal degradation. 4 The mechanism and location of toxin release depends on the type of linker. Non-cleavable linkers depend on degradation of the antibody with or without a portion of the linker to liberate the toxin from the ADC. 6 However, cleavable linkers can release toxins through acidic conditions in the lysosome, reduction of the linker in the cytoplasm or cleavage by specific proteases. 6 For ADCs containing cleavable linkers",

The chimeric antibody cAC10 targets CD30 and is rapidly internalized upon binding, which makes it a suitable candidate antibody to be used in an ADC format. Brentuximab vedotin consists of the cAC10-directed antibody and the microtubulin inhibitor MMAE linked via cathepsin cleavable valine-citrulline linker. A clinical efficacy comparison of the anti-CD30 ADC brentuximab vedotin and the unconjugated anti-CD30 antibody demonstrated 75% vs 0% OR, respectively, clearly favoring the ADC approach. The toxicity profile of anti-CD30 ADC was discussed briefly, with neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy as the main observed toxicities. This can be linked to the fact that nerve cells are more sensitive to microtubulin inhibition drugs than other cells. Next, data on the stability of the ADC was presented. The vc-MMAE product exhibited a half-life of approximately 1 week in mice and monkeys. It was suggested that MMAE in serum is partly responsible for the demonstrated toxicity profile.\n\nTo improve the toxicity profile, efforts were made to avoid the reversible fragmentation reaction of maleimide taking place, which results in detachment of the toxin from the antibody and thereby causing unwanted side effects. Avoiding this reaction resulted in a more stabilized ADC, showing enhanced efficacy and an improved toxicity profile. As an example a decrease in neutropenia in rats was shown. Another improvement was made by reducing the hydrophobicity of the ADC product, which could be an underlying cause of accelerated clearance. The drug-linker was engineered such that unnecessary hydrophobic elements were eliminated, which resulted in an improved PK profile and increased therapeutic window. Implementing a more hydrophilic MMAE product with a DAR of 8 resulted in a higher efficacy than the DAR 4 variant, which was the opposite for the hydrophobic MMAE product. Further improvements were made by reducing the heterogen",

Developments in linker technology have greatly increased the ability of ADCs to selectively deliver their payload to target cells while limiting their systemic effects [86]. Linkers generally fall into one of two categories: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers rely on differences in the blood microenvironment and intracellular tumor environment to induce linker degradation. These take three forms: hydrazone, disulfide and peptide linkers, each of which is cleaved or degraded through a different mechanism [86]. Hydrazone linkers are pH-sensitive and undergo acidic hydrolysis in the lysosomal microenvironment [86]. Disulfide linkers are degraded by thiols, which commonly accumulate in tumor cells, where they act as antioxidants [86,94]. Peptide linkers are degraded by pH-dependent proteases, which are only active in the lysosome [86]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers rely on the near-complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody to release the cytotoxic agent. This makes them entirely dependent on being endocytosed to release their drug product. However, this tradeoff provides enhanced stability while the ADC is in circulation, as well as improvements in the ADC half-life [86].",

The toxic payloads used in most approved and clinical-stage ADCs are microtubule disruptors (e.g., maytansinoid and dolastatin analogs) or DNA-damaging agents (e.g., duocarmycins, pyrrolobenzodiazepines, and calicheamicins). The conjugating linkers in ADCs are generally classified into cleavable and non-cleavable ones, which behave quite differently in a biological system, and produce distinct in vivo forms of released toxin.",

We selected the human lymphoma tumor xenogra\ue09d BJAB, as this model discriminates between conjugates containing cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. 30 Anti-CD22 conjugates were administered at a single maytansine dose of 50 mg m \u00c02 to allow comparison between Lys-and Cys-linked conjugates with differential drug loads. Con\ue103rming the importance of release, the non-cleavable maleimide control MPEO-DM1 (1d) was completely stable at this new site (Fig. S2 \u2020) yet showed minimal activity. Signi\ue103cantly, while the disul\ue103de conjugate K149C-DM1 (1b, Cys-linked) has similar circulation stability to SPDB-DM4 (9a, Lys-linked), it possessed superior efficacy, indicating that the ability to decouple stability from release results in improved activity in vivo. To con\ue103rm that this was not a result of antibody site (Cys vs. Lys) or drug loading, we made MBT-DM4 (9b), a Cys-linked conjugate with the same hindered disul\ue103de as SPDB-DM4 (9a), and demonstrated that the two conjugates were equally efficacious. \n\nLastly, we sought to develop Cys-linked disul\ue103de chemistry that would enable traceless release of non-thiol drugs (e.g., amines), while retaining high stability in circulation and rapid release of payload (Fig. 5).",

            "text": "Yet, they still face the challenge of non-selective payload deconjugation in circulation due to the susceptibility of the linkers to plasma proteases for peptide-based linkers, to plasma reactive thiols for disulfide-based and maleimide-based linkers, or to serum esterases for alkyl carbamate linkers [27][28][29][30]. \n\nIn contrast to cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma but require the complete intracellular proteolytic catabolism of the ADCs to yield cytotoxic metabolites. These metabolites typically consist of the intact linker-payload attached to the conjugating amino acid residue from the antibodies, such as lysine-SMCC-DM1 for trastuzumab emtansine or cysteine-MC-MMAF for belantamab mafodotin [25]. These metabolites are often charged and exhibit low permeability through cell membranes [31]. Although ADCs employing non-cleavable linkers generally show a more favorable tolerability, potentially due to reduced off-target toxicity relating to free payload exposure, ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate a superior efficacy [32]. This enhanced efficacy is partially attributed to the bystander effect, which refers to the ability of the free payload to diffuse from intracellular sites of ADC catabolism and payload release to neighboring cells within the local tumor environment [33]. ADCs with lipophilic payloads and cleavable linkers, which make up more than 80% of the currently approved ADCs, are the preferred choice for the treatment of cancers associated with heterogeneous antigen expression or slow rates of antigen/ADC internalization [32]. Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues.",

            "text": "developed to allow assessment of immunogenicity following the tiered strategy often applied during the development of monoclonal antibody therapeutics, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and electrochemiluminescence [24,26].\n\nA full understanding of the pharmacokinetics of an ADC, and how this may impact efficacy and toxicity is a key component of ADC design and delivery [27]. Drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) is the average number of drugs conjugated to an antibody in an ADC; an important attribute of this treatment modality which can affect efficacy, toxicity and pharmacokinetics. For example, low drug loading levels are likely to reduce the potency of the ADC. DAR is often dependent on the amino acid to which the drug is conjugated, for example, in non-specific conjugation there are approximately 40 lysines present within an IgG scaffold to which the drug can attach [28], with DARs between 6 and 14 reported, depending on the chosen linker [29]. In contrast, cysteine residues are far less prevalent with, for example, four exposed disulphides present on IgG1, providing a total of eight conjugation sites. Therefore, conjugation via this site would result in an ADC with a lower DAR [19], with DARs of 2, 4, 6 or 8 typically seen, depending on the linker chemistry [28]. However, although ADCs with higher DARs may appear more potent in vitro, the faster plasma clearance of highly conjugated antibodies can result in lower efficacy in vivo, with decreased drug loading associated with greater efficacy [30]. In addition, the hydrophobicity of the ADC can accelerate clearance, with the use of hydrophilic linkers shown to improve efficacy [31]. Therefore, the careful and informed selection of the correct conjugation chemistry, together with optimal drug loading will play a role in optimising the production of an ADC with the desired efficacy and toxicity profile.",

ADCs have been used in many patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies. To date, twelve ADCs have received FDA approval, with numerous others in different clinical research stages [101,102]. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies (payloads) that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linkers have a key role in ADC outcomes because their characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and noncleavable, and both have been proven to be safe in preclinical and clinical trials. Cleavable linkers have been used in many ADCs, such as hydrazone linkers in gemtuzumab ozogamicin targeting CD33 for patients with AML, dipeptide (VC) MMAE linkers in brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) targeting CD30 for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, and SMCC linkers in trastuzumab emtansine targeting HER2 for HER2-positive breast cancers [101,102]. \n\nThe cytotoxic drugs used as payloads are highly potent agents used to kill cancer cells. The microtubule inhibitors auristatins and maytansinoids are the drugs most frequently used for ADC development, in addition to the DNA synthesis inhibitors calicheamicin, doxorubicin and duocarmycins [101,103]. \n\nAs the most important component of ADCs, the antibody can specifically identify and bind to a well-characterized tumor antigen receptor and deliver the payload to the tumor cell in the process. Currently, Nectin4, CD79b, CD22, CD33, HER2, CD30, FOLR1, and TROP2 are the antigens most often targeted by ADCs.",

            "text": "Second-generation ADCs targeting HER2, trastuzumab duocarmazine (SYD985), was characterized to supersede T-DM1 by overcoming all resistance using a cleavable linker and a more potent payload, duocarmycin (DUBA) via different conjugation chemistry. There are, however, no measurable changes observed between the half-life of Adcetris \u00ae with a cleavable linker and Kadcyla \u00ae with non-cleavable linker at the clinical level [156,157]. \n\nThe linker property will also determine how the final products act during blood circulation and also touch the sensitivity of the antibody to environmental stresses [158]. Some disulfide-linked ADCs were found to conjugate with blood proteins through cleaved free thiols. Hydrophobic linkers and payloads frequently encourage the aggregation of ADC molecules, e.g., King et al. showed that multiple loading of the BR96 antibody that is simultaneously attached to doxorubicin drug leads to non-covalent dimerization of the antibody, which will eventually lead to hepatotoxicity [159,160]. It has also been seen that the linkers that are more hydrophobic are not able to significantly affect the MDR1 + cells. Instead, linkers with a more polar and amphiphilic nature were able to appear with a greater effect such as mal-PEG4-N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-Hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-(2-pyridyldithio)-2-sulfobutanoate (sulfo-SPDB) [161]. In addition to the MDR1 challenge, it has also been found that reducing the percentage of hydrophobicity by employing hydrophilic linkers containing negatively charged sulfonate groups, polyethylene glycol (PEG) groups, or pyrophosphate diester groups can also help in improving therapeutic index level and pharmacokinetics [162].",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), cytotoxic drugs linked to antibodies through specialized chemical linkers, provide a method to target cytotoxic drugs to a tumor and minimize normal tissue damage, thereby increasing the effectiveness and reducing the toxicity of chemotherapy. The design of an ideal ADC is a dichotomy requiring tight linkage between the cytotoxic drug and the antibody to prevent nonspecific drug release while the agent is in circulation, yet appropriate release of the drug when the ADC reaches the tumor. The specific release of the cytotoxic drug is critical to the safety of the ADCs because the cytotoxic drug must be hundreds-fold more potent than the drugs used in typical systemic chemotherapy to be effective in the context of an ADC (1)(2)(3). To accomplish this specificity, specialized linkers between the antibody and drug have been designed that are cleaved only in a specific microenvironment found in or on the target tumor cell. Examples include linkers that are cleaved by acidic conditions, reducing conditions, or proteases (4)(5)(6). Another option is to have stable linkers that are not cleaved, but rather, coupled to antibodies against tumor antigens that are internalized and then degraded, releasing the drug attached to the conjugating amino acid within cells (7,8). Thus, the active metabolite(s) and amounts of active drug released should be substantially different for the cleavable linker ADC and this could affect the safety and efficacy of the ADCs.\n\nAnother factor that has been less explored is the interaction of the linker type and the target. In vitro data suggest that the biology of the target, in particular, the extent of trafficking to the lysosomal compartment, will influence the effectiveness of the ADC (7)(8)(9)(10). In vivo, the situation is even more complex; the extracellular microenvironment, and the intracellular trafficking of the target, the longer exposure times (weeks instead of days), in combination with the linker-drug used, will determine where, to what extent, and in what form the cytotoxic drug is released and",

The aspects of the antibody component that could impact PK are similar to that of the naked antibody, and include antigen binding, target mediated drug disposition, tissue distribution, immunogenicity, binding to FcRn, effector functions, aggregation, etc. \n\nThe stability of the linker which is dependent on the type of linker, as well as the site and type of conjugation, can impact ADC clearance. The type of linker (cleavable vs. non-cleavable) can also impact the metabolite/catabolite profile of an ADC, which could lead to differences in its activity. Another important aspect that impacts PK is the drug to antibody ratio of the ADC that can be manipulated by different conjugation chemistry [10,11]. Two main types of cytotoxic agents used with the current ADCs are microtubule inhibitors (auristatins, maytansinoids) and DNA-damaging agents. The different mechanisms of action of these cytotoxic drugs can have an effect on the PK drivers of efficacy and toxicity of the ADC. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and disposition of ADCs can help us to take advantage of the opportunity to increase the safety window of an ADC. However, this complex molecule offers multiple challenges to assess its PK. While there has been a lot of progress in understanding the PK of ADCs, many questions still remain. This review discusses key PK findings for different types of ADCs in development, challenges associated with PK characterization, and the strategies and technologies being used to address these issues.",

The linker facilitates ADC stability in circulation until the ADC reaches the target cell and the payload is released. 143 There are two classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. 144 Cleavable linkers can be cleaved in response to certain environment factors to release the free drug into the cytosol. 145 This includes hydrazine linkers that are cleaved in response to the acidic environment of the endosome and lysosome, exhibited in gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Cleavable linkers can also be cleaved in the presence of proteases or reducing agents, such as cathepsin B or high levels of glutathione. 145 For non-internalizing ADCs, drug release relies on extracellular cleavage by glutathione and proteases that have been shed as a result of tumor cell death. 146 Noncleavable linkers are resistant to proteolytic degradation and rely on the full degradation of the antibody to release the attached linker-payload complex. This requires the payload to remain active, while linker bound. 144 Because of this, noncleavable linkers have been proposed as a strategy to overcome drug resistance as the linker-payload complex is no longer a substrate for MDR1. 147 Therefore, the proposed MOA of the ADC can be a determinant for linker choice. \n\nFor some ADCs, the chemical linker may also serve to balance the hydrophobicity between the mAb and payload, therefore reducing potential aggregation. In this regard, analyzing the bioanalytical significance of all components of an ADC is important for evaluating the safety and efficacy of the drug. ][150] In addition to selectively choosing a chemical linker, the method by which the payloads are conjugated to the antibody is essential in modulating the homogeneity and potency of the ADC. 151 Until recently, conventional methods relied upon lysine and interchain cysteines to conjugate cytotoxic molecules to the antibody.",

The availability of many different site-specific conjugation methods [51] has made it possible to choose suitable sites on the antibody for payload attachment. The thiol-maleimide Michael addition chemistry is a commonly used method because of its robustness and chemo-specificity. The reaction leads to a succinimide thioether linkage formed with either native or engineered cysteine residues in the antibody. However, the maleimide exchange with thiols present in certain plasma components can result in deconjugation, which negatively affects ADC efficacy and safety. The succinimide ring can also undergo hydrolysis to produce a stable linkage which cannot further undergo retro-Michael elimination and is therefore beneficial for ADC activity. Shen et al. have shown that the different solvent accessibility and chemical environment of different conjugation sites can have different effects on the above-mentioned two reactions, which in turn affects the stability and efficacy of the corresponding ADCs [52]. It is interesting to note that conjugation sitedependent payload loss in plasma was observed not only with the ValCit-PABC linkers, but also with the non-cleavable linkers. The results from this study seem to show that the decrease in DAR was due to chemical deconjugation; however, one may not completely exclude the possibility that the enzymatic cleavage of the ValCit-PABC linker also played",

            "text": "However, the acid-labile hydrazone linker can be considerably less stable than some of the other types of cleavable linkers, which may contribute to the narrow therapeutic window and high toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin [132]. Another type of non-enzymatic cleavable linker is the disulfide linker, which is stable in bloodstream but reduced to free thiols by a high intracellular concentration of reduced glutathione. Upon internalization, the drug-linker is released to cytosol after antibody degradation or linker cleavage in lysosome, and the disulfide bond in the linker is reduced by cytosolic glutathione. Anetumab ravtansine [97] and mirvetuximab soravtansine [133] (see above) are examples of ADCs with disulfide linkers, as well as gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin whose linker contains not only the hydrazone moiety but also a disulfide linkage (Figure 3b) [134]. The serum stability of disulfide linkers depends on the substitution on the \u03b1-carbon atoms of the disulfide linkage [130]. Linkers with an unsubstituted disulfide bond were readily cleaved in circulation, and ADCs with such linkers showed a higher toxicity and a lower efficacy. On the other hand, ADCs with highly substituted disulfide linkers (e.g., Tmab-SSNPP-DM4 in [130]) had comparable stability to the ADC with a non-cleavable linker, with up to ~80% of the ADC retaining its conjugated drugs in vivo after seven days. \n\nEnzymatically cleavable linkers are cleaved by lysosomal enzymes, most notably cathepsin B, which is overexpressed in many cancers [135].",

The former two conjugation methods produce heterogeneous products containing a mixture of different molar ratios of drug (0-8 drugs) to antibody linked at different conjugation sites. 5,6 In contrast, ADCs derived from engineered cysteines (THIOMAB platform) result in homogenous preparation with defined stoichiometry (2 drugs per antibody). 7 He showcased several examples of in vivo efficacy and safety studies on conventional ADCs and their corresponding engineered ADCs in his presentation. Despite having a lower drug load, engineered ADCs with 2 drugs per antibody showed similar in vivo efficacy compared with conventional ADCs with an average of 3.5 drugs per antibody. This was reasoned to be due to improved PK properties of engineered ADCs compared with conventional ADCs.7 Engineered ADCs in the context of a non-cleavable maytansine (MCC-DM1) or a cleavable auristatin-based linker drug (MC-vc-PAB-MMAE) displayed reduced liver and bone marrow toxicity compared with conventional ADCs. 7,8 r. Junutula highlighted the role of the conjugation site in the in vivo stability and therapeutic activity of ADCs. He summarized the data on engineered ADCs using three trastuzumab THIOMAB variants that differed in solvent accessibility and local charge. These three variants had similar in vitro properties (binding to target antigen and in vitro potency), but differed in their in vivo efficacy and PK properties. A detailed biochemical mechanism on the stability of cysteine-maleimide-based antibody conjugates in plasma in vitro and in vivo was dissected and discussed.",

            "text": "The primary advantages of ADCs are that they can act as prodrugs during systemic circulation and finally release the free drugs at the target tumor cells. The operation mechanism of successful ADCs is depicted as below (Figure 3). Relying on highly targeted tumor antigen recognition and effective internalization, ADCs recognize and bind to a specific tumor antigen on the cell surface, then internalization of ADCs is conducted through endocytosis. Once entering the tumor cells, the ADCs are transferred to the endosome or lysosome which digest the potential linkers or antibodies and actively release cytotoxic drugs. Therefore, linkers play a crucial role in releasing the potent drug at target tumor cells. Linkers are classified according to different categories in terms of the mechanism of drug release and their stability in circulation, including cleavable linkers and non-cleavable linkers [32,42]. Cleavable linkers rely on the physiological environment, such as there being high glutathione concentrations, low pH, and special protease, which could assist the linkers in enabling chemical or biochemical reactions by way of hydrolyzation or proteolysis [3,43]. Non-cleavable linkers despond on the monoclonal antibody degradation after ADCs' internalization within the lysosomes and endosomes to generate the metabolites containing the active cytotoxic drugs with or without a portion of the linkers. On account of different mechanism strategies, differences between the potential ADC metabolisms and the varying characteristics of cytotoxic drugs should be taken into consideration [44]. \n\nEach release strategy must account for many factors: the various activities of cytotoxic drugs, the characteristics of monoclonal antibodies, and the particular disease. The optimal linkers designed to conjugate the cytotoxic drugs to monoclonal antibodies must meet the particular requirements imposed by the factors described above.",

            "text": "A ntibody\u2212drug conjugates (ADCs) are attracting consid- erable attention due to their high therapeutic potential in cancer treatment. 1 ADCs combine the high selectivity of a monoclonal antibody for a specific target on cancer cells with the toxicity of a drug attached through a linker. Once the ADC has reached its target, the payload can be released. Despite extensive research in ADCs, improvement is still highly desirable, particularly in those related to conditionally activable linker technologies. Two main families of linkers have been developed. \"Noncleavable linkers\" rely on proteolytic degradation of the antibody upon internalization to release the drug. On the contrary, \"cleavable linkers\" are designed to release the drug within or in the vicinity of the tumor cell upon a trigger stimulus. In recent years, there have been multiple reports of self-immolative linkers able to self-degrade in a spontaneous and irreversible manner through a cascade-elimination process. This process is, in general, driven by an entropy increase and the formation of thermodynamically stable products. \u221211 The most validated self-immolative linker uses a p-amino benzyl carbamate either coupled to a valine-citrulline (Val-Cit-PAB) or \u03b2-glucuronide, which release the cytotoxic payload upon cathepsin B or \u03b2-glucuronidase cleavage, respectively. 12 hese linkers have been successfully translated into the clinic; for example, Adcetris has been approved for the treatment of refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma. 13 In the last years, a range of self-immolative linkers have also been developed such as paminobenzyl ethers, 14 cinnamyl ethers, 15 or cyclization driven linkers 16,17 (Figure 1a). \n\nHere, we decided to explore the Grob fragmentation 18\u221220 in the design of self-immolative linkers.",

            "text": "The application of ADCs is a double-edged sword, resulting in significant clinical efficacy while inevitably increasing the risk of drug-related adverse reactions. Only approximately 0.1% of the drug dose is delivered to the targeted diseased cell population after ADC drugs enter the human body, and the vast majority of the drug is distributed in the circulation or to normal cells, leading to unwanted toxicity. 64 A meta-analysis of adverse reactions in clinical trials of ADC drugs revealed that the incidence of all SG-related adverse events was as high as 97.1% (95% CI, 96.0-98.2%), and the incidence of \u2265 grade 3 treatment-related adverse events was 61.1% (95% CI, 57.6-64.6%). 65 To better exploit the therapeutic value of TROP-2 ADC drugs, exploring the mechanism of ADC drug adverse events and thus optimizing the management strategy of adverse events is one of the future research directions for TROP-2 ADC drugs. \n\nInstability of the coupling between the ADC linker and the cytotoxic drug can lead to off-target toxicity due to the premature release of the payload before reaching targeted tumor cells. There are two main types of ADC drug linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. However, in practice, cleavable linkers can be affected by poor plasma stability in circulation, and peptide-chain structure-based linkers with high sensitivity to proteases in serum or spontaneous decoupling can lead to the premature release of the payload before reaching the target tissues and the bystander effect, causing toxicity to normal cells owing to the increased ability of the drug to permeate cells. 66 Non-cleavable linkers can maintain high stability in the bloodstream, and internalization, lysosomal delivery and degradation of the ADC complex are necessary to release the active drug. The use of non-cleavable linkers reduces the probability of drug release from the extracellular space, but in contrast to cleavable linkers, they are unable to kill neighboring tumor cells through the bystander effect. In addition, the coupling site of ADC drugs may also modulate the stability and pharmacokinetics of ADCs.",

ADCs are comprised of a drug with cytotoxic activity cross-linked to a monoclonal antibody, targeting antigens expressed at higher levels on tumor cells than on normal cells. By providing a selective targeting mechanism for cytotoxic drugs, ADCs improve the therapeutic index in clinical practice. In this review, the chemistry of ADC linker conjugation together with strategies adopted to improve antibody tolerability (by reducing antigenicity) are examined, with particular attention to ADCs approved by the regulatory agencies (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)) for treating cancer patients. Recent developments in engineering Immunoglobulin (Ig) genes and antibody humanization have greatly reduced some of the problems of the first generation of ADCs, beset by problems, such as random coupling of the payload and immunogenicity of the antibody. ADC development and clinical use is a fast, evolving area, and will likely prove an important modality for the treatment of cancer in the near future.",

They not only ensure the stable binding between the antibody and the active payload, preventing premature release of the payload, but also significantly influence the pharmacokinetics (PK), therapeutic index, and safety of the drug (Jain et al., 2015). Based on their structure and functionality, linkers can be categorized into cleavable and non-cleavable types. Cleavable linkers are sensitive to the intracellular environment and can be cleaved under specific conditions, such as the action of proteases or in low pH environments, leading to the release of cytotoxic molecules. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers require proteolytic degradation of the ADC's antibody portion to release the active payload (von Arx et al., 2023). \n\nT-DM1 is composed of the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab, a non-cleavable thioether linker N-maleimidomethyl cyclohexane-1carboxylate (MCC), and a potent microtubule-depolymerizing maytansinoid derivative, DM1 (55). Its drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) is 3.5 (56). \n\nT-Dxd is constructed by conjugating trastuzumab with a cleavable tetrapeptide linker maleimide glycine-glycinephenylalanine-glycine (GGFG) and the Topo I inhibitor exatecan (Yu et al., 2022). The enhanced therapeutic efficacy of T-Dxd may be attributed to its higher drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR: 7-8), the unique cleavable GGFG peptide linker, and the superior membrane permeability of the Dxd payload. These attributes confer DS-8201a with a stronger bystander effect against nontargeted cancer cells (Xu et al., 2019). The structure and mechanism regarding T-DM1, T-DXd are summarized in Figure 1.",

            "text": "It is becoming increasingly clear that site-specific conjugation offers significant advantages over conventional conjugation chemistries used to make antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs). Site-specific payload placement allows for control over both the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and the conjugation site, both of which play an important role in governing the pharmacokinetics (PK), disposition, and efficacy of the ADC. In addition to the DAR and site of conjugation, linker composition also plays an important role in the properties of an ADC. We have previously reported a novel site-specific conjugation platform comprising linker payloads designed to selectively react with site-specifically engineered aldehyde tags on an antibody backbone. This chemistry results in a stable C\u2013C bond between the antibody and the cytotoxin payload, providing a uniquely stable connection with respect to the other linker chemistries used to generate ADCs. The flexibility and versatility of the aldehyde tag conjugation platform has enabled us to undertake a systematic evaluation of the impact of conjugation site and linker composition on ADC properties. Here, we describe the production and characterization of a panel of ADCs bearing the aldehyde tag at different locations on an IgG1 backbone conjugated using Hydrazino-iso-Pictet-Spengler (HIPS) chemistry. We demonstrate that in a panel of ADCs with aldehyde tags at different locations, the site of conjugation has a dramatic impact on in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic behavior in rodents; this advantage translates to an improved safety profile in rats as compared to a conventional lysine conjugate.",

            "text": "These therapeutic effects have most recently been achieved, largely due to new ADC linker chemistries that stabilize the ADC in the bloodstream and maximize the tumorspecific delivery of the cytotoxic payload [11]. Linkers can be broadly classified as cleavable or non-cleavable, each with their own distinct mechanism of action [14]. Cleavable linkers, such as hydrazone, disulphide and peptide linkers, allow selective cleavage of the ADC within the tumor cell by exploiting environmental differences between healthy and malignant tissues, such as pH or the presence of specific enzymes [15]. Once the ADC is internalized by binding to its tumor-associated antigen, the linker can be cleaved to release the cytotoxic drug directly within the cancer cell. Depending on the payload drug chemistry, the drug can be cell-impermeant resulting in killing of only the targeted cell, or cell-permeant which enables killing of the surrounding, antigen-negative cells in a process called bystander killing. Similarly, a cleavable linker can be cleaved within the tumor microenvironment before cell internalization of the ADC, releasing the drug and also producing bystander killing [16]. Although bystander killing is undesirable for healthy cells, the process could allow eradication of antigennegative tumor cells that would otherwise not have been targeted by the ADC [17,18] and could also facilitate the maturation and activation of intratumoral immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), which are known to be activated by certain ADC payloads such as maytansines, aurostatins, and pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers [19][20][21]. Non-cleavable linkers such as thioether and maleimidocaproyl (MMC) linkers, are not susceptible to environmental or enzymatic cleavage and instead are only broken down to release the cytotoxic payload after tumor cell internalization and subsequent antibody degradation in the endosomes and lysosomes [14].",

These two components are joined by a covalent linker, whose nature is critical to the efficacy and safety of the ADC. Enzyme-cleavable dipeptidic linkers have emerged as a particularly effective ADC linker type due to their ability to selectively release the payload in the lysosomes of target cells. However, these linkers have a number of drawbacks, including instability in rodent plasma and their inherently high hydrophobicity. Here we show that arylsulfate-containing ADC linkers are cleaved by lysosomal sulfatase enzymes to tracelessly release their payload, while circumventing the instability problems associated with dipeptide-linkers. When incorporated with trastuzumab and the highly potent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload, the arylsulfate-containing ADC 2 and ADC 3 were more cytotoxic than the non-cleavable ADC 4 against HER2-positive cells, while maintaining selectivity over HER2-negative cells. We propose that the stability, solubility and synthetic tractability of our arylsulfate linkers make them an attractive new motif for cleavable ADC linkers, with clear benefits over the widely used dipeptidic linkers.",

Because the metabolic product contains the payload linked to an antibody-derived amino acid, it is vital that the payload retain activity even with the added bulk and charge. In one comparison of linker types, it was found that ADCs containing a non-cleavable linker had similar potency, but a higher therapeutic window, than the corresponding ADCs containing a protease-cleavable linker. 233 In addition to chemical reactivity, the physicochemical properties of the linker as a whole should also be considered. Since ADCs contain more hydrophobic surface area than naked antibodies, they are generally more prone to aggregation. 230 Additionally, hydrophobic drugs are more likely to be substrates for the transporter MDR1. 61 Therefore, polar linkers that contain solubilizing groups like sulfonate and PEG not only reduce ADC aggregation propensity, but also potentiate elimination of MDR1-expressing cells (assuming the polar functionality is retained in the final warhead). 234,235 As a result, properties like potency, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic index can all be improved by using charged or polar linkers. 236 Presence of charge in the final drug moiety also largely determines its ability to elicit the bystander effect, as only uncharged molecules efficiently cross lipid membranes to reach neighboring cells. Whereas S-methyl metabolites originating from disulfide linkers are uncharged and therefore enable bystander killing, amino acid-conjugated payloads with noncleavable linkers are charged and less likely to elicit these effects. 237,238 It should be noted that toxicity to neighboring cells can be favorable (in the case of targeting tumors with heterogenous antigen expression) or unfavorable (when the primary casualties are healthy cells).",

Use of cleavable linkers is a more traditional approach where the cytotoxic drug is intended to be released after being processed inside the cell. Examples of cleavable linkers-based ADCs include: gemtuzumab ozogamicin (pH-sensitive hydrazone linkers), sacituzumab govitecan, brentuximab vedotin, polatuzumavedotin, enfortumab vedotin, and trastuzumab deruxtecan (proteasesensitive linkers) and mirvetuximab soravtansine and indatuximab ravtansine (glutathione-sensitive linkers) (20,60). Even though they are specifically designed to maintain stability during circulation, it has been suggested that nonspecific drug release may occur in case of acid cleavable linkers, which can be overcome by using non-cleavable linkers. Both types of linkers are featured in the FDA approved list of ADCs with their own advantages (Figure 2).",

            "text": "options are broadly categorized into cleavable and noncleavable linkers, there are several different functional groups and/or trigger points that can be used for either category of linkers. In a data-driven approach, several linkers were explored representing both cleavable and non-cleavable formats to determine the optimal choice for delivering a STING agonist via an ADC. In evaluating the different linkers, the corresponding ADCs were assessed for their analytical properties [hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC)], in vitro activity, in Table 2. STING Activity with Analogs 18a\u2212e and 19a\u2212d vivo PK, anti-tumor activity, and impact on off-target activity. Other parameters, such as payload and antibody, were held constant as the linker was evaluated.\n\nIn an attempt to assess the best possible linker from each respective class, several criteria were considered. For example, an ester attachment is known to be susceptible to potential metabolism, as exemplified by ADC 36 ( Figure 5A), which has an unhindered ester bond. Addition of an alanine adjacent to the ester bond resulted in more stable ADC 37 and nearly 2fold improvement in exposure of the conjugated drug ( Figure  5B). However, even more hindered amino acids, such as the valine in ADC 38, did not result in an improved PK profile compared to 37. Whereas ADCs 36\u221238 leverage 6 as the payload, ADC 39, which employs a cleavable peptide-based linker, uses 4 as the payload. For assessing the non-cleavable linker, the scaffold, which attenuates the biophysical properties of the ADC, was removed as it was expected to detrimentally impact the activity of the released payload due to its large size ( Figure 5C). Activity of the anticipated released payload 41 ( Figure 5C) from ADC 40 was tested and confirmed to be similar to the payload released from 37 (payload 6), with similar binding (as assessed by SPR, see Table S1 in the Supporting Information) and an EC 50 value of 5 nM in the permeabilized THP1 cell assay.

            "text": "The appropriate choices of mAb, drug potency, and conjugation methodology are key elements in developing optimized ADCs for the targeted treatment of cancer. Classical ADCs stably conjugated with highly potent drugs permit selective targeting of chemotherapeutic agents that would otherwise be too toxic for general administration. In the circulation, premature drug release could result in untoward toxicities and a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy of the ADCs. In recent years, new ADCs as potential treatments for diverse epithelial cancers have appeared. For example, sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) incorporates a moderately toxic drug, SN-38, at a high ratio. It uses a pH-sensitive, cleavable linker designed to impart cytotoxic activity to both target and bystander cells via ADC internalization and local release of the free drug at the tumor. 25,26 n this work, we redesigned anti-CD30-vcMMAE (ADCETRIS) to make it safer in the blood system by conjugating the antibody to DM1 through a noncleavable peptide linker to create anti-CD30-MCC-DM1. Both MMAE and DM1 belong to the class of tubulin inhibitors, and with free drug IC 50 values between 10 \u221211 and 10 \u22129 , they have been used successfully in commercialized ADCs. 27,28 ADCETRIS uses a cleavable linker to release MMAE, increasing the possibility of the bystander effect. Anti-CD30-MCC-DM1, which uses a noncleavable linker, was found to release DM1 still attached to the linker in addition to an amino acid residue. \n\nThe targeting of CD30 has an important and emerging role in the setting of Hodgkin lymphoma, ALCL, and possibly other CD30-positive malignancies. 29 CD30 has restricted expression in normal tissues, but is widely expressed in Hodgkin's disease, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. 21,30",

            "text": "The linker plays a crucial role since its properties greatly influence the ADC's pharmacokinetics, therapeutic index and efficacy (Hughes, 2010;Flygare et al, 2013;Shefet-Carasso and Benhar, 2015). The ideal linker should be stable so that the ADC does not release the cytotoxic drug before reaching its target and causing off-target toxicity. At the same time it should be able to release the drug efficiently once internalised (Teicher and Chari, 2011). \n\nAnother important factor is how many of the drug molecules will be loaded onto the antibody: the drug-antibody ratio (DAR). Attaching too few of the drug molecules will lead to decreased efficacy. Attach too many and the ADC will become unstable with altered pharmacokinetic properties, increased plasma clearance, reduced half-life and increased systemic toxicity (Perez et al, 2014). The currently licensed ADCs with proven activity are produced by nonspecific conjugation to lysine residues and to some degree consist of an undesirable heterogeneous mixture of ADCs containing drug molecules with high There are ongoing efforts for more homogeneous ADCs with increased number of drug molecules stably linked to the Ab. The optimal DAR is undetermined and highly dependent on other ADC variables; however, more commonly the ADCs aim to attain a DAR close to 4. (Hamblett et al, 2004;Teicher and Chari, 2011). Site-specific conjugation, has been an important step in ADC development, enabled the production of homogeneous ADCs with the desired and prespecified DAR by using techniques such as engineered cysteine residue, non-canonical amino acid incorporation or modification of peptide tags (Panowksi et al, 2014;Agarwal and Bertozzi, 2015). Linkers can be divided in non-cleavable and cleavable. Noncleavable linkers have the characteristic that following ADC lysosomal degradation the cytotoxic payload remains active while still being attached to the linker and an amino acid residue.",

However, non-cleavable ADC 4, which lacks a cathepsin-cleavable sequence within the linker scaffold, showed 1.8-4.2-fold higher EC 50 values than those of cleavable ADC 3a (Fig. 3c, d, Supplementary Fig. 11, and Supplementary Table 3). These results suggest that existence of a cleavage mechanism is a key to maximize cell killing potency of ADCs constructed using our branched linker platform. \n\nValidation of ADCs in vivo. Finally, we evaluated the ADCs in vivo using mouse models. We first assessed PK profiles of VCit, SVCit, and EVCit ADCs 3a-c using BALB/c mice. Mice were treated with intravenous injection of each ADC or the parental N297A anti-HER2 mAb (3 mg kg -1 ). Blood was collected periodically via the tail vein. Concentrations of total mAb (both conjugated and unconjugated) and intact ADC (conjugated only) in blood were determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Fig. 4a, b, Supplementary Fig. 12, and Supplementary Table 5). All ADCs showed similar clearance rates as that of the parental mAb (t 1/2\u03b2 = 14.9 days), indicating that installing glutamic acid or serine at the P 3 position did not negatively impact the clearance profile (Fig. 4a). As expected, EVCit ADC 3c showed no significant loss of payload caused by cleavage in circulation (t 1/2\u03b2 = 12.0 days). In contrast, VCit and SVCit ADCs 3a, b quickly lost MMAF (t 1/2\u03b2 = 2.0 days and 2.4 days, respectively), demonstrating that the VCit and SVCit sequences installed on the mAb-branched linker system were unstable in circulation.",

            "text": "The primary emphases of linker design for ADCs are the ability to cleave active drug from the ADCs into the targeted cancer cell and the ability to remain stable in systemic circulation. The early ADCs (3-4) with an acid labile hydrazine bond were designed to release the active drug into the target cells using the acidic environment of the endosomes and lysosomes. Efficient release of cytotoxic agents was demonstrated in acidic buffer, but studies of ADC incubation under physiological conditions reported slow release of the agents. 42) Because release of drug in circulation could lead to systemic toxicity and a lower therapeutic index owing to degradation of the ADCs, it was thought that an effective linker design has to balance the necessity of better stability in circulation and efficient cleavage in the target cell. GO (5) consists of calicheamicin linked to the antibody via 4-(4\u2032-acetylphenoxy) butanoic acid (AcBut) linker as a hydrazone bond linker. 19) The AcBut linker was carefully chosen after screening a set hybrid linkers with good stability at pH 7.4 and almost complete hydrolysis at pH 4.5 at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. 43) GN-35 ( 7) contains a lysosomal protease-cleavable dipeptide and self-immolative p-aminobenzyloxycarbamoyl (pABC) linker. 27) The dipeptide (valine-citrulline) is recognized by cathepsins (such as cathepsin B) which are enhanced in tumors. 44,45) Thus, this dipeptide was stable in circulation until it reached tumor cells and the payload was selectively released into tumor cells. Moreover, MMAE itself was released by 1,6-elimination and decarboxylation of self-immolative pABC, and exerted an antitumor effect. \n\nIn contrast, T-DM1 (8) adopted a non-cleavable linker not triggered by a drug-release mechanism to achieve greater stability in systemic circulation. 33)",

Off-target side toxicity remains a significant safety concern, hindering ADC development. Mechanistically, each of the three components of ADCs can contribute to their side toxicities. For instance, the non-specific expression of targeted antigens in normal cells can mistakenly deliver ADCs to the wrong site. Premature deconjugation of the toxic payload in circulation represents a key mechanism for severe side toxicity associated with the majority of ADCs. Notably, most of the FDA-approved ADCs use cleavable linkers, yet they are more vulnerable to plasma proteases and other enzymes compared to non-cleavable linkers. In contrast, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may exhibit a favorable safety profile. However, they usually experience low efficacy issues. Thus, future studies developing novel strategies to overcome this unwanted toxicity are warranted.",

However, it was very difficult to evaluate the acDrug of the first generation ADCs without cleavable linkers such as trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, brand name: Kadcyla \u00ae ) by LC-MS, and therefore it was reported that the conjugated antibody instead of acDrug were quantitated by ELISA assay (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/ drugsatfda_docs/nda/2013/125427Orig1s000PharmR.pdf (accessed on 1 September 2021)) for Kadcyla. Recently, more attention is paid to the importance of the in vivo acDrug levels of ADCs regarding the efficacy, in vivo drug-antibody ratio (DAR) evaluation, and toxicity. Currently, only ADCs with cleavable linkers are easily applicable to the quantitation of acDrug by the immuno-affinity capture method followed by on-bead digestion using specific enzymes such as cathepsin B or beta-glucuronidase for the LC-MS analysis of acDrug [16][17][18]. Due to lack of specific sites in the linker, this method was not applicable to Kadcyla, which contains non-cleavable linkers. \n\nIn this paper, we developed an immuno-affinity capture LC-MS/MS assay using previously reported chemical desulfuration pretreatment [19] to quantify acDrug in rat preclinical PK samples even for trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, brand name: Kadcyla \u00ae ), a representative ADC with non-cleavable linkers.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) emerged as a promising therapeutic modality prepared from naked antibodies by chemically or enzymatically conjugating a cytotoxic payload using specific linker chemistries. Most currently, cytotoxic molecules are too toxic for systemic application, thus ADCs provide a method to harness the specificity of a mAb for targeted delivery of such highly potent cytotoxic agents to tumor cells expressing a unique cognate antigen [89,91,97,104,107,108]. According to the generally accepted mechanism of action, binding of an ADC to such a tumor associated cell surface antigen, induces internalization of the ADC-antigen complex into the targeted cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent trafficking of the ADC-loaded endosomes to the lysosomal compartment (Figure 3). Once in the lysosomes, the payload is released through enzymatic digestion or a pH-induced degradation of the linker, causing cytosolic release of the cytotoxic payload to efficiently induce cell death [109]. \n\nThe propensity of ADCs mainly depends on the nature of the mAbs, the linker, and the cytotoxic payload, which synergistically work to exert their maximal toxicities [30,[110][111][112]. For instance, the chemical nature of the linker which joins the mAb to the cytotoxic payload may negatively affect ADCs' biophysical properties, hence their potency [113,114]. The latter was corroborated by Lewis Philips et al. (2008) reporting an improved therapeutic efficacy, pharmacokinetics behavior and reduced toxicity when HER2-positive breast cancer tumor xenografts were treated with a non-reducible thioether linker-based trastuzumab-maytansinoid conjugate as opposed to its counterpart that had a reducible disulfide linker [111]. Moreover, the hydrophobic nature of most potent ADCs may reduce their therapeutic efficacy as a result of mAb aggregation and precipitation [112].",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates comprise three elements: a mAb, a linker, and a cytotoxic drug. Each of these components undergoes distinct metabolic changes. [1,29] Some linkers are processed intracellularly to release the cytotoxic drug, by a reduction in disulfide bonds mediated by glutathione in the cytoplasm, exposure to acidic conditions in the lysosome, or cleavage by specific proteases. The so-called non-cleavable linkers, that maintain better stability in systemic circulation, rely on degradation of the mAb to release their payload. Antibody-drug conjugates are not a homogenous solution. [29] After the administration, ADCs are being distributed and metabolized. The ADC is expected to be catabolized as a protein with component amino acids recycled or eliminated. Owing to their complex structure, bioanalysis should include the conjugated antibody, the total antibody, the antibody-conjugated drug, the unconjugated drug, and possibly its metabolites including or not part of the linker. [30] Another vital component of the ADC therapeutic system are anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). All these parameters might impact the exposure-response effect relationship. Based on a population-pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, following intravenous administration, the central volume of distribution of all ADCs equals approximately that of plasma volume, owing to the big molecular weight of the conjugates.

Once the ADCs are internalized into tumor cells, the linker needs to be cleaved, rapidly releasing drugs 7,53 . One critical factor that should be taken into consideration is the DAR. Too few drug molecules on each antibody result in decreased efficacy, while excessive DAR will lead to poor pharmacokinetics of ADCs because of higher hydrophobicity and lower solubility 14,47 . It has been reported that the DAR of most clinical trials ADCs are in the range of 2.0e4.0 14 . \n\nLinkers used in typical ADCs can be divided into noncleavable and cleavable linkers 4 . Noncleavable linkers usually rely on the lysosomal degradation to release the cytotoxic drugs which are attached to the linker and an amino acid residue of the antibody 54,55 . For example, brentuximab vedotin was designed to use a noncleavable linker (succinimidyl trans-4-(maleimidylmethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, SMCC) to crosslink the maytansinoid to the HER2 antibody 56 . \n\nThe structure of cleavable linkers includes a position of cleavage between the antibody and the drug 3 . Usually, based on the cleavage mechanisms, cleavable linkers can be classified into three groups. (i) Acid sensitive, such as hydrazone linkers, that are cleaved in the lysosome because of low pH environment. For example, the hydrazone linker is used in both GO and InO. In addition, although acid cleavable linkers are designed for maintaining stability during circulation and release drugs in the acidic environment, it has been reported that acid cleavable linkers could be associated with nonspecific release of the drugs 57 . (ii) Lysosomal protease sensitive, such as valineealanine and valineecitrulline peptide linkers, that are designed to release drugs after cleavage by intracellular proteases.",

In recent years, booming research pipelines together with various FDA approved ADCs, such as moxetumomab pasudotox, polatuzumab vedotin and famtrastuzumab-deruxtecan-nxki, implicate that this drug delivery platform can be used for next-generation of oncotherapy. 65,66 Among the three components of ADCs, the linker chemistries determine the therapeutic window. Successful linker technology should prevent the premature release of the toxic payload in bloodstream and at the meantime ensure that the free toxic payload is released at the intended disease site at an adequate rate. Therefore, tremendous effort has been invested in the conjugation and linker chemistries in ADC \ue103eld. 65 Based on different mechanisms for release of the toxic payload, the linker strategies fall into two main classes: cleavable and noncleavable linkers. Disul\ue103de bond within the linker, due to its relative stability in circulation and efficient free drug release rate at tumor site, is one of the most recognized and attractive strategies for cleavable linkers in ADC design, along with hydrazone. The \ue103rst disul\ue103de-containing ADC, namely gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg\u00ae, Table 1), 67 was developed by P\ue103zer and was approved by FDA in 2000 for treatment of patients with relapsed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia. Mylotarg\u00ae is a pH and reduction dual-sensitive ADC for delivering calicheamicin derivative, a potent antitumor antibiotic. Disul\ue103de and N-acyl hydrazine linkage were employed to achieve reduction and acid-sensitivity, respectively. Mylotarg\u00ae's drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) value, a key parameter to impact PK/PD and cytotoxicity of ADCs, is 2-3 (typically 3-4 as a",

Conjugation of both prodrugs did not affect 7D9 binding, and all 3 ADCs exhibited anti-proliferative activity against OVCAR3 cancer cells in vitro, but their efficacy differed significantly in vivo [46]. \n\nIn vivo, cleavable 7D9-mc-vc-PAB-MMAE was more efficacious than both MMAF ADCs against OVCAR3 tumors [46]. Their in vivo potency is ranked as follows: 7D9mc-vc-PAB-MMAE>7D9-mc-vc-PAB-MMAF>7D9-mc-MMAF. The uncleavable maleimidocaproyl-MMAF (mc-MMAF) was least potent. This may be due to its lysosomal metabolite Cys-mc-MMAF having a slower diffusion into the cytoplasm to exert cytotoxic effects than the free MMAF or MMAE resulting from the valine-citrulline cleavage. The most potent ADC is 7D9-mc-vc-PAB-MMAE since its lysosomal metabolite, the free MMAE, has the ability to kill neighboring cells. In contrast, the free MMAF has poor membrane permeability and is lacking a bystander effect. Therefore, the humanized 7D9 antibody (h7D9.v3) was conjugated to MMAE via the protease-sensitive cleavable linker mc-vc-PAB and selected for development. \n\nThe h7D9.v3 antibody retained high affinity for mesothelin binding, ranging from 0.4 to 3 nM as measured by Scatchard analysis of 0.5+ to 3+ mesothelin-expressing cells.

The striking success has driven scientists and clinicians to further advance this molecular platform for developing effective therapeutics for cancers, microbial infection 13, and immune modulation 14 . \n\nADCs consist of potent drugs (payloads) linked to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) through chemical linkers. This molecular format enables pinpoint delivery of highly cytotoxic payloads to target tumor cells, resulting in greater potency, a broader therapeutic window, and more durable treatment effect than are possible with traditional chemotherapy agents alone 15,16 . In addition to the choice of the antibody and payload, the ADC linker structure and antibody-payload conjugation modality impact ADC homogeneity, cytotoxic potency, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK). These key parameters critically contribute to overall in vivo therapeutic efficacy [17][18][19][20] . Thus, refining linker and conjugation chemistries is of crucial importance for optimizing the therapeutic potential and safety profiles of ADCs. \n\nValine-citrulline (VCit) dipeptide linkers connecting a payload with a p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) group are standard cleavable linkers widely used in many successful ADCs including the FDA-approved ADC Adcetris 21,22 .",

As the development of current linker technology, more emphasis is being placed on the characteristics of cleavable and non-cleavable linkers, focusing merely on the drug-release mechanism and other biophysical properties of the linker itself. Very little is known about the correlations between the linker/conjugation chemistry and the internalization process. Therefore, our goal here is to explore the effects of ADC structure, including the selection of linker, the site of attachment and the conjugation chemistry, on the delivery and intracellular trafficking of the molecules.\n\nThe model antibody we selected was an anti-MUC1 antibody (scFv-SM3). MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein overexpressed on various cancer cells, including breast cancers and ovarian carcinomas, thus has been recognized as an important molecular target for cancer treatment. 16,17 Previous studies showed that antibodies could be internalized upon binding to MUC1-expressing tumor cells, indicating that MUC1 is a suitable target for drug delivery. 18 Accordingly, several MUC1binding ligands have been developed for targeted delivery of toxic compounds to cancer cells in vitro. 18 However, to the best of our knowledge, no mechanic studies have been done in elucidating the endocytosis and intracellular trafficking pathways of anti-MUC1 antibodies. Especially, no correlation has been investigated between structure modi\ue103cation and cellular delivery of the MUC1-speci\ue103c ADCs. Furthermore, there is still a lack of functional in vivo studies in the development of anti-MUC1 bioconjugates. 19,20 Herein, we prepared four distinct SM3-conjugates with unique structural characteristics ranging from the conjugation chemistry, the conjugation site and the selection of linker (Fig. 1).

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an established class of biotherapeutics allowing for targeted drug delivery, with approvals leveraging a range of targets, payloads and conjugation site/chemistries (Dumontet et al. 2023). In addition to target/antibody selection, ADC technology encompasses multiple modalities of conjugation methods, targeted amino acids, drug linkers, conjugated small molecules, and drug loading, i.e. the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). Optimisation of the DAR is a critical step in ADC development, requiring thorough evaluation of potency, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. Toxicity profiles of auristatin ADCs in clinical studies, regardless of therapeutic target, indicate exposure to conjugated payload as the main contributor to some safety events (Drake and Rabuka 2015;Eaton et al. 2015;Liao et al. 2021;Nguyen et al. 2023;Passey et al. 2023): thus highlighting the importance of characterisation and evaluation of drug loading in vivo. \n\nAcross multiple interchain-cysteine maleimide conjugated ADCs, decreases in the DAR have been observed in vivo (Hengel et al. 2014;Leal et al. 2015;Sanderson et al. 2016). In biological systems, the rate of change and resulting DAR at a given time is dependent upon drug-linker deconjugation, stabilisation of the succinimide through ring opening hydrolysis, and potentially differential clearance across ADC drug loads (Hamblett et al. 2004;Lyon et al. 2014). The contribution of each of these to the DAR in vivo is hypothesised to be similar for deconjugation and hydrolysis for a given class of linkage chemistries and conjugation sites. However, the impact from differential clearance may vary depending on the physiochemical properties of the drug linker and impact to overall ADC properties. \n\nPK modelling of each of these contributing factors requires data on the disposition of individual drug load species, a challenge for cysteine conjugated ADCs due to the lack of interchain disulphide bonds, requiring preservation of noncovalent interactions and tertiary structure throughout analysis.",

            "text": "ADCs are currently being investigated for the treatment of a variety of cancers. The mechanistic basis for the ADC activity includes its specific binding to the cellular target, triggering ADC cellular internalization by pinocytosis, followed by the intracellular release of the payload (Roberts et al., 2013). Therefore, after administration into the systemic circulation, the antibody fragment guides the complex to the targeted tumor antigen where it becomes internalized into the cancer cell (Hasan et al., 2018). The intracellular release of the payload in its active form results in cell death. The three components of ADCs, namely the antibody, the linker and the cytotoxic drug, have their own inherent characteristics and limitations which influence each other, thus finding the best combination of these components to design an ideal ADC is a complicated task (Hasan et al., 2018). Although this targeted approach appears straightforward, its translation to clinical practice has been problematic with initial attempts failing due to inappropriate linker systems or insufficiently potent cytotoxins, resulting in unfavorable therapeutic indices. Modern ADCs tend to use highly potent cytotoxic molecules, such as derivatives of calicheamicin, maytansine and auristatins (Senter, 2009;Ducry and Stump, 2010). A number of these molecules have demonstrated substantial in vivo antitumor activity. To translate the fundamental advantage of ADCs in targeting tumor-selective or tumor-specific antigens in clinical practice, it is essential that linkers be of sufficient stability to minimize systemic exposure to the cytotoxin and the resulting toxicities, while still providing sufficient targeted intracellular release of the cytotoxic agent (Roberts et al., 2013).",

Prodrugs are inactive or less active derivatives of drug molecules and undergo enzymatic or chemical transformation to regenerate the active forms.

The antibody connected to the cytotoxic warhead (drug) via a linker serves as targeted delivery system to the tumor expressing the antigen/target recognized by the antibody. Ideally, in blood, after systemic administration, this prodrug is nontoxic. Upon binding of the antibody to the targeted tumor antigen and internalization of the complex into the cancer cell, the drug is then released in its active form and in sufficient quantity to kill the cell.

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are drugs comprised of a monoclonal antibody tethered to a cytotoxic drug using a linker. ADCs rely on monoclonal antibodies to guide (highly) cytotoxic drugs to the proximity of target cells, whereupon the drug is released. Ideally, the monoclonal antibody component targets antigens that are exclusively and homogeneously expressed on cell membranes of cancer cells [60]. For maximal on-target effects, ADC-targeted antigens are not to be secreted and are ideally internalized upon ADC binding [61,62]. Drugs tethered using non-cleavable linkers are only released following a complete proteasomal breakdown of the antibody component and will remain linked to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody [63]. Cleavable linkers are designed to release drugs in response to particular extracellular and intracellular environments (pH, redox potential) or following enzymatic cleavage [63]. \n\nThe first ADC that received FDA approval for the treatment of mUC patients was enfortumab vedotin. Enfortumab targets nectin-4 and is tethered to the cytotoxic agent vedotin using a protease-cleavable linker. FDA approval was based on results of a phase I clinical trial showing a promising ORR of 42% and a CR of 9% in mUC [64]. Side-effects most often associated with enfortumab vedotin or other vedotin-based ADCs are fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, rash, and hyperglycemia [65]. \n\nEnfortumab vedotin paves the way for other ADCs to be used against MIBC, and ADCs targeting ErbB family members are currently being evaluated. HER2 overexpression in BC has been targeted by ADCs, even though the anticancer effect of HER2 inhibition was found to be minimal.",

            "text": "In the majority of ADCs that have been developed and are in clinical trials, drug molecules have been covalently bound through lysine and cysteine linkers, following the first two aforementioned strategies (Figure 6a) [24]. Between both of them, the alkylation of reduced interchain-disulfides of cysteines has been normally chosen, since there are more much lysines present in the antibody surface than interchain-cysteines (40 lysines per antibody versus 8 exposed cysteine sulfhydryl groups), and the heterogeneity of the reaction is reduced when cysteines are selected to anchor the cytotoxic compounds [24,76,78]. In any case, maleimide chemistry is usually chosen to synthesize both types of disulfide-based ADCs, and the employed linkers can be either cleavable or non-cleavable. The first ones, the cleavable linkers, include an engineered lysosomal specific protease or are disulfide-bond-based glutathione (GSH)-sensitive, since the intracellular concentration of this molecule is much higher than it is in circulation. Otherwise, non-cleavable thioether linkers are those that make necessary a post-internalization degradation in lysosomes of the ADC to release the payload (Figure 6b) [24]. They have a better stability in the bloodstream and longer half-lives and, hence, a smaller risk of off-target toxicity than that of cleavable linkers [24,79]. For this reason, this sort of linker was the one that was employed to synthesize ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) [80], which was the first anti-HER2 ADC that started to be commercialized in 2013 (Kadcyla \u00ae ) [23]. \n\nThus, T-DM1 is integrated by a non-cleavable linker that allows the attachment of a derivative of maytansine (DM1) to Tmab [24,81].",

            "abstract": "\n Background: CCR7 is overexpressed in lymphoid malignancies. JBH492 is a first-in-class CCR7-targeting ADC, comprising a humanized, Fc-silenced anti-CCR7 IgG1 antibody conjugated to maytansinoid microtubule inhibitor DM4 via a cleavable linker. Preclinical studies support avidity-driven differential binding in CCR7-high tumor cells compared to CCR7-low healthy immune cells, and in vivo animal studies demonstrated robust and durable efficacy in multiple clinically relevant lymphoma models (Dang et al. 2022).\n Methods: This is an ongoing first-in-human, open-label, phase I/Ib, multi-center study in patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (r/r) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) (NCT04240704), which completed enrollment for dose-escalation phase. Five dose levels of JBH492 monotherapy ranging from 0.4 to 3.6 mg/kg (intravenous administration every 3 weeks [q3W]) were tested with 3 - 7 pts enrolled per dose level. Preclinical data from xenografts predicted tumor stasis at 1.6 mg/kg q3W. The objective of dose escalation was to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of JBH492 and to determine maximum tolerated and recommended doses. Pts with r/r CLL and NHL, who failed standard of care therapy (at least 2 prior regimens) and who were intolerant/ineligible to approved therapies, were included; CCR7 expression confirmation was not required prior enrollment.\n Results: Total 25 pts with r/r stage II-IV NHL (n = 24, [adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma, 3; cutaneous T cell lymphoma, 4; diffuse large B cell lymphoma, 7; follicular lymphoma, 1; Mantle cell lymphoma, 1; marginal zone lymphoma, 2; peripheral T cell lymphoma, 3; others, 3]) and CLL (n = 1) with median age 69.0 y (43 - 85) were enrolled. Mean duration of exposure was 13.5 wks. One pt had dose-limiting toxicity \u2014 grade (G) 3 thrombocytopenia lasting for 13 d. Overall, 23 (92%) pts had at least 1 adverse event (AE) (G \u2265 3, n = 11). Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were reported in 15 (60%) pts (G \u2265 3, n = 3). Of 6 (24%) pts who had serious AEs (SAEs) (G \u2265 3, n = 3), 2 (8%) had TRSAE. The most frequent AEs (\u2265 20%) included anemia (32%), thrombocytopenia (28%), neutropenia and dry eye (20% each). Two deaths due to underlying disease were reported. PK for total ADC was roughly dose proportional.\n Four NHL pts (2 T-NHL and 2 B-NHL) had partial response (PR) and 2 had stable disease, with PRs observed at doses between 2.4 and 3.6 mg/kg q3W.

            "text": "\n Background: CCR7 is overexpressed in lymphoid malignancies. JBH492 is a first-in-class CCR7-targeting ADC, comprising a humanized, Fc-silenced anti-CCR7 IgG1 antibody conjugated to maytansinoid microtubule inhibitor DM4 via a cleavable linker. Preclinical studies support avidity-driven differential binding in CCR7-high tumor cells compared to CCR7-low healthy immune cells, and in vivo animal studies demonstrated robust and durable efficacy in multiple clinically relevant lymphoma models (Dang et al. 2022).\n Methods: This is an ongoing first-in-human, open-label, phase I/Ib, multi-center study in patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (r/r) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) (NCT04240704), which completed enrollment for dose-escalation phase. Five dose levels of JBH492 monotherapy ranging from 0.4 to 3.6 mg/kg (intravenous administration every 3 weeks [q3W]) were tested with 3 - 7 pts enrolled per dose level. Preclinical data from xenografts predicted tumor stasis at 1.6 mg/kg q3W. The objective of dose escalation was to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of JBH492 and to determine maximum tolerated and recommended doses. Pts with r/r CLL and NHL, who failed standard of care therapy (at least 2 prior regimens) and who were intolerant/ineligible to approved therapies, were included; CCR7 expression confirmation was not required prior enrollment.\n Results: Total 25 pts with r/r stage II-IV NHL (n = 24, [adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma, 3; cutaneous T cell lymphoma, 4; diffuse large B cell lymphoma, 7; follicular lymphoma, 1; Mantle cell lymphoma, 1; marginal zone lymphoma, 2; peripheral T cell lymphoma, 3; others, 3]) and CLL (n = 1) with median age 69.0 y (43 - 85) were enrolled. Mean duration of exposure was 13.5 wks. One pt had dose-limiting toxicity \u2014 grade (G) 3 thrombocytopenia lasting for 13 d. Overall, 23 (92%) pts had at least 1 adverse event (AE) (G \u2265 3, n = 11). Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were reported in 15 (60%) pts (G \u2265 3, n = 3). Of 6 (24%) pts who had serious AEs (SAEs) (G \u2265 3, n = 3), 2 (8%) had TRSAE. The most frequent AEs (\u2265 20%) included anemia (32%), thrombocytopenia (28%), neutropenia and dry eye (20% each). Two deaths due to underlying disease were reported. PK for total ADC was roughly dose proportional.\n Four NHL pts (2 T-NHL and 2 B-NHL) had partial response (PR) and 2 had stable disease, with PRs observed at doses between 2.4 and 3.6 mg/kg q3W. Post data-cut-off, 1 pt with T-NHL achieved CR following 4 cycles of treatment. No correlation between CCR7 expression and response could be drawn (CCR7 expression was observed in all samples from 14 pts).\n Conclusions: The data from this phase I study suggest that targeting CCR7 with JBH492 is a promising therapeutic strategy for lymphoid malignancies with manageable hematological and non-hematological safety profile.

SHR-A1811 is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of a humanized HER2-directed monoclonal antibody, cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker, and DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor. Here, we report data from the phase 1 portion of a phase 1/2 study with SHR-A1811 in patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC (NCT04818333).\n Methods: In this single-arm, dose escalation and expansion phase 1 portion, patients with advanced activating HER2-mutant NSCLC who had failed platinum-based chemotherapy in the advanced or metastatic setting or could not tolerate chemotherapy were enrolled. SHR-A1811 was assessed at doses of 3.2, 4.8, 5.6, 6.4, and 8.0 mg/kg intravenously once every 21-day cycle. Dose escalation and determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was guided by Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control. Dose selected for expansion was determined based on data from dose-escalation phase. The primary endpoints were safety, MTD and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).\n Results: At data cutoff (Nov 8, 2022), 50 patients were enrolled. All were stage IV with a median of 3 (range 1-8) prior systemic treatments, including HER2-targeted TKI (66%), immune checkpoint inhibitors (68%), and anti-angiogenic drugs (78%). 96% had a HER2 kinase domain mutation. One patient in 8.0 mg/kg dose cohort had dose-limiting toxicities (grade 4 febrile neutropenia and grade 4 thrombocytopenia). The 4.8 mg/kg dose cohort was expanded to 38 patients. The median follow-up duration was 5.6 months (95% CI 4.2-7.0). 62% of patients remained on treatment. Overall, objective response rate was 40.0% (95% CI 26.4-54.8); median duration of response was 8.3 months (95% CI 5.4-13.7); disease control rate was 86.0% (95% CI 73.3-94.2); median progression-free survival was 10.8 months (95% CI 6.7-15.0). All patients had treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). 42% of patients experienced grade \u22653 TRAEs, with the most common ones being decreased neutrophil count (30%), decreased white blood cell count (20%), anemia (16%), and thrombocytopenia (12%). Nine patients (18%) had serious AEs deemed related to SHR-A1811. Treatment discontinuation due to AEs was reported in two patients. One death was reported to be treatment related (interstitial lung disease). After single dosing, dose exposure (Cmax and AUClast) of SHR-A1811 increased in a dose-proportional manner. PK parameters of SHR-A1811 and total antibody were similar at all dose levels, with low plasma exposure of free topoisomerase I inhibitor observed.\n Conclusion: SHR-A1811 showed tolerable safety profile and durable antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC.

By combining the antibody-mediated specific targeting with potent killing from a cytotoxic payload, antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), and especially bispecific ADCs (BsADC), have become powerful therapeutic strategies. EGFR and MET are oncogenic proteins that are co-expressed in a wide range of tumors. Moreover, MET amplification is largely associated with drug resistance of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Biocytogen developed a fully human EGFR x MET BsADC using our proprietary common light chain RenLiteTM mouse platform and knobs-into-holes technology. The BsAb showed enhanced internalization and binding affinity compared to parental monoclonal and monovalent antibodies in the EGFR/MET co-expressing NCI-H1975 cell line. After conjugating the BsAb with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease-cleavable linker, the resulting BsADC, YH013, exhibited a remarkable and dose-dependent anti-tumor efficacy in NCI-H1975 and NCI-H292 cell line-derived xenograft models. Moreover, in multiple patient-derived xenografts of NSCLC and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which co-express EGFR and MET, YH013 demonstrated superior and durable efficacy that outperformed benchmark antibodies at a lower dose (3 mg/kg). Collectively, these results suggest that YH013 can be an effective treatment option for EGFR and MET co-expressing tumors and overcome MET-driven EGFR-TKI resistance to improve patient outcomes.\n Citation Format: Yanfei Han, Chengzhang Shang, Zhuon li, Zhenyan Han, Jun Li, Zixu Cui, Gao An, Wanjun Hao, Yujie Liu, Hao Li, Baihong Liu, Ellen Zhang, Qingcong Lin, Yi Yang, Yuelei Shen.

However, these ADCs still exhibit serious safety issues, such as hematologic toxicities and interstitial lung disease. OBI-992, a novel TROP2 targeting ADC, which is derived from the conjugation of an anti-TROP2 antibody with a topoisomerase I inhibitor, exatecan, via an enzyme-cleavable linker. OBI-992 is designed to have high serum stability and broad therapeutic index. Herein, we describe the results from preclinical studies of OBI-992, including in vitro and in vivo stability, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) profile, and safety evaluation.\n Material and Methods: To characterize OBI-992, the linker stability was evaluated by ex vivo serum stability and rat PK studies. PK/PD properties, including systemic and tumor exposures as well as receptor occupancy, were evaluated in a human lung cancer xenograft model. In vitro toxicity testing, including ADC toxicity on differentiating neutrophils and Fc\u03b3R mediated toxicity, was evaluated using human monocyte THP-1 cells. A 6-week repeat dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted to evaluate the safety and toxicokinetics of OBI-992.\n Results: Ex vivo serum stability demonstrated that OBI-992 exhibited better linker stability than the benchmark datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd). In vivo PK evaluation in rats showed that OBI-992 had lower Cmax and AUC of free payload than Dato-DXd, indicating a better PK profile of OBI-992 in rats. A PK/PD study in tumor-bearing mice revealed that OBI-992 exhibited higher tumor exposure of free payload than Dato-DXd, resulting in a better antitumor efficacy. In addition, the antitumor effect positively correlated with percentage of receptor occupancy in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro cytotoxicity testing demonstrated that OBI-992 had lower toxicity in differentiating neutrophils and THP-1 cells compared to Dato-DXd, suggesting that OBI-992 may cause less off-target toxicity. Toxicokinetics of OBI-992 in cynomolgus monkeys revealed that the systemic exposure of ADC was similar to that of total antibody. Furthermore, the systemic exposure of ADC and total antibody were found to increase in a dose-proportional manner. Major toxicities in monkeys were target-related skin lesions. The highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) was determined to be 60 mg/kg.\n Conclusions: OBI-992 exhibits remarkable antitumor efficacy and a favorable safety profile, supporting further clinical development of OBI-992 in TROP2 positive cancers.\n Citation Format: Chi-Sheng Shia, Shih-Ni Wen, Ren-Yu Hsu, Jyy-Shiuan Tu, Hui-Wen Chang, Wan-Fen Li, Ming-Tain Lai.

In preclinical studies, MHB036C demonstrated superior tumor killing activities (5~10 times more potent than the DS-1062a analog) and a favorable safety profile with no unique toxicities as compared to other TROP2 ADCs and no occurrences of interstitial lung disease (ILD). We here present the safety and efficacy results from a first-in-human phase 1/2 study of MHB036C. Methods: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors were enrolled in dose-escalation (D-Esc) and dose-expansion (D-Exp) segments. The D-esc study, utilizing an accelerated titration followed by the traditional 3+3 design, assessed MHB036C at doses ranging from 0.25-2.25 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks. Results: At data cutoff (Dec 31, 2023), 26 pts were enrolled and received at least one dose of MHB036C (D-Esc, n=11, D-Exp, n=15). Two pts experienced dose-limiting toxicities (Grade 3 stomatitis) at 2.25 mg/kg. The MTD was determined to be 1.5 mg/kg. The most common TRAEs overall in \u226525% of pts were stomatitis, anemia, decreased appetite, vomiting, white blood cell (WBC) count decreased, fatigue, nausea, and neutrophil count decreased. The most common Grade \u22653 TRAEs (occurred in \u22655% of pts) were stomatitis (34.6%), WBC count decreased (11.5%), neutrophil count decreased (7.7%), and anemia (7.7%). No ILD was reported. Of 21 response-evaluable pts, 7 experienced partial responses. In the subset of 12 NSCLC pts treated with doses ranging from 1.3 to 2.25 mg/kg, the ORR was 33.3% (4/12) and the DCR was 83.3%. In the subset of 5 HER2-negative breast cancer pts encompassing 4 TNBC pts and 1 HR+/HER2- breast cancer patient, the ORR was 60.0% (3/5). Conclusions: MHB036C demonstrated a manageable safety profile without either major hematologic side effects or ILDs and encouraging efficacy in NSCLC and HER2- breast cancer, representing a potential best-in-class TROP2 ADC. The dose optimization and expansion study is ongoing to establish the RP2D for MHB036C. Clinical trial information: CTR20231246.",

To this end, a non-internalized antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting soluble VEGF was developed using MediLink\u2019s TMALIN\u00ae platform.

It introduces a novel cleavage mechanism that occurs in the tumor microenvironment while stable during systemic circulation. YL242 is designed to leverage anticancer activity through both anti-angiogenesis by the VEGF antibody and the cytotoxicity of the extracellularly released payload. The linker of YL242 can be enzymatically cleaved by enzymes in TME (tumor microenvironment) to release payload C24, subsequently inducing cytotoxic effects to kill cancer cells. Significant dose-dependent antitumor effects, including complete tumor regressions were observed in tumor xenograft mouse models. The stability of YL242 has been demonstrated by incubation with various plasmas under physiological conditions. This high stability was further evidenced by the pharmacokinetic profiles in non-human primate (NHP) studies, where both the ADC and TAb curves are overlapped. YL242 demonstrated promising safety profiles in pivotal non-human primate (NHP) toxicity studies with no drug-related adverse effects observed.

Here we present for the first time the progression-free survival (PFS) analysis results of SHR-A1811 and updated safety results, including an additional 1-year of follow-up and an expanded cohort from 307 to 391 patients. Methods: Patients eligible for this study had HER2-expressing or mutated unresectable, advanced, or metastatic solid tumors and were refractory or intolerant to standard therapies. SHR-A1811 was administered intravenously at doses ranging from 1.0 to 8.0 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Primary endpoints included dose-limiting toxicity, safety, and the recommended phase 2 dose. Results: Between Sep 7, 2020 and Jan 12, 2024, 391 patients received SHR-A1811 treatment, including 136 HER2-positive breast cancers, 110 HER2 low-expressing breast cancers, 42 biliary tract cancers, 39 urothelial carcinomas, 22 gynecological cancers, 14 colorectal cancers (CRC), 13 gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinomas (GC/GEJ), 4 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), and 11 other types of solid tumor. These patients had undergone a median of 3 (IQR 2\u20135) prior treatment regimens for metastatic disease. Of these, 261 (66.8%) had an ECOG performance status of 1, 196 (50.1%) had liver metastasis, and 186 (47.6%) had lung metastasis. As of data cutoff (Feb 29, 2024), the median follow-up for HER2-positive breast cancer, HER2-low breast cancer, and non-breast tumor was 13.4, 9.5, and 6.3 months (mo), respectively. The adverse events remained consistent with previous findings in terms of frequency, severity, and specificity. No new safety signals were identified. Grade \u22653 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 247 patients (63.2%) and 26 patients (6.6%) discontinued treatment due to TRAEs. Incidence of interstitial lung disease was limited, occurring in only 10 patients (2.6%), predominantly at grade 1\u20132. Of the patients whose tumor responses were evaluable, the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 79.1% (95% CI 71.2\u201385.6) in HER2-positive breast cancer, 62.0% (95% CI 52.2\u201371.2) in HER2-low breast cancer, and 40.0% (95% CI 31.5\u201349.0) in non-breast tumor. Responses were durable, with median duration of response (DoR) of 23.6 mo (95% CI 15.6\u2013NE), 12.2 mo (95% CI 7.3\u2013NE), and 15.2 mo (95% CI 9.9\u201320.9), respectively. Median PFS was 20.0 mo (95% CI 15.1\u2013NE) in HER2-positive breast cancer, 11.0 mo (95% CI 8.2\u201313.7) in HER2-low breast cancer, and ranged 3.4\u20138.5 mo in various non-breast tumor types. In breast cancer patients with liver metastasis, the median DoR and PFS (HER2-positive: not reached for DoR, 20.0 mo for PFS; HER2-low: 10.8 mo for DoR, 10.9 mo for PFS) were consistent with the total breast cancer population. Similarly, for breast cancer patients with visceral metastasis, the median DoR and PFS (HER2-positive: 23.7 mo for DoR, 21.9 mo for PFS; HER2-low: 9.9 mo for DoR, 9.8 mo for PFS) also aligned with the overall breast cancer population. Additionally, patients with HER2-positive non-breast tumors showed a trend of better efficacy compared to the overall non-breast tumor cohort in terms of ORR (45.1%), DoR (median 15.2 mo), and PFS (median 7.9 mo). Conclusions: This updated analysis reaffirms the manageable safety profile and promising efficacy of SHR-A1811 in heavily pretreated multiple solid tumors with HER2 expression or mutations.

            "abstract": "\n \n \n Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common pediatric sarcoma, representing 3-4% of childhood and adolescent cancers. While multimodal therapies improved the outcomes for localized disease, 5-year survival for relapsed or metastatic RMS cases remains poor. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) use the specificity of monoclonal antibodies to selectively deliver potent anticancer chemotherapy agents to tumor cells while sparing healthy tissues. FGFR4, a cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinase highly expressed in RMS and other cancers such as some breast cancers, but minimally in normal tissues, is a promising immune target. We hypothesize that FGFR4-targeted ADCs could effectively treat RMS and other FGFR4-positive cancers with limited systemic toxicity.\n \n \n \n High-affinity human FGFR4-specific binders were developed and evaluated for their internalization in RMS cell lines. The top candidate 3A11, a murine monoclonal antibody, was conjugated to either monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a cathepsin cleavable mcValCit-PABC linker (3A11-MMAE), or an Exatecan derivative via a legumain-cleavable mpGlyAsnAsn linker (3A11-Exatecan). ADCs\u2019 in-vitro efficacy was assessed in FGFR4-positive or FGFR4-negative cells using a live-cell analysis system. Western blots were performed to validate their action mechanisms. Finally, ADCs' in-vivo efficacy was tested in 3 subcutaneous xenograft models: fusion-positive RMS (RH4), fusion-negative RMS with an FGFR4 V550L activating mutation (RMS559), and FGFR4-positive breast cancer (MDA-MB-453).\n \n \n \n 3A11 was internalized by FGFR4-positive cells and the internalization efficiency was significantly correlated with FGFR4 surface expression levels. Both ADCs selectively killed FGFR4-expressing cells, with their potency correlating with FGFR4 expression and 3A11 internalization. Western blot confirmed that 3A11-MMAE induced specific apoptosis and 3A11-Exatecan induced cell death after DNA damage in FGFR4-expressing RMS cells. In vivo, 3A11-MMAE (3 mg/kg, twice weekly for two weeks) delayed RH4 tumor growth, improving survival by 30%, whereas a single dose of 3A11-Exatecan (10 mg/kg) eradicated RH4 tumors, achieving 100% survival. In the aggressive RMS559 model, 40% of 3A11-MMAE treated mice achieved tumor clearance, with a 70% survival rate. While two doses of 3A11-Exatecan completely eradicated RMS559 tumors. Furthermore, both ADCs effectively controlled MDA-MB-453 breast cancer growth.\n \n \n \n and Future Directions: Our results demonstrate an unprecedented efficacy of these FGFR4-targeting ADCs specifically against human cancers expressing FGFR4 including aggressive rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancers. We plan to humanize the 3A11 binder and perform pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies in non-human primates for preparation in clinical trials.\n \n \n \n Meijie Tian, Katrina Jia, Jerry T.

While multimodal therapies improved the outcomes for localized disease, 5-year survival for relapsed or metastatic RMS cases remains poor. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) use the specificity of monoclonal antibodies to selectively deliver potent anticancer chemotherapy agents to tumor cells while sparing healthy tissues. FGFR4, a cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinase highly expressed in RMS and other cancers such as some breast cancers, but minimally in normal tissues, is a promising immune target. We hypothesize that FGFR4-targeted ADCs could effectively treat RMS and other FGFR4-positive cancers with limited systemic toxicity.\n \n \n \n High-affinity human FGFR4-specific binders were developed and evaluated for their internalization in RMS cell lines. The top candidate 3A11, a murine monoclonal antibody, was conjugated to either monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a cathepsin cleavable mcValCit-PABC linker (3A11-MMAE), or an Exatecan derivative via a legumain-cleavable mpGlyAsnAsn linker (3A11-Exatecan). ADCs\u2019 in-vitro efficacy was assessed in FGFR4-positive or FGFR4-negative cells using a live-cell analysis system. Western blots were performed to validate their action mechanisms. Finally, ADCs' in-vivo efficacy was tested in 3 subcutaneous xenograft models: fusion-positive RMS (RH4), fusion-negative RMS with an FGFR4 V550L activating mutation (RMS559), and FGFR4-positive breast cancer (MDA-MB-453).\n \n \n \n 3A11 was internalized by FGFR4-positive cells and the internalization efficiency was significantly correlated with FGFR4 surface expression levels. Both ADCs selectively killed FGFR4-expressing cells, with their potency correlating with FGFR4 expression and 3A11 internalization. Western blot confirmed that 3A11-MMAE induced specific apoptosis and 3A11-Exatecan induced cell death after DNA damage in FGFR4-expressing RMS cells. In vivo, 3A11-MMAE (3 mg/kg, twice weekly for two weeks) delayed RH4 tumor growth, improving survival by 30%, whereas a single dose of 3A11-Exatecan (10 mg/kg) eradicated RH4 tumors, achieving 100% survival. In the aggressive RMS559 model, 40% of 3A11-MMAE treated mice achieved tumor clearance, with a 70% survival rate. While two doses of 3A11-Exatecan completely eradicated RMS559 tumors. Furthermore, both ADCs effectively controlled MDA-MB-453 breast cancer growth.\n \n \n \n and Future Directions: Our results demonstrate an unprecedented efficacy of these FGFR4-targeting ADCs specifically against human cancers expressing FGFR4 including aggressive rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancers. We plan to humanize the 3A11 binder and perform pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies in non-human primates for preparation in clinical trials.\n \n \n \n Meijie Tian, Katrina Jia, Jerry T.

The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) EphA5 possesses the classical receptor kinase topology with an extracellular-binding domain, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain. We have previously shown that EphA5 is highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer and contributes to DNA-damage repair and radiation therapy resistance. Others have reported EphA5 expression in gastric, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. Here, we investigated the expression of EphA5 in breast cancer (BC) and assessed EphA5 as a potential cancer-specific target using a novel ADC designated MBRC-101. Methods: MBRC-101 is composed of a humanized anti-EphA5 IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody conjugated to the small molecule microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease cleavable valine-citrulline (vc) ThioBridge linker (ThioBridge\u2122-Glu-[Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE] PEG [24u]). MBRC-101 averages a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR)=4. The specificity profile of the anti-EphA5 monoclonal antibody was characterized using a Membrane Proteome Array (MPA). Receptor-mediated antibody internalization was determined by real-time live-cell analysis; cell killing assays used both live-cell analysis of cell confluence and the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae luminescent cell viability assay. Expression of EphA5 in archival human breast tumor tissue sections was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a commercial polyclonal antibody against human EphA5. In vivo efficacy studies used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of BC. Results: IHC demonstrated robust and selective EphA5 expression in 87% (20 of 23) of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and 88% (23 of 26) of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) patient tumors tested. EphA5 expression was not detected in adjacent, non-malignant breast tissue. Antibody-specificity profile testing showed that the anti-EphA5 antibody bound exclusively to EphA5 and did not cross-react with other members of the Eph receptor/ephrin ligand family. Binding of the anti-EphA5 antibody to EphA5 on the cell surface triggered rapid internalization and processing of the EphA5/antibody complex through the endosomal-lysosomal system. Consistently, MBRC-101 was cytotoxic to EphA5-expressing cells and its activity was concentration-dependent and commensurate to the levels of EphA5 on the cell surface. In PDX murine models of TNBC, once weekly administrations of intravenous (IV) MBRC-101 showed dose-dependent, robust, and reproducible anti-tumor activity in vivo. Partial tumor responses were observed at doses of 2.5 mg/Kg IV and complete and nearly complete tumor responses starting at 5 mg/Kg IV. Doses up to 10 mg/Kg IV were well-tolerated in tumor-bearing mice with no observable weight loss. Pre-clinical safety confirmed MBRC-101 is also well tolerated in rats and in cynomolgus monkeys. Conclusions: These results support EphA5 as a new and promising membrane-associated molecular target for the design and development of ADC-based therapies against hormone-positive breast cancer and TNBC and support the conduct of a Phase 1/1b study of MBRC-101 in patients with breast cancer.\n Citation Format: Fernanda Staquicini, Fenny Tang, Vanessa de Oliveira, Daniela Staquicini, Yongjian Wu, Kirstin Barnhart, J Kellogg Parsons, Wadih Arap, Isan Chen, Renata Pasqualini.

Claudin-6 expression is upregulated in ovarian cancer, testicular cancer, endometrial cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and gastric cancer. Here, the generation and preclinical characterization of a novel Claudin-6 specific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is described, composed of a humanized IgG1 directed against human Claudin-6 site-specifically conjugated a novel payload containing a valine-alanine cleavable linker and a camptothecin warhead with a drug to antibody ratio of 6. Fc\u03b3R-mediated effector function of the ADC was abrogated via mutations in the Fc portion of the antibody. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of Claudin-6 in different tumour indications and characterise the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumour activity in human cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. In addition, the tolerability of the ADC was evaluated in a repeat-dose toxicity study cynomolgus monkeys. Cell binding studies using Fabs showed high affinity binding to Claudin-6, while affinity for Claudin-9 was 16-fold lower with no binding to Claudin-3 and Claudin-4. Cross-reactivity with cynomolgus monkey and mouse Claudin-6 was also demonstrated. Fcgamma receptor binding studies confirmed the strongly reduced binding of the antibody to Fc\u03b3I, Fc\u03b3I,IIa, Fc\u03b3IIb and Fc\u03b3IIa, consistent with the introduction of mutations in the Fc domain of the antibody. In vitro, the Claudin-6 ADC showed potent and specific cytotoxicity against various Claudin-6-expressing solid cancer cell lines, including OVCAR3, PA-1, OV-90, FU-97, BeWo, NTERA-2 and NUGC3 in comparison to a non-binding control ADC conjugated to the same payload, and it also showed potent bystander killing. In vivo, a single dose intravenous (IV) of the Claudin-6 ADC demonstrated potent anti-tumour activity in multiple solid tumour xenograft models, including OVCAR3 and PA-1. Furthermore, administration of the Claudin-6 ADC to cynomolgus monkeys was well tolerated up to 40 mg/kg IV when given on Day 1 and 22. Cell membrane expression of Claudin-6 was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in ovarian cancer (70%), testicular cancer (98%), endometrial cancer (30%), NSCLC (28%) and gastric cancer (24%), confirming expression of Claudin-6 in indications with high unmet need. In summary, this novel Claudin-6 ADC demonstrated potent, specific anti-tumour activity in Claudin-6 expressing cancer-derived models and was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkey, supporting future clinical development of this ADC.\n Citation Format: Nicola Tsang, Nicolas Veillard, Elizabeth Horsley, Karin Havenith, Narinder Janghra, Kristina Zaitseva, Cecile Oblette, Ian Kirby, Paul W.

Furthermore, administration of the Claudin-6 ADC to cynomolgus monkeys was well tolerated up to 40 mg/kg IV when given on Day 1 and 22. Cell membrane expression of Claudin-6 was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in ovarian cancer (70%), testicular cancer (98%), endometrial cancer (30%), NSCLC (28%) and gastric cancer (24%), confirming expression of Claudin-6 in indications with high unmet need. In summary, this novel Claudin-6 ADC demonstrated potent, specific anti-tumour activity in Claudin-6 expressing cancer-derived models and was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkey, supporting future clinical development of this ADC.\n Citation Format: Nicola Tsang, Nicolas Veillard, Elizabeth Horsley, Karin Havenith, Narinder Janghra, Kristina Zaitseva, Cecile Oblette, Ian Kirby, Paul W.

Although no soluble ligand for CDCP1 is known, CDCP1 transduces signals resulting in cancer cell motility, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and metastasis by activating downstream signaling via homodimerization or heterodimerization with other cell surface molecules such as EGFR, HER2, and ITGB1. Owing to its important roles in cancer, CDCP1 has been reported as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of solid cancers. While it is overexpressed in many of the abovementioned solid cancer types, several normal tissues such as esophagus, skin, and bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) also express CDCP1. To minimize the risk of toxicity, we generated novel anti-CDCP1 antibodies that bind weakly to bone marrow HSCs. Three isolated anti-CDCP1 monoclonal antibodies and their humanized versions showed weak binding to HSCs compared to other anti-CDCP1 antibodies reported from other groups. Although they only showed moderate binding activity to cancer cell lines, rapid internalization and efficient lysosomal trafficking was observed following CDCP1 binding. Subsequently, we generated antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) of the 3 anti-CDCP1 antibodies using PBD, MMAE, and MMAF as a cytotoxic payload with both a cleavable and non-cleavable linker. All constructed ADCs showed strong anti-tumor activity in multiple cancer cell lines in vitro. The cytotoxic activities of these ADCs were correlated to CDCP1 surface expression levels and internalization activity. The anti-CDCP1 ADCs showed strong anti-tumor efficacy in multiple cell line xenograft models. We selected the clone h14A043 for further evaluation owing to its observed potent anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo. We then constructed h14A043-ATAC (Antibody Targeted Amanitin Conjugate), which has a site-specifically conjugated amanitin derivative with DAR 2 and an Fc domain mutation that reduces the effector function of human IgG1. h14A043-ATAC showed good anti-tumor potency both in vitro and in vivo. In human prostate cancer PC3 cell line xenograft model, we observed significant tumor growth delay following treatment by h14A043-ATAC with a single administration of 0.1 mg/kg. Furthermore, we observed complete tumor remission in 3 out of 8 mice at 40 days after a single administration of 1 mg/kg. In the non-GLP single dose toxicity study using cynomolgus monkeys, h14A043-ATAC showed good serum stability and no hematological toxicity. Our results suggest that ADC using an anti-CDCP1 mAb with weak binding to bone marrow HSC and sufficient internalization activity could provide a new treatment option for refractory solid cancer patients.\n Citation Format: Shu-ichi Hashimoto, Shiori Miyamoyo, Aki Takaiwa, Koji Nakamura, Yukihito Tsukumo, Yoshinori Yamashita.

To improve the tolerability while leveraging the known activity of brentuximab vedotin, an ADC approved for the treatment of advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma and other CD30-expressing lymphomas, alternative ADC structural components are under exploration. A novel cleavable linker containing a tripeptide molecule comprised of D-leucine-alanine-glutamate (DLAE) was developed and used to generate SGN-35T, an anti-CD30 ADC with the same mAb backbone and cytotoxic monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload as brentuximab vedotin. SGN-35T was investigated for both anti-tumor activity and effects on hematopoiesis using in vitro and in vivo assays. SGN-35T displayed comparable activity to brentuximab vedotin against three lymphoma cell lines in vitro, and complete or near-complete tumor growth inhibition in five lymphoma xenograft models including a CD30-heterogeneous model. SGN-35T led to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase leading to apoptosis, in concordance with the established mechanism of action of MMAE. Introduction of the tripeptide linker in SGN-35T maintained the induction of immunogenic cell death hallmarks observed with brentuximab vedotin and other vedotin-based ADCs. SGN-35T demonstrated reduced potency on hematopoiesis compared to brentuximab vedotin in a human bone marrow colony-forming unit assay. In cynomolgus monkey toxicity studies, administration of SGN-35T had a reduced impact to neutrophils counts at matched dose levels and a two-fold improvement in tolerability compared to brentuximab vedotin, with a highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) of 6 mg/kg versus an HNSTD of 3 mg/kg for brentuximab vedotin when administered Q3Wx4. Together, these data demonstrate that SGN-35T exhibits anti-tumor activity in preclinical models and may reduce the severity of hematopoietic toxicities while retaining anti-tumor activity observed with brentuximab vedotin.

Here, we report the initial results of a phase I clinical trial of BL-M11D1 in relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML patients.\n Methods:\n This study enrolled patients with R/R AML aged 18-75 years. For dose escalation (D-ESC i3+3), BL-M11D1 was administrated intravenously in dose cohorts from 0.6mg/kg up to 4.4mg/kg once a week (QW) in 28-day cycles for induction treatment, followed by administration every two weeks (Q2W) at the same initial dose for consolidation treatment in pts whose bone marrow (BM) blast \uff1c5%. A subset of pts were enrolled in dose-expansion (D-EXP) at 1.65, 2.2 mg/kg doses.\n Results:\n As of July 25, 2024, 39 patients were enrolled at doses ranging from 0.6 mg/kg to 2.75 mg/kg, with a median age of 53.9 years (range: 19-75 years), including 2 patients with secondary AML. Among them, 10 patients had primary refractory AML, 24 had refractory AML, and 5 had relapsed AML. The median number of prior treatment lines was 4 (range 1-9), including 2 patients who had a previous autologous stem cell transplant. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed at the time of the cutoff date. The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) in \u226520% of pts were white blood cell count decreased (56.4%), anemia (51.3%), hypokalemia (51.3%), platelet count decreased (51.3%), neutrophil count decreased (46.2%), hypoalbuminemia (43.6%), hyponatremia (35.9%), nausea (35.9%), ALT increase (33.3%), pyrexia (28.2%), lymphocyte count decreased (25.6%), vomiting (25.6%), abdominal distension (23.1%), diarrhea (23.1%), and hypoproteinemia (20.5%). Grade \u22653 non-hematologic TRAEs were hypokalemia (25.6%), pneumonia (15.4%), infection (12.8%), pyrexia (5.1%), nausea (5.1%), febrile infection (5.1%), bilirubin increased (5.1%), GGT increase (5.1%), ALP increase (5.1%), ALT increase (2.6%), diarrhea (2.6%), AST increase (2.6%). One patient discontinued treatment. There was no dose reduction necessitated by TRAEs. Two pts died due to infection, which might be associated with BL-M11D1 by investigators' evaluation. No grade 3 or higher organ injury has been seen to date, and no veno-occlusive disease (VOD) observed in any patient.\n Responses have been seen starting at the 1.65 mg/kg dose, with a complete response (CR) of 6+ months duration observed. At doses of 1.65 mg/kg, 2.2 mg/kg and 2.75 mg/kg, 7 pts, 14 pts and 4 pts respectively have been evaluable for efficacy (at least 1 post-treatment assessment). The overall response rate (ORR)* at these doses are 14.3% (1/7), 42.9% (6/14) and 50% (2/4), respectively.\n Note:\n *ORR including CR, CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), and morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS).\n Conclusion:\n The preliminary results of this phase I study have demonstrated BL-M11D1 monotherapy with an acceptable safety profile and encouraging anti-cancer activity, including in refractory patients who had not previously achieved remission from prior therapy. The dose escalation of BL-M11D1 is ongoing, to better define the safety profile, anti-cancer activity and the RP2D for future development.\n",

The effectiveness and safety of ADCs rely on both the mAb specificity, and the linker-payload employed. Several approved ADCs using microtubule inhibitor payloads are impacted by ocular adverse events that have been observed both preclinically and in patients. A class of linker-payloads incorporating topoisomerase 1 inhibitors (TOP1i) has emerged recently as an effective alternative to tubulin inhibitor-based ADCs. To date, TOP1i ADCs have not been associated with dose-limiting ocular toxicity seen with microtubule inhibitor payloads. Here we report the preclinical development of an ADAM9 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 9)-targeted ADC that incorporates a novel glycan-linked TOP1i. ADAM9, a member of the ADAM family of multifunctional type 1 transmembrane proteins, plays a role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression and is overexpressed in multiple cancers, making it an attractive target for cancer treatment.\n Methods: MGC028 incorporates the cleavable linker-payload, bicyclononyne carbamoyl sulfamide Val-Ala-PABC exatecan (SYNtecan E\u2122), site-specifically conjugated at asparagine 297 of the heavy chain through enzymatic glycan remodeling and metal-free click chemistry using Synaffix\u2019s GlycoConnect\u2122 technology. In vivo efficacy studies were performed in immunodeficient mice with ADAM9-expressing human tumor cell-line (CDX) or patient-derived (PDX) xenografts. A non-human primate toxicology study was conducted in which MGC028 was administered by 15-minute IV infusion every two weeks at dose levels of 22.5 and 55 mg/kg for a total of two doses.\n Results: MGC028 exhibited specific, dose-dependent in vivo antitumor activity toward ADAM9-positive CDX models representing gastric, lung, pancreatic and colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, MGC028 demonstrated antitumor activity toward ADAM9-positive PDX models of lung and pancreatic cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma. MGC028 was well tolerated in a repeat-dose non-human primate toxicology study, up to 55 mg/kg, the highest dose level tested. Observations were limited to mild, reversible increases in liver enzymes, without microscopic correlates, and decreased lymphoid cellularity in the thymus. In particular, ocular toxicities were not observed.\n Conclusions: MGC028 exhibited potent antitumor activity in in vivo models representing various solid cancer indications and was well tolerated in non-human primates at exposure levels exceeding those required for antitumor activity. Our findings support continued investigation of MGC028 as an ADC therapeutic for the treatment of ADAM9-expressing solid cancers.\n Citation Format: Juniper A. Scribner, Jennifer G.

In vivo efficacy studies were conducted in immunodeficient mice with human tumor cell-line or patient-derived xenografts to identify the spectrum of MGC026-sensitive tumors and the relationship between exposure and antitumor activity.

Additionally, MGC026 demonstrated antitumor activity toward B7-H3-positive patient-derived xenograft models of lung and prostate cancer, with additional indications under investigation. MGC026, administered to cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels of 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg every 3 weeks for a total of 3 doses, exhibited approximate dose-proportional PK and high stability in circulation. MGC026 was well tolerated, with no lung toxicity observed, and the highest dose level tested (50 mg/kg) was declared as the highest non-severely toxic dose.\n Conclusions: MGC026 exhibited a favorable preclinical profile, with potent in vivo activity toward B7-H3-expressing tumor xenografts representing a range of cancer indications.

Analogously, a novel class of immune-stimulating antibody conjugates (ISACs) has recently emerged to achieve tumor-targeted activation of anti-tumor immune responses, avoiding dose-limiting immunotoxicities seen with the systemic immune agonist delivery. Most of the ADC or ISAC to date utilize random payload conjugation to native surface-exposed lysines or cysteines, and relatively labile linkage chemistries, leading to conjugation site and drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) heterogeneity, and ADC/ISAC instability in systemic circulation. In particular, the presence of high-DAR species and linker instability can lead to off-tumor toxicity, thus limiting the therapeutic window. Here we describe the generation and preclinical characterization of a site-specific TLR7-agonist (TLR7a) ISAC targeting an undisclosed TAA1. To specify the conjugation site and DAR, a non-natural amino acid (nnAA), para-acetyl-L-phenylalanine (pAF) was genetically incorporated at defined sites within the anti-TAA1 antibody, providing an orthogonal chemical handle for covalent TLR7 agonist payload conjugation through a highly stable oxime bond. Using this site-specific, homogenous ISAC platform, we systematically screened different conjugate sites and TLR7 agonist payloads to obtain an optimized TAA1-TLR7a ISAC drug candidate. ISAC platform stability, homogeneity, and flexibility were critical, because conjugation site and payload structure dramatically influenced ISAC in vitro activity, PK profile and in vivo efficacy. Using in vitro co-culture assays with human immune cells and tumor cell lines, we showed that the optimized TAA1 ISAC can induce multiple anti-tumor immune mechanisms, including proinflammatory cytokine production, the myeloid cell activation markers induction and enhanced ADCC mediated tumor cell killing. The TAA1 ISAC is 100-fold more active than the free, unconjugated TLR7 agonist, and all activity is conditional on the presence of TAA1-expressing tumor cells. Finally, we demonstrated in vivo efficacy in both xenograft and syngeneic tumor models. In a syngeneic MC38-tumor model expressing human TAA1, ISAC treatment led to complete tumor regression and formation of immunologic memory. These results provide a strong rationale for site-specific TLR7 agonist ISAC as a next generation platform for tumor-targeted, innate immune agonist immunotherapy.\n Citation Format: Mingchao Kang, Sung-Ju Moon, Ji Young Kim, Andy Beck, Molly Allen, Jay Nelson, Keith Tatsukawa, Hon Tran, Manoj Pal, Michael Gray, Nick Knudsen, Lillian Skidmore, David Mills, Yingchun Lu, Ying Buechler, Sukumar Sakamuri, Shawn Zhang, Feng Tian.

Previously, EphA5 has been shown to contribute to DNA-damage repair and radiation therapy resistance in lung cancer. We investigated EphA5 expression in lung cancer as well as breast, pancreatic, gastric, and colorectal cancer and assessed its potential as a therapeutic target using a novel ADC, MBRC-101.\n Methods: MBRC-101 is composed of a humanized anti-EphA5 IgG1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a cleavable valine-citrulline linker using site-specific ThioBridge\u2122 technology. The specificity profile of the anti-EphA5 antibody was characterized using a membrane proteome array. Receptor-mediated antibody internalization was determined by real-time live-cell analysis, and cell killing assays were performed using analysis of cell confluence and luminescent-based viability. Expression of EphA5 in archival human tissue sections was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a commercial antibody. Efficacy studies used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of both lung and head and neck, and breast cancer.\n Results: IHC demonstrated selective EphA5 membrane expression in 78% (18/23) of triple negative and 88% (23/26) of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer tumors tested. EphA5 membrane expression was also detected in 85% (29/34), 73% (16/22), 70% (7/10), 70% (15/22), and 50% (6/12) of lung squamous cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, gastric, colorectal, and pancreatic patient tumors tested, respectively. EphA5 expression was not detected in adjacent, non-malignant tissue in any of the tumors examined. The anti-EphA5 antibody bound exclusively to EphA5 and did not cross-react with other members of the Eph receptor/ephrin ligand family. Binding of the anti-EphA5 antibody on the cell surface triggered rapid internalization and processing through the endosomal-lysosomal system. MBRC-101 was cytotoxic to EphA5-expressing cells and its activity was concentration-dependent and commensurate to levels of EphA5 on the cell surface. In PDX models, once weekly administrations of intravenous MBRC-101 showed dose-dependent, robust, and reproducible anti-tumor activity. Partial tumor responses were observed at doses of 2.5 mg/Kg and complete tumor responses starting at 5 mg/Kg. Toxicologic findings in Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys were attributed to the MMAE payload and not target-related. Based on an HNSTD of 10 mg/kg in monkeys, the starting human dose was 0.5 mg/kg with ~15-fold safety margin.\n Conclusions: EphA5 is a new and promising molecular target for the development of ADC-based therapies against many human cancers. A Phase 1/1b study of MBRC-101 is currently recruiting (NCT06014658).\n Citation Format: Fernanda I. Staquicini, Fenny H. Tang, Vanessa de Oliveira, Daniela I. Staquicini, Yongjian Wu, Kirstin F.

Based on this differential expression profile, a proof-of-concept for an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) approach utilizing NaPi2b was achieved with lifastuzumab vedotin and upifitamab rilsodotin. Both ADCs used auristatin tubulin inhibitor payloads but have been discontinued due to adverse toxicities driven by the linker-payload technologies, resulting in reduced drug exposures impacting efficacy. To overcome these limitations in therapeutic window, Adcentrx has developed ADRX-0134, a NaPi2b-targeting next-generation ADC with a drug-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. ADRX-0134 is conjugated to a novel tubulin inhibitor payload AP052 with a proprietary cleavable linker utilizing Adcentrx\u2019 proprietary i-Conjugation\u00ae technology, resulting in an ADC with refined biophysical features. The antibody of ADRX-0134 was selected based on its strong nanomolar and highly specific cell binding affinity and similar cross-reactivity to cynomolgus monkey and rodent orthologs. The ADC exhibits sub-nanomolar cytotoxic activity to NaPi2b-expressing tumor cells and has a very stable PK profile with minimal deconjugation. This translates to the observed strong efficacy and durable tumor regression in mouse models of ovarian, endometrial and non-small cell lung cancers with high as well as low/heterogenous NaPi2b expression. Most notably, ADRX-0134 achieved tumor regression in settings where deruxtecan- and vedotin-based NaPi2b ADCs were insufficient. Besides the improvement in efficacy, ADRX-0134 was highly tolerated in a repeat dose non-human primate study at up to 18 mg/kg, the highest tested dose. Here, the stable TK profile ensured minimal and recoverable hematology findings, an unchanged clinical chemistry profile and normal histology of lung, liver, GI and eye, which were key safety liabilities for other NaPi2b ADCs. In summary, ADRX-0134 exhibits excellent biophysical features with highly selective and increased efficacy in NaPi2b-expressing tumors, while being well-tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys at doses that are expected to provide a widened therapeutic window over first-generation NaPi2b ADCs.\n \n \n Andrew M.

            "abstract": "\n Shasqi is advancing the Click Activated Protodrugs Against Cancer (CAPAC\u00ae) platform based on click chemistry, a Nobel Prize winning technology. The platform is modular and comprises of 1) an activator that targets specific antigens, and 2) inert cancer drugs, protodrugs, which are selectively activated at tumors via click chemistry. The CAPAC technology separates the tumor targeting function from the payload and reunites them at the tumor creating the flexibility to optimize activity while limiting toxicity during preclinical and clinical development. The modularity of the platform enables the rapid development of new therapies as well as unlocking unique treatment benefits such as tunable combinations and payload cycling. We envision that CAPAC will expand the scope of potential targets, widen the activity window of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). Here we compare a HER2-targeting activator + a monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload with an ADC that binds the same target and carries the same payload, as well as other targeting formats.\n The activator SQT01 is composed of a HER2-binding Fab conjugated with tetrazines (Tz). The protodrug SQP22 is formed by coupling trans-cyclooctene (TCO, with a releasable linker) to MMAE, a cytotoxic spindle poison. An efficient covalent reaction between tetrazine and TCO moieties releases active MMAE at the tumor.\n Mice bearing human NCI-N87 HER2+ tumor were treated with 1) SQT01, 2) a non-binding isotype Fab-Tz, or 3) saline. After 18 h, all mice received either vehicle (10% HPCD), SQP22 protodrug, a non-releasable MMAE TCO-protodrug analog of SQP22, or a di-peptide-containing TCO-protodrug analog. We also tested CAPAC\u2019s approach with SQT06 (a full-length IgG trastuzumab-Tz conjugate) that was followed by an SQP22 dose after 4 days. The dosing of SQP22 with the Fab-Tz and IgG-Tz is timed to allow for systemic clearance of the targeting activator. Fabs have a shorter half-life than IgG, so we dosed SQP22 at 18 h after SQT01 instead of the 4-day timepoint with SQT06. To allow comparisons with ADCs, additional groups received a single dose of commercially available disitamab vedotin (DV) or a HER2-Fab-vedotin.\n SQT01+SQP22 induced a strong tumor growth inhibition comparable to SQT06+SQP22, but significantly better than DV, and SQT01+non-releasable protodrug analog. Dosing with SQT01 with a protease cleavable dipeptide-TCO protodrug analog or a molar equivalent dose of HER2-Fab-vedotin were highly toxic and intolerable. Based on preclinical observations, SQT01+SQP22 was safe and tolerated, and there was no observed body weight loss.\n These data demonstrate that the CAPAC platform, which separates the targeting agent from the payload, provides a clear benefit in terms of safety and efficacy compared with small or large format proteins with the classic fixed construct of ADCs (e.g. a fixed drug to antibody ratio).\n Citation Format: Sangeetha Srinivasan, Stefanie Wagner, George Coricor, Jesse M.

            "text": "\n Shasqi is advancing the Click Activated Protodrugs Against Cancer (CAPAC\u00ae) platform based on click chemistry, a Nobel Prize winning technology. The platform is modular and comprises of 1) an activator that targets specific antigens, and 2) inert cancer drugs, protodrugs, which are selectively activated at tumors via click chemistry. The CAPAC technology separates the tumor targeting function from the payload and reunites them at the tumor creating the flexibility to optimize activity while limiting toxicity during preclinical and clinical development. The modularity of the platform enables the rapid development of new therapies as well as unlocking unique treatment benefits such as tunable combinations and payload cycling. We envision that CAPAC will expand the scope of potential targets, widen the activity window of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). Here we compare a HER2-targeting activator + a monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload with an ADC that binds the same target and carries the same payload, as well as other targeting formats.\n The activator SQT01 is composed of a HER2-binding Fab conjugated with tetrazines (Tz). The protodrug SQP22 is formed by coupling trans-cyclooctene (TCO, with a releasable linker) to MMAE, a cytotoxic spindle poison. An efficient covalent reaction between tetrazine and TCO moieties releases active MMAE at the tumor.\n Mice bearing human NCI-N87 HER2+ tumor were treated with 1) SQT01, 2) a non-binding isotype Fab-Tz, or 3) saline. After 18 h, all mice received either vehicle (10% HPCD), SQP22 protodrug, a non-releasable MMAE TCO-protodrug analog of SQP22, or a di-peptide-containing TCO-protodrug analog. We also tested CAPAC\u2019s approach with SQT06 (a full-length IgG trastuzumab-Tz conjugate) that was followed by an SQP22 dose after 4 days. The dosing of SQP22 with the Fab-Tz and IgG-Tz is timed to allow for systemic clearance of the targeting activator. Fabs have a shorter half-life than IgG, so we dosed SQP22 at 18 h after SQT01 instead of the 4-day timepoint with SQT06. To allow comparisons with ADCs, additional groups received a single dose of commercially available disitamab vedotin (DV) or a HER2-Fab-vedotin.\n SQT01+SQP22 induced a strong tumor growth inhibition comparable to SQT06+SQP22, but significantly better than DV, and SQT01+non-releasable protodrug analog. Dosing with SQT01 with a protease cleavable dipeptide-TCO protodrug analog or a molar equivalent dose of HER2-Fab-vedotin were highly toxic and intolerable. Based on preclinical observations, SQT01+SQP22 was safe and tolerated, and there was no observed body weight loss.\n These data demonstrate that the CAPAC platform, which separates the targeting agent from the payload, provides a clear benefit in terms of safety and efficacy compared with small or large format proteins with the classic fixed construct of ADCs (e.g. a fixed drug to antibody ratio).\n Citation Format: Sangeetha Srinivasan, Stefanie Wagner, George Coricor, Jesse M.

Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates.",

However, resistance to these therapies has been a constant, leading to treatment-failure and new tumor progression. Recently, the kinase-impaired HER3 emerged as a pivotal player in oncogenic signaling, with an important role in both non-treated progression and treatment response. HER2/HER3 dimerization is required for full signaling potential and constitutes the key oncogenic unit. Also, when inhibiting PI3K/AKT pathway (as with anti-HER2 drugs) feedback mechanisms lead to a rebound in HER3 activity, which is one of the main roads to resistance. As current strategies to treat HER2-positive breast cancer are unable to inhibit this feedback response, two great promises emerged: the combination of targeted-therapies and drugs targeting HER3. In this article HER2 and HER3-targeted drugs and possible combinations between them, as well as the biomarkers to predict and monitor these drugs effect, are reviewed.",
                    "[21541286 | Doronina et al. | 2006 | Citations: 478]": "We have previously shown that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) consisting of cAC10 (anti-CD30) linked to the antimitotic agent monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) lead to potent in vitro and in vivo activities against antigen positive tumor models. MMAF is a new antimitotic auristatin derivative with a charged C-terminal phenylalanine residue that attenuates its cytotoxic activity compared to its uncharged counterpart, MMAE, most likely due to impaired intracellular access. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated that mAb-maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl-MMAF (mAb-L1-MMAF) conjugates were >2200-fold more potent than free MMAF on a large panel of CD30 positive hematologic cell lines. As with cAC10-L1-MMAE, the corresponding MMAF ADC induced cures and regressions of established xenograft tumors at well tolerated doses. To further optimize the ADC, several new linkers were generated in which various components within the L1 linker were either altered or deleted. One of the most promising linkers contained a noncleavable maleimidocaproyl (L4) spacer between the drug and the mAb. cAC10-L4-MMAF was approximately as potent in vitro as cAC10-L1-MMAF against a large panel of cell lines and was equally potent in vivo. Importantly, cAC10-L4-MMAF was tolerated at >3 times the MTD of cAC10-L1-MMAF. LCMS studies indicated that drug released from cAC10-L4-MMAF was the cysteine-L4-MMAF adduct, which likely arises from mAb degradation within the lysosomes of target cells. This new linker technology appears to be ideally suited for drugs that are both relatively cell-impermeable and tolerant of substitution with amino acids. Thus, alterations of the linker have pronounced impacts on toxicity and lead to new ADCs with greatly improved therapeutic indices."

To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of T-DM1 in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer, data from four studies (TDM3569g, TDM4258g, TDM4374g, and TDM4688g) of single-agent T-DM1 administered at 3.6\u00a0mg/kg every 3\u00a0weeks (q3w) were assessed in aggregate.MethodsMultiple analytes\u2014T-DM1, total trastuzumab (TT), DM1, and key metabolites\u2014were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. PK parameters of T-DM1, TT, and DM1 exposure were calculated using standard noncompartmental approaches and correlated to efficacy (objective response rate) and safety (platelet counts, hepatic transaminase concentrations). Immunogenicity was evaluated by measuring anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) to T-DM1 after repeated dosing using validated bridging antibody electrochemiluminescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.ResultsPK parameters for T-DM1, TT, and DM1 were consistent across studies at cycle 1 and steady state. T-DM1 PK was not affected by residual trastuzumab from prior therapy or circulating extracellular domain of HER2. No significant correlations were observed between T-DM1 exposure and efficacy, thrombocytopenia, or increased concentrations of transaminases. Across the studies, ATA formation was detected in 4.5% (13/286) of evaluable patients receiving T-DM1 q3w.ConclusionsThe PK profile of single-agent T-DM1 (3.6\u00a0mg/kg q3w) is predictable, well characterized, and unaffected by circulating levels of HER2 extracellular domain or residual trastuzumab. T-DM1 exposure does not correlate with clinical responses or key adverse events."

The drug, with an attached linker and an amino acid or short proteolytic peptide to which the linker is conjugated, is released to the cytosol and exerts its cytotoxic activity (Erickson et al., 2006)[130].

Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates.",

The greater efficacy and tolerability of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 with a stable linker vs. maytansinoid conjugates with cleavable disulfide linkers was noted in a previous section (Phillips et al., 2008). Polson et al. compared the conjugates of both maytansinoids as well as an auristatin group of tubulin polymerization-inhibiting drugs, using cleavable and noncleavable linkers in NHL models (Polson et al., 2009). Conjugates of maytansinoids with a stable linker (MAb-MCC-DM1) or a cleavable disulfide bond (MAb-SPP-DM1) were evaluated. Likewise, in the auristatin group, MMAE conjugates contained a cleavable linker, while MMAF conjugates contained a stable linker. It was found that anti-CD22 conjugates of these drugs with noncleavable linkers were less toxic in rats than those with cleavable linkers with both groups of drugs, when administered at single i.v. dose of 20 mg protein dose per kilogram. The study also found that ADCs with cleavable linkers were effective in a broad range of targets, while those with noncleavable linkers were more selective in the tumor targets that could be treated. Thus, which type of linker to use is a function of the specific tumor target, the tolerability of drug to substitution, and the therapeutic window achievable.",

Here, we systematically examine the potential targets and linker-drug combinations that could provide an optimal ADC for the treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We identified seven antigens (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD72, CD79b, and CD180) for potential treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with ADCs. ADCs with cleavable linkers mediated in vivo efficacy via all these targets; ADCs with uncleavable linkers were only effective when targeted to CD22 and CD79b. In target-independent safety studies in rats, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity, presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation. Thus, our data suggest that ADCs with cleavable linkers work on a broad range of targets, and for specific targets, ADCs with uncleavable linkers provide a promising opportunity to improve the therapeutic window for ADCs in humans.",

Two drugs are currently approved for HER2-positive breast cancer: trastuzumab (Herceptin), introduced in 1998, and lapatinib (Tykerb), in 2007. Despite these advances, some patients progress through therapy and succumb to their disease. A variation on antibody-targeted therapy is utilization of antibodies to deliver cytotoxic agents specifically to antigen-expressing tumors. We determined in vitro and in vivo efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of trastuzumab-maytansinoid (microtubule-depolymerizing agents) conjugates using disulfide and thioether linkers. Antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab-maytansinoid conjugates were evaluated on cultured normal and tumor cells. In vivo activity was determined in mouse breast cancer models, and toxicity was assessed in rats as measured by body weight loss. Surprisingly, trastuzumab linked to DM1 through a nonreducible thioether linkage (SMCC), displayed superior activity compared with unconjugated trastuzumab or trastuzumab linked to other maytansinoids through disulfide linkers. Serum concentrations of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 remained elevated compared with other conjugates, and toxicity in rats was negligible compared with free DM1 or trastuzumab linked to DM1 through a reducible linker. Potent activity was observed on all HER2-overexpressing tumor cells, whereas nontransformed cells and tumor cell lines with normal HER2 expression were unaffected. In addition, trastuzumab-DM1 was active on HER2-overexpressing, trastuzumab-refractory tumors. In summary, trastuzumab-DM1 shows greater activity compared with nonconjugated trastuzumab while maintaining selectivity for HER2-overexpressing tumor cells. Because trastuzumab linked to DM1 through a nonreducible linker offers improved efficacy and pharmacokinetics and reduced toxicity over the reducible disulfide linkers evaluated, trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 was selected for clinical development."

The greater efficacy and tolerability of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 with a stable linker vs. maytansinoid conjugates with cleavable disulfide linkers was noted in a previous section (Phillips et al., 2008). Polson et al. compared the conjugates of both maytansinoids as well as an auristatin group of tubulin polymerization-inhibiting drugs, using cleavable and noncleavable linkers in NHL models (Polson et al., 2009). Conjugates of maytansinoids with a stable linker (MAb-MCC-DM1) or a cleavable disulfide bond (MAb-SPP-DM1) were evaluated. Likewise, in the auristatin group, MMAE conjugates contained a cleavable linker, while MMAF conjugates contained a stable linker. It was found that anti-CD22 conjugates of these drugs with noncleavable linkers were less toxic in rats than those with cleavable linkers with both groups of drugs, when administered at single i.v. dose of 20 mg protein dose per kilogram. The study also found that ADCs with cleavable linkers were effective in a broad range of targets, while those with noncleavable linkers were more selective in the tumor targets that could be treated. Thus, which type of linker to use is a function of the specific tumor target, the tolerability of drug to substitution, and the therapeutic window achievable."

Despite the high potency of synthetic AIP analogues in agr inhibition, the potential of AIP molecules as a delivery vehicle for antibacterial agents remains unexplored. Herein, we report that truncated AIP scaffolds can be fused with fluorophore and cytotoxic photosensitizer molecules without compromising their high agr inhibitory activity, binding affinity to the receptor AgrC, or cell specificity. Strikingly, a photosensitizer-AIP conjugate exhibited 16-fold greater efficacy in a S.\u00a0aureus cell-killing assay than a nontargeting analogue. These findings highlight the potential of truncated AIP conjugates as useful chemical tools for in-depth biological studies and as effective anti-S.\u00a0aureus agents.",

Non-cleavable linkers do not have a designated weak point in their structure that can lead to cleavage by proteases, hydrolases or chemically by pH changes. Consequently, when designing a conjugate, the choice of a non-cleavable over a cleavable linker is usually a consequence of pursuing a certain mode of action where the stability of the complex is more important than a fast liberation of the active moiety. Linkers of various length, polarity, stability and flexibility are used for different types of conjugates and the linker design is mostly driven by the particular purpose and desired mode of action. This article reviews non-cleavable linkers applied predominantly in Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs), and how they influence these conjugates in terms of ADME properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination) and safety."

Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Fig. 1 The development, purification, and production of antibody-drug conjugates cathepsins). pH-sensitive hydrazone (found in brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, trastuzumab deruxtecan, and sacituzumab govitecan) is another enzyme-cleavable peptide-based linker (T-DXd) (Jain et al., 2015)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016).\n\nNon-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability (Lu et al., 2016).",

Of the 34 disclosed structures, 24 of them use a linkage to the thiol of cysteines on the monoclonal antibody. The remaining 10 candidates utilize chemistry to surface lysines of the antibody. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of conjugation to the multiple lysines or cysteines found in mAbs, significant research efforts are now being directed toward the production of discrete, homogeneous ADC products, via site-specific conjugation. These site-specific conjugations may involve genetic engineering of the mAb to introduce discrete, available cysteines or non-natural amino acids with an orthogonally-reactive functional group handle such as an aldehyde, ketone, azido, or alkynyl tag. These site-specific approaches not only increase the homogeneity of ADCs but also enable novel bio-orthogonal chemistries that utilize reactive moieties other than thiol or amine.

Cleavable linkers contain chemical or enzymatic liable chemistries formulated to exploit specific conditions unique to the intracellular or tumor extracellular environments, with the goal of maintaining good stability in the systemic circulation and rapid cleavage at the target site (Lu et al., 2016)(Bargh et al., 2019). In practice, cleavable linkers are often hydrolyzed in plasma at an appreciable rate, leading to the premature release of the payload in the extra-tumoral compartments. Lipophilic payloads exhibit high permeability through plasma membranes and, consequently, the released payload enters non-targeted cells efficiently (e.g., via membrane diffusion), potentially leading to unwanted cytotoxicity...Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues. For instance, in a study by Polson et al., several ADCs were constructed by conjugating antibodies against a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigens to a DM1 payload via either a cleavable (SPP) or a non-cleavable (SMCC) linker and were tested for in vivo toxicity and efficacy (Polson et al., 2009). The SMCC-ADCs showed efficacy against only two of the seven target antigens, while the SPP-ADCs were active against all targets. However, at the dose of 20 mg ADC/kg, the animals treated with an ADC bearing the cleavable linker SPP exhibited much more significant weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities when compared with the results observed following dosing with ADC employing the non-cleavable linker SMCC.",

We identified seven antigens (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD72, CD79b, and CD180) for potential treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with ADCs. ADCs with cleavable linkers mediated in vivo efficacy via all these targets; ADCs with uncleavable linkers were only effective when targeted to CD22 and CD79b. In target-independent safety studies in rats, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity, presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation. Thus, our data suggest that ADCs with cleavable linkers work on a broad range of targets, and for specific targets, ADCs with uncleavable linkers provide a promising opportunity to improve the therapeutic window for ADCs in humans.",

For instance, in a study by Polson et al., several ADCs were constructed by conjugating antibodies against a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigens to a DM1 payload via either a cleavable (SPP) or a non-cleavable (SMCC) linker and were tested for in vivo toxicity and efficacy (Polson et al., 2009). The SMCC-ADCs showed efficacy against only two of the seven target antigens, while the SPP-ADCs were active against all targets. However, at the dose of 20 mg ADC/kg, the animals treated with an ADC bearing the cleavable linker SPP exhibited much more significant weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities when compared with the results observed following dosing with ADC employing the non-cleavable linker SMCC."

Our lead agent, SGN-35, consists of the cAC10 antibody linked to the N-terminal amino acid of monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) via a valine-citrulline p-aminobenzylcarbamate (val-cit-PABC) linker that is cleaved by intracellular proteases such as cathepsin B. More recently, we developed an auristatin F (AF) derivative monomethylauristatin F (MMAF), which unlike MMAE contains the amino acid phenylalanine at the C-terminal position. Because of the negatively charged C-terminal residue, the potency of AF and MMAF is impaired. However, their ability to kill target cells is greatly enhanced through facilitated cellular uptake by internalizing mAbs. Here, we explore the effects of linker technology on AF-based ADC potency, activity, and tolerability by generating a diverse set of dipeptide linkers between the C-terminal residue and the mAb carrier. The resulting ADCs differed widely in activity, with some having significantly improved therapeutic indices compared to the original mAb-Val-Cit-PABC-MMAF conjugate. The therapeutic index was increased yet further by generating dipeptide-based ADCs utilizing new auristatins with methionine or tryptophan as the C-terminal drug residue. These results demonstrate that manipulation of the C-terminal peptide sequence used to attach auristatins to the mAb carrier can lead to highly potent and specific conjugates with greatly improved therapeutic windows.",

Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity (Nolting, 2013). Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level (Zhang et al., 2019)...ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Kovtun et al., 2006), and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression.

Humanized 1F6 (h1F6) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD70, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family that is expressed on hematologic malignancies and carcinomas. Here, we tested h1F6\u2013maleimidocaproyl (mc) MMAF conjugates, consisting of an uncleavable mc linker, for their ability to interfere with the growth of CD70-positive carcinomas. Experimental Design: To evaluate the optimal drug per antibody ratio, we conjugated either four or eight MMAF molecules to the cysteines that comprise the interchain disulfides of h1F6 and determined antitumor activities in vitro and in xenografted mice. The tumor types tested included glioblastoma, patient-derived renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell isolates, and standard RCC tumor cell lines. Results: All h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates potently interfered with the growth of all carcinomas in vitro and resulted in complete responses of RCC tumors implanted orthotopically or s.c. in mice. In vitro, h1F6-mcMMAF(8) was generally more potent than h1F6-mcMMAF(4). However, h1F6-mcMMAF(4) displayed equal or better efficacy than h1F6-mcMMAF(8) when administered to tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions: We showed that h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates inhibited the growth of human carcinomas and that increased drug loading, while improving potency in vitro, did not substantially affect the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in vivo.

                "snippets": "Linkers can be broadly classified as cleavable or non-cleavable, each with their own distinct mechanism of action (Lu et al., 2016). Cleavable linkers, such as hydrazone, disulphide and peptide linkers, allow selective cleavage of the ADC within the tumor cell by exploiting environmental differences between healthy and malignant tissues, such as pH or the presence of specific enzymes (Baah et al., 2021). Once the ADC is internalized by binding to its tumor-associated antigen, the linker can be cleaved to release the cytotoxic drug directly within the cancer cell. Depending on the payload drug chemistry, the drug can be cell-impermeant resulting in killing of only the targeted cell, or cell-permeant which enables killing of the surrounding, antigen-negative cells in a process called bystander killing. Similarly, a cleavable linker can be cleaved within the tumor microenvironment before cell internalization of the ADC, releasing the drug and also producing bystander killing (Staudacher et al., 2017). Although bystander killing is undesirable for healthy cells, the process could allow eradication of antigennegative tumor cells that would otherwise not have been targeted by the ADC (Kovtun et al., 2006)(Golfier et al., 2014) and could also facilitate the maturation and activation of intratumoral immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), which are known to be activated by certain ADC payloads such as maytansines, aurostatins, and pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers (Martin et al., 2014)(M\u00fcller et al., 2014)(Rios-Doria et al., 2017). Non-cleavable linkers such as thioether and maleimidocaproyl (MMC) linkers, are not susceptible to environmental or enzymatic cleavage and instead are only broken down to release the cytotoxic payload after tumor cell internalization and subsequent antibody degradation in the endosomes and lysosomes [14].",

We show that these payloads on their own induced an immune response that prevented the growth of tumors following subsequent tumor cell challenge. ADCs had greater antitumor activity in immunocompetent versus immunodeficient mice, demonstrating a contribution of the immune system to the antitumor activity of these ADCs. ADCs also induced immunologic memory. In the CT26 model, depletion of CD8+ T cells abrogated the activity of ADCs when used alone or in combination with a PD-L1 antibody, confirming a role for T cells in antitumor activity. Combinations of ADCs with immuno-oncology drugs, including PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies, OX40 ligand, or GITR ligand fusion proteins, produced synergistic antitumor responses. Importantly, synergy was observed in some cases with suboptimal doses of ADCs, potentially providing an approach to achieve potent antitumor responses while minimizing ADC-induced toxicity. Immunophenotyping studies in different tumor models revealed broad immunomodulation of lymphoid and myeloid cells by ADC and ADC/immuno-oncology combinations.

Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADC) are emerging as powerful treatment strategies with outstanding target-specificity and high therapeutic activity in patients with cancer.

We hypothesized that its sustained clinical responses could be related to the stimulation of an anticancer immune response. In this study, we demonstrate that the dolastatin family of microtubule inhibitors, from which the cytotoxic component of brentuximab vedotin is derived, comprises potent inducers of phenotypic and functional dendritic cell (DC) maturation. In addition to the direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, dolastatins efficiently promoted antigen uptake and migration of tumor-resident DCs to the tumor-draining lymph nodes. Exposure of murine and human DCs to dolastatins significantly increased their capacity to prime T cells. Underlining the requirement of an intact host immune system for the full therapeutic benefit of dolastatins, the antitumor effect was far less pronounced in immunocompromised mice. We observed substantial therapeutic synergies when combining dolastatins with tumor antigen\u2013specific vaccination or blockade of the PD-1\u2013PD-L1 and CTLA-4 coinhibitory pathways. Ultimately, treatment with ADCs using dolastatins induces DC homing and activates cellular antitumor immune responses in patients.

Cleavable linkers, such as hydrazone, disulphide and peptide linkers, allow selective cleavage of the ADC within the tumor cell by exploiting environmental differences between healthy and malignant tissues, such as pH or the presence of specific enzymes (Baah et al., 2021). Once the ADC is internalized by binding to its tumor-associated antigen, the linker can be cleaved to release the cytotoxic drug directly within the cancer cell. Depending on the payload drug chemistry, the drug can be cell-impermeant resulting in killing of only the targeted cell, or cell-permeant which enables killing of the surrounding, antigen-negative cells in a process called bystander killing. Similarly, a cleavable linker can be cleaved within the tumor microenvironment before cell internalization of the ADC, releasing the drug and also producing bystander killing (Staudacher et al., 2017). Although bystander killing is undesirable for healthy cells, the process could allow eradication of antigennegative tumor cells that would otherwise not have been targeted by the ADC (Kovtun et al., 2006)(Golfier et al., 2014) and could also facilitate the maturation and activation of intratumoral immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), which are known to be activated by certain ADC payloads such as maytansines, aurostatins, and pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers (Martin et al., 2014)(M\u00fcller et al., 2014)(Rios-Doria et al., 2017). Non-cleavable linkers such as thioether and maleimidocaproyl (MMC) linkers, are not susceptible to environmental or enzymatic cleavage and instead are only broken down to release the cytotoxic payload after tumor cell internalization and subsequent antibody degradation in the endosomes and lysosomes [14]."

                "snippets": "The linker, tethering the cytotoxic payload to the mAb, is another crucial factor influencing ADCs therapeutic index and PK, as it determines plasma stability and release profile of the payload (Fu et al., 2022)(Gogia et al., 2023)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022). Generally, most ADC drugs incorporate two types of covalent linkers, cleavable and non-cleavable, which differ in their intracellular processing and systemic stability. While both have been shown to be safe in preclinical and clinical settings, cleavable linkers currently dominate the ADC landscape. For a comprehensive overview of the topic, the readers are advised to refer to (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021)...Notably, acid-sensitive linkers are insufficiently stable and can occasionally be hydrolyzed in the plasma, leading to premature drug release and off-target toxicity. This liability is one of the causes leading to the voluntary Mylotarg \u00ae withdrawal by Pfizer from the US market in 2000, following the severe liver toxicity seen in patients (Nguyen et al., 2023)(Sievers et al., 2001)(Petersdorf et al., 2013)...Due to their resistance to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, these linkers enjoy the advantages of increased plasma stability, longer half-lives, and lower off-target toxicity than the cleavable counterpart, rendering them potentially superior for targeting homogenously expressed Ag (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021). Nonetheless, as most tumors display heterogenous Ag expression, constructs incorporating cleavable linkers with membranepermeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects, unlike the non-cleavable linker type (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021).",

Despite recent successes, many ADCs fail during clinical development due to excessive toxicities and unfavorable risk-benefit profiles. Even for those ADCs that have been approved for clinical use, a substantial fraction of treated patients require dose reduction, treatment delays, or treatment discontinuation due to intolerable ADC-associated toxicity. In this report, we review the mechanisms contributing to the clinical toxicity of ADCs, and we discuss strategies to improve ADC tolerability. Abstract Anti-cancer antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) aim to expand the therapeutic index of traditional chemotherapy by employing the targeting specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to increase the efficiency of the delivery of potent cytotoxic agents to malignant cells. In the past three years, the number of ADCs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tripled. Although several ADCs have demonstrated sufficient efficacy and safety to warrant FDA approval, the clinical use of all ADCs leads to substantial toxicity in treated patients, and many ADCs have failed during clinical development due to their unacceptable toxicity profiles. Analysis of the clinical data has demonstrated that dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are often shared by different ADCs that deliver the same cytotoxic payload, independent of the antigen that is targeted and/or the type of cancer that is treated. DLTs are commonly associated with cells and tissues that do not express the targeted antigen (i.e., off-target toxicity), and often limit ADC dosage to levels below those required for optimal anti-cancer effects. In this manuscript, we review the fundamental mechanisms contributing to ADC toxicity, we summarize common ADC treatment-related adverse events, and we discuss several approaches to mitigating ADC toxicity.",

We will also discuss the landmark clinical trials that demonstrated their treatment efficacy in each indication and that have been approved for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We will also discuss unique side effects which are tied to the normal tissue expression of the antigen, the intrinsic toxicity of the payload, and the off-target toxicity. Finally, we will discuss some exciting new developments in the pipeline, including peptide\u2013drug conjugates, immune-stimulating drug conjugates, and radioactive isotopes as payloads. Abstract Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) are an innovative family of agents assembled through linking cytotoxic drugs (payloads) covalently to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to be delivered to tumor tissue that express their particular antigen, with the theoretical advantage of an augmented therapeutic ratio. As of June 2023, eleven ADCs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are on the market. These drugs have been added to the therapeutic armamentarium of acute myeloblastic and lymphoblastic leukemias, various types of lymphoma, breast, gastric or gastroesophageal junction, lung, urothelial, cervical, and ovarian cancers. They have proven to deliver more potent and effective anti-tumor activities than standard practice in a wide variety of indications. In addition to targeting antigen-expressing tumor cells, bystander effects have been engineered to extend cytotoxic killing to low-antigen-expressing or negative tumor cells in the heterogenous tumor milieu. Inevitably, myelosuppression is a common side effect with most of the ADCs due to the effects of the cytotoxic payload. Also, other unique side effects are specific to the tissue antigen that is targeted for, such as the cardiac toxicity with Her-2 targeting ADCs, and the hemorrhagic side effects with the tissue factor (TF) targeting Tisotumab vedotin. Further exciting developments are centered in the strategies to improve the tolerability and efficacy of the ADCs to improve the therapeutic window; as well as the development of novel payloads including (1) peptide\u2013drug conjugates (PDCs), with the peptide replacing the monoclonal antibody, rendering greater tumor penetration; (2) immune-stimulating antibody conjugates (ISACs), which upon conjugation of the antigen, cause an influx of pro-inflammatory cytokines to activate dendritic cells and harness an anti-tumor T-cell response; and (3) the use of radioactive isotopes as a payload to enhance cytotoxic activity.",

To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives.",

All patients received Mylotarg as a 2-hour intravenous infusion, at a dose of 9 mg/m(2), at 2-week intervals for two doses. Patients were evaluated for remission, survival, and treatment-emergent adverse events.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty percent of patients treated with Mylotarg obtained remission as characterized by 5% or less blasts in the marrow, recovery of neutrophils to at least 1,500/microL, and RBC and platelet transfusion independence. Although patients treated with Mylotarg had relatively high incidences of myelosuppression, grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia (23%), and elevated hepatic transaminase levels (17%), the incidences of grade 3 or 4 mucositis (4%) and infections (28%) were relatively low. There was a low incidence of severe nausea and vomiting (11%) and no treatment-related cardiotoxicity, cerebellar toxicity, or alopecia. Many patients received Mylotarg on an outpatient basis (38% and 41% of patients for the first and second doses, respectively). Among the 142 patients, the median total duration of hospitalization was 24 days; 16% of patients required 7 days of hospitalization or less.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAdministration of the antibody-targeted chemotherapy agent Mylotarg to patients with CD33-positive AML in first relapse induces complete remissions with what appears to be a favorable safety profile."

Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives.",

For antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), the introduction of drug-linkers can lead to increased hydrophobicity and higher levels of aggregation, which are both detrimental to the properties required for subcutaneous dosing. Herein we show how the physicochemical properties of ADCs could be controlled through the drug-linker chemistry in combination with prodrug chemistry of the payload, and how optimization of these combinations could afford ADCs with significantly improved solution stability. Key to achieving this optimization is the use of an accelerated stress test performed in a minimal formulation buffer."

It is imperative for the stability of linkers within the circulatory system to prevent the premature release of cytotoxic drugs from ADCs, as this may result in off-target toxicity. However, these linkers must be designed to be unstable under specific conditions to facilitate the delivery of the drug payload into tumor cells. There are two main types of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers undergo hydrolysis, protease cleavage, or disulfide bond cleavage within early endosomes or secondary endosomes, allowing the release of potent cytotoxic drugs. A commonly utilized mechanism involves the action of glutathione, where cleavable linkers are designed to be sensitive to glutathione. This sensitivity leads to linker cleavage, subsequently releasing the therapeutic payload into the intracellular environment. This mechanism capitalizes on the reducing properties of glutathione, facilitating controlled drug release specifically within the intracellular space (Baah et al., 2021). Examples of ADCs utilizing this cleavable linker mechanism include brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, and polatuzumab vedotin, which employ a pH-sensitive hydrazone linker (Sonawane et al., 2017). On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are resistant to cleavage and remain intact after being fused to the lysosome. The acidic environment generated by the lysosomal proton pump promotes protein degradation through cathepsin B or plasmin-mediated pathways. Studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linkers exhibit greater stability in blood compared to cleavable linkers (Jain et al., 2015). Furthermore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers present a reduced risk of systemic toxicity caused by premature payload release when the drug payload is released within the lysosome. The FDA has approved T-DM1 and mafodotin belantamab as examples of ADCs utilizing non-cleavable linkers (Tong et al., 2021).",

Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers.

Because these conditions can occur independently of antigen internalization, cleavable linkers are often less stable in the blood, resulting in various off-target effects (Polakis, 2016). In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as the thioether or maleimidocaproyl linkers, require internalization by the target cell, so that the antibody, rather than the linker, can be degraded by the lysosome before the drug is released. This latter mechanism does not produce efficient bystander killing and thus results in lower toxicity profiles (Staudacher et al., 2017).",

This, as well as the chemistry of the drug, can dictate whether the drug can diffuse into surrounding cells, resulting in \u2018bystander killing\u2019. Initially, any bystander killing mechanism of action of an ADC was understood to involve an essential sequence of steps beginning with surface antigen targeting, internalisation, intracellular linker cleavage, drug release, and diffusion of drug away from the targeted cell. However, recent studies indicate that, depending on the linker and drug combination, this mechanism may not be essential and ADCs can be cleaved extracellularly or via other mechanisms. In this minireview, we will examine the role of bystander killing by ADCs and explore the emerging evidence of how this can occur independently of internalisation."

Despite recent successes, many ADCs fail during clinical development due to excessive toxicities and unfavorable risk-benefit profiles. Even for those ADCs that have been approved for clinical use, a substantial fraction of treated patients require dose reduction, treatment delays, or treatment discontinuation due to intolerable ADC-associated toxicity. In this report, we review the mechanisms contributing to the clinical toxicity of ADCs, and we discuss strategies to improve ADC tolerability. Abstract Anti-cancer antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) aim to expand the therapeutic index of traditional chemotherapy by employing the targeting specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to increase the efficiency of the delivery of potent cytotoxic agents to malignant cells. In the past three years, the number of ADCs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tripled. Although several ADCs have demonstrated sufficient efficacy and safety to warrant FDA approval, the clinical use of all ADCs leads to substantial toxicity in treated patients, and many ADCs have failed during clinical development due to their unacceptable toxicity profiles. Analysis of the clinical data has demonstrated that dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are often shared by different ADCs that deliver the same cytotoxic payload, independent of the antigen that is targeted and/or the type of cancer that is treated. DLTs are commonly associated with cells and tissues that do not express the targeted antigen (i.e., off-target toxicity), and often limit ADC dosage to levels below those required for optimal anti-cancer effects. In this manuscript, we review the fundamental mechanisms contributing to ADC toxicity, we summarize common ADC treatment-related adverse events, and we discuss several approaches to mitigating ADC toxicity."

Ideal linkers should maintain the ADC's stability in plasma while ensuring payload release, specifically at the tumor site. This targeted release is essential for effectively delivering the cytotoxic payload to cancer cells, as premature release can result in systemic off-target toxicity (Sheyi et al., 2022). Linkers can be classified into two types: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release their payloads in response to specific conditions, such as the pH of cancer cells, reducing agents, and enzymes. Cleavable linkers may increase the efficiency of payload release, causing a bystander effect, but they also have a higher risk of increasing toxicity in normal tissues. On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma, so they only release the drug after the antibody has been completely degraded in the lysosome.

Ideal linkers should maintain the ADC's stability in plasma while ensuring payload release, specifically at the tumor site. This targeted release is essential for effectively delivering the cytotoxic payload to cancer cells, as premature release can result in systemic off-target toxicity (Sheyi et al., 2022). Linkers can be classified into two types: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release their payloads in response to specific conditions, such as the pH of cancer cells, reducing agents, and enzymes. Cleavable linkers may increase the efficiency of payload release, causing a bystander effect, but they also have a higher risk of increasing toxicity in normal tissues. On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma, so they only release the drug after the antibody has been completely degraded in the lysosome. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are not expected to induce a bystander effect. Currently, most ADCs use cleavable linkers."

Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives."

Humanized 1F6 (h1F6) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD70, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family that is expressed on hematologic malignancies and carcinomas. Here, we tested h1F6\u2013maleimidocaproyl (mc) MMAF conjugates, consisting of an uncleavable mc linker, for their ability to interfere with the growth of CD70-positive carcinomas. Experimental Design: To evaluate the optimal drug per antibody ratio, we conjugated either four or eight MMAF molecules to the cysteines that comprise the interchain disulfides of h1F6 and determined antitumor activities in vitro and in xenografted mice. The tumor types tested included glioblastoma, patient-derived renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell isolates, and standard RCC tumor cell lines. Results: All h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates potently interfered with the growth of all carcinomas in vitro and resulted in complete responses of RCC tumors implanted orthotopically or s.c. in mice. In vitro, h1F6-mcMMAF(8) was generally more potent than h1F6-mcMMAF(4). However, h1F6-mcMMAF(4) displayed equal or better efficacy than h1F6-mcMMAF(8) when administered to tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions: We showed that h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates inhibited the growth of human carcinomas and that increased drug loading, while improving potency in vitro, did not substantially affect the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. Based on these findings, h1F6-mcMMAF(4), designated SGN-75, has been identified as a potential antibody-drug conjugate for clinical development.",

Previously, we have investigated key linker parameters such as conjugation chemistry (e.g., maleimide vs. disulfide), linker length and linker steric hindrance and their impacts on PK and efficacy profiles. Herein, we discuss our perspectives on development of integrated strategies for linker design to achieve a balance between ADC stability and payload release efficiency for desired efficacy in antigen-expressing xenograft models. The strategies have been successfully applied to the design of site-specific THIOMABTM antibody-drug conjugates (TDCs) with different payloads.

MMAF is a new antimitotic auristatin derivative with a charged C-terminal phenylalanine residue that attenuates its cytotoxic activity compared to its uncharged counterpart, MMAE, most likely due to impaired intracellular access. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated that mAb-maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl-MMAF (mAb-L1-MMAF) conjugates were >2200-fold more potent than free MMAF on a large panel of CD30 positive hematologic cell lines. As with cAC10-L1-MMAE, the corresponding MMAF ADC induced cures and regressions of established xenograft tumors at well tolerated doses. To further optimize the ADC, several new linkers were generated in which various components within the L1 linker were either altered or deleted. One of the most promising linkers contained a noncleavable maleimidocaproyl (L4) spacer between the drug and the mAb. cAC10-L4-MMAF was approximately as potent in vitro as cAC10-L1-MMAF against a large panel of cell lines and was equally potent in vivo. Importantly, cAC10-L4-MMAF was tolerated at >3 times the MTD of cAC10-L1-MMAF. LCMS studies indicated that drug released from cAC10-L4-MMAF was the cysteine-L4-MMAF adduct, which likely arises from mAb degradation within the lysosomes of target cells.

The choice of linker is one of the critical parameters of ADC design, and is usually experimentally determined for each target and cell type. Numerous examples of both linker types (cleavable and non-cleavable) are currently utilized in the clinic (Rostami et al., 2014)(Jackson et al., 2014)(Mccombs et al., 2015). Regardless of its type, the ideal linker remains intact in systemic circulation, and releases the cytotoxic agent only after internalization in the target cell (Mccombs et al., 2015)(Sanderson et al., 2005), either by the built-in trigger (cleavable linkers) or by degradation of the antibody (non-cleavable linkers)."

Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates."

Critical parameters that govern successful antibody-drug conjugate development for clinical use include the selection of the tumor target antigen, the antibody against the target, the cytotoxic molecule, the linker bridging the cytotoxic molecule and the antibody, and the conjugation chemistry used for the attachment of the cytotoxic molecule to the antibody. Advancements in these core antibody-drug conjugate technology are reflected by recent approval of Adectris\u00ae (anti-CD30-drug conjugate) and Kadcyla\u00ae (anti-HER2 drug conjugate). The potential approval of an anti-CD22 conjugate and promising new clinical data for anti-CD19 and anti-CD33 conjugates are additional advancements. Enrichment of antibody-drug conjugates with newly developed potent cytotoxic molecules and linkers are also in the pipeline for various tumor targets. However, the complexity of antibody-drug conjugate components, conjugation methods, and off-target toxicities still pose challenges for the strategic design of antibody-drug conjugates to achieve their fullest therapeutic potential. This review will discuss the emergence of clinical antibody-drug conjugates, current trends in optimization strategies, and recent study results for antibody-drug conjugates that have incorporated the latest optimization strategies. Future challenges and perspectives toward making antibody-drug conjugates more amendable for broader disease indications are also discussed."

Ideally the linker should be stable in circulation to minimize toxicity but release the active cytotoxin once it is internalized by the tumor cell. The linkers can be categorized as cleavable and non-cleavable, with varying degrees of stability (Polakis, 2016)(Flygare et al., 2013). Cleavable linkers use mechanisms within the cells or cellular compartments to release active cytotoxin, such as low pH (acid labile linkers), glutathione levels (disulfide linkers), and lysosomal proteases (protease cleavable linkers). In contrast, for non-cleavable linkers (e.g. thioether linkers), the entire ADC has to be degraded to release the active cytotoxin."

The linker chemistry, particularly whether it is cleavable or non-cleavable, significantly influences the pharmacokinetics, systemic toxicity, and efficacy of ADCs. (LLM Memory)",
                "text": "\nAntibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) represent a sophisticated class of biopharmaceuticals designed to deliver potent cytotoxic agents specifically to cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. The fundamental components of an ADC include: a monoclonal antibody that targets a tumor-associated antigen, a cytotoxic payload that induces cell death, and a linker that connects these two components. The linker chemistry is a critical design element that determines how and when the cytotoxic payload is released from the antibody.\n\nLinkers in ADCs are broadly classified into two major categories: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers are designed to release the cytotoxic payload in response to specific conditions found predominantly in or around tumor cells, such as acidic pH (hydrazone linkers), reducing environments (disulfide linkers), or the presence of specific enzymes like cathepsins (peptide linkers). In contrast, non-cleavable linkers (such as thioether bonds) remain intact even after internalization, requiring complete degradation of the antibody within lysosomes to release the active drug, typically with an amino acid residue still attached to the payload.\n\nThe choice between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers has profound implications for the ADC's pharmacokinetic profile, systemic toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy. This selection influences the stability of the ADC in circulation, the mechanism of drug release, the potential for bystander effects, and ultimately the therapeutic window of the drug. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

These linkers can be categorized by their release mechanisms:\n\n1. **Hydrazone linkers**: Stable in the alkaline environment of the bloodstream but hydrolyzed in the acidic environment (low pH) of endosomes and lysosomes. However, they may occasionally hydrolyze prematurely in plasma, leading to systemic toxicity. <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> The hydrazone linker in gemtuzumab ozogamicin, for example, exhibits less stability than other cleavable linkers, which may contribute to its narrow therapeutic window. <Paper corpusId=\"211564536\" paperTitle=\"(Shim, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n2. **Disulfide linkers**: These exploit the elevated levels of reductive glutathione in cancer cells to cleave the disulfide bond, releasing the active payload. <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> Recent studies have identified that thioredoxin (TRX) and glutaredoxin (GRX) enzymes catalyze the cleavage of disulfide bonds in ADC linkers. <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"155090407\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n3. **Peptide linkers**: These contain specific amino acid sequences that are substrates for lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B. The valine-citrulline peptide linker found in brentuximab vedotin is cleaved by proteases in the host cells. <Paper corpusId=\"20997961\" paperTitle=\"(Vasigala, 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"12190222\" paperTitle=\"(Doronina et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nAfter cleavage, many linker systems incorporate a self-immolative reaction that completely removes the linker fragment, releasing the free cytotoxic drug. <Paper corpusId=\"211564536\" paperTitle=\"(Shim, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"195879565\" paperTitle=\"(Bargh et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n## Non-Cleavable Linkers\n\nNon-cleavable linkers, such as thioether bonds (MCC) and maleimidocaproyl (MC) linkers, operate through a distinctly different mechanism:\n\n1. **Antibody degradation**: These linkers require complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody portion of the ADC to release the active drug. <Paper corpusId=\"17278582\" paperTitle=\"(Donaghy, 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"20997961\" paperTitle=\"(Vasigala, 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n2. **Drug-linker complex**: Rather than releasing the free drug, non-cleavable linkers produce a metabolite consisting of the cytotoxic payload still attached to the linker and an amino acid residue (typically lysine or cysteine) from the antibody. <Paper corpusId=\"17278582\" paperTitle=\"(Donaghy, 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"10886659\" paperTitle=\"(Erickson et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n3. **Intracellular retention**: The charged amino acid residue attached to the drug-linker complex typically prevents diffusion through cell membranes, confining the cytotoxic effect to target cells that have internalized the ADC. <Paper corpusId=\"22673423\" paperTitle=\"(Govindan et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n## Comparative Mechanisms and Implications\n\nThe different release mechanisms of cleavable versus non-cleavable linkers have important consequences for ADC performance:\n\n1. **Bystander effect**: Cleavable linkers often produce freely diffusible drug molecules that can penetrate nearby cells, creating a \"bystander effect\" that can kill neighboring antigen-negative tumor cells. <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"26250545\" paperTitle=\"(Kovtun et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper> This effect is beneficial in tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression.\n\n2. **Target specificity**: Non-cleavable linkers tend to confine the cytotoxic effect to cells that have internalized the ADC, resulting in greater specificity but potentially reduced efficacy in heterogeneous tumors. <Paper corpusId=\"22673423\" paperTitle=\"(Govindan et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"3203680\" paperTitle=\"(Polson et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n3. **Systemic exposure**: Due to their mechanisms, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers generally demonstrate higher plasma stability, resulting in reduced systemic exposure to free cytotoxic drugs and potentially lower off-target toxicity. <Paper corpusId=\"251541751\" paperTitle=\"(Marei et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"266003384\" paperTitle=\"(Aggarwal et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\n4. **Processing requirements**: Both linker types require different intracellular processing conditions to be effective. Non-cleavable linkers rely heavily on efficient lysosomal processing, while cleavable linkers can activate in various cellular compartments depending on their specific trigger mechanism. <Paper corpusId=\"405679\" paperTitle=\"(Dorywalska et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe selection between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers thus represents a critical design decision that must balance considerations of plasma stability, drug release kinetics, bystander effects, and target cell specificity based on the specific tumor characteristics and therapeutic goals. <Paper corpusId=\"260262995\" paperTitle=\"(Hurwitz et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"207609992\" paperTitle=\"(Phillips et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper>",

                            "The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity (Nolting, 2013). Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level (Zhang et al., 2019)",
                            "ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Kovtun et al., 2006), and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]."

Non-cleavable linkers, e.g., the one in trastuzumab emtansine (Figure 3a), remain attached to the cytotoxic drug after proteolytic degradation of the antibody in the lysosome. The drug, with an attached linker and an amino acid or short proteolytic peptide to which the linker is conjugated, is released to the cytosol and exerts its cytotoxic activity (Erickson et al., 2006)[130]. Cleavable linkers, on the other hand, are cleaved by lysosomal enzymes, or by low pH or a reducing environment inside endosomes; the drug-attached fragment after cleavage is typically removed by self-immolative reaction, releasing the free cytotoxic payload (Bargh et al., 2019)",

However, detailed enzymatic catalytic mechanism relating cleavage of disulfide bonds in xenobiotics is not well understood. This study reports an enzymatic mechanism of cleavage of disulfide bonds in xenobiotic small molecules and antibody conjugate (ADC) linkers. The chemically stable disulfide bonds in substituted disulfide-containing pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD, pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine) monomer prodrugs in presence of glutathione or cysteine were found to be unstable in incubations in whole blood of humans and rats. It was shown the enzymes involved were thioredoxin (TRX) and glutaredoxin (GRX). For a diverse set of drug-linker conjugates, we determined that TRX in the presence of TRX-reductase and NADPH generated the cleaved products that are consistent with catalytic disulfide cleavage and linker immolation. GRX was less rigorously studied; in the set of compounds studied, its role in the catalytic cleavage was also confirmed. Collectively, these in vitro experiments demonstrate that TRX as well as GRX can catalyze the cleavage of disulfide bonds in both small molecules and linkers of ADCs."

Cleavable linkers release the drug from MAb by hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage where as non-cleavable linkers release drug by MAb degradation after internalization. Cleavable linkers are sub characterized into peptide (amide) linkers, hydrazone linkers, and disulphide linkers. Peptide linkers are usually accommodated with protease cleavage sites and are sensitive to proteases in the host cells. A valine-citrullinepeptide linker with protease cathepsin D cleavage site is one successful example used in clinically approved brentuximab vedotin ADC for treatment of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (Senter et al., 2012)",

                            "Auristatins are highly potent antimitotic agents that have received considerable attention because of their activities when targeted to tumor cells in the form of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Our lead agent, SGN-35, consists of the cAC10 antibody linked to the N-terminal amino acid of monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) via a valine-citrulline p-aminobenzylcarbamate (val-cit-PABC) linker that is cleaved by intracellular proteases such as cathepsin B. More recently, we developed an auristatin F (AF) derivative monomethylauristatin F (MMAF), which unlike MMAE contains the amino acid phenylalanine at the C-terminal position. Because of the negatively charged C-terminal residue, the potency of AF and MMAF is impaired. However, their ability to kill target cells is greatly enhanced through facilitated cellular uptake by internalizing mAbs. Here, we explore the effects of linker technology on AF-based ADC potency, activity, and tolerability by generating a diverse set of dipeptide linkers between the C-terminal residue and the mAb carrier. The resulting ADCs differed widely in activity, with some having significantly improved therapeutic indices compared to the original mAb-Val-Cit-PABC-MMAF conjugate. The therapeutic index was increased yet further by generating dipeptide-based ADCs utilizing new auristatins with methionine or tryptophan as the C-terminal drug residue. These results demonstrate that manipulation of the C-terminal peptide sequence used to attach auristatins to the mAb carrier can lead to highly potent and specific conjugates with greatly improved therapeutic windows."

The properties of the linker between the antibody and the payload are proven to be critical to the success of an ADC. Although ADC linkers can be 'non-cleavable', the vast majority of ADCs in clinical development have specific release mechanisms to allow controlled linker cleavage at the target site and are thus termed 'cleavable'. In recent years, the development of new methods of drug release from ADCs has continued in parallel to the deepening understanding of the biological processes underlying the mechanisms of action of pre-existing technologies.

Increasing the steric hindrance of a linker (e.g., SPDB-DM4 linker payload construct) can enhance the stability of the ADC in circulation, with the aim of reducing non-specific toxicities. Cleavable linkers are mostly cleaved from the payload in endosomes or lysosomal compartments via a variety of mechanisms including acidic degradation (hydrazones); protease cleavage by cathepsin B (dipeptide); thiol-disulfide exchange reactions (disulfide, carbonate). Conversely, non-cleavable linkers (MC and SMCC) require complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody, generating a toxic payload with charged lysines or cysteines (Table 1)."

Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates."

                            "Conjugates with a noncleavable linker may have an advantage of less toxicity vs. the conjugates with a cleavable linker, since these have to be specifically internalized for detachment from the carrier antibody, while the amino acid-appended metabolite of the drug, generated after intracellular metabolism, would be unable to diffuse through cell membranes. The greater efficacy and tolerability of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 with a stable linker vs. maytansinoid conjugates with cleavable disulfide linkers was noted in a previous section (Phillips et al., 2008). Polson et al. compared the conjugates of both maytansinoids as well as an auristatin group of tubulin polymerization-inhibiting drugs, using cleavable and noncleavable linkers in NHL models (Polson et al., 2009). Conjugates of maytansinoids with a stable linker (MAb-MCC-DM1) or a cleavable disulfide bond (MAb-SPP-DM1) were evaluated. Likewise, in the auristatin group, MMAE conjugates contained a cleavable linker, while MMAF conjugates contained a stable linker. It was found that anti-CD22 conjugates of these drugs with noncleavable linkers were less toxic in rats than those with cleavable linkers with both groups of drugs, when administered at single i.v. dose of 20 mg protein dose per kilogram. The study also found that ADCs with cleavable linkers were effective in a broad range of targets, while those with noncleavable linkers were more selective in the tumor targets that could be treated. Thus, which type of linker to use is a function of the specific tumor target, the tolerability of drug to substitution, and the therapeutic window achievable."

                            "Conjugates of the anti-CanAg humanized monoclonal antibody huC242 with the microtubule-formation inhibitor DM1 (a maytansinoid), or with the DNA alkylator DC1 (a CC1065 analogue), have been evaluated for their ability to eradicate mixed cell populations formed from CanAg-positive and CanAg-negative cells in culture and in xenograft tumors in mice. We found that in culture, conjugates of either drug killed not only the target antigen-positive cells but also the neighboring antigen-negative cells. Furthermore, we showed that, in vivo, these conjugates were effective in eradicating tumors containing both antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells. The presence of antigen-positive cells was required for this killing of bystander cells. This target cell-activated killing of bystander cells was dependent on the nature of the linker between the antibody and the drug. Conjugates linked via a reducible disulfide bond were capable of exerting the bystander effect whereas equally potent conjugates linked via a nonreducible thioether bond were not. Our data offer a rationale for developing optimally constructed antibody-drug conjugates for treating tumors that express the target antigen either in a homogeneous or heterogeneous manner."

In target-independent safety studies in rats, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity, presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation. Thus, our data suggest that ADCs with cleavable linkers work on a broad range of targets, and for specific targets, ADCs with uncleavable linkers provide a promising opportunity to improve the therapeutic window for ADCs in humans",

The correlation of drug loss from the antibody to hepatic and hematologic toxicities with the cleavable linker ADCs suggests that the reason that the uncleavable linkers are better tolerated than their cleavable counterparts is their decreased systemic release of free drug."

                            "Cleavable and non-cleavable linkers are the two types of linkers. Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Fig. 1 The development, purification, and production of antibody-drug conjugates cathepsins). pH-sensitive hydrazone (found in brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, trastuzumab deruxtecan, and sacituzumab govitecan) is another enzyme-cleavable peptide-based linker (T-DXd) (Jain et al., 2015)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016).\n\nNon-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability (Lu et al., 2016)."

The greatest advantage of non-cleavable linkers compared to cleavable linkers is their increased plasma stability. Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug (Monteiro et al., 2015). Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells (Doronina et al., 2006)(Erickson et al., 2006). In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability."

Thus, the resultant release of the cytotoxic drugs is linked to the antibody's linker and an amino acid residue, which specifically kills tumor cells and doesn't release at non-target locations to cause any damage to healthy cells. Additionally, the non-cleavable linkers have provision to modify the chemical characteristics of small molecules to enhance the affinity of the transporter and increase its effectiveness. Although they have lesser membrane permeability, these linkers are more stable than cleavable ones and increase the therapeutic window by minimizing the off-target toxicities."

Numerous examples of both linker types (cleavable and non-cleavable) are currently utilized in the clinic (Rostami et al., 2014)(Jackson et al., 2014)(Mccombs et al., 2015). Regardless of its type, the ideal linker remains intact in systemic circulation, and releases the cytotoxic agent only after internalization in the target cell (Mccombs et al., 2015)(Sanderson et al., 2005), either by the built-in trigger (cleavable linkers) or by degradation of the antibody (non-cleavable linkers)."

                            "HER2 is a validated target in breast cancer therapy. Two drugs are currently approved for HER2-positive breast cancer: trastuzumab (Herceptin), introduced in 1998, and lapatinib (Tykerb), in 2007. Despite these advances, some patients progress through therapy and succumb to their disease. A variation on antibody-targeted therapy is utilization of antibodies to deliver cytotoxic agents specifically to antigen-expressing tumors. We determined in vitro and in vivo efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of trastuzumab-maytansinoid (microtubule-depolymerizing agents) conjugates using disulfide and thioether linkers. Antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab-maytansinoid conjugates were evaluated on cultured normal and tumor cells. In vivo activity was determined in mouse breast cancer models, and toxicity was assessed in rats as measured by body weight loss. Surprisingly, trastuzumab linked to DM1 through a nonreducible thioether linkage (SMCC), displayed superior activity compared with unconjugated trastuzumab or trastuzumab linked to other maytansinoids through disulfide linkers. Serum concentrations of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 remained elevated compared with other conjugates, and toxicity in rats was negligible compared with free DM1 or trastuzumab linked to DM1 through a reducible linker. Potent activity was observed on all HER2-overexpressing tumor cells, whereas nontransformed cells and tumor cell lines with normal HER2 expression were unaffected. In addition, trastuzumab-DM1 was active on HER2-overexpressing, trastuzumab-refractory tumors. In summary, trastuzumab-DM1 shows greater activity compared with nonconjugated trastuzumab while maintaining selectivity for HER2-overexpressing tumor cells. Because trastuzumab linked to DM1 through a nonreducible linker offers improved efficacy and pharmacokinetics and reduced toxicity over the reducible disulfide linkers evaluated, trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 was selected for clinical development."

While cleavable linkers may release cytotoxic payloads prematurely in circulation, non-cleavable linkers maintain integrity until complete antibody degradation within target cells, potentially providing a wider therapeutic window.

                "text": "\nThe systemic stability of the linker connecting the antibody to the cytotoxic payload is a critical factor in determining both the safety and efficacy profiles of ADCs after intravenous administration. Linker stability directly influences how much intact ADC reaches tumor cells versus how much payload is prematurely released into circulation, significantly affecting systemic toxicity.\n\n## Linker Stability in Circulation\n\nThe ideal linker should remain stable in the bloodstream while readily releasing the cytotoxic payload once the ADC reaches its target cells. Without sufficient stability, the toxic drug may be released prematurely in circulation, leading to off-target effects and reduced efficacy <Paper corpusId=\"13406561\" paperTitle=\"(Wan, 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. Non-cleavable linkers generally demonstrate superior plasma stability compared to their cleavable counterparts <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"267191025\" paperTitle=\"(Metrangolo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This enhanced stability results from their chemical structure, which resists both chemical and enzymatic degradation in the bloodstream <Paper corpusId=\"267826318\" paperTitle=\"(Sbihi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"278236118\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"18457500\" paperTitle=\"(Oflazoglu et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCleavable linkers, conversely, are more susceptible to premature degradation in circulation. Hydrazone linkers, for instance, may occasionally hydrolyze in plasma, releasing the cytotoxic payload before reaching target cells <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This premature release was partially responsible for the voluntary withdrawal of Mylotarg\u00ae from the US market in 2000 due to severe liver toxicity observed in patients <Paper corpusId=\"267191025\" paperTitle=\"(Metrangolo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"25417300\" paperTitle=\"(Sievers et al., 2001)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15185104\" paperTitle=\"(Petersdorf et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Comparative Toxicity Profiles\n\nMultiple studies have demonstrated that ADCs with non-cleavable linkers generally exhibit reduced systemic toxicity compared to those with cleavable linkers. In a comprehensive study by Polson et al., ADCs constructed with non-cleavable linkers (SMCC) showed significantly less weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities in animal models compared to those with cleavable linkers (SPP) at equivalent doses <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"3203680\" paperTitle=\"(Polson et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThis difference in toxicity profiles can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Drug release mechanisms**: Cleavable linkers may release free cytotoxic drugs or toxic metabolites into circulation, while non-cleavable linkers require complete antibody degradation within lysosomes <Paper corpusId=\"13406561\" paperTitle=\"(Wan, 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Metabolite characteristics**: The cytotoxic metabolites released from ADCs with non-cleavable linkers typically retain amino acid residues from the antibody, which can reduce their membrane permeability and confine their activity to target cells <Paper corpusId=\"251660861\" paperTitle=\"(Han et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"17277508\" paperTitle=\"(Diamantis et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Linker processing requirements**: Non-cleavable linkers depend on the complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody after internalization, a process that primarily occurs in target cells <Paper corpusId=\"235240827\" paperTitle=\"(Mahmood, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"22057001\" paperTitle=\"(Tsuchikama et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Impact on Therapeutic Window\n\nThe enhanced plasma stability and reduced systemic toxicity of non-cleavable linkers potentially translate to an improved therapeutic window for ADCs <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"21541286\" paperTitle=\"(Doronina et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>. This advantage has been observed in multiple studies where ADCs with non-cleavable linkers were tolerated at significantly higher doses than their cleavable counterparts while maintaining similar efficacy <Paper corpusId=\"21541286\" paperTitle=\"(Doronina et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHowever, this improved safety profile comes with potential trade-offs. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may demonstrate:\n\n1. **Limited efficacy against certain targets**: In the study by Polson et al., ADCs with non-cleavable linkers showed efficacy against only two of seven tested targets, while those with cleavable linkers were active against all targets <Paper corpusId=\"3203680\" paperTitle=\"(Polson et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Reduced bystander effects**: The charged amino acid residues that remain attached to payloads from non-cleavable linkers typically prevent diffusion through cell membranes, limiting their ability to kill neighboring antigen-negative tumor cells <Paper corpusId=\"267191025\" paperTitle=\"(Metrangolo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"276588757\" paperTitle=\"(Yamanaka et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Greater dependence on target cell biology**: Since non-cleavable linkers require complete antibody degradation within lysosomes, they are more dependent on efficient internalization and lysosomal processing by target cells <Paper corpusId=\"235240827\" paperTitle=\"(Mahmood, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4678281\" paperTitle=\"(Mehrling et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Regulatory Considerations\n\nThe influence of linker type on toxicity profiles has not gone unnoticed by regulatory authorities. An analysis of Phase I study data conducted by the FDA revealed that ADCs utilizing the same linker but targeting distinct antigens exhibited similar toxicity profiles, highlighting the critical importance of linker selection in ADC development <Paper corpusId=\"4678281\" paperTitle=\"(Mehrling et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"392811\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe choice between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers therefore represents a crucial design decision that must balance considerations of plasma stability, systemic toxicity, and efficacy based on tumor characteristics and therapeutic goals. While non-cleavable linkers may offer safety advantages through reduced systemic exposure to free cytotoxic drugs, the optimal linker selection ultimately depends on the specific tumor target, desired efficacy profile, and acceptable toxicity threshold for each ADC application.",

Linkers stable in circulation but readily processed in the target cell are necessary for both safety and potency of the delivered conjugate [48]. In general, linker should be stable enough in systemic circulation to deliver drug into tumor cells, but labile to release this fully active payload drug inside the tumor cells. Otherwise, the toxic drug could be released in the bloodstream, causing systemic toxicity. Polson et al. demonstrated that non-cleavable linker (e.g.  is more stable than cleavable linker (e.g. T-DM1) [49]. The non-cleavable linker may have slower deconjugation or lower clearance than cleavable linker and reduced systemic toxicity of ADC in rats presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation [49]. This is because the cleavable linkers may release drug by lysosomal proteases without the degradation of the mAb component whereas non-cleavable linkers require catabolism of the mAb backbones to release the drug [9 and ref. therein]."

The greatest advantage of non-cleavable linkers compared to cleavable linkers is their increased plasma stability. Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug (Monteiro et al., 2015). Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells (Doronina et al., 2006)(Erickson et al., 2006). In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability."

Generally, most ADC drugs incorporate two types of covalent linkers, cleavable and non-cleavable, which differ in their intracellular processing and systemic stability. While both have been shown to be safe in preclinical and clinical settings, cleavable linkers currently dominate the ADC landscape. For a comprehensive overview of the topic, the readers are advised to refer to (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021)",

                            "Linkers are the most important and intricate part in the development of a successful ADC, since they form the link between the therapy and antibody. Their conjugation mechanism, stability, and chemistry are crucial in preventing unintended drug release into the bloodstream and in facilitating easy cleavage upon internalization into the cancer cell, allowing the payload to be released exclusively at the intended site. They are essential in figuring out the ADCs' pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and therapeutic window. The currently FDA-approved ADCs use two classes of linkers, which differ in the payload release mechanism: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers [24,(Lyon et al., 2015)(Lu et al., 2016). \n\nThe four most used cleavable linkers are \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers, Glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide linkers, cathepsin B-sensitive linkers, and hydrazone linkers. The previously described bystander effect, which impacts normal cells in the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells with no or low target expression, is more likely to occur with ADCs that utilize cleavable linkers [58](Pillow et al., 2016). Non-cleavable linkers, as opposed to cleavable linkers, have better plasma stability, less off-target toxicity, and resistance to proteolytic degradation, as they have non-reducible bonds with the amino acid residues of the antibody."

These linkers enhance plasma stability, rendering them less susceptible to the chemical or enzymatic environment in vivo following the internalization of ADCs by target cells (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Su et al., 2021)",

These linkers also tend to inhibit bystander effects, because the released catabolites have poor cellular permeability. Consequently, identifying alternatives to improve drug release and enhance therapeutic outcomes has become a major focus of ongoing research."

                            "Purpose: The antitubulin agent monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) induces potent antitumor effects when conjugated via protease cleavable linkers to antibodies targeting internalizing, tumor-specific cell surface antigens. Humanized 1F6 (h1F6) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD70, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family that is expressed on hematologic malignancies and carcinomas. Here, we tested h1F6\u2013maleimidocaproyl (mc) MMAF conjugates, consisting of an uncleavable mc linker, for their ability to interfere with the growth of CD70-positive carcinomas. Experimental Design: To evaluate the optimal drug per antibody ratio, we conjugated either four or eight MMAF molecules to the cysteines that comprise the interchain disulfides of h1F6 and determined antitumor activities in vitro and in xenografted mice. The tumor types tested included glioblastoma, patient-derived renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell isolates, and standard RCC tumor cell lines. Results: All h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates potently interfered with the growth of all carcinomas in vitro and resulted in complete responses of RCC tumors implanted orthotopically or s.c. in mice. In vitro, h1F6-mcMMAF(8) was generally more potent than h1F6-mcMMAF(4). However, h1F6-mcMMAF(4) displayed equal or better efficacy than h1F6-mcMMAF(8) when administered to tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions: We showed that h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates inhibited the growth of human carcinomas and that increased drug loading, while improving potency in vitro, did not substantially affect the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. Based on these findings, h1F6-mcMMAF(4), designated SGN-75, has been identified as a potential antibody-drug conjugate for clinical development."

                            "The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity (Nolting, 2013). Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level (Zhang et al., 2019)",
                            "ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Kovtun et al., 2006), and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]."

                            "PURPOSE\nThree open-label, multicenter trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single-agent Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin; CMA-676; Wyeth Laboratories, Philadelphia, PA), an antibody-targeted chemotherapy agent, in patients with CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in untreated first relapse.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThe study population comprised 142 patients with AML in first relapse with no history of an antecedent hematologic disorder and a median age of 61 years. All patients received Mylotarg as a 2-hour intravenous infusion, at a dose of 9 mg/m(2), at 2-week intervals for two doses. Patients were evaluated for remission, survival, and treatment-emergent adverse events.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty percent of patients treated with Mylotarg obtained remission as characterized by 5% or less blasts in the marrow, recovery of neutrophils to at least 1,500/microL, and RBC and platelet transfusion independence. Although patients treated with Mylotarg had relatively high incidences of myelosuppression, grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia (23%), and elevated hepatic transaminase levels (17%), the incidences of grade 3 or 4 mucositis (4%) and infections (28%) were relatively low. There was a low incidence of severe nausea and vomiting (11%) and no treatment-related cardiotoxicity, cerebellar toxicity, or alopecia. Many patients received Mylotarg on an outpatient basis (38% and 41% of patients for the first and second doses, respectively). Among the 142 patients, the median total duration of hospitalization was 24 days; 16% of patients required 7 days of hospitalization or less.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAdministration of the antibody-targeted chemotherapy agent Mylotarg to patients with CD33-positive AML in first relapse induces complete remissions with what appears to be a favorable safety profile."

Patients were randomly assigned to receive daunorubicin (45 mg/m(2) per day on days 1, 2, and 3), cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) per day by continuous infusion on days 1-7), and GO (6 mg/m(2) on day 4; DA+GO) vs standard induction therapy with daunorubicin (60 mg/m(2) per day on days 1, 2, and 3) and cytarabine alone (DA). Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) received 3 courses of high-dose cytarabine. Those remaining in CR after consolidation were randomly assigned to receive either no additional therapy or 3 doses of GO (5 mg/m(2) every 28 days). From August 2004 until August 2009, 637 patients were registered for induction. The CR rate was 69% for DA+GO and 70% for DA (P = .59). Among those who achieved a CR, the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 43% in the DA+GO group and 42% in the DA group (P = .40). The 5-year overall survival rate was 46% in the DA+GO group and 50% in the DA group (P = .85). One hundred seventy-four patients in CR after consolidation underwent the postconsolidation randomization. Disease-free survival was not improved with postconsolidation GO (HR, 1.48; P = .97). In this study, the addition of GO to induction or postconsolidation therapy failed to show improvement in CR rate, disease-free survival, or overall survival."

                            "There are two main classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers contain chemical or enzymatic liable chemistries formulated to exploit specific conditions unique to the intracellular or tumor extracellular environments, with the goal of maintaining good stability in the systemic circulation and rapid cleavage at the target site (Lu et al., 2016)(Bargh et al., 2019). In practice, cleavable linkers are often hydrolyzed in plasma at an appreciable rate, leading to the premature release of the payload in the extra-tumoral compartments. Lipophilic payloads exhibit high permeability through plasma membranes and, consequently, the released payload enters non-targeted cells efficiently (e.g., via membrane diffusion), potentially leading to unwanted cytotoxicity",
                            "Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues. For instance, in a study by Polson et al., several ADCs were constructed by conjugating antibodies against a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigens to a DM1 payload via either a cleavable (SPP) or a non-cleavable (SMCC) linker and were tested for in vivo toxicity and efficacy (Polson et al., 2009). The SMCC-ADCs showed efficacy against only two of the seven target antigens, while the SPP-ADCs were active against all targets. However, at the dose of 20 mg ADC/kg, the animals treated with an ADC bearing the cleavable linker SPP exhibited much more significant weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities when compared with the results observed following dosing with ADC employing the non-cleavable linker SMCC."

In target-independent safety studies in rats, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity, presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation. Thus, our data suggest that ADCs with cleavable linkers work on a broad range of targets, and for specific targets, ADCs with uncleavable linkers provide a promising opportunity to improve the therapeutic window for ADCs in humans",
                            ".the cleavable linker ADCs release more free cytotoxic drug (or metabolites thereof) into the circulation. The correlation of drug loss from the antibody to hepatic and hematologic toxicities with the cleavable linker ADCs suggests that the reason that the uncleavable linkers are better tolerated than their cleavable counterparts is their decreased systemic release of free drug."

New linker technology associated with novel highly potent cytotoxic payloads has permitted the development of more effective and safe ADCs. In recent years, two ADCs have been licensed, T-DM1 and brentuximab vedotin, and are already establishing their place in cancer treatment. A plethora of ADCs are being investigated in phases I and II trials, emerging data of which appears promising. As we deepen our understanding of what makes a successful ADC, an increasing number of ADCs will likely become viable treatment options as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy. This review will present the philosophy underlying ADCs, their main characteristics and current research developments with a focus on ADCs in solid tumours."

Non-cleavable linkers are a new generation of linkers with improved plasma stability compared to cleavable linkers. The ADCs prepared by non-cleavable linkers rely on the complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody after internalization to release the cytotoxic small molecule drug. The ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are dependent on the biology of the target cell compared to cleavable linkers and have an improved therapeutic index due to their greater plasma stability. Since non-cleavable linkers can provide greater stability and tolerance than cleavable linkers, in the circulation, these linkers reduce off-target toxicity and also provide a larger therapeutic window (Tsuchikama et al., 2017)(Walles et al., 2018)(Thorpe et al., 1987)."

This new antibody-based molecular platform enables selective delivery of a potent cytotoxic payload to target cancer cells, resulting in improved efficacy, reduced systemic toxicity, and preferable pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) and biodistribution compared to traditional chemotherapy. Boosted by the successes of FDA-approved Adcetris\u00ae and Kadcyla\u00ae, this drug class has been rapidly growing along with about 60 ADCs currently in clinical trials. In this article, we briefly review molecular aspects of each component (the antibody, payload, and linker) of ADCs, and then mainly discuss traditional and new technologies of the conjugation and linker chemistries for successful construction of clinically effective ADCs. Current efforts in the conjugation and linker chemistries will provide greater insights into molecular design and strategies for clinically effective ADCs from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints. The development of site-specific conjugation methodologies for constructing homogeneous ADCs is an especially promising path to improving ADC design, which will open the way for novel cancer therapeutics."

                            "We have previously shown that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) consisting of cAC10 (anti-CD30) linked to the antimitotic agent monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) lead to potent in vitro and in vivo activities against antigen positive tumor models. MMAF is a new antimitotic auristatin derivative with a charged C-terminal phenylalanine residue that attenuates its cytotoxic activity compared to its uncharged counterpart, MMAE, most likely due to impaired intracellular access. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated that mAb-maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl-MMAF (mAb-L1-MMAF) conjugates were >2200-fold more potent than free MMAF on a large panel of CD30 positive hematologic cell lines. As with cAC10-L1-MMAE, the corresponding MMAF ADC induced cures and regressions of established xenograft tumors at well tolerated doses. To further optimize the ADC, several new linkers were generated in which various components within the L1 linker were either altered or deleted. One of the most promising linkers contained a noncleavable maleimidocaproyl (L4) spacer between the drug and the mAb. cAC10-L4-MMAF was approximately as potent in vitro as cAC10-L1-MMAF against a large panel of cell lines and was equally potent in vivo. Importantly, cAC10-L4-MMAF was tolerated at >3 times the MTD of cAC10-L1-MMAF. LCMS studies indicated that drug released from cAC10-L4-MMAF was the cysteine-L4-MMAF adduct, which likely arises from mAb degradation within the lysosomes of target cells. This new linker technology appears to be ideally suited for drugs that are both relatively cell-impermeable and tolerant of substitution with amino acids. Thus, alterations of the linker have pronounced impacts on toxicity and lead to new ADCs with greatly improved therapeutic indices."

                            "Linkers bind the antibody to the cytotoxic payload. Ideal linkers should maintain the ADC's stability in plasma while ensuring payload release, specifically at the tumor site. This targeted release is essential for effectively delivering the cytotoxic payload to cancer cells, as premature release can result in systemic off-target toxicity (Sheyi et al., 2022). Linkers can be classified into two types: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release their payloads in response to specific conditions, such as the pH of cancer cells, reducing agents, and enzymes. Cleavable linkers may increase the efficiency of payload release, causing a bystander effect, but they also have a higher risk of increasing toxicity in normal tissues. On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma, so they only release the drug after the antibody has been completely degraded in the lysosome. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are not expected to induce a bystander effect. Currently, most ADCs use cleavable linkers."

                            "The stability of the linker can exert a considerable influence on the toxicities that might be associated with the active component of the ADC [11]. The most stable linkers will only release the chemotherapeutic component of the ADC in a target-specific manner; however, less stable linkers are prone to non-specific cleavage, resulting in a broader toxicity profile [11]. In addition, linkers can be classified as cleavable or non-cleavable, with cleavable linkers being those that are cleaved from the active component of the ADC by any of a variety of mechanisms including acidic degradation (hydrazones), protease cleavage by cathepsin B (dipeptide), and thiol-disulphide exchange reactions (disulphide), most of which occur in the endosomes of lysosomal compartments (Mccombs et al., 2015). In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as maleimidocaproyl and thioether linkers, require complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the targeting antibody to occur, leaving the active component attached to the linker and a charged lysine or cysteine residue (Mccombs et al., 2015). Importantly, an analysis of Phase I study data for several ADCs in development that was conducted by the FDA noted that ADCs utilising the same linker, but distinct target antigens, exhibited similar toxicity profiles, highlighting the importance of linker selection in agent development (Drake et al., 2015)(Kim et al., 2015)."

Critical parameters that govern successful antibody-drug conjugate development for clinical use include the selection of the tumor target antigen, the antibody against the target, the cytotoxic molecule, the linker bridging the cytotoxic molecule and the antibody, and the conjugation chemistry used for the attachment of the cytotoxic molecule to the antibody. Advancements in these core antibody-drug conjugate technology are reflected by recent approval of Adectris\u00ae (anti-CD30-drug conjugate) and Kadcyla\u00ae (anti-HER2 drug conjugate). The potential approval of an anti-CD22 conjugate and promising new clinical data for anti-CD19 and anti-CD33 conjugates are additional advancements. Enrichment of antibody-drug conjugates with newly developed potent cytotoxic molecules and linkers are also in the pipeline for various tumor targets. However, the complexity of antibody-drug conjugate components, conjugation methods, and off-target toxicities still pose challenges for the strategic design of antibody-drug conjugates to achieve their fullest therapeutic potential. This review will discuss the emergence of clinical antibody-drug conjugates, current trends in optimization strategies, and recent study results for antibody-drug conjugates that have incorporated the latest optimization strategies. Future challenges and perspectives toward making antibody-drug conjugates more amendable for broader disease indications are also discussed."

                "tldr": "While ADCs with cleavable linkers demonstrate broader efficacy across various tumor targets, non-cleavable linkers show superior efficacy for specific antigens like CD22 and CD79b. The optimal linker choice depends on cellular internalization mechanisms, target biology, and whether bystander effects are beneficial for the specific tumor type. (15 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe efficacy of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is directly influenced by the choice of linker chemistry, with cleavable and non-cleavable linkers offering distinct advantages and limitations for drug delivery to tumor cells.\n\n## Linker-Dependent Efficacy Across Targets\n\nIn a comprehensive study by Polson et al., ADCs with cleavable linkers demonstrated efficacy against a wide range of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma targets (CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD72, CD79b, and CD180), while ADCs with non-cleavable linkers showed efficacy against only two specific targets: CD22 and CD79b <Paper corpusId=\"3203680\" paperTitle=\"(Polson et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that the choice of linker technology should be tailored to the specific target antigen being pursued.\n\nThe more selective efficacy profile of non-cleavable linkers appears to be related to their mechanism of action, which requires:\n\n1. **Efficient internalization**: Non-cleavable linkers depend on cellular internalization of the ADC-antigen complex through endocytosis <Paper corpusId=\"249748294\" paperTitle=\"(Lam et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Complete antibody degradation**: For ADCs with non-cleavable linkers to be effective, they must undergo complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation to release the active payload <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"21359935\" paperTitle=\"(Monteiro et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Target-specific processing**: The lysine-drug-linker metabolites produced after degradation of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers remain charged and generally cannot diffuse through cell membranes, limiting their activity to cells that have internalized the ADC <Paper corpusId=\"22673423\" paperTitle=\"(Govindan et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Case Studies in Comparative Efficacy\n\nDespite their more selective target profile, non-cleavable linkers have demonstrated superior efficacy in several comparative studies:\n\n1. **Trastuzumab-DM1**: The development of trastuzumab linked to DM1 through a non-cleavable thioether linkage (SMCC) showed superior activity compared to unconjugated trastuzumab or trastuzumab linked to maytansinoids through disulfide linkers <Paper corpusId=\"207609992\" paperTitle=\"(Phillips et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper>. This observation contributed to the selection of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (T-DM1) for clinical development.\n\n2. **Auristatin derivatives**: Doronina et al. demonstrated that anti-CD30 ADCs with non-cleavable maleimidocaproyl (L4) linkers connecting to the cytotoxic payload MMAF were approximately as potent in vitro as their cleavable counterparts but were tolerated at more than three times the maximum tolerated dose <Paper corpusId=\"21541286\" paperTitle=\"(Doronina et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Mechanisms Underlying Efficacy Differences\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the efficacy differences between ADCs with cleavable versus non-cleavable linkers:\n\n1. **Release kinetics**: ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate faster rates of cytotoxic drug activation and release for most cell lines <Paper corpusId=\"4592961\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This more rapid drug release may contribute to their broader efficacy profile across different target antigens.\n\n2. **Intracellular processing requirements**: Non-cleavable linkers have more stringent requirements for intracellular processing, including efficient internalization and lysosomal degradation <Paper corpusId=\"266003383\" paperTitle=\"(Wittwer et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This dependency on specific cellular mechanisms may explain their efficacy against only certain antigens.\n\n3. **Plasma stability**: The greater plasma stability of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers allows more intact ADC molecules to reach tumor cells, potentially enhancing their efficacy for appropriate targets <Paper corpusId=\"235229014\" paperTitle=\"(Baah et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Bystander Effect and Efficacy in Heterogeneous Tumors\n\nA critical distinction between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers is their ability to generate bystander effects, which can significantly impact efficacy in heterogeneous tumors:\n\n1. **Cleavable linkers**: The free drugs released from ADCs with cleavable linkers can often diffuse through cell membranes to kill neighboring antigen-negative tumor cells, creating a beneficial bystander effect in heterogeneous tumors <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"266003383\" paperTitle=\"(Wittwer et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"24698174\" paperTitle=\"(Staudacher et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Non-cleavable linkers**: The charged metabolites produced from ADCs with non-cleavable linkers typically cannot diffuse through cell membranes, limiting their activity to cells that have directly internalized the ADC <Paper corpusId=\"22673423\" paperTitle=\"(Govindan et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>. This may reduce their efficacy in tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression.\n\n3. **Target specificity**: The confined activity of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers provides greater target specificity but potentially reduced efficacy in heterogeneous tumors <Paper corpusId=\"26250545\" paperTitle=\"(Kovtun et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Therapeutic Window Considerations\n\nDespite potentially narrower efficacy profiles, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers often provide an improved therapeutic window:\n\n1. **Reduced toxicity**: The decreased systemic release of free cytotoxic drug from ADCs with non-cleavable linkers contributes to their reduced toxicity profile <Paper corpusId=\"3203680\" paperTitle=\"(Polson et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Tolerability at higher doses**: The improved tolerability of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may allow for administration at higher doses, potentially compensating for their more selective efficacy profile <Paper corpusId=\"21541286\" paperTitle=\"(Doronina et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Enhanced therapeutic index**: The combination of targeted efficacy and reduced systemic toxicity may translate to an improved therapeutic index for ADCs with non-cleavable linkers against appropriate targets <Paper corpusId=\"276971806\" paperTitle=\"(Buyukgolcigezli et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"246783968\" paperTitle=\"(Sheyi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe choice between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers for optimal efficacy thus depends on multiple factors, including target antigen characteristics, tumor heterogeneity, internalization efficiency, and the desired balance between efficacy and safety. While cleavable linkers offer broader applicability across targets, non-cleavable linkers may provide superior efficacy and safety profiles for specific well-characterized targets with efficient internalization mechanisms.",

In target-independent safety studies in rats, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity, presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation. Thus, our data suggest that ADCs with cleavable linkers work on a broad range of targets, and for specific targets, ADCs with uncleavable linkers provide a promising opportunity to improve the therapeutic window for ADCs in humans",
                            ".the cleavable linker ADCs release more free cytotoxic drug (or metabolites thereof) into the circulation. The correlation of drug loss from the antibody to hepatic and hematologic toxicities with the cleavable linker ADCs suggests that the reason that the uncleavable linkers are better tolerated than their cleavable counterparts is their decreased systemic release of free drug."

The greatest advantage of non-cleavable linkers compared to cleavable linkers is their increased plasma stability. Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug (Monteiro et al., 2015). Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells (Doronina et al., 2006)(Erickson et al., 2006). In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability."

                            "HER2-targeted therapies have radically changed the prognosis of HER2-positive breast cancer over the last few years. However, resistance to these therapies has been a constant, leading to treatment-failure and new tumor progression. Recently, the kinase-impaired HER3 emerged as a pivotal player in oncogenic signaling, with an important role in both non-treated progression and treatment response. HER2/HER3 dimerization is required for full signaling potential and constitutes the key oncogenic unit. Also, when inhibiting PI3K/AKT pathway (as with anti-HER2 drugs) feedback mechanisms lead to a rebound in HER3 activity, which is one of the main roads to resistance. As current strategies to treat HER2-positive breast cancer are unable to inhibit this feedback response, two great promises emerged: the combination of targeted-therapies and drugs targeting HER3. In this article HER2 and HER3-targeted drugs and possible combinations between them, as well as the biomarkers to predict and monitor these drugs effect, are reviewed."

                            "Conjugates with a noncleavable linker may have an advantage of less toxicity vs. the conjugates with a cleavable linker, since these have to be specifically internalized for detachment from the carrier antibody, while the amino acid-appended metabolite of the drug, generated after intracellular metabolism, would be unable to diffuse through cell membranes. The greater efficacy and tolerability of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 with a stable linker vs. maytansinoid conjugates with cleavable disulfide linkers was noted in a previous section (Phillips et al., 2008). Polson et al. compared the conjugates of both maytansinoids as well as an auristatin group of tubulin polymerization-inhibiting drugs, using cleavable and noncleavable linkers in NHL models (Polson et al., 2009). Conjugates of maytansinoids with a stable linker (MAb-MCC-DM1) or a cleavable disulfide bond (MAb-SPP-DM1) were evaluated. Likewise, in the auristatin group, MMAE conjugates contained a cleavable linker, while MMAF conjugates contained a stable linker. It was found that anti-CD22 conjugates of these drugs with noncleavable linkers were less toxic in rats than those with cleavable linkers with both groups of drugs, when administered at single i.v. dose of 20 mg protein dose per kilogram. The study also found that ADCs with cleavable linkers were effective in a broad range of targets, while those with noncleavable linkers were more selective in the tumor targets that could be treated. Thus, which type of linker to use is a function of the specific tumor target, the tolerability of drug to substitution, and the therapeutic window achievable."

                            "HER2 is a validated target in breast cancer therapy. Two drugs are currently approved for HER2-positive breast cancer: trastuzumab (Herceptin), introduced in 1998, and lapatinib (Tykerb), in 2007. Despite these advances, some patients progress through therapy and succumb to their disease. A variation on antibody-targeted therapy is utilization of antibodies to deliver cytotoxic agents specifically to antigen-expressing tumors. We determined in vitro and in vivo efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of trastuzumab-maytansinoid (microtubule-depolymerizing agents) conjugates using disulfide and thioether linkers. Antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab-maytansinoid conjugates were evaluated on cultured normal and tumor cells. In vivo activity was determined in mouse breast cancer models, and toxicity was assessed in rats as measured by body weight loss. Surprisingly, trastuzumab linked to DM1 through a nonreducible thioether linkage (SMCC), displayed superior activity compared with unconjugated trastuzumab or trastuzumab linked to other maytansinoids through disulfide linkers. Serum concentrations of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 remained elevated compared with other conjugates, and toxicity in rats was negligible compared with free DM1 or trastuzumab linked to DM1 through a reducible linker. Potent activity was observed on all HER2-overexpressing tumor cells, whereas nontransformed cells and tumor cell lines with normal HER2 expression were unaffected. In addition, trastuzumab-DM1 was active on HER2-overexpressing, trastuzumab-refractory tumors. In summary, trastuzumab-DM1 shows greater activity compared with nonconjugated trastuzumab while maintaining selectivity for HER2-overexpressing tumor cells. Because trastuzumab linked to DM1 through a nonreducible linker offers improved efficacy and pharmacokinetics and reduced toxicity over the reducible disulfide linkers evaluated, trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 was selected for clinical development."

                            "We have previously shown that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) consisting of cAC10 (anti-CD30) linked to the antimitotic agent monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) lead to potent in vitro and in vivo activities against antigen positive tumor models. MMAF is a new antimitotic auristatin derivative with a charged C-terminal phenylalanine residue that attenuates its cytotoxic activity compared to its uncharged counterpart, MMAE, most likely due to impaired intracellular access. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated that mAb-maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl-MMAF (mAb-L1-MMAF) conjugates were >2200-fold more potent than free MMAF on a large panel of CD30 positive hematologic cell lines. As with cAC10-L1-MMAE, the corresponding MMAF ADC induced cures and regressions of established xenograft tumors at well tolerated doses. To further optimize the ADC, several new linkers were generated in which various components within the L1 linker were either altered or deleted. One of the most promising linkers contained a noncleavable maleimidocaproyl (L4) spacer between the drug and the mAb. cAC10-L4-MMAF was approximately as potent in vitro as cAC10-L1-MMAF against a large panel of cell lines and was equally potent in vivo. Importantly, cAC10-L4-MMAF was tolerated at >3 times the MTD of cAC10-L1-MMAF. LCMS studies indicated that drug released from cAC10-L4-MMAF was the cysteine-L4-MMAF adduct, which likely arises from mAb degradation within the lysosomes of target cells. This new linker technology appears to be ideally suited for drugs that are both relatively cell-impermeable and tolerant of substitution with amino acids. Thus, alterations of the linker have pronounced impacts on toxicity and lead to new ADCs with greatly improved therapeutic indices."

                            "Linkers can be broadly classified as cleavable or non-cleavable, each with their own distinct mechanism of action (Lu et al., 2016). Cleavable linkers, such as hydrazone, disulphide and peptide linkers, allow selective cleavage of the ADC within the tumor cell by exploiting environmental differences between healthy and malignant tissues, such as pH or the presence of specific enzymes (Baah et al., 2021). Once the ADC is internalized by binding to its tumor-associated antigen, the linker can be cleaved to release the cytotoxic drug directly within the cancer cell. Depending on the payload drug chemistry, the drug can be cell-impermeant resulting in killing of only the targeted cell, or cell-permeant which enables killing of the surrounding, antigen-negative cells in a process called bystander killing. Similarly, a cleavable linker can be cleaved within the tumor microenvironment before cell internalization of the ADC, releasing the drug and also producing bystander killing (Staudacher et al., 2017). Although bystander killing is undesirable for healthy cells, the process could allow eradication of antigennegative tumor cells that would otherwise not have been targeted by the ADC (Kovtun et al., 2006)(Golfier et al., 2014) and could also facilitate the maturation and activation of intratumoral immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), which are known to be activated by certain ADC payloads such as maytansines, aurostatins, and pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers (Martin et al., 2014)(M\u00fcller et al., 2014)(Rios-Doria et al., 2017). Non-cleavable linkers such as thioether and maleimidocaproyl (MMC) linkers, are not susceptible to environmental or enzymatic cleavage and instead are only broken down to release the cytotoxic payload after tumor cell internalization and subsequent antibody degradation in the endosomes and lysosomes [14]."

                            "There are two main classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers contain chemical or enzymatic liable chemistries formulated to exploit specific conditions unique to the intracellular or tumor extracellular environments, with the goal of maintaining good stability in the systemic circulation and rapid cleavage at the target site (Lu et al., 2016)(Bargh et al., 2019). In practice, cleavable linkers are often hydrolyzed in plasma at an appreciable rate, leading to the premature release of the payload in the extra-tumoral compartments. Lipophilic payloads exhibit high permeability through plasma membranes and, consequently, the released payload enters non-targeted cells efficiently (e.g., via membrane diffusion), potentially leading to unwanted cytotoxicity",
                            "Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues. For instance, in a study by Polson et al., several ADCs were constructed by conjugating antibodies against a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigens to a DM1 payload via either a cleavable (SPP) or a non-cleavable (SMCC) linker and were tested for in vivo toxicity and efficacy (Polson et al., 2009). The SMCC-ADCs showed efficacy against only two of the seven target antigens, while the SPP-ADCs were active against all targets. However, at the dose of 20 mg ADC/kg, the animals treated with an ADC bearing the cleavable linker SPP exhibited much more significant weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities when compared with the results observed following dosing with ADC employing the non-cleavable linker SMCC."

The chemistry of the linker, which connects the drug to the mAb, determines how and when the drug is released from the mAb. This, as well as the chemistry of the drug, can dictate whether the drug can diffuse into surrounding cells, resulting in \u2018bystander killing\u2019. Initially, any bystander killing mechanism of action of an ADC was understood to involve an essential sequence of steps beginning with surface antigen targeting, internalisation, intracellular linker cleavage, drug release, and diffusion of drug away from the targeted cell. However, recent studies indicate that, depending on the linker and drug combination, this mechanism may not be essential and ADCs can be cleaved extracellularly or via other mechanisms. In this minireview, we will examine the role of bystander killing by ADCs and explore the emerging evidence of how this can occur independently of internalisation."

We found that in culture, conjugates of either drug killed not only the target antigen-positive cells but also the neighboring antigen-negative cells. Furthermore, we showed that, in vivo, these conjugates were effective in eradicating tumors containing both antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells. The presence of antigen-positive cells was required for this killing of bystander cells. This target cell-activated killing of bystander cells was dependent on the nature of the linker between the antibody and the drug. Conjugates linked via a reducible disulfide bond were capable of exerting the bystander effect whereas equally potent conjugates linked via a nonreducible thioether bond were not. Our data offer a rationale for developing optimally constructed antibody-drug conjugates for treating tumors that express the target antigen either in a homogeneous or heterogeneous manner."

                            "As one of the major therapeutic options for cancer treatment, chemotherapy has limited selectivity against cancer cells. Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives."

Non-cleavable linkers produce charged metabolites that remain confined within target cells, providing greater specificity but limiting efficacy against heterogeneous tumors. (10 sources)",

This mechanism is particularly valuable in tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression, where not all cancer cells express the target antigen <Paper corpusId=\"266003383\" paperTitle=\"(Wittwer et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Non-cleavable linkers**: These linkers require complete antibody degradation within lysosomes, resulting in charged metabolites (typically drug-linker complexes with an attached amino acid) that cannot easily cross cell membranes <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Consequently, their cytotoxic effects remain confined to cells that have directly internalized the ADC <Paper corpusId=\"274892504\" paperTitle=\"(Tang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe bystander effect can occur through multiple pathways:\n\n1. **Intracellular release and diffusion**: The conventional understanding involves internalization of the ADC, intracellular linker cleavage, and subsequent diffusion of the released drug to neighboring cells <Paper corpusId=\"24698174\" paperTitle=\"(Staudacher et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Extracellular processing**: Recent evidence suggests that ADCs with certain cleavable linkers can be processed extracellularly, releasing the cytotoxic payload before cell internalization, which also contributes to bystander killing <Paper corpusId=\"24698174\" paperTitle=\"(Staudacher et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Impact on Tumor Heterogeneity\n\nThe bystander effect has significant implications for addressing tumor heterogeneity:\n\n1. **Heterogeneous antigen expression**: Most solid tumors display heterogeneous antigen expression <Paper corpusId=\"267191025\" paperTitle=\"(Metrangolo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Cleavable linkers that enable bystander effects can overcome this limitation by killing antigen-negative tumor cells in proximity to antigen-positive cells <Paper corpusId=\"26250545\" paperTitle=\"(Kovtun et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Tumor penetration barriers**: Physical barriers within tumors can limit ADC penetration. The bystander effect allows cytotoxic payloads to reach tumor regions that might be inaccessible to the intact ADC <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\n3. **Empirical evidence**: In vivo studies have demonstrated that ADCs with cleavable linkers can effectively eradicate mixed populations of antigen-positive and antigen-negative tumor cells, whereas equally potent conjugates with non-cleavable thioether bonds could not <Paper corpusId=\"26250545\" paperTitle=\"(Kovtun et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Target Cell Specificity\n\nNon-cleavable linkers offer superior target cell specificity compared to cleavable linkers:\n\n1. **Confined activity**: The charged amino acid residues that remain attached to payloads from non-cleavable linkers prevent membrane permeability, confining their cytotoxic effects to cells that have internalized the ADC <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"278236118\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Reduced off-target effects**: This confined activity contributes to the reduced systemic toxicity profile of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers <Paper corpusId=\"274892504\" paperTitle=\"(Tang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Homogeneous tumors**: Non-cleavable linkers are particularly suitable for targeting tumors with homogeneous antigen expression, where bystander effects are less critical <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Immunological Considerations\n\nBeyond direct cytotoxic effects, the bystander effect may also influence the immune response to tumors:\n\n1. **Immune cell activation**: Certain ADC payloads released through cleavable linkers can facilitate the maturation and activation of intratumoral immune cells such as dendritic cells <Paper corpusId=\"266003383\" paperTitle=\"(Wittwer et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"825485\" paperTitle=\"(Muller et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Enhanced antitumor immunity**: This immune activation can potentially enhance the overall antitumor response beyond the direct cytotoxic effects of the ADC <Paper corpusId=\"207676170\" paperTitle=\"(Rios-Doria et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Design Considerations\n\nThe choice between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers involves careful consideration of tumor characteristics and therapeutic goals:\n\n1. **Tumor heterogeneity assessment**: For heterogeneous tumors, cleavable linkers with membrane-permeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects <Paper corpusId=\"267191025\" paperTitle=\"(Metrangolo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Payload properties**: The chemical properties of the payload (particularly membrane permeability) significantly influence the potential for bystander effects <Paper corpusId=\"276588757\" paperTitle=\"(Yamanaka et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Balancing specificity and efficacy**: The choice between greater target specificity (non-cleavable linkers) and broader tumor cell killing (cleavable linkers) represents a key design decision in ADC development <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nThe bystander effect and target cell specificity thus represent critical considerations in ADC design, with important implications for efficacy against heterogeneous tumors and therapeutic index optimization. The optimal linker selection ultimately depends on specific tumor characteristics, target antigen distribution, and the desired balance between specific targeting and broader tumor cell killing.",

We found that in culture, conjugates of either drug killed not only the target antigen-positive cells but also the neighboring antigen-negative cells. Furthermore, we showed that, in vivo, these conjugates were effective in eradicating tumors containing both antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells. The presence of antigen-positive cells was required for this killing of bystander cells. This target cell-activated killing of bystander cells was dependent on the nature of the linker between the antibody and the drug. Conjugates linked via a reducible disulfide bond were capable of exerting the bystander effect whereas equally potent conjugates linked via a nonreducible thioether bond were not. Our data offer a rationale for developing optimally constructed antibody-drug conjugates for treating tumors that express the target antigen either in a homogeneous or heterogeneous manner."

                            "Linkers can be broadly classified as cleavable or non-cleavable, each with their own distinct mechanism of action (Lu et al., 2016). Cleavable linkers, such as hydrazone, disulphide and peptide linkers, allow selective cleavage of the ADC within the tumor cell by exploiting environmental differences between healthy and malignant tissues, such as pH or the presence of specific enzymes (Baah et al., 2021). Once the ADC is internalized by binding to its tumor-associated antigen, the linker can be cleaved to release the cytotoxic drug directly within the cancer cell. Depending on the payload drug chemistry, the drug can be cell-impermeant resulting in killing of only the targeted cell, or cell-permeant which enables killing of the surrounding, antigen-negative cells in a process called bystander killing. Similarly, a cleavable linker can be cleaved within the tumor microenvironment before cell internalization of the ADC, releasing the drug and also producing bystander killing (Staudacher et al., 2017). Although bystander killing is undesirable for healthy cells, the process could allow eradication of antigennegative tumor cells that would otherwise not have been targeted by the ADC (Kovtun et al., 2006)(Golfier et al., 2014) and could also facilitate the maturation and activation of intratumoral immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), which are known to be activated by certain ADC payloads such as maytansines, aurostatins, and pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers (Martin et al., 2014)(M\u00fcller et al., 2014)(Rios-Doria et al., 2017). Non-cleavable linkers such as thioether and maleimidocaproyl (MMC) linkers, are not susceptible to environmental or enzymatic cleavage and instead are only broken down to release the cytotoxic payload after tumor cell internalization and subsequent antibody degradation in the endosomes and lysosomes [14]."

                            "The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity (Nolting, 2013). Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level (Zhang et al., 2019)",
                            "ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Kovtun et al., 2006), and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]."

                            "ADC linkers can be divided broadly into two groups: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers such as hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers rely on physiologic factors (i.e., cathepsin, glutathione (GSH), and low pH) within the cell to cleave the linker. Because these conditions can occur independently of antigen internalization, cleavable linkers are often less stable in the blood, resulting in various off-target effects (Polakis, 2016). In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as the thioether or maleimidocaproyl linkers, require internalization by the target cell, so that the antibody, rather than the linker, can be degraded by the lysosome before the drug is released. This latter mechanism does not produce efficient bystander killing and thus results in lower toxicity profiles (Staudacher et al., 2017)."

                            "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) employ the exquisite specificity of tumour-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for the targeted delivery of highly potent cytotoxic drugs to the tumour site. The chemistry of the linker, which connects the drug to the mAb, determines how and when the drug is released from the mAb. This, as well as the chemistry of the drug, can dictate whether the drug can diffuse into surrounding cells, resulting in \u2018bystander killing\u2019. Initially, any bystander killing mechanism of action of an ADC was understood to involve an essential sequence of steps beginning with surface antigen targeting, internalisation, intracellular linker cleavage, drug release, and diffusion of drug away from the targeted cell. However, recent studies indicate that, depending on the linker and drug combination, this mechanism may not be essential and ADCs can be cleaved extracellularly or via other mechanisms. In this minireview, we will examine the role of bystander killing by ADCs and explore the emerging evidence of how this can occur independently of internalisation."

                            "The linker, tethering the cytotoxic payload to the mAb, is another crucial factor influencing ADCs therapeutic index and PK, as it determines plasma stability and release profile of the payload (Fu et al., 2022)(Gogia et al., 2023)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022). Generally, most ADC drugs incorporate two types of covalent linkers, cleavable and non-cleavable, which differ in their intracellular processing and systemic stability. While both have been shown to be safe in preclinical and clinical settings, cleavable linkers currently dominate the ADC landscape. For a comprehensive overview of the topic, the readers are advised to refer to (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021)",
                            "Notably, acid-sensitive linkers are insufficiently stable and can occasionally be hydrolyzed in the plasma, leading to premature drug release and off-target toxicity. This liability is one of the causes leading to the voluntary Mylotarg \u00ae withdrawal by Pfizer from the US market in 2000, following the severe liver toxicity seen in patients (Nguyen et al., 2023)(Sievers et al., 2001)(Petersdorf et al., 2013)",
                            "Due to their resistance to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, these linkers enjoy the advantages of increased plasma stability, longer half-lives, and lower off-target toxicity than the cleavable counterpart, rendering them potentially superior for targeting homogenously expressed Ag (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021). Nonetheless, as most tumors display heterogenous Ag expression, constructs incorporating cleavable linkers with membranepermeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects, unlike the non-cleavable linker type (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021)."

                            "M\u00fcller, Martin, von Bergwelt-Baildon, Zippelius, and colleagues show that the dolastatin family of microtubule inhibitors induced tumor-resident DC maturation and homing to draining lymph nodes to potentiate cellular antitumor immune responses, providing a rationale for combining dolastatin-based treatments with immunotherapy. Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADC) are emerging as powerful treatment strategies with outstanding target-specificity and high therapeutic activity in patients with cancer. Brentuximab vedotin represents a first-in-class ADC directed against CD30+ malignancies. We hypothesized that its sustained clinical responses could be related to the stimulation of an anticancer immune response. In this study, we demonstrate that the dolastatin family of microtubule inhibitors, from which the cytotoxic component of brentuximab vedotin is derived, comprises potent inducers of phenotypic and functional dendritic cell (DC) maturation. In addition to the direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, dolastatins efficiently promoted antigen uptake and migration of tumor-resident DCs to the tumor-draining lymph nodes. Exposure of murine and human DCs to dolastatins significantly increased their capacity to prime T cells. Underlining the requirement of an intact host immune system for the full therapeutic benefit of dolastatins, the antitumor effect was far less pronounced in immunocompromised mice. We observed substantial therapeutic synergies when combining dolastatins with tumor antigen\u2013specific vaccination or blockade of the PD-1\u2013PD-L1 and CTLA-4 coinhibitory pathways. Ultimately, treatment with ADCs using dolastatins induces DC homing and activates cellular antitumor immune responses in patients. Our data reveal a novel mechanism of action for dolastatins and provide a strong rationale for clinical treatment regimens combining dolastatin-based therapies, such as brentuximab vedotin, with immune-based therapies.

                            "Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is the process by which certain cytotoxic drugs induce apoptosis of tumor cells in a manner that stimulates the immune system. In this study, we investigated whether antibody-drug conjugates (ADCS) conjugated with pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer (PBD) or tubulysin payloads induce ICD, modulate the immune microenvironment, and could combine with immuno-oncology drugs to enhance antitumor activity. We show that these payloads on their own induced an immune response that prevented the growth of tumors following subsequent tumor cell challenge. ADCs had greater antitumor activity in immunocompetent versus immunodeficient mice, demonstrating a contribution of the immune system to the antitumor activity of these ADCs. ADCs also induced immunologic memory. In the CT26 model, depletion of CD8+ T cells abrogated the activity of ADCs when used alone or in combination with a PD-L1 antibody, confirming a role for T cells in antitumor activity. Combinations of ADCs with immuno-oncology drugs, including PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies, OX40 ligand, or GITR ligand fusion proteins, produced synergistic antitumor responses. Importantly, synergy was observed in some cases with suboptimal doses of ADCs, potentially providing an approach to achieve potent antitumor responses while minimizing ADC-induced toxicity. Immunophenotyping studies in different tumor models revealed broad immunomodulation of lymphoid and myeloid cells by ADC and ADC/immuno-oncology combinations. These results suggest that it may be possible to develop novel combinatorial therapies with PBD- and tubulysin-based ADC and immuno-oncology drugs that may increase clinical responses.

                            "Linkers bind the antibody to the cytotoxic payload. Ideal linkers should maintain the ADC's stability in plasma while ensuring payload release, specifically at the tumor site. This targeted release is essential for effectively delivering the cytotoxic payload to cancer cells, as premature release can result in systemic off-target toxicity (Sheyi et al., 2022). Linkers can be classified into two types: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release their payloads in response to specific conditions, such as the pH of cancer cells, reducing agents, and enzymes. Cleavable linkers may increase the efficiency of payload release, causing a bystander effect, but they also have a higher risk of increasing toxicity in normal tissues. On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma, so they only release the drug after the antibody has been completely degraded in the lysosome. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are not expected to induce a bystander effect. Currently, most ADCs use cleavable linkers."

This improved therapeutic window allows for higher dosing and potentially better clinical outcomes, though the optimal linker choice remains dependent on specific tumor characteristics and therapeutic goals. (15 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe therapeutic window of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) represents the dosage range between effective treatment and unacceptable toxicity. The choice between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers has significant implications for this critical parameter.\n\n## Enhanced Therapeutic Window with Non-Cleavable Linkers\n\nNon-cleavable linkers consistently demonstrate potential for a wider therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"251541751\" paperTitle=\"(Marei et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"255852470\" paperTitle=\"(Marei et al._1, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This advantage stems primarily from their superior plasma stability, which reduces premature payload release in circulation <Paper corpusId=\"235229014\" paperTitle=\"(Baah et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Multiple studies have shown that ADCs with non-cleavable linkers outperform their cleavable counterparts in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily after complete lysosomal degradation following ADC internalization <Paper corpusId=\"235240827\" paperTitle=\"(Mahmood, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"10886659\" paperTitle=\"(Erickson et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Improved Tolerability and Dosing\n\nThe enhanced plasma stability of non-cleavable linkers translates directly to improved tolerability at higher doses. Doronina et al. demonstrated that an anti-CD30 ADC with a non-cleavable maleimidocaproyl (L4) linker was tolerated at more than three times the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of its cleavable counterpart while maintaining comparable potency <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"21541286\" paperTitle=\"(Doronina et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>. This improved tolerability potentially allows for administration at higher doses, which may compensate for the more selective efficacy profile sometimes observed with non-cleavable linkers <Paper corpusId=\"4592961\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Reduced Off-Target Toxicity\n\nA key factor contributing to the wider therapeutic window of non-cleavable linkers is their reduced off-target toxicity profile <Paper corpusId=\"235229014\" paperTitle=\"(Baah et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"235240827\" paperTitle=\"(Mahmood, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This advantage arises from:\n\n1. **Greater plasma stability**: Non-cleavable linkers resist premature degradation in circulation, reducing systemic exposure to free cytotoxic payloads <Paper corpusId=\"4592961\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Dependency on intracellular processing**: Because non-cleavable linkers require complete antibody degradation within lysosomes, payload release predominantly occurs within target cells <Paper corpusId=\"251541751\" paperTitle=\"(Marei et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Charged metabolites**: The lysine-drug-linker metabolites produced after degradation of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers remain charged and generally cannot diffuse through cell membranes, confining their activity to cells that have internalized the ADC <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"10886659\" paperTitle=\"(Erickson et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Recirculation and Homogeneity Considerations\n\nRecent research has identified additional factors that may influence the therapeutic window of ADCs:\n\n1. **ADC recirculation**: ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may exhibit higher recirculation rates compared to those with cleavable linkers, potentially impacting their distribution and therapeutic window <Paper corpusId=\"276369379\" paperTitle=\"(Ballestin et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Drug-to-antibody ratio homogeneity**: ADCs with homogeneous drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) demonstrate reduced heterogeneity in blood levels, potentially lowering the risk of excess exposure to the payload <Paper corpusId=\"276369379\" paperTitle=\"(Ballestin et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Balancing Stability and Efficacy\n\nWhile non-cleavable linkers generally provide an improved therapeutic window, this advantage must be balanced against potential limitations in efficacy against certain targets <Paper corpusId=\"4592961\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. As discussed in previous sections, ADCs with cleavable linkers often demonstrate broader efficacy across various tumor targets and can generate beneficial bystander effects in heterogeneous tumors.\n\nThe selection between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers thus represents a crucial design decision that must balance stability, efficacy, and safety considerations. Recent advances in linker design have also significantly improved the stability of cleavable linkers, potentially narrowing the gap in therapeutic window advantages <Paper corpusId=\"46938489\" paperTitle=\"(Lucas et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAn ideal linker should limit premature payload release in plasma while facilitating active drug release at the desired target sites <Paper corpusId=\"265173843\" paperTitle=\"(Belluomini et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"53773514\" paperTitle=\"(Abdollahpour-Alitappeh et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. As ADC development continues to evolve, linker selection increasingly requires careful consideration of tumor characteristics, target biology, and the desired balance between specificity and efficacy to optimize the therapeutic window for each specific application <Paper corpusId=\"271530455\" paperTitle=\"(He et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"246783968\" paperTitle=\"(Sheyi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

The greatest advantage of non-cleavable linkers compared to cleavable linkers is their increased plasma stability. Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug (Monteiro et al., 2015). Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells (Doronina et al., 2006)(Erickson et al., 2006). In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability."

                            "Non-cleavable linkers are an important component of ADCs (Tsuchikama et al., 2016)(Tsuchikama et al., 2017)(Walles et al., 2018). Non-cleavable linkers are a new generation of linkers with improved plasma stability compared to cleavable linkers. The ADCs prepared by non-cleavable linkers rely on the complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody after internalization to release the cytotoxic small molecule drug. The ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are dependent on the biology of the target cell compared to cleavable linkers and have an improved therapeutic index due to their greater plasma stability. Since non-cleavable linkers can provide greater stability and tolerance than cleavable linkers, in the circulation, these linkers reduce off-target toxicity and also provide a larger therapeutic window (Tsuchikama et al., 2017)(Walles et al., 2018)(Thorpe et al., 1987)."

                            "Antibody-drug conjugates are targeted anticancer agents consisting of a cytotoxic drug covalently linked to a monoclonal antibody for tumor antigen-specific activity. Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates."

                            "We have previously shown that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) consisting of cAC10 (anti-CD30) linked to the antimitotic agent monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) lead to potent in vitro and in vivo activities against antigen positive tumor models. MMAF is a new antimitotic auristatin derivative with a charged C-terminal phenylalanine residue that attenuates its cytotoxic activity compared to its uncharged counterpart, MMAE, most likely due to impaired intracellular access. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated that mAb-maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl-MMAF (mAb-L1-MMAF) conjugates were >2200-fold more potent than free MMAF on a large panel of CD30 positive hematologic cell lines. As with cAC10-L1-MMAE, the corresponding MMAF ADC induced cures and regressions of established xenograft tumors at well tolerated doses. To further optimize the ADC, several new linkers were generated in which various components within the L1 linker were either altered or deleted. One of the most promising linkers contained a noncleavable maleimidocaproyl (L4) spacer between the drug and the mAb. cAC10-L4-MMAF was approximately as potent in vitro as cAC10-L1-MMAF against a large panel of cell lines and was equally potent in vivo. Importantly, cAC10-L4-MMAF was tolerated at >3 times the MTD of cAC10-L1-MMAF. LCMS studies indicated that drug released from cAC10-L4-MMAF was the cysteine-L4-MMAF adduct, which likely arises from mAb degradation within the lysosomes of target cells. This new linker technology appears to be ideally suited for drugs that are both relatively cell-impermeable and tolerant of substitution with amino acids. Thus, alterations of the linker have pronounced impacts on toxicity and lead to new ADCs with greatly improved therapeutic indices."

                            "There are two main classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers contain chemical or enzymatic liable chemistries formulated to exploit specific conditions unique to the intracellular or tumor extracellular environments, with the goal of maintaining good stability in the systemic circulation and rapid cleavage at the target site (Lu et al., 2016)(Bargh et al., 2019). In practice, cleavable linkers are often hydrolyzed in plasma at an appreciable rate, leading to the premature release of the payload in the extra-tumoral compartments. Lipophilic payloads exhibit high permeability through plasma membranes and, consequently, the released payload enters non-targeted cells efficiently (e.g., via membrane diffusion), potentially leading to unwanted cytotoxicity",
                            "Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues. For instance, in a study by Polson et al., several ADCs were constructed by conjugating antibodies against a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigens to a DM1 payload via either a cleavable (SPP) or a non-cleavable (SMCC) linker and were tested for in vivo toxicity and efficacy (Polson et al., 2009). The SMCC-ADCs showed efficacy against only two of the seven target antigens, while the SPP-ADCs were active against all targets. However, at the dose of 20 mg ADC/kg, the animals treated with an ADC bearing the cleavable linker SPP exhibited much more significant weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities when compared with the results observed following dosing with ADC employing the non-cleavable linker SMCC."

In theory, these linkers are catalyzed in a tumor cells, due to the presence, or increased presence, of their catalyst, to allow for selective release of the cytotoxic agent (Perez et al., 2014)(Mccombs et al., 2015)",
                            "On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation to release the cytotoxic payload after an ADC has been internalized by the cell (Mccombs et al., 2015). In the lysosomal compartment, the process of intracellular proteolytic degradation reduces the ADC to the level of amino acids. For this type of linker to be effective, the cytotoxic agent must maintain its activity, despite still being attached to part of the linker [22]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are considered to have improved therapeutic index because of their greater plasma stability, although new designs of cleavable linkers have significantly improved stability (Casi et al., 2012)."

                            "Targeted delivery of therapeutic molecules into cancer cells is considered as a promising strategy to tackle cancer. Antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs), in which a monoclonal antibody (mAb) is conjugated to biologically active drugs through chemical linkers, have emerged as a promising class of anticancer treatment agents, being one of the fastest growing fields in cancer therapy. The failure of early ADCs led researchers to explore strategies to develop more effective and improved ADCs with lower levels of unconjugated mAbs and more\u2010stable linkers between the drug and the antibody, which show improved pharmacokinetic properties, therapeutic indexes, and safety profiles. Such improvements resulted in the US Food and Drug Administration approvals of brentuximab vedotin, trastuzumab emtansine, and, more recently, inotuzumab ozogamicin. In addition, recent clinical outcomes have sparked additional interest, which leads to the dramatically increased number of ADCs in clinical development. The present review explores ADCs, their main characteristics, and new research developments, as well as discusses strategies for the selection of the most appropriate target antigens, mAbs, cytotoxic drugs, linkers, and conjugation chemistries."

                            "Researchers have explored different types of linkers, which can be broadly classified into two categories: cleavable and noncleavable linkers. (Sheyi et al., 2022)55,56 Cleavable linkers have the ability to release a metabolite of the effector molecules from the ADC, allowing it to enter cells, either at the tumor site or within endosomes and lysosomes. These cleavable linkers are further divided into chemically cleavable linkers and enzymatically cleavable linkers, such as peptide-based linkers, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers, and phosphate-based linkers. (Sheyi et al., 2022) Notably, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers consist of \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers and \u03b2-galactosidase-sensitive linkers. Premature cleavage of these linkers can lead to the effector molecules harming normal cells. (Beck et al., 2017) On the other hand, noncleavable linkers, such as thioether linkers and maleimido caproyl linkers, require internalization of the ADC into cells and subsequent breakdown by lysosomes to release the effector molecules. ADCs with noncleavable linkers depend on complete lysosomal enzymatic degradation of the antibody for payload release, resulting in simultaneous dissociation of the linker. 58"

                            "As one of the major therapeutic options for cancer treatment, chemotherapy has limited selectivity against cancer cells. Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives."
