They are mainly responsible for removing particles and pathogens from the blood through phagocytosis [58]. To enhance the uptake of LNPs by Kupffer cells and their immunoregulation ability, research has explored various strategies, including increasing the size of LNPs and modifying the LNP surface with hydrophobic molecules [59]. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are located in the sinusoidal space of the liver, where they play important roles in blood filtration, metabolic regulation, antigen presentation, and lipid metabolism. LSECs have a unique structure and function, enabling them to play a crucial role in immune and metabolic processes in the liver [60]. Targeting LNPs to Kupffer cells and LSECs can lead to more effective drug or gene delivery, especially in the treatment of liver diseases. For example, in diseases that require liver-specific treatment, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer, this targeted delivery strategy can improve the therapeutic outcomes and reduce unnecessary side-effects. Paunovska et al. [61] explored the use of different types of cholesterol to modify LNPs and reported that the structure of the cholesterol significantly affects the targeting ability of the LNPs. In addition, by using the Fast Identification Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) system, they screened LNPs formulated with different oxidized cholesterol and observed that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol can efficiently deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells. This contrasts with conventional LNPs, which primarily target hepatocytes, and suggests that the targeting of LNPs to specific cell types can be improved by specific chemical modifications. This improved targeting has significant implications for the treatment of liver diseases and the application of immunotherapy.",

Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.",

Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.",

                    "text": "The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood. Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-\uf067RIIb2 (17). These receptors are involved in the removal of blood-borne antigens by active endocytosis. For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25). \n\nIn this study, we report the engineered LNP formulations for the targeted delivery of RNA into different types of cells in the liver. Hepatocytes and LSECs are two major cells involved in various liver-related diseases. Hepatocytes are often associated with rare diseases in metabolism and endocrine dysfunctions, while LSECs are closely related with chronic liver diseases such as liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (19,26,27). It is important to selectively target the liver cells in different diseases, and its selectivity becomes more critical when introducing in vivo gene regulation and editing. Here, ionizable lipids were first synthesized and screened for their pK a (where K a is the acid dissociation constant) and endolytic activities. Selected lipid candidates were further evaluated for in vitro and in vivo gene expression after formulating LNPs with reporter mRNA [firefly luciferase (FLuc)]. Targeted delivery of LNPs with mRNA (Cre) in different types of cells in the liver was examined by controlling the particle size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. In addition, engineered LNPs with mannose moieties were prepared for active targeting of LSECs. Optimized condition for the targeted delivery of mRNA to LSECs was lastly confirmed.",

Although LNPs are particularly advantageous for in vivo delivery, systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics other than liver hepatocytes remains highly challenging. \n\nThe liver consists of two major types of cells, including parenchymal cells (e.g., hepatocytes) and nonparenchymal cells [e.g., liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and stellate cells] (16)(17)(18)(19). Given their physiological differences, a cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver requires a precise engineering of LNPs. For example, LSECs have the highest endocytic capacity without a basement membrane, making them the most permeable among liver cells (20). LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (21). Chen and coworkers (22) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation. \n\nNanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood.",

The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

                    "text": "A platform technology that delivers RNA therapeutics to targeted cells has great potential for treating various liver diseases associated with different types of cells in the liver. In particular, LSECs participate in initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases by change in their pathological characteristics in response to chemical toxins, cytokines, and inflammatory stimuli (17,19). Previous studies have shown that targeting endothelial sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 and Bax in LSECs could also reduce apoptosis of LSECs and eventually reduced acute hepatic failure (43,44). The conjugation of hyaluronan, KLGR peptide, and mannose resulted in increased uptake of nano particles into LSECs compared to nonconjugated groups. Moreover, previously reported studies have confirmed that LNPs can be delivered to different tissue by changing LNP formulations. Some of these formulations showed increased mRNA delivery to LSECs without targeting ligands (45). Nevertheless, its selectivity remained not well understood (37). \n\nTo translate the targeted delivery to LSECs, ApoE-dependent cellular uptake must be replaced by alternative ligand selection and incorporation. Upon entering blood circulation system, LNPs can be readily delivered to hepatocytes and LSECs by ApoE-dependent cellular uptake. However, delivery efficacy of LNPs in LSECs is significantly less than that of hepatocytes (23). Here, we demonstrated a targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs by incorporating active ligands to LNPs. The mannose ligand can interact with specific receptors (CD206) expressed on LSECs. We have shown that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) allowed selective delivery of mRNA/siRNA only to LSECs through mannose-CD206 interaction. It is likely that, when PEGlipid content is high enough, the ApoE-mediated cellular uptake is mostly reduced, while mannose-CD206 interaction becomes predominant for the cellular entry of LNPs. Moreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae.",

Kim, M. Jeong, S. Hur, Y. Cho, J. Park, H. Jung, Y. Seo, H. Woo, K. Nam, K. Lee, H. Lee\n## Abstract\nEngineered ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were developed for the LSEC-specific delivery of RNA therapeutics. Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe mechanism of cellular uptake was well investigated, and adsorption of serum ApoE (apolipoprotein E) on the surface of LNPs was a major effector facilitating the intracellular delivery of LNPs into hepatocytes through low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (15). Although LNPs are particularly advantageous for in vivo delivery, systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics other than liver hepatocytes remains highly challenging. \n\nThe liver consists of two major types of cells, including parenchymal cells (e.g., hepatocytes) and nonparenchymal cells [e.g., liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and stellate cells] (16)(17)(18)(19). Given their physiological differences, a cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver requires a precise engineering of LNPs. For example, LSECs have the highest endocytic capacity without a basement membrane, making them the most permeable among liver cells (20). LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (21). Chen and coworkers (22) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation. \n\nNanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23).

Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-\uf067RIIb2 (17). These receptors are involved in the removal of blood-borne antigens by active endocytosis. For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25). \n\nIn this study, we report the engineered LNP formulations for the targeted delivery of RNA into different types of cells in the liver. Hepatocytes and LSECs are two major cells involved in various liver-related diseases. Hepatocytes are often associated with rare diseases in metabolism and endocrine dysfunctions, while LSECs are closely related with chronic liver diseases such as liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (19,26,27). It is important to selectively target the liver cells in different diseases, and its selectivity becomes more critical when introducing in vivo gene regulation and editing. Here, ionizable lipids were first synthesized and screened for their pK a (where K a is the acid dissociation constant) and endolytic activities. Selected lipid candidates were further evaluated for in vitro and in vivo gene expression after formulating LNPs with reporter mRNA [firefly luciferase (FLuc)]. Targeted delivery of LNPs with mRNA (Cre) in different types of cells in the liver was examined by controlling the particle size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. In addition, engineered LNPs with mannose moieties were prepared for active targeting of LSECs. Optimized condition for the targeted delivery of mRNA to LSECs was lastly confirmed.\n\n## Active targeting of LSECs using ligand-incorporated LNPs\nUpon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).\n\n## DISCUSSION\nA platform technology that delivers RNA therapeutics to targeted cells has great potential for treating various liver diseases associated with different types of cells in the liver. In particular, LSECs participate in initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases by change in their pathological characteristics in response to chemical toxins, cytokines, and inflammatory stimuli (17,19). Previous studies have shown that targeting endothelial sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 and Bax in LSECs could also reduce apoptosis of LSECs and eventually reduced acute hepatic failure (43,44). The conjugation of hyaluronan, KLGR peptide, and mannose resulted in increased uptake of nano particles into LSECs compared to nonconjugated groups. Moreover, previously reported studies have confirmed that LNPs can be delivered to different tissue by changing LNP formulations. Some of these formulations showed increased mRNA delivery to LSECs without targeting ligands (45). Nevertheless, its selectivity remained not well understood (37). \n\nTo translate the targeted delivery to LSECs, ApoE-dependent cellular uptake must be replaced by alternative ligand selection and incorporation. Upon entering blood circulation system, LNPs can be readily delivered to hepatocytes and LSECs by ApoE-dependent cellular uptake. However, delivery efficacy of LNPs in LSECs is significantly less than that of hepatocytes (23). Here, we demonstrated a targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs by incorporating active ligands to LNPs. The mannose ligand can interact with specific receptors (CD206) expressed on LSECs. We have shown that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) allowed selective delivery of mRNA/siRNA only to LSECs through mannose-CD206 interaction. It is likely that, when PEGlipid content is high enough, the ApoE-mediated cellular uptake is mostly reduced, while mannose-CD206 interaction becomes predominant for the cellular entry of LNPs. Moreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae.\n...\nMoreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae. This additionally reduced the uptake of LNPs to hepatocytes and allowed more selective uptake into the LSECs. Collectively, our results successfully demonstrated the targeted delivery of RNA into different types of cells in the liver by controlling physical size of LNPs, PEG-lipid content, and incorporation of active targeting ligands. Overall, this approach may offer new strategies to develop cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver and other tissues.",

For example, a platform for mRNA delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) was reported, from which a promising lipid candidate CL15A6 with high affinity to aHSCs was identified, and the biosafety with an in vivo dose up to 2 mg/kg was proven. 37 In addition, Frederick Campbell and colleagues rationally designed an anionic LNP that switched neutral LNPs surface charge into anionic based on the formulation of Onpattro, 38 which preferentially targeted mRNA delivery to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) made up of LSECs and KCs through scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and -2 mediating anionic recognition of LNPs with LSECs. 39 elective targeting of liver cells by using ligand-modified LNPs is another potential strategy. Mannose-modified LNPs can achieve selective delivery of nucleic acids to LSECs through the mannose receptor, which is specifically expressed on LSECs. 30,40 This strategy was employed by Andre E. Nel and his team, where they used mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid moiety of LNPs (Figure 1A), enabling LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA at the cellular level (Figure 1B), and also enhancing in vivo lung gathering of man-LNPs with the dose of 1 mg/kg (Figure 1C). 41 onventional LNPs mostly enrich the liver due to natural characteristics, making it difficult and necessary to target extra-hepatic tissue. Inspired by the four-component formula of classical LNPs, the selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy, first reported by Daniel J. Siegwart's group, has been reported, which involves the incorporation of a complementary component, known as the SORT molecule, in classical fourcomposition LNPs (Figure 1D). 42",

Bellinger utilized multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to interact with highly expressed asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on the hepatocytes, mediating an endogenous entry mechanism. 33 An optimized GalNAc-modified LNPs formulated by ionizable lipid GL6 based on the lysine-based scaffold and covalently linked to the sugar moiety and scaffold exhibited significant adenine base editing capability targeting ANGPTL3 in the liver in a somatic LDLR-deficient nonhuman primates (NHP) model. The GalNAc-LNPs increased liver editing from 5% to 61% in the NHP model and resulted in an 89% reduction in ANGPTL3 protein in the blood for 6 months after administration. 34 Besides, O-series LNPs (ILs containing an ester bond in the tail) have shown a preference for accomplishing liver-selective mRNA delivery. 35 Qiaobing Xu's team developed a novel O-series LNPs, 306-O12B LNPs, to perform a specific hepatocyte delivery of Cas9 (CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats)-associated protein 9) mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting ANGPTL3 (sgAngptl3). 36 n spite of the fact that the ability of LNPs to target hepatocytes has been widely explored, the targeted delivery of LNPs to other liver cells, such as HSCs, hepatic macrophages, Kupffer cells (KCs), and LSECs, remains a challenge. Fortunately, several studies have shown that strategies for targeting other hepatic cells with LNPs are possible. In the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships.",

                    "text": "As the largest digestive organ in the body, the liver plays a central role in metabolism, mainly performed by hepatocytes, one type of parenchymal cells, in which lesion of hepatocytes often causes serious metabolic diseases, such as Wilson disease, Gilben syndrome, etc. In addition, some hepatic non-parenchymal cells, such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) also trigger serious hepatic diseases. For instance, LSECs play a key role in the initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma development. 27 ucleic acid drugs offer unique advantages over conventional chemical and protein-based drugs and represent a new approach to treating liver diseases. Targeting hepatocytes is relatively straightforward because LNPs are naturally taken up by hepatocytes through the interaction of serum ApoE adsorbed on the LNPs' surface and LDLR on the hepatocyte surfaces, facilitating cellular endocytosis. 28 Consistent with the theory, unmodified LNPs have been found to be widely distributed in the liver after systemic administration. 29 In addition, the hepatocellular targeting ability of LNPs can be significantly enhanced by optimizing lipid composition and LNPs formulation. For instance, a study by H. Lee and colleagues found that LNPs containing 1.5% PEGylated lipids exhibited approximately 80% transfection efficiency, the highest hepatocyte uptake, among LNPs formulations containing PEGylated lipids ranging from 1 to 3%. 30 Also, it has been reported that by constructing helper lipids 31 and ILs libraries, it was possible to identify mRNA/siRNA-LNPs with superior liver targeting and enrichment properties. James E. Dahlman's group reported that LNPs containing stereopure 20a-hydroxycholesterol (20a) showed a more robust capacity to deliver mRNA to hepatocytes than control at a low dose. 32 However, passive targeting mechanisms via LNPs may not be efficient for patients lacking LDLR.",

For instance, LSECs play a key role in the initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma development. 27 ucleic acid drugs offer unique advantages over conventional chemical and protein-based drugs and represent a new approach to treating liver diseases. Targeting hepatocytes is relatively straightforward because LNPs are naturally taken up by hepatocytes through the interaction of serum ApoE adsorbed on the LNPs' surface and LDLR on the hepatocyte surfaces, facilitating cellular endocytosis. 28 Consistent with the theory, unmodified LNPs have been found to be widely distributed in the liver after systemic administration. 29 In addition, the hepatocellular targeting ability of LNPs can be significantly enhanced by optimizing lipid composition and LNPs formulation. For instance, a study by H. Lee and colleagues found that LNPs containing 1.5% PEGylated lipids exhibited approximately 80% transfection efficiency, the highest hepatocyte uptake, among LNPs formulations containing PEGylated lipids ranging from 1 to 3%. 30 Also, it has been reported that by constructing helper lipids 31 and ILs libraries, it was possible to identify mRNA/siRNA-LNPs with superior liver targeting and enrichment properties. James E. Dahlman's group reported that LNPs containing stereopure 20a-hydroxycholesterol (20a) showed a more robust capacity to deliver mRNA to hepatocytes than control at a low dose. 32 However, passive targeting mechanisms via LNPs may not be efficient for patients lacking LDLR.\n...\nHowever, passive targeting mechanisms via LNPs may not be efficient for patients lacking LDLR. Given this, Andrew M. Bellinger utilized multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to interact with highly expressed asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on the hepatocytes, mediating an endogenous entry mechanism. 33 An optimized GalNAc-modified LNPs formulated by ionizable lipid GL6 based on the lysine-based scaffold and covalently linked to the sugar moiety and scaffold exhibited significant adenine base editing capability targeting ANGPTL3 in the liver in a somatic LDLR-deficient nonhuman primates (NHP) model. The GalNAc-LNPs increased liver editing from 5% to 61% in the NHP model and resulted in an 89% reduction in ANGPTL3 protein in the blood for 6 months after administration. 34 Besides, O-series LNPs (ILs containing an ester bond in the tail) have shown a preference for accomplishing liver-selective mRNA delivery. 35 Qiaobing Xu's team developed a novel O-series LNPs, 306-O12B LNPs, to perform a specific hepatocyte delivery of Cas9 (CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats)-associated protein 9) mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting ANGPTL3 (sgAngptl3). 36 n spite of the fact that the ability of LNPs to target hepatocytes has been widely explored, the targeted delivery of LNPs to other liver cells, such as HSCs, hepatic macrophages, Kupffer cells (KCs), and LSECs, remains a challenge. Fortunately, several studies have shown that strategies for targeting other hepatic cells with LNPs are possible. In the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships.\n...\nIn the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships. For example, a platform for mRNA delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) was reported, from which a promising lipid candidate CL15A6 with high affinity to aHSCs was identified, and the biosafety with an in vivo dose up to 2 mg/kg was proven. 37 In addition, Frederick Campbell and colleagues rationally designed an anionic LNP that switched neutral LNPs surface charge into anionic based on the formulation of Onpattro, 38 which preferentially targeted mRNA delivery to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) made up of LSECs and KCs through scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and -2 mediating anionic recognition of LNPs with LSECs. 39 elective targeting of liver cells by using ligand-modified LNPs is another potential strategy. Mannose-modified LNPs can achieve selective delivery of nucleic acids to LSECs through the mannose receptor, which is specifically expressed on LSECs. 30,40 This strategy was employed by Andre E. Nel and his team, where they used mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid moiety of LNPs (Figure 1A), enabling LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA at the cellular level (Figure 1B), and also enhancing in vivo lung gathering of man-LNPs with the dose of 1 mg/kg (Figure 1C). 41 onventional LNPs mostly enrich the liver due to natural characteristics, making it difficult and necessary to target extra-hepatic tissue. Inspired by the four-component formula of classical LNPs, the selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy, first reported by Daniel J. Siegwart's group, has been reported, which involves the incorporation of a complementary component, known as the SORT molecule, in classical fourcomposition LNPs (Figure 1D). 42",

One recent publication compared a series of synthesized ionizable LNPs in terms of their ability to target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs); the LNPs had varied PEG percentages and nanoparticle sizes [120]. In another study, Siegwart's group designed Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) nanoparticles by incorporating certain molecules into lipid nanoparticles comprised of ionizable lipids, cholesterol, DSPC and PEG. The resulting SORT nanoparticles tuned mRNA release based on modulation of internal charge and thereby facilitated delivery to specific tissue types [141]. Since tuning ionizable lipids based on organ or cell type may be difficult to achieve in clinical practice, targeting of LNPs with specific ligands may be the best strategy. Ligand-mediated targeting has been shown to mediate delivery nucleic acid cargos to specific cell types overexpressing the receptor [192]. Targeting of mRNA-LNPs can be achieved by introducing the targeting ligands during LNP production or by post-insertion of targeting ligands into the mRNA-LNP. Recent studies have shown that different targeting ligands can be inserted into mRNA-LNPs to specifically target immune cells, cardiac cells and liver cells. The research field of targeting mRNA-LNPs is still in its infancy, with relatively few publications available. Table 7 summarizes the different ligands utilized to target mRNA-LNPs to different cell types.",

Strikingly, as much as 30-90% of systemically administered LNPs accumulate in the liver, which would constitute a severe off-target effect if treating non-hepatic diseases [251,252]. In order to transition mRNA-LNPs from prophylactic to therapeutic applications, researchers must overcome the crucial challenge of delivering mRNA payloads to non-hepatic tissues. Considerable efforts have been devoted to guiding mRNA-LNPs to specific tissues, as selective targeting remains a key obstacle to the advancement of precision medicine and mitigation of off-target and adverse effects associated with RNA-based therapeutics [185,186]. \n\nWhile non-targeting mRNA-LNPs tend to primarily accumulate in the liver after administration via intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous routes, targeting ligands may be used to more precisely direct LNPs to hepatocytes or other specific liver cell types. For example, one study utilized LNPs decorated with mannose ligands to deliver mRNA encoding epitope peptides of Arachishypogaea protein 2 (Ara h2), a primary allergen in peanuts, to LSECs [253]. In C3H/HeJ mice sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract, the prophylactic administration of the LSEC-targeted mRNA-LNP could inhibit anaphylaxis. This effect was mediated by suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis and mast cell release of inflammatory factors. In other work, antibodies against the endothelial cell surface marker, PCAM-1 (platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; CD31) were utilized for LNP targeting [195]. Intravenous administration of anti-PCAM-1-conjugated mRNA-LNPs led to low levels of hepatic uptake accompanied by an approximately 200-fold elevation of mRNA delivery and 25-fold increase of protein expression in the lungs compared to non-targeted counterparts.",

J. L. P. Perez, Monika Kumari, Guan-Hong Chen, Ming-Hsiang Hong, Yin-Shiou Lin, Ching-Hang Liu, Shih-Han Ko, C. A. P. Concio, Yi-Jen Su, Yi-Han Chang, Wen-Shan Li, Han-Chung Wu\n## Abstract\nRealizing the immense clinical potential of mRNA-based drugs will require continued development of methods to safely deliver the bioactive agents with high efficiency and without triggering side effects. In this regard, lipid nanoparticles have been successfully utilized to improve mRNA delivery and protect the cargo from extracellular degradation. Encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles was an essential factor in the successful clinical application of mRNA vaccines, which conclusively demonstrated the technology's potential to yield approved medicines. In this review, we begin by describing current advances in mRNA modifications, design of novel lipids and development of lipid nanoparticle components for mRNA-based drugs. Then, we summarize key points pertaining to preclinical and clinical development of mRNA therapeutics. Finally, we cover topics related to targeted delivery systems, including endosomal escape and targeting of immune cells, tumors and organs for use with mRNA vaccines and new treatment modalities for human diseases.\n## New modality of mRNA-based vaccines and drugs: lipid compositions and ligand targeting\nIn addition to ligand-mediated targeting, different modified ionizable lipids can facilitate delivery of mRNAs to specific cell types or organs. One recent publication compared a series of synthesized ionizable LNPs in terms of their ability to target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs); the LNPs had varied PEG percentages and nanoparticle sizes [120]. In another study, Siegwart's group designed Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) nanoparticles by incorporating certain molecules into lipid nanoparticles comprised of ionizable lipids, cholesterol, DSPC and PEG. The resulting SORT nanoparticles tuned mRNA release based on modulation of internal charge and thereby facilitated delivery to specific tissue types [141]. Since tuning ionizable lipids based on organ or cell type may be difficult to achieve in clinical practice, targeting of LNPs with specific ligands may be the best strategy. Ligand-mediated targeting has been shown to mediate delivery nucleic acid cargos to specific cell types overexpressing the receptor [192]. Targeting of mRNA-LNPs can be achieved by introducing the targeting ligands during LNP production or by post-insertion of targeting ligands into the mRNA-LNP. Recent studies have shown that different targeting ligands can be inserted into mRNA-LNPs to specifically target immune cells, cardiac cells and liver cells. The research field of targeting mRNA-LNPs is still in its infancy, with relatively few publications available. Table 7 summarizes the different ligands utilized to target mRNA-LNPs to different cell types.\n\n## Organ targeting\nAlthough LNPs can be used to efficiently deliver nucleic acids in vivo, their preferential accumulation in the liver tissue poses a significant limitation. Strikingly, as much as 30-90% of systemically administered LNPs accumulate in the liver, which would constitute a severe off-target effect if treating non-hepatic diseases [251,252]. In order to transition mRNA-LNPs from prophylactic to therapeutic applications, researchers must overcome the crucial challenge of delivering mRNA payloads to non-hepatic tissues. Considerable efforts have been devoted to guiding mRNA-LNPs to specific tissues, as selective targeting remains a key obstacle to the advancement of precision medicine and mitigation of off-target and adverse effects associated with RNA-based therapeutics [185,186]. \n\nWhile non-targeting mRNA-LNPs tend to primarily accumulate in the liver after administration via intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous routes, targeting ligands may be used to more precisely direct LNPs to hepatocytes or other specific liver cell types. For example, one study utilized LNPs decorated with mannose ligands to deliver mRNA encoding epitope peptides of Arachishypogaea protein 2 (Ara h2), a primary allergen in peanuts, to LSECs [253]. In C3H/HeJ mice sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract, the prophylactic administration of the LSEC-targeted mRNA-LNP could inhibit anaphylaxis. This effect was mediated by suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis and mast cell release of inflammatory factors. In other work, antibodies against the endothelial cell surface marker, PCAM-1 (platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; CD31) were utilized for LNP targeting [195]. Intravenous administration of anti-PCAM-1-conjugated mRNA-LNPs led to low levels of hepatic uptake accompanied by an approximately 200-fold elevation of mRNA delivery and 25-fold increase of protein expression in the lungs compared to non-targeted counterparts.",

Antibodies and their various formats have been conjugated to LNPs, and the resultant conjugates have shown successful retargeting of LNPs to multiple extrahepatic cells and tissues, including immune cells, lymph nodes, bone marrow, cancer cells, and endothelial cells (Table 3). \n\nN-Acetyl Galactosamine. Conjugation of chemically stabilized siRNA to trivalent GalNAc has resulted in the FDA approval of five therapeutics that are administered sc for various liver indications. Trivalent GalNAc is conjugated to the 3\u2032 end of the sense strand using a pH labile hydroxy proline linker. GalNAc allows targeting to the liver where it binds to ASGPRs expressed on hepatocytes 134 (note that the ASGPR is conserved across species), and there are \u223c1 million ASGPRs on liver cells that recycle every 15 min. 31",

Furthermore, the review highlights the diverse applications of cell-specific mRNA therapeutics in addressing various aspects of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias. By modulating key regulatory genes involved in cardiomyocyte proliferation, inflammation, angiogenesis, tissue repair, and cell survival, mRNA therapeutics hold the potential to intervene at multiple stages of CVD pathogenesis.

Polymeric micelles (PMs) were functionalized by coupling peptide ligands of LSEC membrane receptors CD32b, CD36 and ITGB3. Functionalization was confirmed via spectroscopy and electron microscopy. In vitro and in vivo FPM-Sim internalization was assessed by means of flow cytometry in LSECs, hepatocytes, Kupffer and hepatic stellate cells from healthy rats. Maximum tolerated dose assays were performed in healthy mice and efficacy studies of FPM-Sim were carried out in bile duct ligation (BDL) and thioacetamide (TAA) induction rat models of cirrhosis. Functionalization with the three peptide ligands resulted in stable formulations with a greater degree of in vivo internalization in LSECs than non-functionalized PMs. Administration of FPM-Sim in BDL rats reduced toxicity relative to free simvastatin, albeit with a moderate portal-pressure-lowering effect. In a less severe model of TAA-induced cirrhosis, treatment with FPM-CD32b-Sim nanoparticles for two weeks significantly decreased portal pressure, which was associated with a reduction in liver fibrosis, lower collagen expression as well as the stimulation of nitric oxide synthesis. In conclusion, CD32b-FPM stands out as a good nanotransporter for drug delivery, targeting LSECs, key inducers of liver injury.",

This effect was confirmed by the expected overexpression of KLF2 in healthy isolated LSECs treated with free or encapsulated simvastatin. We also ruled out any possible effect of the empty functionalized nanodevices acting only as an inert vehicle for the delivery of the loaded drug. \n\nIntravenous treatment of healthy rats with the different fluorescent formulations confirms that, in all cases, functionalization confers greater efficiency in entering the main liver cells than passive targeting; the capture of FPMs was clearly superior to that achieved by non-functionalized PMs, and LSECs were the liver cells with the highest uptake. Furthermore, in endothelial cells, all three types of functionalization were equally effective. In vivo cell internalization experiments also confirmed that the receptors selected as LSEC targets for our nanoparticles were also expressed in healthy Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, allowing functionalized nanoparticles to enter both cell types quite efficiently. This was expected for CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 , as their expression in the liver is elevated not only in LSECs, but also in other hepatic cell types [34,35]. However, CD32b, an Fc\u03b3R conferring LSECs the highest endocytic capacity of any cell in the human body, is known to be the most specific marker of these cells in the liver. Yet, recent studies have shown that CD32b is not only expressed in LSECs but also in Kupffer cells, with a liver level expression of 90% and 10%, respectively [36].",

Rafael, Fernanda Andrade, I. Abasolo, S. Schwartz, M. Mart\u00ednez-G\u00f3mez, Mar\u00eda Teresa Salcedo, J. M. Peric\u00e0s, Diana Hide, Mingxing Wei, N. Metanis, Joan Genesc\u00e0, M. Martell\n## Abstract\nIn this study, we developed functionalized polymeric micelles (FPMs) loaded with simvastatin (FPM-Sim) as a drug delivery system to target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) for preserving liver function in chronic liver disease (CLD). Polymeric micelles (PMs) were functionalized by coupling peptide ligands of LSEC membrane receptors CD32b, CD36 and ITGB3. Functionalization was confirmed via spectroscopy and electron microscopy. In vitro and in vivo FPM-Sim internalization was assessed by means of flow cytometry in LSECs, hepatocytes, Kupffer and hepatic stellate cells from healthy rats. Maximum tolerated dose assays were performed in healthy mice and efficacy studies of FPM-Sim were carried out in bile duct ligation (BDL) and thioacetamide (TAA) induction rat models of cirrhosis. Functionalization with the three peptide ligands resulted in stable formulations with a greater degree of in vivo internalization in LSECs than non-functionalized PMs. Administration of FPM-Sim in BDL rats reduced toxicity relative to free simvastatin, albeit with a moderate portal-pressure-lowering effect. In a less severe model of TAA-induced cirrhosis, treatment with FPM-CD32b-Sim nanoparticles for two weeks significantly decreased portal pressure, which was associated with a reduction in liver fibrosis, lower collagen expression as well as the stimulation of nitric oxide synthesis. In conclusion, CD32b-FPM stands out as a good nanotransporter for drug delivery, targeting LSECs, key inducers of liver injury.\n## Discussion\nIn vitro internalization in primary cultures of LSECs of the three FPM formulations with the specific ligands for CD32b, CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 receptors demonstrated that specific ligand-receptor interactions plus passive targeting promoted uptake by a greater number of healthy LSECs than the micelles conjugated with their scrambled variants. \n\nSimvastatin has been shown to reduce portal hypertension through the putative reduction in IHVR by means of several mechanisms, including the induction of KLF2 expression, related to the stimulation of a vasoprotective phenotype in LSECs [11,12,33]. This effect was confirmed by the expected overexpression of KLF2 in healthy isolated LSECs treated with free or encapsulated simvastatin. We also ruled out any possible effect of the empty functionalized nanodevices acting only as an inert vehicle for the delivery of the loaded drug. \n\nIntravenous treatment of healthy rats with the different fluorescent formulations confirms that, in all cases, functionalization confers greater efficiency in entering the main liver cells than passive targeting; the capture of FPMs was clearly superior to that achieved by non-functionalized PMs, and LSECs were the liver cells with the highest uptake. Furthermore, in endothelial cells, all three types of functionalization were equally effective. In vivo cell internalization experiments also confirmed that the receptors selected as LSEC targets for our nanoparticles were also expressed in healthy Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, allowing functionalized nanoparticles to enter both cell types quite efficiently. This was expected for CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 , as their expression in the liver is elevated not only in LSECs, but also in other hepatic cell types [34,35]. However, CD32b, an Fc\u03b3R conferring LSECs the highest endocytic capacity of any cell in the human body, is known to be the most specific marker of these cells in the liver. Yet, recent studies have shown that CD32b is not only expressed in LSECs but also in Kupffer cells, with a liver level expression of 90% and 10%, respectively [36].",

            "text": "Kupffer cells, as macrophages in the liver, play a key role in immune monitoring and the inflammatory response of the liver. They are mainly responsible for removing particles and pathogens from the blood through phagocytosis [58]. To enhance the uptake of LNPs by Kupffer cells and their immunoregulation ability, research has explored various strategies, including increasing the size of LNPs and modifying the LNP surface with hydrophobic molecules [59]. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are located in the sinusoidal space of the liver, where they play important roles in blood filtration, metabolic regulation, antigen presentation, and lipid metabolism. LSECs have a unique structure and function, enabling them to play a crucial role in immune and metabolic processes in the liver [60]. Targeting LNPs to Kupffer cells and LSECs can lead to more effective drug or gene delivery, especially in the treatment of liver diseases. For example, in diseases that require liver-specific treatment, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer, this targeted delivery strategy can improve the therapeutic outcomes and reduce unnecessary side-effects. Paunovska et al. [61] explored the use of different types of cholesterol to modify LNPs and reported that the structure of the cholesterol significantly affects the targeting ability of the LNPs. In addition, by using the Fast Identification Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) system, they screened LNPs formulated with different oxidized cholesterol and observed that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol can efficiently deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells. This contrasts with conventional LNPs, which primarily target hepatocytes, and suggests that the targeting of LNPs to specific cell types can be improved by specific chemical modifications. This improved targeting has significant implications for the treatment of liver diseases and the application of immunotherapy.",

            "text": "Kupffer cells play an important role in liver inflammation and immune tolerance, and they clear particles mainly through phagocytosis. It is reported that increasing the size of LNPs and surface modification of LNP with hydrophobic molecules could enhance the cellular uptake and promote immune regulation of Kupffer cells. 84 Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) reside in the liver sinusoids and are responsible for blood filtration, metabolism regulation, antigen presentation, and lipid metabolism. 85 To realize the Kupffer cell or LSECs specific mRNA delivery, Dahlem group applied many different kinds of cholesterol in the prescription of LNP, and found the structure of cholesterol has a great influence on the targeting ability of LNP. 86 They screened LNP formulated with different oxidized cholesterol with fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) system, and conclude that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol will deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells, which is different from the traditional LNP that mainly target to hepatocyte. Considering the important role of Kupffer cells and LSECs in antigen presentation and anti-inflammation effects, this LNP could be further used for immunotherapy. Pattipeiluhu et al. prepared a scavenger receptor LNPs (srLNPs) that could specifically target sinusoidal endothelial cells. 87 Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells (KCs) are the primary cell types of the hepatic blood vessel and sinusoids, which are responsible for liver homeostasis. Moreover, LSECs can function as antigen-presenting cells for regulating adaptive immunity and immunotolerance, considered a good target for immunotherapy. Based on the previous studies, anionic nanoparticles can be taken up by SECs, which are mediated by the stabilin receptors. Here, they prepared the srLNPs by referring to the composition of Onpattro. The only difference is the zwitterionic lipid DSPC was replaced by anionic lipid DSPG.",

            "text": "The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood. Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-\uf067RIIb2 (17). These receptors are involved in the removal of blood-borne antigens by active endocytosis. For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25). \n\nIn this study, we report the engineered LNP formulations for the targeted delivery of RNA into different types of cells in the liver. Hepatocytes and LSECs are two major cells involved in various liver-related diseases. Hepatocytes are often associated with rare diseases in metabolism and endocrine dysfunctions, while LSECs are closely related with chronic liver diseases such as liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (19,26,27). It is important to selectively target the liver cells in different diseases, and its selectivity becomes more critical when introducing in vivo gene regulation and editing. Here, ionizable lipids were first synthesized and screened for their pK a (where K a is the acid dissociation constant) and endolytic activities. Selected lipid candidates were further evaluated for in vitro and in vivo gene expression after formulating LNPs with reporter mRNA [firefly luciferase (FLuc)]. Targeted delivery of LNPs with mRNA (Cre) in different types of cells in the liver was examined by controlling the particle size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. In addition, engineered LNPs with mannose moieties were prepared for active targeting of LSECs. Optimized condition for the targeted delivery of mRNA to LSECs was lastly confirmed.",

However, other cell types which are part of the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES), such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and Kupffer cells (KCs) also represent interesting targets for nucleic acid therapeutics. Although KCs are very effective in removing and destroying nanosystems, they are much more difficult to be productively transfected with commonly used nucleic acid carriers. Therefore, several attempts were made to enable nucleic acid delivery to these cell types, including receptor-targeting strategies as well as the development of novel lipids for LNPs aiming for chemical targeting (Fig. 4).",

            "text": "The most successful liver-targeting LNPs is likely Onpattro \u00d2 , which was designed to exploit apoE binding to LNP in circulation to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes via the LDLR receptor. Hepatocytes comprise most of the liver, which also contains Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The liver is the main organ to take up synthetic nanoparticles administered systemically. Studies including [63] have shown that preference for hepatocytes over the reticuloendothelial system (RES), which includes Kupffer cells and LSECs, can be tuned by making LNP sizes either smaller or larger than the diameter of the fenestrations in the liver (50-300 nm [104] and 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm [57]). Kim et al. [105] show that grafting mannose onto LNPs allowed for selective delivery of RNA to LSECs while minimizing unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [106] exploited the dimensions of the fenestrations in the liver, in an alternate way, to increase LNP accumulation in cells other than the Kupffer cells and LSECs that usually take up a significant portion of nanoparticles administered systemically [107]. Specifically, Saunders et al. [106] administered non-toxic liposomes, termed nanoprimers, that were larger than the fenestrae of the liver capillaries and designed to transiently occupy RES cells in the liver prior to LNP administration. This strategy improved LNP nucleic acid-mediated knockdown and translation efficiency of targets in hepatocytes.",

LNPs accumulated broadly across these cell types, though functional mRNA delivery was notably higher in liver endothelial cells than in Kupffer cells or hepatocytes. Liver endothelial cells, with their distinctive discontinuous vasculature, act as a gateway, allowing LNPs to extravasate into the space of Disse, where they can interact with hepatocytes and other liver cells. Notably, endothelial cell subtypes, for example, CD32High (central venous zone) and CD32Low (periportal zone), showed different interactions with LNPs, with CD32Low cells exhibiting higher accumulation. This spatial distribution and receptor expression in liver endothelial cells influenced LNP uptake and processing, which in turn impacted biodistribution and functional delivery (Figure 3). 0][51] As part of the fibrotic matrix in liver disease, they may also influence how LNPs interact with the immune system. 34",

            "text": "A platform technology that delivers RNA therapeutics to targeted cells has great potential for treating various liver diseases associated with different types of cells in the liver. In particular, LSECs participate in initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases by change in their pathological characteristics in response to chemical toxins, cytokines, and inflammatory stimuli (17,19). Previous studies have shown that targeting endothelial sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 and Bax in LSECs could also reduce apoptosis of LSECs and eventually reduced acute hepatic failure (43,44). The conjugation of hyaluronan, KLGR peptide, and mannose resulted in increased uptake of nano particles into LSECs compared to nonconjugated groups. Moreover, previously reported studies have confirmed that LNPs can be delivered to different tissue by changing LNP formulations. Some of these formulations showed increased mRNA delivery to LSECs without targeting ligands (45). Nevertheless, its selectivity remained not well understood (37). \n\nTo translate the targeted delivery to LSECs, ApoE-dependent cellular uptake must be replaced by alternative ligand selection and incorporation. Upon entering blood circulation system, LNPs can be readily delivered to hepatocytes and LSECs by ApoE-dependent cellular uptake. However, delivery efficacy of LNPs in LSECs is significantly less than that of hepatocytes (23). Here, we demonstrated a targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs by incorporating active ligands to LNPs. The mannose ligand can interact with specific receptors (CD206) expressed on LSECs. We have shown that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) allowed selective delivery of mRNA/siRNA only to LSECs through mannose-CD206 interaction. It is likely that, when PEGlipid content is high enough, the ApoE-mediated cellular uptake is mostly reduced, while mannose-CD206 interaction becomes predominant for the cellular entry of LNPs. Moreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae.",

However, depletion strategies have been shown to improve hepatocyte targeting by minimizing LNP clearance by Kupffer cells. 35 For example, depletion of Kupffer cells was shown to improve nanoparticle delivery to tumors by up to 150-fold, though the maximum tumor accumulation remains only 2% of the injected dose, demonstrating systemic challenges in nanoparticle targeting. LSECs, because of their fenestrations, facilitated selective delivery, such as for receptor-specific LNPs. 23 7][78] Similarly, targeted therapies using hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/epidermal growth factor (EGF) mRNA and NM-FGF19 mRNA-loaded LNPs successfully treated chronic liver injuries and metabolic dysfunction by delivering therapeutic payloads to specific hepatic cells. 79,80 ecent studies demonstrated new mechanisms for liver-targeted delivery. For example, anionic LNPs targeted Kupffer cells and LSECs through stabilin receptors, 45 while GalNAc-LNPs entered hepatocytes through asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptor-mediated uptake, independent of LDL receptor. 81 (7) Some LNP formulations demonstrated extrahepatic targeting beyond the liver.",

[5,10,[12][13][14][15] However, expanding the scope of LNP-based gene therapies to other hepatic cell types (or nonhepatic cells), and therefore gain access to many tissue-/cell-specific diseases, has so far proven more challenging. To meet this challenge, empirical screening of LNPs has revealed formulations that preferentially target extrahepatic tissues (e.g., bone marrow) [16,17] and cells (e.g., T-cells), [18,19] as well as individual hepatic (e.g., liver endothelial) cell types. [20,21] However, while these empirical discoveries have enriched our understanding of the structure-activity land-scape of LNP technologies, they have not revealed the biological mechanisms underpinning LNP transport and preferential cellular uptake in vivo. This knowledge is fundamental for rational design and should be the foundation of any future discovery efforts toward LNP-RNA therapies with target cell specificity beyond hepatocytes. [5,22] Besides hepatocytes (comprising \u224880% liver volume), the liver is composed of nonparenchymal liver cells, including Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). [23] Hepatic blood vessels, or sinusoids, connecting the hepatic artery and portal vein to the central vein, are primarily composed of LSECs (\u224870%) and KCs (\u224820%). [24,25] Together, these two cell types make up the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) whose primary role is to maintain blood homeostasis through the scavenging of macromolecular waste and pathogens from blood. [26,27] LSECs, in particular, are specialized scavenger endothelial cells (SECs) and have one of the highest endocytic activities of any cell type in the body.

Based on our previous observations, LSECs take up LNPs with higher pKa values, in the pKa range tested (5.70-7.25). 32 However, higher pKa values were not examined and the optimum pKa value for targeting LSECs is not currently known. \n\nWe previously developed an LNP composed of different types of pH-sensitive cationic lipids, namely YSK lipids (referred to as YSK-LNP), to deliver siRNA in vitro and in vivo, particularly in hepatocytes. 33,34 In our previous study, slightly cationic LNP formulations that were composed of lipids with high pKa values, such as YSK13-C4 (pKa 6.80) and YSK15-C4 (pKa 7.10), were found to be highly localized in LSECs as opposed to hepatocytes. 32 Nevertheless, they showed a weak gene silencing activity in LSECs, possibly due to their inactivation by endothelial lipase (EL). 32 his prompted us to investigate the feasibility of targeting LSECs using lipase-resistant LNPs in which the membrane had optimized pKa values.",

In particular, mannose receptors (CD206) have been attracting attention because they are expressed on immunocompetent cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as on vascular endothelial cells [90]. Applying this strategy, an attempt to modify the cell selectivity in the liver by mannose modification was also reported in LNPs [49]. The pharmacokinetics of general LNPs is determined by the formation of protein corona especially after systemic administration, as described above. To make active targeting dominant, it is necessary to inhibit the formation of protein corona. It has been reported that increasing the amount of PEG-lipids reduced the interaction with ApoE and the LDLR-mediated delivery to hepatocytes. Therefore, in the LNPs based on ionizable lipids, DOPE, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid, the amount of PEG-lipid was increased to 3%, which is higher than general LNPs, and 2.5% of it was replaced with mannose-modified PEG-lipid. In the evaluation of firefly luciferase mRNA as a reporter, the mannose modification of LNPs did not change the liver-specific protein expression. The cellular pattern of protein expression in the liver, however, changed significantly in an evaluation using LSL-tdTomato mice. In the original LNPs, the percentage of tdTomato-positive cells was~70% for hepatocytes,~10% for liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and~5% for Kupffer cells; in the mannose-modified LNPs, the percentage was~15% for hepatocytes,~70% for LSECs, and~15% for Kupffer cells.

However, the endocytic capacity for mannose/Nacetylglucosamine is greater in LSECs than in Kupffer cells (Praaning-van Dalen et al., 1987). This may be because of the 2-fold greater number of LSECs (Praaning-van Dalen et al., 1987) and the greater expression of mannose/N-acetylglucosamine receptors in LSECs (Bijsterbosch et al., 1996;Kogelberg et al., 2007;Magnu \u00b4sson & Berg, 1993) than in Kupffer cells.

            "text": "In the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships. For example, a platform for mRNA delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) was reported, from which a promising lipid candidate CL15A6 with high affinity to aHSCs was identified, and the biosafety with an in vivo dose up to 2 mg/kg was proven. 37 In addition, Frederick Campbell and colleagues rationally designed an anionic LNP that switched neutral LNPs surface charge into anionic based on the formulation of Onpattro, 38 which preferentially targeted mRNA delivery to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) made up of LSECs and KCs through scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and -2 mediating anionic recognition of LNPs with LSECs. 39 elective targeting of liver cells by using ligand-modified LNPs is another potential strategy. Mannose-modified LNPs can achieve selective delivery of nucleic acids to LSECs through the mannose receptor, which is specifically expressed on LSECs. 30,40 This strategy was employed by Andre E. Nel and his team, where they used mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid moiety of LNPs (Figure 1A), enabling LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA at the cellular level (Figure 1B), and also enhancing in vivo lung gathering of man-LNPs with the dose of 1 mg/kg (Figure 1C). 41 onventional LNPs mostly enrich the liver due to natural characteristics, making it difficult and necessary to target extra-hepatic tissue. Inspired by the four-component formula of classical LNPs, the selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy, first reported by Daniel J. Siegwart's group, has been reported, which involves the incorporation of a complementary component, known as the SORT molecule, in classical fourcomposition LNPs (Figure 1D). 42",

To reduce nanovehicle capture, Saunders et al. 115 designed a liposome with a highly negative surface charge (\u00c099.4 mV) and large size (259 nm). After intravenous injection, liposomes with these unique physicochemical properties transiently occupied the MPS and thus decreased the uptake of siRNA-loaded LNPs by Kupffer cells and LSECs, prolonging their retention in blood. Ultimately, through the action of a nanoprimer, LNPs carrying human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA increased hEPO production (by 32%) or enhanced FVII silencing (by 49%).",

            "text": "BackgroundNumerous studies in rats and a few other mammalian species, including man, have shown that the sinusoidal cells constitute an important part of liver function. In the pig, however, which is frequently used in studies on liver transplantation and liver failure models, our knowledge about the function of hepatic sinusoidal cells is scarce. We have explored the scavenger function of pig liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), a cell type that in other mammals performs vital elimination of an array of waste macromolecules from the circulation.Results125I-macromolecules known to be cleared in the rat via the scavenger and mannose receptors were rapidly removed from the pig circulation, 50% of the injected dose being removed within the first 2\u20135 min following injection. Fluorescently labeled microbeads (2 \u03bcm in diameter) used to probe phagocytosis accumulated in Kupffer cells only, whereas fluorescently labeled soluble macromolecular ligands for the mannose and scavenger receptors were sequestered only by LSEC. Desmin-positive stellate cells accumulated no probes. Isolation of liver cells using collagenase perfusion through the portal vein, followed by various centrifugation protocols to separate the different liver cell populations yielded 280 \u00d7 107 (range 50\u2013890 \u00d7 107) sinusoidal cells per liver (weight of liver 237.1 g (sd 43.6)). Use of specific anti-Kupffer cell- and anti-desmin antibodies, combined with endocytosis of fluorescently labeled macromolecular soluble ligands indicated that the LSEC fraction contained 62 \u00d7 107 (sd 12 \u00d7 107) purified LSEC. Cultured LSEC avidly endocytosed ligands for the mannose and scavenger receptors.ConclusionsWe show here for the first time that pig LSEC, similar to what has been found earlier in rat LSEC, represent an effective scavenger system for removal of macromolecular waste products from the circulation.",

LSECs line the sinusoids of the liver and represent ~25% of liver cells ( [72] and Fig. 3C and D). Like Kupffer cells, LSECs express scavenger receptors SREC 1 and SREC-II that may be candidates for uptake of Ad particles [79]. LSECs work in concert with Kupffer cells to clear material from the bloodstream. Unlike Kupffer cells that can engulf particles up to 2 m in diameter, LSECs remove particles under 230 nm in diameter by pinocytosis [78,80]. Therefore, both cell types of have an overlapping ability to remove Ads from the circulation, although an increase in the effective diameter of Ad virions upon binding to other circulatory factors may favor uptake by Kupffer cells. Interestingly, when Kupffer cell uptake was impaired, LSECs were able to take up particles >1 m in diameter [80]. Sequestration of Ad by vascular endothelial cells is unclear, although in situ experiments show that like LSECs they are poorly transduced even at high doses [81].",

Kupffer cells, the liver's resident macrophage population, are known to phagocytose foreign particulates. Most of the nanoparticles are typically taken up by Kupffer cells in the liver, which preferentially interact with negatively charged NPs. Kupffer cells are responsible for immune and inflammatory responses and regulate liver diseases, including NAFLD. Hepatocytes, which are specialized epithelial cells, also interact with NPs but to a lower extent than the macrophages. ey activate other liver cells and are also involved in immune and inflammatory responses. In contrary to Kupffer cells, hepatocyte uptake of NPs increases with positive zeta potential. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are specialized endothelial cells that form the interface between blood cells and liver cells. Open fenestrations and lack of basal lamina of LSECs provide a mesh-like structure leading to the entrapment of NPs in the liver. Stellate cells are fat-storing cells that play a crucial role in liver fibrosis [17,19]. is preferential distribution to the liver is attributed to the presence of fenestrations along the endothelial barrier of the liver and the absence of basal lamina. After systemic administration, the majority of NPs with a size above 6 nm accumulate in the liver. \n\nus, enterohepatic circulation plays a vital role to deliver orally administered NPs to the liver [20]. \n\nNonparenchymal cells located at the sinusoidal endothelium (i.e., Kupffer cells) are responsible for passive targeting due to their location in the liver sinusoid. Nanoparticles with the size of >100 nm mostly accumulate in sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, while the smaller nanoparticles (<100 nm) passively target hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells [21]. e optimum size of NPs for liver delivery is about 40-150 nm [22]. \n\n1.5.

            "text": "As the largest digestive organ in the body, the liver plays a central role in metabolism, mainly performed by hepatocytes, one type of parenchymal cells, in which lesion of hepatocytes often causes serious metabolic diseases, such as Wilson disease, Gilben syndrome, etc. In addition, some hepatic non-parenchymal cells, such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) also trigger serious hepatic diseases. For instance, LSECs play a key role in the initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma development. 27 ucleic acid drugs offer unique advantages over conventional chemical and protein-based drugs and represent a new approach to treating liver diseases. Targeting hepatocytes is relatively straightforward because LNPs are naturally taken up by hepatocytes through the interaction of serum ApoE adsorbed on the LNPs' surface and LDLR on the hepatocyte surfaces, facilitating cellular endocytosis. 28 Consistent with the theory, unmodified LNPs have been found to be widely distributed in the liver after systemic administration. 29 In addition, the hepatocellular targeting ability of LNPs can be significantly enhanced by optimizing lipid composition and LNPs formulation. For instance, a study by H. Lee and colleagues found that LNPs containing 1.5% PEGylated lipids exhibited approximately 80% transfection efficiency, the highest hepatocyte uptake, among LNPs formulations containing PEGylated lipids ranging from 1 to 3%. 30 Also, it has been reported that by constructing helper lipids 31 and ILs libraries, it was possible to identify mRNA/siRNA-LNPs with superior liver targeting and enrichment properties. James E. Dahlman's group reported that LNPs containing stereopure 20a-hydroxycholesterol (20a) showed a more robust capacity to deliver mRNA to hepatocytes than control at a low dose. 32 However, passive targeting mechanisms via LNPs may not be efficient for patients lacking LDLR.",

The interactions of LNPs with other liver cell subtypes, such as CD74-expressing macrophages and CD32-expressing endothelial cells, affect how efficiently nucleic acids are delivered. 32 Table 1 summarizes these cell types and their interactions with LNPs. \n\nKupffer cells are distinct macrophages that reside in the liver sinusoids, are responsible for a large fraction of the body's total macrophages, and are involved in clearing circulating nanoparticles and other foreign materials from the blood. Kupffer cells rapidly take up LNPs, resulting in their predominant distribution in the liver after intravenous administration. 23,33 Alongside their phagocytic function, Kupffer cells have defined subpopulations with inflammatory (CD74High) and tolerogenic (CD74Low) phenotypes, 32 which can influence the immune response and nanoparticle clearance. Their high uptake often limits the amount of LNPs reaching hepatocytes, as Kupffer cells sequester the nanoparticles before they can reach their target cells, reducing functional delivery. 35  et al. 11 demonstrated that modulating Kupffer cell activity can enhance nanoparticle delivery to target tissues. Depletion of Kupffer cells has been shown to improve the functional delivery of nanoparticles to hepatocytes and improve therapeutic outcomes, especially in cancer models. 36 y strategies include: \n\n(1) Saturation of Kupffer cells using non-toxic materials to temporarily reduce their phagocytic capacity. \n\nDepletion of Kupffer cells to minimize liver sequestration and enhance nanoparticle circulation to target tissues.",

Kupffer cells express scavenger receptors, mannose receptors, tolllike receptors, antibody receptors, and complement receptors, which facilitate the internalization of pathogens or foreign materials. Nanoparticles can be internalized through clathrin-mediated or caveolin-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and other endocytotic mode [188]. Similar as macrophages, LSECs possess phagocytic ability. Using scavenger receptors, mannose receptors, LSECs can directly take up materials from the bloodstream [112]. LSECs and Kupffer cells may compete for nanoparticles in the liver sinusoid [189]. Hepatic stellate cells distribute within the space of Disse which is a narrow space between LSECs and hepatocytes [22]. Nanomaterials that can pass through the sinusoidal fenestrae and not remove from Kupffer cells and LSECs may be taken up by hepatic stellate cells [112].",

            "text": "Kupffer cells, the resident liver macrophages, have long been considered as scavenger cells responsible for removing particulate material from the portal circulation. However, evidence derived mostly from animal models indicates that Kupffer cells may be implicated in the pathogenesis of various liver diseases including viral hepatitis, steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, intrahepatic cholestasis, and activation or rejection of the liver during liver transplantation and liver fibrosis [117]. \n\nBoth the Kupffer and sinusoidal endothelial cells share many characteristics that can be relevant for the enhanced uptake of drug delivery systems by these cells. They are endowed with a high phagocytic capacity and are as such an intrinsic part of the reticuloendothelial system (RES). This system plays an essential role in the regulation of the host defence system and because of this, many foreign particles that accumulate in these two cell types [118]. Several of these diseases are treated with systemic immunosuppressive agents, but there are many arguments that favour a local downregulation of inflammatory processes within the liver rather than inducing systemic immunosuppressive effects [119]. Accumulation of therapeutic compounds in Kupffer and endothelial cells can either be nonspecific or specific via designated receptors. Drug delivery systems like liposomes, micelles and viral particles end up in these cells via nonspecific uptake mechanisms due to their largest phagocytic activity [120]. \n\nIn addition, uptake in Kupffer and endothelial cells can also be mediated by specific receptors. These cells bind to negatively charged molecules via scavenger receptors that are abundantly expressed on their membrane [121,122]; for example, coupling of compound to lysine groups within the albumin molecule removes positive charges from the molecule which creates a compound with a net negative charge that may serve as a ligand for scavenger receptors [123,124]. \n\nTargeting to Kupffer cell is directed through mannose receptor using sugar moieties (like mannose and fucose) which are coupled to delivery system while targeting to sinusoidal endothelial cell is possible using hyaluron receptor as the target receptor [5,6].",

During screening, researchers discovered PPZ-A10, a lipid with shorter C10 carbon chains. They incorporated PPZ-A10, along with cholesterol, C18PEG2K, and DOPE, to create LNPs for efficient mRNA delivery to Kupffer cells. 160 Furthermore, a range of vector optimized strategies have been developed with the specific aim of improving the targeted delivery to liver parenchymal cells. A delivery vector designed by Finn et al. 161 achieved significant hepatic editing, with around 70% effectiveness at the mouse thyroxine transfer protein gene locus. This editing reached most hepatocytes in the mouse liver, including GS+ pericentral cells. 161 In another example, the reducible LNPs composed of disulfide bondcontaining hydrophobic tails have been screened for delivering Cas9 mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA) to hepatocytes to promote proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9) knockdown. 162,163 There was a design of LNPs targeting the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) that enhanced mRNA expression in the liver, especially in RES cell types. 164 Such targeting approaches hold potential for ameliorating liver-related disorders by modulating specific cellular responses, thereby minimizing off-target effects and fostering therapeutic efficacy. \n\nUsing ligands to actively target delivery vectors to the liver and other organs of interest is a potential research area.",

Therefore, it would be a feasible approach to target nonparenchymal cells in the liver TME for the treatment of liver metastasis. Systemic drug delivery to hepatocytes has successfully led to the approval of Onpattro by the FDA. However, the delivery to other functional nonparenchymal cells in the liver microenvironment remained challenging. Surprisingly, Paunovska et al 75 found that LNPs would be delivered more potently in stromal cells of the liver microenvironment compared to hepatocytes. These findings suggested the feasibility of targeting the liver microenvironment using drugloading liposomal nanoparticles. One of the major deficiencies of the liposomal drug was that it would be easily taken by the reticuloendothelial system, which diminished its circulating time and anti-tumor effect. However, as reticuloendothelial systems were important components of liver TME, 76 the increased uptake of TME-targeting LNPs would increase the concentrations of liposomal therapeutics in hepatic nonparenchymal cells, which led to better therapeutic effects.",

This binding creates competition that decreases nanoparticle binding efficiency. Further to this, receptor expression varies between individuals and is often altered in diseased states, such as liver fibrosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, making precise targeting even more difficult. 84 When nanoparticles enter the bloodstream, they quickly acquire a protein corona-a layer of adsorbed proteins-that can obscure targeting ligands, reducing specificity and increasing off-target effects. 85,86 High doses of nanoparticles may also saturate receptors, further limiting their ability to appropriately reach target cells.",

LSECs characteristically possess open fenestrae and unique in comparison to other endothelial cells, they lack an underlying basement membrane. These open fenestrae are 50-150 nm wide pores, which cluster together to act as a two-way channel for the flow of soluble molecules through the endothelial barrier between the blood and hepatocytes [38]. LSECs are also highly efficient scavengers, capable of clearing macromolecules, such as stabilin bound oxidized low density lipoprotein, by endocytic receptor-uptake and trans-cytosis to the Space of Disse, further contributing to the delivery of metabolic substrates from the blood to hepatocytes [39,40].\n\nSince the liver directly receives and processes antigen-enriched blood from the portal circulation and is therefore highly susceptible to the influx of pathogens, the liver has a central role in immunity [41]. Towards this function, LSECs provide an adhesive niche for myeloid cells and lymphocytes and the unique structure of LSECs allows na\u00efve lymphocytes to contact hepatocytes via cytoplasmic extensions through LSEC fenestrations [41,42]. LSECs also contribute towards regulation of T-cell activation and tolerance through their antigen-presenting capabilities [39]. Further contributing to the immunological function of the liver are Kupffer cells (KCs). Part of the reticuloendothelial system, these liver-resident macrophages patrol the sinusoidal blood under physiological conditions, acting as a filter to eliminate gut-derived bacteria and microbial by-products, as well as phagocytosing spent erythrocytes [43]. Within the sinusoid, KCs interact with lymphocytes, and are key in promoting T-cell tolerance to prevent immune responses to harmless antigens, which is imperative given the continuous exposure to innocuous antigens from the gut [44].

            "text": "The capillaries of the liver are contained within its sinusoids. Blood arrives here from two vascular systems, the arterial and portal vasculature (18). The endothelial cells in the sinusoids are discontinuous, with their primary function being filtration. They lack an organized basement membrane and function in partner with tissue resident macrophages, called Kupffer cells, to remove wastes, ECs doing so mainly through endocytosis (11,18). Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) represent a heterogenous population, with distinct phenotypes in different zones of the liver, as each zone is its own unique microenvironment (142). As the liver is a key immune organ, LSECs can present antigens to both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells via MHC Class I and II molecules [reviewed in (143,144)]. Interactions between LSECs and T cells can decrease T cell activation, preventing autoimmune dysfunction throughout the body. Traditional transmigration is not always necessary for immune cell surveillance. In some instances, T cells can pass through the LSEC gaps and directly contact hepatocytes, or contact hepatocytes without crossing the LSEC barrier by contacting the hepatocyte protrusions through the fenestrations (145). Leukocytes are recruited and infiltrate the liver sinusoids in several disease condition, including hepatitis and sepsis (29). While the liver has post-capillary venules, leukocyte migration primarily occurs in the sinusoidal capillaries and does not require selectins (29, 146). However, expression of E-selectin by a small percentage of LSECs was detected in Kupffer cell (resident liver macrophages)-depleted mice and serves to recruit monocytes that replenish the Kupffer cell population (147). Another unique aspect of liver sinusoidal TEM is that junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), rather than PECAM-1, is necessary for transmigration (148, 149). LSECs also express baseline levels of ICAM-1 and vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-",

The hepatic lobule is the liver's functional unit. Blood from the portal vein and the hepatic artery traverse the lobules to the central vein. Bile canaculi transport bile from the liver to the gut. Various metabolic pathways distribute along the porto-central axis of a liver lobule. GS, glutamine synthesis; Cho, cholesterol synthesis.

Many structural and functional features have been elucidated by Braet and Wisse [54,[63][64][65][66][67]. LSECs line the hepatic sinusoids and form pores, so-called fenestrations, that are clustered in sieve plates (Fig. 2). Endothelial fenestrae range from 50 to 200 nm in diameter and differ between species (Table 1). Therefore, liver fenestrae physically restrict circulating LNPs' access to the perisinusoidal space and thus limit cellular interactions with hepatocytes according to size. Several research groups have investigated using pore-opening substances to modulate fenestrae size with limited success [64]. In addition to their structural characteristics, LSECs have high endocytic activity. A number of scavenger receptors, including stabilin-2, can efficiently sequester anionic nanoparticles [68].",

Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.",

            "text": "In addition to ligand-mediated targeting, different modified ionizable lipids can facilitate delivery of mRNAs to specific cell types or organs. One recent publication compared a series of synthesized ionizable LNPs in terms of their ability to target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs); the LNPs had varied PEG percentages and nanoparticle sizes [120]. In another study, Siegwart's group designed Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) nanoparticles by incorporating certain molecules into lipid nanoparticles comprised of ionizable lipids, cholesterol, DSPC and PEG. The resulting SORT nanoparticles tuned mRNA release based on modulation of internal charge and thereby facilitated delivery to specific tissue types [141]. Since tuning ionizable lipids based on organ or cell type may be difficult to achieve in clinical practice, targeting of LNPs with specific ligands may be the best strategy. Ligand-mediated targeting has been shown to mediate delivery nucleic acid cargos to specific cell types overexpressing the receptor [192]. Targeting of mRNA-LNPs can be achieved by introducing the targeting ligands during LNP production or by post-insertion of targeting ligands into the mRNA-LNP. Recent studies have shown that different targeting ligands can be inserted into mRNA-LNPs to specifically target immune cells, cardiac cells and liver cells. The research field of targeting mRNA-LNPs is still in its infancy, with relatively few publications available. Table 7 summarizes the different ligands utilized to target mRNA-LNPs to different cell types.",

Cellular uptake of adenoviral vectors after systemic gene transfer occurs predominantly in nonparenchymal liver cells (i.e. mainly liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells) [28]. It was demonstrated that uptake of vectors by non-parenchymal liver cells (i.e. mainly liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells) inversely correlates with transduction of parenchymal liver cells [28]. Depletion of Kupffer cells and macrophages in the liver by intravenous administration of clodronate liposomes results in significantly increased transgene DNA levels in parenchymal liver cells [28] and in increased transgene expression [28]. Besides clodronate liposomes, preadministration of polyinosinic acid, a scavenger receptor A ligand, before gene transfer has been shown to prevent sequestration of adenoviral vectors in Kupffer cells and to enhance parenchymal liver cell transduction [29]. The liver transduction we've obtained, using only 10 7 BoHV-4-based vector particles and without intervention to decrease the uptake of the vector in the liver reticulo-endotelial cells, can be considered satisfactory. This Histological examination of livers from inoculated mice indicated that BoHV-4-A-EGFPDTK the infected/transduced liver were hepatocytes and not Kupffer cells (KC) or sinusoidal endothelial cells (liver sinusoidal endothelial cell, LSEC), which are those responsible for the clearance of viral particles [17]. A possible explanation for this surprising behavior could be that the viral fraction sequestered by KC or LSEC lost the transduction ability due to inactivation by the phagocytic activity of those cells, and thus, GFP could not be expressed. Whereas the GFP expressed in the hepatocytes could derive from the remaining viral fraction that escaped KC or LSEC phagocytosis, and thus maintained infection/transduction ability.

Whereas CD31 + CD102 + SSC high cells represented a population with very high Fc\u03b3RIIb (CD32b) expression (Figure 6A, central panel), the nonendothelial population (CD31 \u2212 CD102 \u2212 SSC low ) moderately expressed Fc\u03b3RIIb (right panel). In addition, we noted that their relative amount varied to a great extent in the individual preparations. Of note, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are known to express high levels of Fc\u03b3RIIb [55]. Moreover, Lynch et al. showed that Kupffer cell preparations may contain a pronounced fraction of LSEC that mimic Kupffer cells with respect to cell surface marker expressions [56] due to a tight binding of the Kupffer cell membrane to the LSEC surface. To account for this issue, we added endothelial markers CD31 and/or CD102 to our FACS panel and found that, among the F4/80 Tim4-double-positive cells, the CD31 + CD102 + cells had a high side scatter (SSC high ), which reflected a high granularity/complexity and very high Fc\u03b3RIIb expression. In contrast, the nonendothelial CD31 \u2212 CD102 \u2212 SSC low cells showed a moderate Fc\u03b3RIIb expression (Figure 6A). This is in accordance with the data from Ganesan et al.

Besides special targeting of LSECs, there are other methods of liver fibrosis treatment that act via an indirect effect on LSECs, such as simultaneous consumption of LSECs and aHSCs (108), artificial control of the switch of the Erk1/2-Akt axis in LSECs to reverse LSECs from a proregenerative to a profibrotic phenotype (53), prevention of interstellar interaction of LSECs (109,110), selective enhancement of autophagy in LSEC in the early stages (111) and treatment of liver fibrosis with anti-angiogenic agents (112). Finally, a more detailed understanding of cytoskeletal structure and function of LSECs may help with the design of drugs that control fenestrae opening, which seems to be a simple and straightforward anti-liver fibrosis approach.",

These phagocytic cells are part of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), also known as the reticuloendothelial system (RES). They comprise 80% of the entire macrophage population within the body, illustrating their importance in host defense and LNP elimination [52].\n\nThree major elimination pathways have been described [56]. First, negatively charged LNP systems are recognized by class A scavenger receptors (SR-A) expressed primarily on Kupffer cells resulting in rapid clearance [41,57,58]. Second, mannose-and fucose-type receptors can be leveraged to selectively target LNP systems to Kupffer cells. Third, LNP opsonization by serum proteins results in MPS sequestration. Complement factors (e.g. C3b or C1q) and serum opsonins such as fibrinogen can coat LNPs with unfavourable characteristics including large size, high surface charge, or lack of PEGylation [59][60][61]. Several research groups have explored strategies to prevent Kupffer cell clearance in order to redirect LNPs to hepatocytes. Transient Kupffer cell depletion using clodronate-loaded liposomes or by knocking out the endocytic Caveolin1 gene are efficient methods in a research setting [41,43]. However, the clinical utility of such approaches is limited.",

            "text": "The mechanism of cellular uptake was well investigated, and adsorption of serum ApoE (apolipoprotein E) on the surface of LNPs was a major effector facilitating the intracellular delivery of LNPs into hepatocytes through low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (15). Although LNPs are particularly advantageous for in vivo delivery, systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics other than liver hepatocytes remains highly challenging. \n\nThe liver consists of two major types of cells, including parenchymal cells (e.g., hepatocytes) and nonparenchymal cells [e.g., liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and stellate cells] (16)(17)(18)(19). Given their physiological differences, a cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver requires a precise engineering of LNPs. For example, LSECs have the highest endocytic capacity without a basement membrane, making them the most permeable among liver cells (20). LSECs have many fenestrae, allowing the facile transport of macromolecules between sinusoidal lumen and hepatocytes. Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (21). Chen and coworkers (22) previously reported the effect of particle size on the in vivo potency of LNPs in the liver. They showed that the particle size heavily influenced the gene delivery efficacy of LNPs, as well as the stability of LNPs during blood circulation. \n\nNanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood.",

            "text": "The liver tropism limitation of conventional LNPs substantially drives the development of non-hepatic organ-and specific cell type-targeted LNPs by surface engineering with various targeting ligands. Recently, surface engineering strategies were also utilized to improve the performance and other properties of LNPs beyond the targeted delivery (supplementary Table S3). It was found that LNP accumulation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) activated endothelial cells and neutrophilic inflammation, which might induce both hepatic and systemic toxicity. To address this issue, LNPs were modified with GalNAc ligands to maximize their hepatocyte specificity while reducing uptake by LSECs (Sato et al. 2017). The results showed that systemic administration of GalNAc-LNPs carrying siRNA against hepatitis B virus (HBV) circumvented hepatotoxicity and systemic toxicity in mice with no loss of therapeutic activity in persistent HBV infections (Fig. 5A). To improve the safety profile of LNPs, the \"stealth\" shell of PEG was replaced by a synthetic non-ionic hydrophilic polypeptoid, pSar 23 (polysarcosine) (Nogueira et al. 2020;Wilhelmy et al. 2023). Analysis of in vivo systemic toxicity revealed that pSar-LNPs induced similar or lower liver enzyme levels (e.g., alanine aminotransferase/ALT, aspartate transaminase/AST, lactate dehydrogenase/LDH, and total bilirubin) and reduced cytokine induction compared to their PEG-LNP counterparts (Nogueira et al. 2020). Furthermore, a higher and prolonged erythropoietin (EPO) secretion was observed in mice treated with pSar-LNPs containing DPL14 ionizable lipid (Fig. 5B). Enhanced transfection efficiency and cell-binding affinity to monocytes were also achieved with pSar-LNPs in vitro (Wilhelmy et al. 2023). \n\nIntracellular kinetics of nucleic acid-LNPs can also be affected through the surface engineering.",

Fibrosis is an active research field and discoveries in the last years have contributed to the development of new antifibrotic drugs, although none of them have been approved yet. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are highly specialized endothelial cells localized at the interface between the blood and other liver cell types. They lack a basement membrane and display open channels (fenestrae), making them exceptionally permeable. LSEC are the first cells affected by any kind of liver injury orchestrating the liver response to damage. LSEC govern the regenerative process initiation, but aberrant LSEC activation in chronic liver injury induces fibrosis. LSEC are also main players in fibrosis resolution. They maintain liver homeostasis and keep hepatic stellate cell and Kupffer cell quiescence. After sustained hepatic injury, they lose their phenotype and protective properties, promoting angiogenesis and vasoconstriction and contributing to inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, improving LSEC phenotype is a promising strategy to prevent liver injury progression and complications. This review focuses on changes occurring in LSEC after liver injury and their consequences on fibrosis progression, liver regeneration, and resolution. Finally, a synopsis of the available strategies for LSEC-specific targeting is provided.",

            "text": "For cell-specific targeted delivery strategies against myofibroblasts, the targeted drugs circumvent several biological barriers to achieve effective drug concentration in the liver. Nevertheless, many of the targeted drug delivery systems do not necessarily be accumulated sufficiently in the intrahepatic target cell-type such as myofibroblasts, because of high non-specific uptake by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells that are mostly active in the uptake of (nano)particulates. In the liver, the drug first enters via blood circulation to sinusoids and then reaches perisinusoidal space, where hepatocytes are located. Hepatocytes, comprises of about 80% of the total resident hepatic cells in healthy liver, are strategic key cells in a wide range of liver diseases and are actively involved in the metabolism of numerous drugs entering the liver. In addition to hepatocytes, Kupffer cells (sinusoidal macrophages) accounts for 15% of total healthy liver cell population and constitutes 80-90% of the tissue-resident macrophages in the whole body. They are active in immune defenses by removing not only dangerous foreign compounds, but also many large molecular-weight drugs entering the liver via circulation [105]. Rapid uptake and complete degradation of many biological compounds by Kupffer cells make them challenging barriers to systemic delivery of therapeutics [106]. Also, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), present close to hepatocytes within the space of Disse, like Kupffer cells have high phagocytic ability which has a fundamental role in immune system and host defense. As already mentioned, HSCs are the important fibrogenic cells of liver, playing major role in liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. However, the drugs that enter the liver will not necessarily reach the intended target cell type. Since HSCs are located in the space of Disse between endothelial cells and hepatocytes, the (targeted) drug-conjugates should pass sinusoidal endothelial barriers, and escape Kupffer cells and hepatocytes uptake to be accumulated selectively in HSCs for therapeutic efficacy [107].",

Of note, however, when we stained liver the single-cell preparations for Kupffer cell markers F4/80 and Tim4 in combination with an Fc\u03b3RIIb-specific antibody, we found two F4/80 and Tim4-double-positive subpopulations that differed markedly with respect to Fc\u03b3RIIb expression (Figure 6A). Whereas CD31 + CD102 + SSC high cells represented a population with very high Fc\u03b3RIIb (CD32b) expression (Figure 6A, central panel), the nonendothelial population (CD31 \u2212 CD102 \u2212 SSC low ) moderately expressed Fc\u03b3RIIb (right panel). In addition, we noted that their relative amount varied to a great extent in the individual preparations. Of note, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are known to express high levels of Fc\u03b3RIIb [55]. Moreover, Lynch et al. showed that Kupffer cell preparations may contain a pronounced fraction of LSEC that mimic Kupffer cells with respect to cell surface marker expressions [56] due to a tight binding of the Kupffer cell membrane to the LSEC surface. To account for this issue, we added endothelial markers CD31 and/or CD102 to our FACS panel and found that, among the F4/80 Tim4-double-positive cells, the CD31 + CD102 + cells had a high side scatter (SSC high ), which reflected a high granularity/complexity and very high Fc\u03b3RIIb expression. In contrast, the nonendothelial CD31 \u2212 CD102 \u2212 SSC low cells showed a moderate Fc\u03b3RIIb expression (Figure 6A). This is in accordance with the data from Ganesan et al. [55] and Kumar et al. [46], showing that Fc\u03b3RIIb expression on LSEC is much higher than on KC.",

The LSECs line the sinusoidal lumen and their nuclei show only a weak Hoechst signal compared to hepatocytes. Remarkably, in Tie2 \u00d7 mT/mG reporter mice further cells in the sinusoidal lumen also express eGFP. Among them, platelets appear as small flakes rapidly flowing through the sinusoids, which is helpful for identification of the direction of the blood flow. These platelets can form transient aggregates (Video 3, 21-34 min).\n\nLSEC can also be stained by fluorescently labeled latex nanoparticles. Particles with a diameter larger than 500 nm are known to be exclusively taken up by macrophages. In contrast, smaller sized particles, below 100 nm, are taken up by macrophages as well as by LSEC (Fig. 3c). While fluorescent latex nanoparticles visualize both LSEC and Kupffer cells, lectins such as wheat germ agglutinin preferentially bind to glycoproteins of LSEC (Video 6).

            "text": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are the most abundant non-parenchymal cells lining the sinusoidal capillaries of the hepatic system. LSECs are characterized with numerous fenestrae and lack basement membrane as well as a diaphragm. These unique morphological characteristics of LSECs makes them the most permeable endothelial cells of the mammalian vasculature and aid in regulating flow of macromolecules and small lipid-based structures between sinusoidal blood and parenchymal cells. LSECs have a very high endocytic capacity aided by scavenger receptors (SR), such as SR-A, SR-B (SR-B1 and CD-36), SR-E (Lox-1 and mannose receptors), and SR-H (Stabilins). Other high-affinity receptors for mediating endocytosis include the Fc\u03b3RIIb, which assist in the antibody-mediated removal of immune complexes. Complemented with intense lysosomal activity, LSECs play a vital role in the uptake and degradation of many blood borne waste macromolecules and small (<280 nm) colloids. Currently, seven Toll-like receptors have been investigated in LSECs, which are involved in the recognition and clearance of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) as well as damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP). Along with other SRs, LSECs play an essential role in maintaining lipid homeostasis with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), in juxtaposition with hepatocytes. LSECs co-express two surface lectins called L-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3 Grabbing Non-integrin Receptor (L-SIGN) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin (LSECtin). LSECs also express several adhesion molecules which are involved in the recruitment of leukocytes at the site of inflammation. Here, we review these cell surface receptors as well as other components expressed by LSECs and their functions in the maintenance of liver homeostasis. We further discuss receptor expression and activity and dysregulation associated with the initiation",

            "text": "As such, commercial demand has driven work to explore how targeted mRNA delivery methods could be applied to direct therapeutic mRNA medicines to specific cell types. For example, Perche et al. showed that mannosylated lipopolyplex can target splenic dendritic cells more efficiently than control lipopolyplex [159]. Similarly, Kim et al. found that LNPs with ionizable lipids 241C10 to 246C10 can efficiently target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) [108]. Moreover, Liu et al. observed that ionizable lipids with different lengths of hydrocarbon tails or helper lipids with different charges can be used to guide organ-selective mRNA-LNP distributions [130]. Chen et al. also applied the lipid 113-O12B to formulate LNPs that can specifically target lymph nodes [36]. Researchers also observed that tuning the content of PEG lipids in LNPs causes mRNA-loaded LNPs to target different types of liver cells in vivo. The same study offered evidence that mRNA-LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid specifically target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells [108]. Additionally, it has been reported that encapsulating additional molecules in LNPs can direct the complexes to different tissues. For example, inclusion of DODAP, 18PA or DOTAP causes the LNPs to respectively target liver, spleen or lung [38,50]. Moreover, Veiga et al. intravenously injected leukocyte-targeted IL-10 mRNA encapsulated in an anti-Ly6c-antibody-decorated LNP into a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This treatment increased the expression of IL-10 in colon, consequently reducing intestinal inflammation and preventing colitis pathogenesis [233]. Using a similar LNP design, Rosenblum et al. intraperitoneally injected anti-EGFR-antibody-decorated LNPs encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and PLK1 single guide RNA (sgRNA) to disseminated ovarian-tumor-bearing mice.",

Targeting the fibrogenic programs in aHSC is central to combat fibrosis in NASH. \n\nHSCs also have distinct receptors on plasma membrane that are suitable for targeting. For instance, sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) as an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein, is selectively expressed on the surface of aHSC upon chronic ER stress [39,40] (See section 3.2 for details). Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are highly differentiated endothelial cells that lack basement membrane while retaining the fenestrae. They modulate liver homeostasis by eliminating lipid and lipoproteins in the circulation via receptor-mediated endocytosis [41]. Dysfunction of LSEC drives NASH pathogenesis by producing proinflammatory chemokines, recruiting leukocytes to liver parenchyma via interaction with their adhesion molecules and finally aggravating hepatic inflammation and NASH [42]. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) binds to its ligand, vascular endothelial growth factor D and blocks VE-Cadherin upregulation, improving lymphatic permeability upon oxidized low-density lipoprotein treatment [43]. It is exclusively expressed in LSEC cells [44], indicating it as an ideal receptor for LSEC targeting delivery. The cell-type specificity of ligand-receptor-interaction-based delivery strategies is summarized in Table 1. The comparison of the uptake efficiency, and challenges of specific delivery are summarized in Table 2.",

            "text": "In vitro internalization in primary cultures of LSECs of the three FPM formulations with the specific ligands for CD32b, CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 receptors demonstrated that specific ligand-receptor interactions plus passive targeting promoted uptake by a greater number of healthy LSECs than the micelles conjugated with their scrambled variants. \n\nSimvastatin has been shown to reduce portal hypertension through the putative reduction in IHVR by means of several mechanisms, including the induction of KLF2 expression, related to the stimulation of a vasoprotective phenotype in LSECs [11,12,33]. This effect was confirmed by the expected overexpression of KLF2 in healthy isolated LSECs treated with free or encapsulated simvastatin. We also ruled out any possible effect of the empty functionalized nanodevices acting only as an inert vehicle for the delivery of the loaded drug. \n\nIntravenous treatment of healthy rats with the different fluorescent formulations confirms that, in all cases, functionalization confers greater efficiency in entering the main liver cells than passive targeting; the capture of FPMs was clearly superior to that achieved by non-functionalized PMs, and LSECs were the liver cells with the highest uptake. Furthermore, in endothelial cells, all three types of functionalization were equally effective. In vivo cell internalization experiments also confirmed that the receptors selected as LSEC targets for our nanoparticles were also expressed in healthy Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, allowing functionalized nanoparticles to enter both cell types quite efficiently. This was expected for CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 , as their expression in the liver is elevated not only in LSECs, but also in other hepatic cell types [34,35]. However, CD32b, an Fc\u03b3R conferring LSECs the highest endocytic capacity of any cell in the human body, is known to be the most specific marker of these cells in the liver. Yet, recent studies have shown that CD32b is not only expressed in LSECs but also in Kupffer cells, with a liver level expression of 90% and 10%, respectively [36].",

Although YSK05-LNP and YSK05/12-LNP have a similar biodistribution, as shown in Figure S2, in which the lipids and siRNA of both types of LNPs were visualized by Fluo-rVivo imaging and were found to be largely distributed to liver tissues, the intrahepatic distribution of those LNPs varied and was determined by their pKa value. The intrahepatic distribution was shifted substantially from hepatocytes (with YSK05-LNP [pKa 6.50; Figure 6, upper]) into LSECs (with YSK05/12-LNP [pKa 7.15; Figure 6, lower]). However, we observed that traces of the YSK05/12-LNP were distributed into hepatocytes and liver resident macrophages (Kupffer cells). Furthermore, the biodistribution of YSK05/12-LNP to the lung and spleen was minimal (only a weak siRNA fluorescent intensity was detected in lungs [Figure S2]) and its silencing activity in lung and spleen endothelia was weak (Figure S1). The selectivity of the YSK05/12-LNP for the liver endothelium over the lung or spleen endothelium can be attributed to the special scavenging character of LSECs, which have a very high endocytic capacity and are responsible for the uptake of soluble or colloidal materials and nanoparticles that are not large enough to be phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. 16,17,20,46,47",

Sinusoidal cells are a compilation of endothelial cells, Kupffer cells (resident liver macrophages), fat-storing cells (also called stellate cells or Ito cells), and pit cells (natural killer cells). Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells comprise 70%, Kupffer cells 20%, stellate cells 10%, and pit cells less than 1% of the number of sinusoidal cells 14,16,17 . In the context of hepatocyte-directed gene transfer, we focus here on the role of Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells that constitute together the reticulo-endothelial cells of the liver. Kupffer cells account for 80% to 90% of resident macrophages in the entire body 18 . They have a diameter of 10-15 \uf06dm whereas liver sinusoidal endothelial cells are smaller with a diameter of 7-9 \uf06dm 14 . Sinusoidal endothelial cells are scavenger cells that are able to internalize particles up to 0.23 \u00b5m under physiologic conditions in vivo 19 . Larger particles are taken up by Kupffer cells 19 . Since most gene transfer vectors have a diameter below 0.23 \u00b5m, uptake of vectors by both Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells may attenuate the efficiency of hepatocyte-directed gene transfer. Most experimental work on the role of liver reticulo-endothelial cells in relation to hepatocyte transduction has been performed with adenoviral vectors. These studies support the dual role of liver reticulo-endothelial cells in hepatocyte-directed gene transfer. On the one hand, the high endocytotic capacity of these cells limits hepatocyte transduction, on the other hand, the presence of fenestrae facilitates hepatocyte transduction 20 . The relevance of these observations for other types of vectors and other modes of gene transfer will subsequently be discussed.",

Controversies in the literature regarding the LSEC phenotype pose a challenge when determining distinct functionalities of KCs and LSECs. This may be due to overlapping functions of the two cells, insufficient purification and/or identification of the cells, rapid dedifferentiation of LSECs in vitro, or species differences. We therefore characterized and quantitatively compared expressed gene products of freshly isolated, highly pure LSECs (fenestrated SE-1/Fc\u03b3RIIb2+) and KCs (CD11b/c+) from Sprague Dawley, Crl:CD (SD), male rats using high throughput mRNA-sequencing and label-free proteomics. We observed a robust correlation between the proteomes and transcriptomes of the two cell types. Integrative analysis of the global molecular profile demonstrated the immunological aspects of LSECs. The constitutive expression of several immune genes and corresponding proteins of LSECs bore some resemblance with the expression in macrophages. LSECs and KCs both expressed high levels of scavenger receptors (SR) and C-type lectins. Equivalent expression of SR-A1 (Msr1), mannose receptor (Mrc1), SR-B1 (Scarb1), and SR-B3 (Scarb2) suggested functional similarity between the two cell types, while functional distinction between the cells was evidenced by LSEC-specific expression of the SRs stabilin-1 (Stab1) and stabilin-2 (Stab2), and the C-type lectins LSECtin (Clec4g) and DC-SIGNR (Clec4m). Many immune regulatory factors were differentially expressed in LSECs and KCs, with one cell predominantly expressing a specific cytokine/chemokine and the other cell the cognate receptor, illustrating the complex cytokine milieu of the sinusoids.

Processing 30% of the total blood volume every minute, [49] the liver encounters antigens Adv. Healthcare Mater. 2023, 12,2202238 www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advhealthmat.de deriving both from the gastrointestinal tract as well as arterial blood. This allows the liver to play a key role in immune surveillance as resident immune cells must clear pathogens deriving from the gut as well as systemic circulation. This organ is wellequipped in this capacity, containing the single largest population of macrophages (residential Kupffer cells) and the greatest densities of natural killer cells. [49] On the other hand, the liver is also intimately involved in inducing tolerance to dietary and commensal antigens. Resident APCs such as Kupffer cells and liver sinusoidal endothelia cells (LSECs) are key players in mediating liver tolerance. [50] In particular, Kupffer cells clear cellular debris from the liver without stimulating an inflammatory response. LSECs present antigen to CD4 + T cells via MHC-II but express low levels of costimulatory molecules. This combination of antigen without costimulation makes LSECs a main driver in the development of T REGS (Figure 1e). [51,52] Most biomaterial drug delivery vehicles designed to target liver immune cells are nanoparticles (NPs) administered intravenously (IV) to take advantage of the high blood flow volume through this organ. NPs can be decorated with ligands that are highly expressed on liver immune cells to enable receptormediated active targeting. Liu et al. demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by modifying the surface of polymeric NPs with ligands targeting scavenger and mannose receptors [55] or stabilin receptors, [56] which are highly expressed on LSECs. The authors showed that while NPs in the 200-300 nm range accumulated almost exclusively in the liver, targeting ligands were necessary for antigen colocalization with LSECs. These and other similar studies have motivated the design of NPs decorated with sugar [53] or antibody [57,58] ligands for",

When compared to HCs, the NPCs deprived of non-adherent cells showed higher expression of an endothelial cell maker Pecam1 (platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, or Cd31), but lower levels of a hepatocyte marker Alb (Albumin). In contrast, the HCs expressed low Pecam1 and high Alb, confirming the separation of NPCs and HCs (Fig. 7c). Although the expression of Stab1 mRNA in the NPCs was not significantly different between C57BL/6J, 129S6 and DBA/2J, Stab2 mRNA was reduced in the NPCs of DBA/2J to less than 50% of those in C57BL/6J and 129S6 (p < 0.001).

            "text": "Since extrahepatic macrophages also express CD206, we first confirmed the liver-specific delivery of mFLuc-loaded LNPs with mannose. In addition, we compared a ligand-dependent mRNA delivery efficiency of LNPs using mannose-PEG lipid with that of galactose-PEG lipid. As shown in fig. S8, LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid and galactose-PEG lipid resulted in slightly bigger size than LNPs with PEG-lipid only. This phenomenon was previously reported among saccharideconjugated nanoparticles (41,42). The prepared mFLuc-loaded LNPs were injected intravenously into C57BL/6 mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Whole-body image showed substantial bioluminescence in the mice liver with mannose-incorporated LNPs and supported the liver tissue-specific expression of mFLuc. \n\nWe then examined the ability of LSEC-specific gene editing using mCre. mCre-loaded LNPs with mannose were injected to mice at a dose of mRNA at 0.5 mg/kg. As shown in Fig. 7A, ex vivo organ images also confirmed robust liver-specific tdTomato fluorescence. Next, cell type-specific fluorescence was quantified by imaging tissue sections. Notable tdTomato fluorescence was detected along the liver vessel (LSECs), and Kupffer cells rarely expressed tdTomato fluorescence (Fig. 7B). We further quantified this phenomenon by counting tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells with MetaMorph image software. As shown in Fig. 7C, 15% of hepatocytes, 70% of LSECs, and 15% of Kupffer cells were tdTomato fluorescence positive. tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells were also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (fig. S9D). Notably, compared with LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid, mannose-incorporated LNPs showed the substantial decrease of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes.",

            "text": "Notably, the hepatic uptake process dynamics of LNPs differs between the ApoE-LDLR-mediated endogenous targeting pathway and the GalNAc-mediated active targeting pathway [92]. Specifically, in the endogenous targeting pathway, LNPs rapidly enter the Disse space from the blood and gradually accumulate, then being slowly absorbed by the cells. In contrast, in the active targeting pathway, LNPs exhibit slower and more sustained cellular uptake, remaining in the blood for a longer period. Although active targeting can enhance the specificity of the mRNA-LNPs by incorporating additional targeting ligands, its implementation for hepatocyte targeting is less common due to increased formulation complexity. Currently, liver-specific delivery research predominantly employs passive and endogenous targeting. \n\nBesides hepatocytes, other cells also play important roles in liver diseases and can serve as the target cells of mRNA NPs [121]. For example, HSCs are important effector cells in liver fibrosis [122], while liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are significant in immunotherapy and a proposed target for immunomodulation [113,123]. \n\nHowever, HSCs are difficult to transfect, and the complexity of the liver microenvironment during liver fibrosis further compounds the difficulty of targeting HSCs. To address these challenges, Younis et al. designed a ligand-free mRNA-LNP containing CL15A6 lipid of hydrophobic scaffold structure (Fig. 7B) [108]. This formulation achieved successful transfection of over 80% of HSCs in vivo in liver fibrosis mice. The CL15A6-LNP had a diameter of approximately 80 nm, allowing it to pass through the fenestrated liver sinusoidal endothelium. Additionally, the LNP pKa was about 7.25, which made LNPs unrecognizable by ApoE, thus avoiding substantial interactions with hepatocytes. Further, CL15A6-LNP uptake by HSCs occurs through platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2)-mediated CME.",

This process is associated with elevated serum PDGF levels during liver fibrosis and overexpression of PDGFR\u03b2 in HSCs. The reports on receptor-ligand active targeting strategy in mRNA delivery are nevertheless scarce because of the small proportion of HSCs in the liver. Mitchell et al. studied the active targeting strategy of mRNA delivery based on the neutral anisamide, a high-affinity ligand for the sigma receptor highly expressed in activated HSCs [112]. The anisamide-LNPs actively target HSCs, demonstrating potential in liver fibrosis treatment. \n\nNPs larger than 150 nm can interact with LSECs effectively due to the fenestration size of hepatic vascular endothelium. Sato et al. [124] found that increasing the size of LNPs to 200 nm and raising the pKa to around 7.1 improve the targeting efficiency of LSECs by LNPs. Moreover, stabilin and mannose receptors were highly expressed on the LSEC membrane [125]. Roy et al. [109] demonstrated that mRNA-LNPs with a negative surface charge, achieved by replacing DSPC with distearoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DSPG), could be specifically absorbed by LSECs with the participation of stabilin receptors. Kim et al. [16] suggested that mannose-modified mRNA-LNPs could actively target LSECs and that increased PEG-lipid content (3%) in the formula could inhibit ApoE-mediated endogenous targeting. Xu et al. [113] employed mannosylated mRNA-LNPs to target LSECs and modulate the immune response in mice, successfully suppressing their allergic reactions to a peanut allergen, offering a promising intervention therapeutic approach to allergic diseases (Fig. 7C). \n\nInterestingly, Dahlman et al. [110,126] noted that altering the cholesterol structure of LNPs could regulate the ability of mRNA-LNPs to target organs and cells.",

            "text": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) represent a highly specialized population of endothelial cells (ECs) lining liver sinusoids. 1 LSECs comprise a sizeable percentage (15-20%) of the overall hepatic cellular populace, rendering them the predominant non-parenchymal cell phenotype within the hepatic milieu. 2 These cells play pivotal roles in modulating various pathophysiological processes within the liver, including liver regeneration, fibrosis, steatosis, and cancer. 2,3 Their unique location and phenotype allow LSECs to regulate blood flow, nutrient exchange, immune responses, and the clearance of waste products in the liver microenvironment. 4 Despite the recognized importance of LSECs, the identification of specific marker genes that uniquely characterize these cells remains a challenge. 5 The absence of reliable markers hampers our ability to precisely characterize and isolate LSECs, limiting our understanding of their molecular profile and functional characteristics. Besides, the current unavailability of LSEC promoter-driven Cre mice, which are essential tools for investigations into cell-specific gene activities, has created a bottleneck in the research concerning LSEC-associated liver diseases. \n\nLSECs hold a pivotal and indispensable role in maintaining the homeostasis of the liver endothelial niche, 6 orchestrating hepatocytes, 7 hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), 8 and Kupffer cells (KCs) 9 by enacting the intricate process of angiocrine signaling. Our research group has devoted considerable time and effort to investigating the regulatory function of LSECs in liver regeneration, 10 fibrogenesis, 11,12 and steatohepatitis. 13 Previously, we and other researchers have predominantly relied upon traditional and canonical EC markers like CD31, 14 VEGFR2, 15 or VEGFR3 16,17 to effectively label the hepatobiliary endothelium. However, none of them is liver-specific. Lyve1, which has been validated as a superior discriminator of LSECs, exhibits abundant expression in lymphatics and lung tissues. 18,19",

Kupffer cells mainly took up NPs (38%), followed by HSCs (29%) LSECs (29%), and hepatocytes (4%) in hydrophilic-NP-PBS treated liver. LSECs were the primary cells taking up NPs (41%), followed by Kupffer cells (36%), HSCs (21%), and hepatocytes (2%) in hydrophobic-NP-PBS treated liver. The hierarchy of NP uptake in hydrophobic-NP-olive oil treated liver was LSECs (39%) > Kupffer cells (32%) > HSCs (26%) > hepatocytes (3%). \n\nLSECs are highly specialized endothelial cells compared with normal continuous endothelial cells in the vessels [27]. LSECs form a permeable barrier, at the interface between the sinusoidal vessels and the space of Disse [28,29]. Therefore, LSECs were regarded as an important barrier to overcoming NP delivery to HSCs or hepatocytes. NP delivery to HSCs and hepatocytes can be impaired by strong endocytosis of LSECs, as well as phagocytosis of Kupffer cells, as evidenced in a previous literature review [30]. This implies a possible convenience of Kupffer cells and LSECs for targeting by NPs, due to their location and strong phagocytic and endocytic activity [31,32]. Based on our results, hydrophobic NP surface modification would be appropriate for targeting LSECs. \n\nHydrophilic silica NPs seem to be more appropriate to target HSCs rather than LSECs. The number of NP-positive HSCs in the hydrophilic-NP-PBS treated liver was significantly highest among all NP-treated livers (Figure 5B), and so hydrophilic surface-modified NPs might be more likely to reach HSCs when compared with the hydrophobic surface-modified NPs.",

            "text": "Therefore, it is speculated that the clustered NPs could not pass the LSEC fenestrae properly, due to their relatively substantial size. In sinusoidal vessels, the aggregated NPs can provide more opportunities to stimulate adjacent Kupffer cells to recruit various secondary inflammatory cells around the clumped NPs. Although silica NPs have been known to have low toxicity, aggregation of NPs seems to cause inflammation and toxicity in the liver. \n\nThe modification of the NP surface with a high affinity ligand binding to a cell-specific receptor is one of the most frequently used methods to improve cell targeting efficiency [4]. For example, coating of NP with vitamin A has been tried to target HSC in a previous study [45]. However, it was uncertain whether vitamin A-coated NP is beneficial in targeting HSCs, since the distributions of NPs in other types of liver cells were not determined in the previous study. In this study, we investigated the distribution patterns of NPs in liver by modifying surface energy. Interestingly, the size of the NPs along with the surface charge affected cellular distribution in the liver. Thus, the size of the NPs seems to be another important factor in determining specific NP delivery to target cells. \n\nThe present study describes, for the first time, the cellular distribution of silica NPs in the liver, based on the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface modification of the NPs. The distribution of the NPs is influenced by their size and surface characteristics. Modifying the NP surface hydrophobicity is essential to improving NP delivery to the liver Kupffer cells and LSECs, whereas a hydrophilic surface modification is appropriate to deliver NPs to HSCs. Targeting hepatocytes using NPs is more complicated than targeting Kupffer cells, LSECs, or HSCs because of the location and the presence of reticuloendothelial barriers to protect hepatocytes. This study provides information imperative to targeting the specific types of liver cells using silica NPs and understanding the association between NP surface energy and the distribution pattern in the liver. Regardless of NP formulation, it seems the surface polarity of NPs is a crucial factor in determining their cellular distribution pattern in the liver.",

            "text": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are specialized endothelial cells lining a liver sinusoid, which is a type of blood vessels characterized by a lack of distinctive basement membrane and the presence of small open pores, called fenestrae. 1,2) The unique permeable structure provided by LSECs enables plasma to freely access to the disse space (which is the space between LSECs and hepatocytes), whereby hepatocytes can exchange small molecules (like nutrients) without directly contacting the blood stream. \n\nAs for their functional aspects, LSECs are equipped with a variety of endocytic systems, through which they play important roles in the clearance of macromolecules delivered from portal blood, such as hyaluronic acid. 3) They are also known as a primary site for the production of Factor VIII, which is a blood-clotting factor (also referred to as the anti-hemophilic factor). 4,5) ][8] Furthermore, it has been speculated that LSEC may be an initial target of hepatic toxicants and that their functional or structural impairments can be substantially involved in drug-induced liver toxicity. 9,10) Therefore, LSECs have drawn significant attention in various liver study fields, where they are expected to provide novel insights into liver physiology/pathophysiology, as well as crucial targets for drug development or hepatotoxicity. \n\nIt has been considered likely that LSEC fulfill their unique roles through reciprocal cross-talk with other hepatic cells, specifically hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells. Having said that, it is also true that molecular entities and pathways responsible for LSEC functions, along with mechanisms underlying communications between LSEC and other hepatic cells, remain mostly unknown. To facilitate clarification of these points, especially in humans, it is likely that in vitro human LSEC models will provide essential experimental tools.",

To elucidate the cell type-specific biodistribution of 306O10 LNPs, we investigated the cellular uptake patterns within liver and spleen. \n\nTo assess cellular targeting in the liver, we evaluated GFP-306O10 uptake in primary cultures of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and hepatocytes. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of GFP transcript levels at 48 hours post-transfection revealed substantial uptake in LSECs, Kupffer cells, and hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig. 2D). \n\nTo characterize the immunological targeting profile of 306O10 in spleen, we employed the experimental design outlined in Supplementary Fig. 2E. GFP mRNA-encapsulated LNPs were administered via intravenous injection to C57BL/6J mice. Spleen tissues were harvested 4 hours post-administration for subsequent immune cell isolation and quantitative analyses. \n\nMagnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) was employed to isolate CD19 + , CD11c + and CD11c - populations from the harvested tissues. The level of LNP uptake within each sorted immune subset was then quantified by qRT-PCR measurement of GFP mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 2F). These findings highlight the versatility of 306O10 LNPs in targeting diverse immune cell populations, a critical feature for immunomodulatory applications.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, LSECs undergo the loss of endothelial permeability in CLD. Recently a study showed that TiO 2 NPs could restore sinusoidal permeability by inducing transient leakiness in primary human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HHSECs), which could improve hepatic recovery and upregulate drug uptake (Tee et al., 2018). \n\nMoreover, in blood, over 90% of hyaluronic acid (HA) is taken and metabolized by LSECs due to the receptors on them (DeLeve and Maretti-Mira, 2017). Therefore, HA modified delivery systems can be used for LSEC targeting in liver fibrosis. Ohya et al. developed biodegradable polyanion-coated polymeric micelles conjugated with HA by polyion complex (PIC) formation, which were taken up only into LSECs (Ohya et al., 2011). \n\nIt has been reported that rather than hepatocytes, LSECs play the key role in the initial uptake of virus into the liver in a hepatitis B virus model. Fluorescent viral particles and virus proteincoated gold particles exhibited a preferential uptake of the viral substrates into LSECs (Breiner et al., 2001). Thus, utilizing viral pathways of cell targeting in liver might be a candidate for drug delivery to fibrotic liver. Abel et al. prepared mouse CD105-specific lentiviral vectors (mCD105-LV) that can specifically transduce LSECs (Abel et al., 2013). Another work took use of the endocytic uptake by LSECs to deliver antigens to the liver (Liu et al., 2021). The tolerogenic nanoparticles (TNPs) attached ApoBP ligand presented antigens to regulate the differentiation of naive T-cells into Tregs (Figure 5). It seems that LSECs-targeting antigen delivery might be a hopeful candidate in the immune regulation for autoimmune disorders, such as autoimmune hepatitis.",

            "text": "Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells (LSECs) play a crucial role in maintaining liver homeostasis, regulating immune responses, and fibrosis in liver diseases. This review explores the unique functions of LSECs in liver pathology, particularly their roles in immune tolerance, antigen presentation, and the modulation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) during fibrosis. LSECs act as key regulators of immune balance in the liver by preventing excessive immune activation while also filtering antigens and interacting with immune cells, including Kupffer cells and T cells. Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease(MAFLD) is significant because it can lead to advanced liver dysfunction, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. The prevalence of Metabolic Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) is increasing globally, particularly in the United States, and is closely linked to rising rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to prevent severe outcomes, highlighting the importance of studying LSECs in liver disease. However, during chronic liver diseases, LSECs undergo dysfunction, leading to their capillarization, loss of fenestrations, and promotion of pro-fibrotic signaling pathways such as Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), which subsequently activates HSCs and contributes to the progression of liver fibrosis. The review also discusses the dynamic interaction between LSECs, HSCs, and other hepatic cells during the progression of liver diseases, emphasizing how changes in LSEC phenotype contribute to liver scarring and fibrosis. Furthermore, it highlights the potential of LSECs as therapeutic targets for modulating immune responses and preventing fibrosis in liver diseases. By restoring LSECs\u2019 function and targeting pathways associated with their dysfunction, novel therapies could be developed to halt or reverse liver disease progression. The findings of this review reinforce the importance of LSECs in liver pathology and suggest that they hold significant promises as targets for future treatment strategies aimed at addressing chronic liver diseases.",

The Nanoprimer is a liposome designed with specific physicochemical properties to transiently occupy the KC and LESC, which does not contain or encapsulate any drug nor have any moieties attached to its surface. Besides, the Nanoprimer was optimized to be larger than the fenestrae of the liver capillaries (hydrodynamic diameter over 230 nm) to prevent it from passing through the Space of Disse, thus hindering its ability to interact with hepatocytes. The study demonstrated that the pretreatment of mice with the Nanoprimer decreased the LNPs' uptake by the MPS and prolonged the circulation time of LNPs. By accumulating rapidly in the liver cells, the Nanoprimer improved the bioavailability of the LNPs encapsulating human erythropoietin (hEPO) mRNA or factor VII (FVII) siRNA, leading respectively to more hEPO production (by 32%) or FVII silencing (by 49%).",

            "text": "ECs are highly specified endothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids. Unlike other endothelial cells, LSECs are fenestrated, which allows them to facilitate the transfer of molecules, including LNPs, into the space of Disse, where hepatocytes reside. These fenestrae, small pores around 100-140 nm in diameter, make LSECs highly permeable to small nanoparticles. 34 Once in proximity to hepatocytes, LNPs that successfully bind to ApoE can be taken up via LDL receptors, promoting functional delivery. ApoE is essential for LNPs to target the liver. \n\nIn the bloodstream, ApoE binds to LNPs, forming a protein corona that allows them to be recognized by LDL receptors on hepatocytes. 22,43 The lipid composition of LNPs (e.g., ionizable and helper lipids) also influences ApoE binding efficiency. 22,44 In addition, the efficiency of ApoE-coated LNP uptake is influenced by hepatocyte zonation, as metabolic and cellular differences across liver zones determine the fate and distribution of LNPs. 16 wever, LNPs that fail to bind ApoE or that become coated with other serum proteins may be redirected to non-target cells or cleared by the spleen. 24,36 LSECs also express a variety of receptors, including scavenger receptors (e.g., stabilin-1 and stabilin-2) 45 and mannose receptors, 23 that can mediate the active uptake of functionalized LNPs. For MacParland et al. 34 example, mannose-modified LNPs can selectively bind LSECs, improving RNA therapeutic delivery. 23 In addition, the slow blood flow in liver sinusoids allows more time for LNPs to interact with LSECs. 15 Finally, altering the size, charge, and surface chemistry of LNPs can optimize their interaction with LSECs, with smaller particles (<100 nm) more readily translocated through the fenestrae and internalized. 23",

            "text": "However, the endocytic capacity of galactose-terminated glycoproteins is much lower in LSECs than in hepatocytes or Kupffer cells (Magnu \u00b4sson & Berg, 1993). Thus, galactose-modified delivery systems are suitable for targeting hepatocytes (Morimoto et al., 2003;Popielarski et al., 2005) and Kupffer cells via galactose particle/fucose receptors (Dong et al., 2008). In fact, several delivery systems have been synthesized to deliver therapeutic molecules into Kupffer cells, including galactosylated lowmolecular-weight chitosan (Dong et al., 2009). Shimada et al. (1997) also reported that biodegradable PEG-conjugated galactolipids show greater targeting (490%) for Kupffer cells when intravenously injected into rats. Thus, several galactose-modified delivery systems show greater transfection efficiency in the liver than in other organs (e.g. lung, kidney, heart and spleen) (Hisayasu et al., 1999;Nishikawa et al., 2000). However, these results do not mean greater transfection efficiency for hepatocytes than other hepatic cells. \n\nThe uptake of galactose-modified nanoparticles by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells is influenced by the sizes of these nanoparticles. For example, slightly anionic, galactose-PEGylated nanoparticles of 50 nm in diameter efficiently target hepatocytes, but nanoparticles of 140 nm in diameter are more selective for Kupffer cells (Popielarski et al., 2005). Moreover, when galactosylated low-molecular-weight chitosan/oligodeoxynucleotide complexes of 150 nm in diameter were intravenously injected into mice, Kupffer cells (50.6%) and LSECs (33.2%) endocytosed 483% of the complexed molecules, whereas hepatocytes endocytosed only 16.2% of the complexed molecules (Dong et al., 2008).",

LSECs further act as a platform for adhesion of various liver-resident immune cell populations such as Kupffer cells, innate lymphoid cells or liver dendritic cells. In addition to having an extraordinary scavenger function, LSECs possess potent immune functions, serving as sentinel cells to detect microbial infection through pattern recognition receptor activation and as antigen (cross)-presenting cells. LSECs cross-prime naive CD8 T cells, causing their rapid differentiation into memory T cells that relocate to secondary lymphoid tissues and provide protection when they re-encounter the antigen during microbial infection. Cross-presentation of viral antigens by LSECs derived from infected hepatocytes triggers local activation of effector CD8 T cells and thereby assures hepatic immune surveillance. The immune function of LSECs complements conventional immune-activating mechanisms to accommodate optimal immune surveillance against infectious microorganisms while preserving the integrity of the liver as a metabolic organ.",

            "text": "For therapeutic nanomaterials, tissue-targeted delivery systems can significantly reduce toxicity and improve bioavailability. Currently, liver-targeted delivery systems are commonly used for the treatment of NAFLD and chronic HBV infection. 36 The absence of a basement membrane and the presence of fenestrations in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) provide the physiological basis for the passive accumulation of nanomaterials in the liver. Besides, the mononuclear phagocyte system, including Kupffer cells, monocytes, and splenic macrophages, helps sequester the majority of nanomaterials in the liver. 37 hagocytosis by the mononuclear phagocyte system is influenced by the route of administration and the properties of nanomaterials, such as size, shape, charge, and rigidity. Nanomaterials ranging from 50 to 250 nm in size, with nonspherical shapes, high charge density, and surface hydrophobicity, are more likely to be captured by the hepatic mononuclear phagocyte system upon entering the bloodstream, thereby facilitating hepatic accumulation. 37,38 This effect may result from opsonization, in which opsonins bind to the nanomaterials, enhancing their recognition and uptake by macrophages. 38 dditionally, albumin-based formulations target the liver by leveraging the transcytosis of albumin through LSECs, facilitating precise delivery to the space of Disse. 39 Moreover, long half-life, high stability, and capacity to bind hydrophobic molecules enhance albumin's accumulation, making it an effective drug delivery vehicle for liver diseases. 40 everal characteristics of the liver can be utilized for active liver-targeted strategies: 36 (1) The larger pore size of LSECs compared to capillary walls in most tissues: Macromolecules can enter liver tissue and accumulate. For instance, the accumulation of dextran in the liver is tissue-dependent based on molecular weight.",

            "text": "The non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) consist of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells (KCs) and stellate cells (169). The nutrient-rich blood from the hepatic portal vein and oxygen-rich blood from the hepatic artery meet in the sinusoidal blood vessels (170). During this process, the LSECs of the sinusoidal vessels assist in clearing macromolecular waste and regulating hepatic vascularity (171). Other than most endothelial cells, LSECs possess a higher endocytic ability. As an example, 45% of all pinocytic vesicles are attributed to LSECs and LSECs are shown to be more efficient in absorbing/internalizing circulating antigens than dendritic cells or macrophages of the spleen and Kupffer cells and dendritic cells of the liver (172)(173)(174). LSECs are able to filter the blood via selective exchange of molecules in the blood and underlying stellate and hepatocytes due to their fenestrated morphology (175). Due to the lack of a basement membrane or basal lamina, there is direct access to the space of Disse (perisinusoidal space) for interaction between blood and hepatocyte or stellate cells (176). The LECs fenestrae have the ability to change their diameter according to as a response to the cellular microenvironment (177). The fenestrae are maintained by cooperative paracrine and autocrine signalling of hepatocytes and stellate cells. VEGF, NO and serotonin pathways have been shown to be involved in the maintenance and regulation of contraction or dilation of the fenestrae (178,179). Loss or reduction fenestrae number in LSECs is referred to as defenestration (177). Defenestration leads to reduced hepatic uptake of lipoproteins which can cause hypolipoproteinemia (180). Subsequently, defenestration is involved in multiple disorders like liver fibrosis, atherosclerosis, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",

The liver was then cannulated via the portal vein and perfused with buffer solution for 5 min at 7 mL/min, followed by collagenase solution for 7 min at 7 mL/min in situ. The liver was removed, and dissociated cells were filtered through a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer and collected. Hepatocytes were isolated by three 3 min centrifugations at 50\u00d7g. Nonviable hepatocytes were removed by collecting the cell pellet under 50% Percoll solution after 5 min of centrifugation at 50\u00d7 g. LSECs were collected from the initial hepatocyte isolation supernatant. They were then purified by collecting cells between the layers of two-step Percoll gradient (25%, 45%) after centrifugation at 1350\u00d7 g for 30 min. Kupffer cells were removed from the LSEC fraction by selective adherence to plastic using two 8 min incubations at 37 \u2022 C in RPMI-1640 media.

            "text": "The liver constitutes one of the largest organs of the body and exerts numerous essential functions associated with digestion, metabolism, protein synthesis and the detoxification of xenobiotics [1]. Hence, the liver is a primary site of various metabolic disorders [2]. Further, chronic hepatitis [3] and metabolic disorders [4] may result in liver fibrosis or even cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is considered a premalignant state as 80% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most frequent type of primary liver cancer, develop in cirrhotic livers [5]. In addition, due to anatomical reasons, the liver is also a primary organ of tumor metastasis [6]. The therapy of liver tumors is complicated by the default tolerogenic state of liver-resident non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) [7]. Hence, the liver, with its different specialized cell types, is a highly interesting target organ for cell-type-addressing nanoformulations, thereby avoiding adverse side effects, such as systemic toxicity [8]. However, as outlined in this review, the structure of the liver has proven a challenge for nano-based cell-targeting approaches. \n\nOn the one hand, the liver acts as a biological barrier and may sequestrate the vast majority of administered nanoparticles (NPs) from the bloodstream, when particles (>6 nm) are not eliminated by the kidney [9]. However, on the other hand, within the liver NPs need to pass several biological barriers hindering their successful uptake by the different liver cell populations [10]. In this regard, NPs intended to address hepatocytes need to cross the sinusoidal fenestrations of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) [11,12]. Furthermore, Kupffer cells (KCs), that constitute the major liver-resident macrophage population [13], and LSECs express various types of Fc and scavenger receptors [14] for the efficient uptake of larger KC [13] and smaller LSEC [15] macromolecules, and consequently also NPs [9].",

Uptake by KCs can reduce delivery to other liver sites, and loss of fenestration hinders the passage of nanodrugs from blood to hepatocytes and activated HSCs.

Various waste macromolecules, continuously released from tissues in large quantities as a consequence of normal catabolic processes are cleared by the LSEC. In spite of the fact that pig livers are used in a wide range of experimental settings, the scavenger properties of pig LSEC has not been investigated until now. Therefore, we studied the endocytosis and intracellular transport of ligands for the five categories of endocytic receptors in LSEC.ResultsEndocytosis of five 125I-labelled molecules: collagen \u03b1-chains, FITC-biotin-hyaluronan, mannan, formaldehyde-treated serum albumin (FSA), and aggregated gamma globulin (AGG) was substantial in cultured LSEC. The endocytosis was mediated via the collagen-, hyaluronan-, mannose-, scavenger-, or IgG Fc-receptors, respectively, as judged by the ability of unlabelled ligands to compete with labelled ligands for uptake. Intracellular transport was studied employing a morphological pulse-chase technique. Ninety minutes following administration of red TRITC-FSA via the jugular vein of pigs to tag LSEC lysosomes, cultures of the cells were established, and pulsed with green FITC-labelled collagen, -mannan, and -FSA. By 10 min, the FITC-ligands was located in small vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm, with no co-localization with the red lysosomes. By 2 h, the FITC-ligands co-localized with red lysosomes. When LSEC were pulsed with FITC-AGG and TRITC-FSA together, co-localization of the two ligands was observed following a 10 min chase. By 2 h, only partial co-localization was observed; TRITC-FSA was transported to lysosomes, whereas FITC-AGG only slowly left the endosomes. Enzyme assays showed that LSEC and Kupffer cells contained equal specific",

            "text": "The liver is considered a crucial organ of the body due to its involvement in numerous processes, such as metabolism, immunity, detoxification, nutrient storage, among others. The liver is composed primarily of four distinct cell types, differentiated into two categories as parenchymal cells (PC, 60-80%) and non-parenchymal cells . The NPC population is composed of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells/LSECs (50%), Kupffer cells/KCs (20%) and stellate cells (<1%). The remaining NPCs are composed of lymphocytes (25%) and biliary cells (5%) (Racanelli and Rehermann, 2006). The role of hepatocytes, KCs and stellate cells in maintaining liver homeostasis is well documented. However, the LSEC, is the most understudied due to technical challenges in purification and culturing ex vivo. \n\nProf. Eddie Wisse first proposed the ultrastructure of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) in 1970, which differentiated LSECs from KCs and paved the way for future study on LSECs and elucidation of their function (Wisse, 1970(Wisse, , 1972)). A few years later, several research groups developed LSEC isolation techniques and identified their role in the uptake of various substances in vitro (Seglen, 1976;Smedsrod et al., 1984). In the early 1980s, LSECs were identified as a significant clearance site for blood-borne hyaluronan, which established their role as scavenger cells (Fraser et al., 1981). This led to an increase in interest among scientists from other discipline, such as immunology, virology, cancer, and more to further comprehend the various roles performed by LSECs. This review focuses on the detailed description of LSEC morphology and their scavenger, adhesion and other prominent receptors that define their functional roles in the hematological and hepatic systems during health and disease.",

LSEC further express several pattern recognition receptors that enable them to act as scavenger cells (see below). Moreover, LSEC constitutively express co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40) as well as MHC class I and II molecules necessary for presentation of antigen to T cells. Finally, LSEC express a number of molecules that are typically found on cells of myeloid origin such as CD4 and CD11c. It can be concluded from these observations that LSEC are endowed with a set of surface molecules that renders them competent for both, recruitment of T cells and antigen presentation to T cells. \n\nHowever, LSEC in adult mice are not derived from the bone marrow (A. Limmer and P. Knolle, unpublished observation) whereas Kupffer cells continuously repopulate from the bone marrow [18]. It rather seems that LSEC regenerate from cells resident to the liver, which is not surprising given the haematopoietic function of the liver early in life and the capacity of transplanted livers to establish micro-chimerism [19,20]. The liver has a dual blood supply with portal venous blood draining together with hepatic arterial blood into the hepatic sinusoids. Leukocytes entering the liver with the bloodstream pass through the hepatic sinusoids and are obviously in direct contact with sinusoidal cells, the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and the Kupffer cells. Intensive contact between sinusoidal cells and passenger leukocytes can occur for a number of reasons.",

In addition to functioning as vascular channels, LSECs play a role in the immune system. LSECs function in both pathogen recognition and antigen presentation. LSECs can cross-present antigens to CD8 + T cells by taking up, processing, and transferring antigens to MHC class I. The presentation of antigens produces a tolerogenic response in na\u00efve CD8 + T cells by upregulating PD-L1 on the surface of LSECs, which bind to the PD-1 receptor expressed on na\u00efve CD8 + T cells (51). LSECs also present antigens to the MHC class II complex to activate CD4 + T cells. However, because of the lack of co-stimulatory molecules, LSECs drive na\u00efve CD4 + T cells to develop into T reg cells rather than into T helper cells (52). LSECs express various receptors for angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 and 2, Tie-2 (angiopoietin-1 receptor), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. The interaction between these receptors and their ligands promotes the proliferation of LSECs and angiogenesis (53,54).",

            "text": "An increasing shortage of suitable donor livers has led to high rates of mortality of those patients awaiting liver allotransplantation. Alternatives to deceased or living donor liver transplantation include xenotransplantation, with genetically modified swine being the preferred donor animal [1]. The development of pigs, which lack the alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase gene (GTKO) and express human complement regulatory proteins (hCRP) [2], has largely eliminated hyperacute rejection of pig solid organs transplanted into primates [3]. Heart [4] and kidney xenotransplants [5] can survive for up to 3-6 months. However, baboon recipients of GTKO pig livers survive for less than 10 days, with profound thrombocytopenia accompanied by fatal bleeding being major limitations [6]. \n\nThe endothelial lining of the liver sinusoids differ from the heart and kidney in lacking a well developed basement membrane. Its organization into a fenestrated monolayer exposes hepatocytes and macrophages (Kupffer cells) directly to the blood circulation, and both cell types have been shown to play a role in platelet homeostasis [7]. However, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are also unique among endothelial cells in their ability to clear particulate matter from the bloodstream, and many scavenger receptors have been identified on LSEC that facilitate this process [8], whether purely for clearance function or as part of LSEC's antigen presentation function. Interestingly, a recent study showed that human platelets perfused through an ex vivo pig liver largely disappear from the circulation within 15 minutes, and can subsequently be found in phagosomes of the LSEC [9]. \n\nThe receptors involved in platelet phagocytosis by LSEC are not yet well-defined. Receptors which mediate platelet phagocytosis by other cell types may be expressed on LSEC.",

            "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

            "text": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), especially its advanced stage nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), has become a threatened public health problem worldwide. However, no specific drug has been approved for clinical use to treat patients with NASH, though there are many promising candidates against NAFLD in the drug development pipeline. Recently, accumulated evidence showed that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) play an essential role in the occurrence and development of liver inflammation in patients with NAFLD. LSECs, as highly specialized endothelial cells with unique structure and anatomical location, contribute to the maintenance of liver homeostasis and could be a promising therapeutic target to control liver inflammation of NAFLD. In this review, we outline the pathophysiological roles of LSECs related to inflammation of NAFLD, highlight the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of LSECs, and discuss the potential drug development strategies against NAFLD based on targeting to LSECs.",

            "text": "Cellular uptake of adenoviral vectors after systemic gene transfer occurs predominantly in non-parenchymal liver cells (i.e. mainly liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells) [11][12][13][14]. We have demonstrated that uptake of vectors by non-parenchymal liver cells (i.e. mainly liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells) inversely correlates with transduction of parenchymal liver cells [14] and is mouse strain-dependent. The transgene DNA copy number in the non-parenchymal liver cells at one hour after transfer in Balb/c mice was nearly 6-fold higher than in C57BL/6 mice [14]. This difference in scavenging of vectors between both strains is a major determinant of the approximately 3-fold higher transgene DNA levels and higher transgene expression levels in parenchymal liver cells of C57BL/6 mice compared to Balb/c mice [14]. \n\nFurther evidence for a major role of liver reticulo-endothelial cells as a determinant of hepatocyte transduction comes from experiments with clodronate liposomes. Depletion of Kupffer cells and macrophages in the liver by intravenous administration of clodronate liposomes results in significantly increased transgene DNA levels in parenchymal liver cells [14] and in increased transgene expression [13,14,22,23]. Since liver sinusoidal endothelial cell function may be modified by Kupffer cells [24,25], it cannot be excluded that part of the effect of clodronate liposomes is due to reduced activation of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells by Kupffer cells. Besides clodronate liposomes, pre-administration of polyinosinic acid, a scavenger receptor A ligand, before gene transfer has been shown to prevent sequestration of adenoviral vectors in Kupffer cells and to enhance parenchymal liver cell transduction [26].",

In the fitusiran group, 40 (51%) of 79 treated participants had no treated bleeds compared with 2 (5%) of 40 participants in the ondemand clotting factor concentrates group. [86] The size of LNPs can also influence their delivery in the liver. Clinically relevant LNPs typically have a small size of <60 nm. Since the average diameter of liver endothelial fenestrae is 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm, [87] LNPs with smaller sizes can easily pass through and be selectively taken up by hepatocytes. [1,79] Conversely, larger LNPs may have a greater propensity to accumulate in other cells in the liver, such as KCs and LSECs, which is helpful for a therapy-targeting liver fibrosis. Another strategy to enable LNP delivery to specific cell types in the liver is to engineer the LNP with surface-targeting ligands. For example, LSECs express high levels of mannose receptors on their surface, which can be used to selectively deliver LNP-mRNA to these cells by modifying the LNP surface with mannose. [88] Also, by adding a targeting peptide, LNPs have exhibited higher selectivity to HCC cells over normal liver tissues in an in vitro study. [89] Overall, the growing field of LNPs could accelerate the current challenges in liver disease treatment.",

            "text": "The liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) represents a unique class of endothelial cells distinct from the other classes of endothelial cells in the body [21]. Functionally, this cell type has an endocytic machinery capable of very efficient uptake and degradation of physiological and foreign waste material, including all major classes of biological macromolecules and nanoparticles (< 200 nm) [22]. The endocytic capacity of LSECs greatly exceeds that of other types of endothelial cells. The signature feature of LSECs as scavenger cells, responsible for the removal of potentially dangerous macromolecules from blood, emphasizes their importance in liver immunity. \n\nFormyl peptides labeled with FITC or other fluorochromes are increasingly used to identify cells involved in inflammatory reactions since it is generally believed that this probe, when administered i.v., will effectively target cells that carry the receptor for formyl peptides, FPR1, in the same way as unconjugated fNLPNTL. We found it important to verify this hypothesis, and devised a series of experiments to study whether FITC-fNLPNTL exhibits the same in vivo distribution pattern as fNLPNTL. In order to trace the injected ligand, the fNLPNTL was radioiodinated by two distinct features, through labeling the FITC group of the FITC-fNLPNTL conjugate or directly to a tyrosine group within fNLPNTL. \n\nFirst, we investigated the fate of fNLPNTL administered i.v. into mice. Interestingly, FITC-fNLPNTL was taken up in the liver to a much greater extent than was fNLPNTL. Moreover, the unconjugated peptide distributed to blood and carcass to a much higher extent than its FITC-labeled counterpart (Fig 2). We next wanted to identify the receptors involved in the uptake of the conjugated and unconjugated peptides. First, we established that FPR1, on both mRNA and protein basis was present in the liver and isolated liver cells of mice and humans.",

            "text": "an intermediate near-neutral net charge [153]. Consistent with the above findings, highly positive LNPs targeted the lungs and highly negative LNPs targeted the spleen, while intermediate charge levels predominantly targeted the liver. Liver targeting has been shown to depend on Apo-E binding to near-neutral liposomes or LNPs [154], which does not occur for negatively charged liposomes [155].\n\nNotably, all of the above charge-mediated targeting studies have been done using IV administration and the routes typically used for vaccination, such as the intramuscular or intradermal routes, have not been examined. Most studies that analyze expression after intramuscular injection do, however, detect the systemic trafficking of mRNA LNPs, which are rapidly and strongly expressed in the liver, at the same time as they are expressed in muscle and draining lymph nodes [97,156,157]. These particular LNPs therefore seem to enter the vasculature and are subsequently expressed in liver hepatocytes due to passive ApoE-mediated targeting, which is not surprising since they were designed for hepatocyte targeting. This systemic distribution and expression of immunogens could, however, generate systemic cytokines, complement activation and lead to other potential undesirable effects that could amplify the frequency or severity of adverse events and/or impair immune response generation. Finally, only a limited number of studies have been carried out with ligand-mediated targeting of LNPs. Lung endothelial cell targeting was achieved by conjugating CD31 (PECAM) antibodies to the LNP and injecting intravascularly [158]. The liver hepatocyte-directed LNP then became largely redirected to the lung. A similar approach using a VCAM ligand successfully targeted LNPs to inflamed regions of the brain and alleviated TNF-\u03b1-induced brain edema [159]. Dendritic cells in vitro were also more efficiently transfected using a mannosylated liposome, which may be a strategy applicable to vaccination [160]. Higher throughput screening methods to identify ligands targeting specific cell types have also been developed and may be applicable for the targeting of specific dendritic cell subsets [161",

            "text": "Although reducing hepatic uptake of parenterally administered LNP has been a challenge, alterations in LNP composition and physicochemical characteristics have been shown to influence liver distribution (Table 1). The LNP surface charge has been shown to influence the liver accumulation of intramuscularly administered LNP, with negatively charged LNP having greater liver uptake [4]. Similarly, the inclusion of neutral lipids to LNP resulted in liver tropism following intravenous injection, while the addition of cationic lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in a shift to lung uptake and the addition of negatively charged lipids to net neutral LNP resulted in splenic uptake [17]. The addition of oxidized cholesterol to LNP shifted liver uptake away from hepatocytes and into the hepatic microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and hepatic endothelial cells [30]. The inclusion of constrained lipids in LNP, such as adamantyl phospholipids, has also been shown to target hepatic Kupffer cells [31]. Apart from charge and composition, size can also influence hepatocyte transfection, presumably due to the hepatic architecture, with narrow sinusoidal fenestration pores of ~100 nm [32]; LNP > ~200 nm dramatically diminishes hepatocyte transfection [33]. \n\nAlternatives to LNP modification have also been attempted to prevent liver accumulation. In one example, a liposome termed a \"nanoprimer\" was used to saturate Kupffer cell-mediated clearance 10 min prior to administration of LNP containing Cy5.5 labeled human erythropoietin mRNA or factor VII siRNA, resulting in increased systemic fluorescence at 1 h post-dose and increased erythropoietin or decreased factor VII protein expression at 48 h post-dose, respectively [34]. Clever mRNA modifications have also been made in an attempt to reduce off-target liver expression by the design of hepatic-selective, suppressive micro-RNA (miRNA) binding sites into the untranslated regions of the mRNA [35].",

            "text": "The selectivity of the YSK05/12-LNP for the liver endothelium over the lung or spleen endothelium can be attributed to the special scavenging character of LSECs, which have a very high endocytic capacity and are responsible for the uptake of soluble or colloidal materials and nanoparticles that are not large enough to be phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. 16,17,20,46,47 It is noteworthy that, despite the improved activity in LSECs, the YSK05-LNP was still stronger in hepatocytes than the YSK05/12-LNP in LSECs. This can be attributed to the difference in the type of siRNA used to target hepatocytes or LSECs (siFVII vs siCD31, respectively), which might have different gene silencing strengths. Furthermore, differences in cellular properties between hepatocytes and LSECs should also be considered. Another possible explanation is related to the low uptake of YSK05/12-LNP by Kupffer cells due to its cationic charge. However, this uptake is small compared with that of YSK12-C4-LNP (pKa 8.00), which could be taken up by Kupffer cells due to its highly cationic charge, and despite its strong activity in vitro, 36 it lost its activity completely in vivo. Moreover, the weak activity of the YSK12-C4-LNP could be attributed to its rapid disintegration in the blood stream and the leakage of siRNA. As shown in Figure S2, the siRNA was rapidly eliminated and detected in the kidney at 30 minutes after intravenous administration, possibly due to the high cationic charge of the LNP and its recognition by the reticuloendothelial system, while the lipids derived from LNPs were mostly distributed to lungs and, to a lower extent, the liver.",

            "text": "The high permeability of capillary endothelium to water, macromolecules, and solutes is explained by the presence of special transporting systems, including channels, vesicles, diaphragms, and fenestrae. In fact, liver sinusoids are one of the most permeable microvessels in the body, and millions of large fenestrae (>100 nm) can be found along the sinusoidal surface [5]. Lining their lumen, there is a specialized subtype of endothelial cell named LSECs (liver sinusoidal endothelial cells). LSECs comprise around ~20% of liver cells [6] and are located at the interface between hepatic microcirculation and hepatocytes. On the luminal side, LSECs continuously survey blood from the gastrointestinal tract, exerting a close relationship with resident liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) and all leukocytes that are in the circulation or those that constantly patrol liver vessels (including monocytes, NK, and NKT cells). On the other side (facing the Disse Space), LSECs interact with hepatic stellate cells (or Ito cells) and hepatocytes. This is crucial for liver metabolism since LSECs are a permeable barrier that mediates the exchange, active uptake, and degradation of circulating molecules [7]. LSECs also possess a high endocytic capacity, and numerous endocytic vesicles can be found under homeostatic conditions in their cytoplasm. It is well accepted that LSECs may perform effective uptake of a wide variety of substances from the blood by receptor-mediated endocytosis [8]. Therefore, considering the absence of a regular basal lamina together with the presence of fenestrae, LSECs are different and unique from any other type of endothelial cell in the body. \n\nConsidering that liver hemodynamic features and vascular architecture create a niche for blood surveillance, it is not surprising that [9] the hepatic environment harbors one of the largest populations of immune cells in the body.",

            "text": "s, conventional NPs are recognized as foreign bodies, and rapidly captured by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) through the regulation of plasma proteins after administration, but the liver targeting NPs may serve as a beneficial nanomaterial for liver disease therapy [12], as shown in Fig. 2. As NPs move along the sinusoid, they will come into contact with sinusoidal endothelial cells, Kupffer cells (KCs), T cells, and DCs. Depending on their physicochemical properties, NPs have better access through fenestrae to enter the space of Disse and contact with hepatocytes. The smaller NPs may transcytose through the hepatocytes and enter the bile duct through bile canaliculi. Conventional NPs are captured by the RES. Larger size, negatively charged, or hydrophilic NPs are preferentially swallowed by KCs via phagocytosis; NPs less than 200 nm NP or with negative surface charge or hydrophobicity tend to be taken up by endothelial cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis with a high exposure dose or long time. NPs less than 50 nm NP or hydrophilic NPs could be captured by stellate cells. Smaller   NPs with positive surface charge or hydrophobic NPs are  preferentially taken up by hepatocytes through clathrinmediated endocytosis. Hence, we reviewed the latest advances in remodeling the hepatic fibrotic microenvironment with emerging monotherapies, with particular attention to remodeling immune regulation, metabolic reprogramming, ECM deposition, and hypoxia-induced vascular production in the hepatic fibrotic microenvironment. Finally, the nanoadvantages and challenges of engineered NPs targeting APCs or directly targeting T cells for immunotherapy of liver fibrosis were highlighted in this review.",

            "text": "To achieve this goal, they developed mannose-modified LNPs that encapsulated mRNA-expressing peanut epitopes designed to enter the liver via biodistribution and be taken up by LSECs, which in turn induced a tolerance effect that effectively inhibited allergic reactions to crude peanut allergen extracts. This tolerance effect was accompanied by the inhibition of the Th2 immune response, IgE antibody production, and degranulation of mast cells. Kim et al. [93] reported the development of engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of mRNA to hepatocytes and LSECs. They evaluated the effects of the particle size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs on the specific delivery of mRNA in the liver. Targeted mRNA delivery to the LSECs was further explored by introducing active ligands. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [94] utilized the dimensions of fenestrations in the liver and administered nanoprimers to mice as a pretreatment. This strategy aimed to reduce LNP uptake, consequently enhancing LNP accumulation in cell types other than Kupffer cells and LSECs. \n\nLiver-targeted LNPs show potential for the treatment of hereditary diseases such as hemophilia and acute intermittent porphyria [95]. Studies have identified antithrombin (AT) as a negative regulatory factor that can be targeted to treat hemophilia A and B [96,97]. Restoration of the coagulation system balance has been achieved using the RNA interference drug fitusiran to selectively inhibit AT [98]. However, it is not a long-acting medication and requires repeated injections [99]. To seek long-acting treatments for hemophilia, Han et al. [69] developed LNPs encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and mouse AT-targeted singleguide RNA (sgRNA) for AT gene editing and inhibition. They evaluated therapeutic efficacy in hemophilia A and B mouse models by assessing thrombin generation mediated by mAT gene editing.",

            "text": "By restricting FVIII expression to endothelial cells, largely LSEC, using a LV platform containing the transgene under the control of the vascular endothelial cadherin (VEC) promoter, our group has recently treated the bleeding phenotype in three different strains of immunocompetent hemophilia A mice and prevented the formation of anti-FVIII immune responses after immunization with FVIII several weeks after gene transfer. Further, this strategy was able to revert inhibitor titers in hemophilia A mice previously immunized with FVIII, while the depletion of Tregs in treated mice resulted in a temporary loss of tolerance with the formation of anti-FVIII antibodies, suggesting a role for LSEC in FVIII-specific tolerance The drawing shows a schematic reproduction of a liver sinusoid. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are cells delineating the hepatic sinusoids. Hepatocyes are separated from endothelial cells by the space of Disse. Stellate cells (SCs) are contained in the space of Disse. On the side facing the bloodstream are found hepatic macrophages, also known as Kupffer cells (KCs), in tight contact with LSECs, and dendritic cells (DCs). Liver-directed gene transfer can be achieved using vector containing cell-type-specific promoter, such as albumin (Alb), Transthyretin (TTR), human alpha antitrypsin (hAAT) promoters for hepatocytes, and ICAM2, Flk1, Tie2, and VEC for endothelial cells. Envelopes of viral vectors can be modified to restrict vector entry to specific cell types, such as the GP64 glycoprotein from baculovirus and hepatitis B virus envelope (HBVE) for hepatocyte transductional targeting.",

For instance, a means of passing through the LSECs or evading phagocytosis of NPs by Kupffer cells is still considered essential for the successful and efficient NP delivery to HSCs in liver fibrosis. \n\nAll types of NPs were not delivered properly to the hepatocytes (Figure 6), suggesting that both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface modifications are not successful strategies for specific targeting of NPs to the hepatocytes. Considerable emphasis has been placed on NP or drug delivery to hepatocytes in treating liver cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma [32,39]. To date, several attempts have been made to design NPs for delivery to the hepatocytes, such as galactosylated chitosan NPs [40], galactose derivative-modified NPs [41], and dye-functionalized theranostic NPs [42]. Most of the NPs are actively targeting specific surface receptors of hepatocellular carcinoma cancer cells, for example, the asialoglycoprotein receptor, ganglioside GM1 receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, and integrin receptor [39]. However, considering the presence of these receptors in non-targeted normal cells, it is still very important to improve the specificity of NP targeting to hepatocellular carcinoma cells and hepatocytes. The effects of hydrophobic or hydrophilic surface modification in NP delivery to hepatocytes have not yet been fully studied.",

However, targeted modulation of LSECs is still not achieved thus far. Here, we report LSECs are specifically targeted and modulated by melittin nanoparticles (\u03b1-melittin-NPs). Intravital imaging shows that LSECs fluoresce within 20\u2009s after intravenous injection of \u03b1-melittin-NPs. \u03b1-melittin-NPs trigger the activation of LSECs and lead to dramatic changes of cytokine/chemokine milieu in the liver, which switches the hepatic immunologic environment to the activated state. As a result, \u03b1-melittin-NPs resist the formation of metastatic lesions with high efficiency. More strikingly, the survival rate reaches 80% in the spontaneous liver metastatic tumor model. Our research provides support for the use of \u03b1-melittin-NPs to break LSEC-mediated immunologic tolerance, which opens an avenue to control liver metastasis through the immunomodulation of LSECs. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells are known to promote immune tolerance in liver. Here, the authors target these cells using melittin nanoparticles and show alterations in the liver immune environment and suppression of liver metastases.",

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which comprise ~50% of the non-parenchymal cells in the liver and form the fenestrated wall of the hepatic sinusoids, have the potential to act as APCs 11,12 . Usually, LSECs play an important role in the inherent tolerogenicity of the liver, mainly due to the low levels of expression of costimulatory molecules and their ability to produce IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 7,13 . This means that LSECs fail to function as professional APCs and do not drive CD4 + T cells into differentiating into Th1 cells 14 . Moreover, the unique tolerogenic phenotype of B7-HI high CD80/CD86 low on the surface of LSECs results in the imbalance of stimulatory and inhibitory signals, leading to CD8 + T-cell tolerance 15,16 . In addition, LSECs could influence the dendritic cell (DC) costimulatory function to indirectly regulate the functional states of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells 17 . As versatile non-migratory APCs in the liver, LSECs do not require the time-consuming steps involved in APC migration to lymphatic tissue, and activated LSECs could mediate the recruitment of immune cells to the liver 18 . Thus, LSECs have the potential to serve as immunotherapy target, and the selective activation of LSECs to break their tolerance-inducing properties has the capacity to awake anti-tumor response in liver. However, it is very challenging to target and modulate LSECs specifically due to the many phagocytic cell subpopulations in the liver and the lack-of-specific phagocytic receptors on LSECs.",

            "text": "Modulation of the tolerogenic APCs in the liver should be a potent strategy to activate the specific anti-tumor immune response and eliminate tumor metastasis 7 . Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which comprise ~50% of the non-parenchymal cells in the liver and form the fenestrated wall of the hepatic sinusoids, have the potential to act as APCs 11,12 . Usually, LSECs play an important role in the inherent tolerogenicity of the liver, mainly due to the low levels of expression of costimulatory molecules and their ability to produce IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 7,13 . This means that LSECs fail to function as professional APCs and do not drive CD4 + T cells into differentiating into Th1 cells 14 . Moreover, the unique tolerogenic phenotype of B7-HI high CD80/CD86 low on the surface of LSECs results in the imbalance of stimulatory and inhibitory signals, leading to CD8 + T-cell tolerance 15,16 . In addition, LSECs could influence the dendritic cell (DC) costimulatory function to indirectly regulate the functional states of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells 17 . As versatile non-migratory APCs in the liver, LSECs do not require the time-consuming steps involved in APC migration to lymphatic tissue, and activated LSECs could mediate the recruitment of immune cells to the liver 18 . Thus, LSECs have the potential to serve as immunotherapy target, and the selective activation of LSECs to break their tolerance-inducing properties has the capacity to awake anti-tumor response in liver. However, it is very challenging to target and modulate LSECs specifically due to the many phagocytic cell subpopulations in the liver and the lack-of-specific phagocytic receptors on LSECs.",

A similar intrahepatic distribution has recently been described for LNP-DNA barcode systems (composed of MC3 or cKK-E12) by Sago et al. [50]. However, direct comparison of datasets carried out with different LNP systems, including variations in the lipid composition, ionizable lipid, lipid-nucleic acid ratios, and nucleic acid type must be assessed with caution. At a dose of 0.3 mg DNA /kg, LNPs accumulated in all three major liver cell types, with higher doses in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes than endothelial cells. In sharp contrast, gene expression following LNP-mediated mRNA delivery demonstrated an inverse hierarchy among hepatic cells: endothelial cells > Kupffer cells > hepatocytes. Higher LNP doses corresponding to 1 mg/kg mRNA shifted expression slightly towards hepatocytes while keeping the same pattern. Transfection of all major liver cell types with equal potency was recently demonstrated for LNP-mRNA systems (composed of branched-tail 306O i10 ) at a dose of 2 mg RNA/kg by Hajj et al. [51].\n\nIndeed, targeting the right cell type with the right dose is crucial to developing effective therapeutics. It should be noted that the LNP compositions described in these preclinical studies deviate from those used in the clinic (except for MC3-based LNPs). Systematic studies are therefore needed to improve our fundamental understanding of LNPs' in vivo behavior. Rigorous control of physicochemical LNP characteristics such as size distribution, zeta potential, and entrapment will be crucial to assess the intrahepatic distribution of a single LNP composition with different payloads.",

            "text": "In this review, we have summarized the current knowledge about the role of LSEC as the main regulator of initial response to liver damage and their role in sinusoidal communication. The liver endothelium has a unique phenotype responsible for many of its functions. LSEC are gatekeepers of liver homeostasis because of their vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, anti-angiogenic, anti-fibrotic and pro-regenerative properties. Once liver injury appears, independently of the aetiology, LSEC are the first cells to sense and respond to it due to their privileged situation. A wide range of noxious stimuli can trigger LSEC loss of phenotype, mainly through the generation of ROS and inflammation. Consequently, LSEC acquire a capillarized phenotype, become pro-vasoconstrictive, pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic, pro-angiogenic and pro-fibrotic, and impair their liver regenerative response. Each of those phenomena has their specific contribution, promoting fibrosis progression highlighting the core contribution of LSEC in the fibrotic process. \n\nIn addition, LSEC orchestrate the liver regeneration response controlling the hepatic microenvironment by secreting paracrine factors. Aberrant activation of LSEC in the context of chronic injury promotes the loss of their regenerative capacity and balances liver response towards fibrosis over regeneration. Besides their important role in fibrosis progression, LSEC are also implicated in its resolution mainly through the secretion of VEGF and MMPs and by mediating monocyte infiltration in the liver. For all the previously stated reasons, LSEC targeting may be of enormous utility in liver fibrosis treatment. Moreover, LSEC are excellent targets for drug delivery due to their unique properties and there are many strategies able to reach LSEC and modify dysregulated pathways. Selective LSEC targeting appears as an attractive strategy to treat liver fibrosis.",

            "text": "The endothelial system of liver with fenestrae is different from other tissues, which endows nanodrugs with unique advantages for therapeutic purposes (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, modification of nanodrugs in terms of physical (including size, shape, and uniformity), chemical (including composition, charge, and surface coating) and biological (including encapsulated compounds and specific conjugated ligands) features facilitate their efficient and selective targeting of pathology sites [141,142]. Nanodrugs cannot penetrate the vascular endothelial system of normal non-hepatic tissues (Fig. 6B) and nanoparticles tend to accumulate and target lesions with incomplete endothelial lining and basement membrane [143][144][145][146]. Overall, 30-99% nanodrugs are reported to aggregate in the liver after administration into the body via different routes [147]. \n\nDue to the fenestrated sieve plates between LSECs, which range from 50 to 180 nm in humans or up to 280 nm in mice and rats [5], smaller nanodrugs directly pass the sinusoid into disse of space. Nanodrugs are also taken up by LSECs through receptor-ligand interactions and subsequently LSECs transported to disse of space if not consumed. Subsequently, nanodrugs in the disse interact with hepatocytes, leading to their uptake. Modification of nanodrugs, such as alterations in targeting molecules, PEGylation, and imparting positive charges on the surface, can also greatly increase uptake by hepatocytes [148,149]. In addition, larger nanoparticles tend to be captured by KCs after entering hepatic sinusoids through portal vein or hepatic artery due to their greater surface area for interactions [147,150]. Considering the critical role of KC-related inflammation in liver injury, enrichment of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant nanoparticles in KCs also provides favorable conditions for treatment (Fig. 6C). Notably, sinusoid capillarization occurs when LSECs are injured during liver injury, especially chronic liver injury and liver fibrosis.",

However, recent studies on the cellular distribution of NPs within the liver have revealed important contributions of Blymphocytes, hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells and especially liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). 4 The relative contribution of KCs and LSECs to the clearance of circulating NPs depends mainly on size. Phagocytosis by KCs is responsible for clearance of particles with a size >500 nm. 5 , 6 These NPs are captured by KCs either directly through endocytic receptors on their surface (such as scavenger and mannose receptors), or indirectly, after binding of serum proteins to the NP surface (i.e. opsonization) and subsequent recognition of the bound proteins by Fc-and complement receptors. 7 Compared to KCs, clearance by the more numerous LSECs (present in an approximately 1:2 ratio) 4 is largely dependent on clathrinmediated endocytosis and is limited to particles with a size <500 nm. 8 Although for LSECs the molecular mechanisms leading to cellular NP uptake are less well understood, it is known that LSECs internalize biological colloidssuch as viral particles, 9 bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 10 , 11 oxidized lipoprotein particles 11 , 12 and immune complexes 13 at a similar rate to, or exceeding uptake by KCs. \n\nAnalysis and identification of the molecular mechanisms that mediate NP clearance will help in the challenging task of translation of nanomedicines. The analysis of LSEC function is complicated due to the rapid dedifferentiation of LSECs in vitro 14 and relies, consequently, on in vivo animal models. Recently, we have established an in vivo zebrafish model for NP clearance and have identified a cell type homologous to LSECs in the early zebrafish embryo. 15 These cellswhich we named scavenging endothelial cells (SECs), in analogy with previously identified non-mammalian LSEC homologs 16 are not located in the liver (as in mammals).",

            "text": "In mice, 98% of intravenous Ad5 is absorbed by the liver [4]. Approximately 65% of the liver cells are hepatocytes, 25% are liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and 7% are Kupffer and other cells [40]. Previous work by Shayakhmetov's group showed that one must detarget Kupffer cells, LSECs, and hepatocytes to significantly reduce all Ad5 sequestration by the liver [41]. In this work, the detargeting strategies each combat only one or two of these overlapping sequestration mechanisms. \n\nKupffer cells are the resident macrophage in the liver [6] and are thought to absorb most injected Ad5 [4]. Of the detargeting strategies tested, only PEGylation is thought to detarget Kupffer cells [21]. LSECs are another mechanism for Ad sequestration from the blood [41]. There are approximately four times as many LSECs as Kupffer cells, so even less efficient uptake by these cells may significantly alter the fate of systemically administered Ads. Of the detargeting strategies tested, PEGylation appears able to reduce endothelial cell uptake in vitro [23], but it is unclear if this occurs in vivo. \n\nBoth Kupffer and LSECs reside in the blood supply feeding the liver parenchyma. Therefore, intravenous Ad5 must evade both Kupffer cells and LSECs before reaching hepatocytes within the parenchyma. In the presence of FX, Ad5 is protected from complement and partially protected from destruction by Kupffer cells, this is mediated by complement fixation [42,43]. BAP insertion blocked FX-binding to markedly reduce hepatocyte infection and sequestration [10]. The BAP reduces but overall uptake of Ad5 in the whole liver in mice with intact natural antibody and complement levels, but not in nude or Rag\u2212/\u2212 mice [13]. It is unclear if the presence of the large BAP on hexon reduces natural antibody or complement deposition on Ad and Kupffer cell sequestration.",

            "text": "Endothelial cell-specific Notch activation triggers maladaptation of LSEC and thereby aggravates NASH [24], where the adhesion molecule VCAM-1 is significantly upregulated in human subjects. Conversely, the inhibition of VCAM-1 [94] remarkably protects mice from the disease. Since VCAM-1 and Notch are also expressed in other tissues [95], specific targeting of LSEC to lower the expression of VCAM-1 or Notch is imperative for treating NASH with minimal detriments. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) effectively deliver non-coding RNAs into liver and silence target pro-inflammatory genes. LNP can be conjugated with mannose that specifically binds to the membrane mannose receptors of LSEC and ionizable amine lipid scaffolds. VEGFR3 antibody conjugated LNP delivers siRNAs to the VEGFR3 \u00fe subpopulation of LSEC, which silences the pro-inflammatory RUNX1 expression and subsequently reduces the expression of VCAM-1, attenuating infiltration of immune cells and inflammation [56] (Figure 1E). Moreover, coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) plays a pathologic role in chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and inflammation [96]. In one study, the ionizable amine lipid scaffold is loaded with siRNA against FVIII gene in LSEC. The in vivo administration effectively silences FVIII in LSEC and attenuates inflammation in NASH [97] (Figure 1D). Repurposing current drugs may also contribute to LSEC-targeting strategies to treat NASH. Ablation of group IVA phospholipase A2 (IVA-PLA2) in endothelial cell/LSEC markedly suppresses activation of HSC and deposition of collagen in liver [98]. Notably, Phase 0 clinical trial to treat plaque psoriasis with inhibitors AVX001 has validated efficacy and safety in human subjects [99].",

            "text": "The accumulation of any type of NPs in the liver is generally accomplished because of the central role of the liver itself as a main metabolic and excretory organ in the body. The presence of fenestrations in the layers of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and the absence of the impermeable basal lamina allow for rapid accumulation of NPs in the liver through passive targeting [24]. Complementing certain anatomic or pathophysiological features of the target organ, such passive accumulation also relies on nanoparticle properties including size, shape, surface charge, and hydrophilicity [25]. For instance, the passive liver targeting strategy highly depends on the size of nanocarriers as the endothelial fenestrations of liver sinusoids span approximately 50-200 nm in diameter (Figure 2a). In their study, Hirn and co-workers revealed that 50% of small gold NPs (around 1.4 nm) were accumulated in the liver after systemic administration. As the size was increased into 200 nm, the fraction of gold NPs accumulated in the liver was further increased to 99% [26]. The fact that around 80-90% of all macrophage population resides in the liver also contributes to the passive accumulation of NPs in the liver [27,28]. \n\nThe interaction of the nanocarriers with various types of cells is size-dependent [30]. Nanocarriers with a particle size bigger than 100 nm could be taken up by LSECs and Kupffer cells through endocytosis. With the increase of particle size, the uptake of nanocarriers by Kupffer cells is enhanced, leading to rapid accumulation of the nanocarriers in the liver with short blood circulation time [31]. In contrast, nanocarriers with a particle size smaller than 100 nm could avoid a capture by Kupffer cells. These nanocarriers then diffuse out of the sinusoids through the dynamic endothelial fenestrations to reach HSCs in the perisinusoidal space or even hepatocytes [24,29]. Smaller nanocarriers (10-20 nm) can be taken up rapidly by hepatocytes [32].",

Intravenously injected NPs are usually trapped in the liver owing to the special structure of hepatic sinusoids, resulting in high endocytosis by hepatocytes, hepatic endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells [62,133]. For example, LNPs were first opsonized by apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in the blood circulation after intravenous injection and entered the hepatocytes by binding to the ApoE receptor on the surfaces of hepatocytes [134,135]. Holmes et al. demonstrated that intravenous injection of ionizable lipid-containing LNPs delivered mRNA of zincfinger nuclease (ZFN) that induced the highest gene knockout efficiency in hepatocytes (approximately 80%), whereas the gene knockout  [96].

Thus, achieving high transfection efficiency in Kupffer cells while reducing the transfection efficiency to other liver cells remains a challenge.\n\nThe structure of lipids has significant impacts on the delivery efficiency of LNPs in vivo. For example, the structure of cholesterol, which is an important component for stabilizing the LNPs, may affect the efficiency of LNPs for delivering mRNA to Kupffer cells in vivo [137]. Paunovska et al. established a library of cholesterol variants and evaluated the efficiency of LNPs for mRNA delivery. Their results demonstrated that the LNPs formulated using C18-PEG 2K , DOPE, cKK-E12 ionizable lipid, and 20\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol (20\u03b1-OH)-modified cho",

            "text": "Kupffer cells are the macrophages of the liver and play a crucial role scavenging foreign materials that end up in the portal circulation [95]. They are also responsible for the initiation of inflammation by releasing active cytokines and reactive oxygen species as a response to hepatotoxin mediated injury to hepatocytes or biliary epithelial cells. In a fibrotic liver, Kupffer cells overexpress platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) which acts as the primary mitogen for activated stellate cells, hence indirectly driving forth fibrogenesis [96,97]. In the specific case of alcohol mediated injury, the Kupffer cells get activated and produce TNF- that evokes parenchymal stress response [98]. Despite advances in isolating their role in liver disease progression, the cross-talk between Kupffer cells and LSECs remains largely unexplored. In a rodent model with liver injury due to sepsis, Hutchins et al. demonstrated that the interaction between PD-1 expressing Kupffer cells and PD-L1 expressing LSECs resulted in endothelial dysfunction [99]. Similarly, Arii and Imamura demonstrated that blocking the signaling from Kupffer cells in cold-preserved liver resulted in restoration of LSEC phenotype. The study also demonstrates that an increase in ICAM-1 expression on LSECs is regulated by secretion of TNF- by Kupffer cells [100]. In an attempt to establish the communication between Kupffer cells and LSECs, an in vitro study by Ford et al. demonstrated that in a fibrotic model, cross-talk between LSECs and Kupffer cells resulted in a loss of fenestrations and increase in CD31 expression [62]. showed that disruption of Notch1 signaling results in vascular remodeling of the liver and the intact signaling ensures the highly differentiated phenotype of LSECs is maintained, thus indicating the potential as an antiangiogenesis target for liver fibrosis [106]. Several experimental drugs have surfaced over the last decade that could potentially treat fibrosis by targeting the vascular function of the organ.",

In addition, the microvascular niche of the liver sinusoids comprises Kupffer cells, i.e., sinusoidal macrophages, and hepatic stellate cells, which store vitamin A and may transdifferentiate upon liver injury to myofibroblasts, developing a cytoskeleton rich in alpha smooth muscle actin (ACTA2). [19] ith its dual blood supply and its highly specialized sinusoidal microvascular niche, the liver vasculature represents a paradigm of organotypic and segmental angiodiversity. [20,21] Previously, we have shown that microvascular angiodiversity in the liver depends on a special LSEC differentiation program controlled by transcription factor GATA-4. GATA-4-dependent organ-specific endothelial differentiation controls liver development and embryonic hematopoiesis. [22] In the adult liver, LSEC control liver function and hepatic fibrogenesis by paracrine signaling via organotypic angiocrine factors. [23] In particular, loss of portmanteau of the names Wingless and Int-1 (Wnt) factors disrupts metabolic liver zonation, whereas de novo expression of endothelial platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) promotes stellate cell activation and fibrogenesis upon endothelial GATA-4 deficiency in the adult liver. Within the hepatic vascular niche, however, the role of endothelial ALK1 signaling has not yet been comprehensively analyzed. \n\nHere, we established a preclinical genetic HHT model featuring exclusive hepatic involvement and adequate life expectancy.",

            "text": "Although LNPs can be used to efficiently deliver nucleic acids in vivo, their preferential accumulation in the liver tissue poses a significant limitation. Strikingly, as much as 30-90% of systemically administered LNPs accumulate in the liver, which would constitute a severe off-target effect if treating non-hepatic diseases [251,252]. In order to transition mRNA-LNPs from prophylactic to therapeutic applications, researchers must overcome the crucial challenge of delivering mRNA payloads to non-hepatic tissues. Considerable efforts have been devoted to guiding mRNA-LNPs to specific tissues, as selective targeting remains a key obstacle to the advancement of precision medicine and mitigation of off-target and adverse effects associated with RNA-based therapeutics [185,186]. \n\nWhile non-targeting mRNA-LNPs tend to primarily accumulate in the liver after administration via intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous routes, targeting ligands may be used to more precisely direct LNPs to hepatocytes or other specific liver cell types. For example, one study utilized LNPs decorated with mannose ligands to deliver mRNA encoding epitope peptides of Arachishypogaea protein 2 (Ara h2), a primary allergen in peanuts, to LSECs [253]. In C3H/HeJ mice sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract, the prophylactic administration of the LSEC-targeted mRNA-LNP could inhibit anaphylaxis. This effect was mediated by suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis and mast cell release of inflammatory factors. In other work, antibodies against the endothelial cell surface marker, PCAM-1 (platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; CD31) were utilized for LNP targeting [195]. Intravenous administration of anti-PCAM-1-conjugated mRNA-LNPs led to low levels of hepatic uptake accompanied by an approximately 200-fold elevation of mRNA delivery and 25-fold increase of protein expression in the lungs compared to non-targeted counterparts.",

            "text": "Due to the direct contact with blood and its carried substances, it is not surprising that LSECs possess very efficient endocytic capacity that is superior to any professional APCs within the body (19,20). To fulfill their engulfing potential, LSECs express various scavenger receptors (e.g., Stabilin 1, 2, and B1), lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1, and a range of C-type lectin receptors (21)(22)(23). LSECs efficiently endocytose soluble molecules or particles under 200 nm, whereas KCs attached to LSECs within the sinusoids cover particles and debris exceeding 200 nm (24). Together, they create a well-controlled functional dichotomy for constantly probing the liver environment.\n\nLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells constitutively carry low level of MHC-II and are able to upregulate its expression upon exposure to inflammatory cytokines (25,26). Na\u00efve CD4 + T-cells primed by LSECs under steady state differentiate into regulatory T-cells (Tregs) that lack the transcription factor Forkhead-Box-Protein P3 (FoxP3), which is normally expressed by Tregs generated by professional APCs (27). These LSEC-induced CD25 low FoxP3 \u2212 T-cells are very immune suppressive (27). This aspect of LSEC-mediated antigen presentation could provide therapeutic benefits. Nanoparticles loaded with autoantigens are taken up by LSECs and lead to MHC-II presentation and to the consequent induction of regulatory CD4 + T-cells (28). Importantly, LSEC-targeted nanoparticles were able to reverse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in vivo (28).\n\nLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells are not only able to present exogenous antigen on MHC-II but also on MHC-I and thus capable of cross-presentation ( Figure 1C) (29). Surprisingly, LSECs can cross-present soluble antigens even more efficiently than DCs (20,30). This antigen presentation, however, is only limited to a short time period due to the",

            "text": "The term \"liver gene therapy\" is often used to unilaterally describe all gene therapy approaches for treating diseases originating in hepatocytes. Although hepatocytes are the most prominent cell type within the liver, several other cell types can interact with nanoparticles and affect their performance [41][42][43][44]. It is therefore recommended that scientists expand their LNP studies to include single cell quantification rather than the whole liver. Every liver lobule comprises parenchymal (i.e. hepatocytes) and non-parenchymal liver cells (i.e. LSECs and Kupffer cells). In addition to these three major cell types, the liver consists of several other cell populations. A recent study revealed 20 discrete cell types ranging from stellate cells (also known as Ito cells) and cholangiocytes to immune cells such as B, T, or NK-like cells [45]. The human liver cell atlas revealed additional subtypes within the liver microenvironment [46]. The most relevant cell types and their implications for LNP-based gene therapy are discussed in the next sections, following the particle's journey in the body after systemic administration [47].\n\nFollowing intravenous injection, LNP-siRNA systems (composed of CLinDMA:Cholesterol:PEG-DMG; 50:44:6 mol%) accumulate in all major liver cell types (i.e. Kupffer cells, LSECs, and hepatocytes) in a time-and dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by Shi et al. [49]. When LNP-siRNA were administered at 0.3 mg siRNA/kg, similar siRNA amounts were detected in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. Doses of 1 mg/kg to 9 mg/kg siRNA delivered 50% to 83%, respectively, to hepatocytes. At 30 minutes post injection, LNPs were mainly localized in the space of Disse, whereas 2 hours post injection LNPs accumulated in hepatocytes. siRNAs delivered to Kupffer cells and LSECs were inactive, but delivery to hepatocytes resulted in efficient gene silencing.

            "text": "Livers of pig are used in a wide range of experimental settings related to problems encountered in human medicine such as fulminant hepatic failure [1,2] and graft survival in liver transplantation [3]. Bioartificial liver support systems, which combine living cells of the liver in an extracorporeal circuit, have been successfully used in first clinical trials [4]. The shortage of human organs to be used for bioreactors and the lack of safe and effective human liver cell lines have resulted in pigs becoming an important hepatic cell source. Although much work based on the use of pig liver has been carried out in the past, no studies have so far focused on isolated cell populations of the liver. To overcome this lack of knowledge, we recently published a study on high yield isolation and characterization of pig liver cells [5]. This work represents a basis for in vitro studies of the cells constituting the hepatic reticulo-endothelial system: the Kupffer cells (KC) and the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) [6]. Together these cells represent the most powerful scavenger system of the body. Most soluble or insoluble macromolecular harmful material entering the body from the gut is transported to the liver via the portal vein and eliminated by uptake in KC and LSEC. Studies in rats have revealed that LSEC are actively engaged in blood clearance of an array of waste macromolecules of both soluble and colloidal nature. Major components of connective tissue as well as other potentially hazardous products are eliminated rapidly and almost exclusively from the blood by receptormediated endocytosis in LSEC [7,8].\n\nThe endocytic receptors of rat LSEC can be listed in five categories: (i) collagen \u03b1-chain receptor (COLLAR), (ii) hyaluronan receptor (HAR), (iii) IgG Fc receptor, (iv) mannose receptor, and (v) scavenger receptor (SR).

            "text": "Liver non-parenchymal cells, or NPCs, make up for an approximate 20% of liver volume and NPCs play many roles in the liver, primarily in maintaining hepatic structure and functionality. Liver damage significantly alters both the phenotype and function of a non-parenchymal cell, significantly reducing the ability of the liver to recover appropriately. Three of the most abundant and important NPC of the liver are sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells, and stellate cells. Other important NPC types that also reside in the liver but are less abundant are fibroblasts, neutrophils, and macrophages. With regard to their interactions with NBMs, NPCs play vital roles, with NBMs interacting with varying NPCs, before reaching hepatocytes. Kupffer cells recognise NBMs as foreign materials, with NBMs being internalised through scavenger receptors and subsequently taken up by micropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated and caveolin-mediated endocytosis, and various other endocytosis pathways [35]. It is the Kupffer cells, along with the blood-circulating monocytes and macrophages in other tissues including spleen and gut, which constitute the mononuclear phagocyte system, or MPS. The MPS, also known as the reticular endothelial system, is responsible for sequestering approximately 95% of NBMs administered [36], with the rate of uptake highly dependent on NBM characteristics such as surface chemistry, size, and ligand chemistry. It is reported that larger NBMs, ranging in size from 400 to 600 nm, are preferentially phagocytosed by these cells, along with particles that are neutrally charged (i.e., PEG coatings). Studies have also shown that rod-shaped NBMs exhibit a reduced clearance compared to their spherical counterparts, potentially due to the presence of fewer accessible binding areas for interactions with macrophages [37,38]. Various studies have highlighted this phenomenon, with Lunov et al. showing that 20-nm and 60-nm SPIONs accumulated irrespective of their size in macrophages via clathrin-mediated and scave",

            "text": "Liver fibrosis due to viral or metabolic chronic liver diseases is a major challenge of global health. It is a critical pre-stage condition of severe hepatopathy, characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components and ongoing chronic inflammation. To date, early prevention of liver fibrosis remains challenging. As the most abundant non-parenchymal hepatic cell population, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are stabilizers that maintain the intrahepatic environment. Notably, LSECs dysfunction appears to be implicated in the progression of liver fibrosis via numerous mechanisms. Following sustained liver injury, they lose their fenestrae (cytoplasmic pores) and change their crosstalk with other cellular interactions in the hepatic blood environment. LSEC-targeted therapy has shown promising effects on fibrosis resolution, opening up new opportunities for anti-fibrotic therapy. In light of this, the present study summarized changes in LSECs during liver fibrosis and their interactions with hepatic milieu, as well as possible therapeutic approaches that specially target LSECs.",

At the same time, LSECs are the main source of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO), which keeps HSCs in a resting state. In the presence of liver injury, LSECs become capillarized, which can not only reduce the production of vasodilators (such as NO, cyclooxygenase, and prostaglandin I2 [PGI2]) but also increase the production of vasoconstrictors (endothelin 1, thromboxane A2, angiotensin II). This imbalance not only alters the phenotype of LSECs but also contributes to the activation of HSCs and promotes inflammation and liver fibrosis (Deleve et al., 2008;Xie et al., 2012;Poisson et al., 2017). It also secretes TGF-\u03b2, PDGF or activates signaling pathways such as Wnt\u03b2catenin, which can activate HSCs in a paracrine and autocrine manner. Due to the unique properties of LSECs, selective LSEC-targeted therapy appears to be an attractive strategy for the treatment of liver fibrosis (Gracia-Sancho et al., 2021).",

The pharmacokinetic and safety profile of fCNT in a non-human primate strongly proposes extrapolation to humans. The predominant hepatic cell type that accumulated this fibrillar nanocarbon was a professional scavenger endothelial cell in the sinusoid that performed rapidly and at high capacity. Mouse LSEC has 14 \u00b1 5 fenestrae per mm 2 (humans have 15-25 per mm 2 ) with diameters of 99\u00b118 nm (humans, 50odo300 nm) 36 . This is an avid, dedicated mammalian scavenger cell and in combination with intact biliary elimination of fCNT has yielded a very favourable biological outcome for soluble fibrillar nanocarbon in animal models. Biocompatibility has been confirmed in several model systems and now these results explain the action of the host on fCNT and add further weight to arguments for use in man. \n\nPotential therapeutic application of fCNT in humans could focus on the critical role of LSE in numerous liver disorders (for example, ischemia-reperfusion injury, sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and pseudocapillarization in the aging population) 30 . fCNT could be envisioned as a molecular platform to specifically target the LSEC and deliver therapeutic interventions (for example, small molecule drugs or RNA interference) to treat LSEC-based disorders. Hepato-targeted gene therapy strategies are being explored 50,51 and fCNT could be included as a selective delivery platform based on our favourable pharmacokinetic and toxicologic data and the ability of fCNT to strongly bind, deliver and unload siRNA in vivo 52,53 . Macrophages that express Stabilin-1 (not liver-resident Kupffer cells) should accumulate fCNT via receptor-mediated processes and suggests further investigation 54 .

            "text": "Importantly unlike the kidney (Satchell and Braet, 2009) and other organs, the hepatic sinusoidal endothelial fenestrations lack a diaphragm and basal lamina. This, plus the ability of cells to rapidly regulate fenestration diameter and number (O'Reilly et al., 2010;Cogger et al., 2016) further regulates transport. \n\nLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells also express an unusual complement of scavenger receptors which recognize, bind, and rapidly internalize an enormous diversity of extracellular ligands (Shetty et al., 2018). These are characterized into classes A to J depending on their ligand recognition and structural properties (Patten et al., 2021) and LSEC express receptors in classes SR-B, E, F, G, and H to support clearance of fatty acids, lipids ECM proteins, glycosaminoglycan molecules and apoptotic cells. This significant endocytic capability supports the immune regulation (Knolle and Limmer, 2001), metabolic capacity (Li et al., 2011) and \"waste management\" (Smedsrod, 2004) functions of the liver. In the context of this article, it is important to note that LSEC also express high levels of FcR under homeostatic conditions. The FcR on LSEC can bind opsonized pathogens and macromolecules to facilitate clearance, with blood-borne immune complexes rapidly cleared from the circulation by both Kupffer cells (KC) and LSEC (Smedsrod, 2004). Although KC may be more efficient at clearing immune complexes, the increased number of LSEC compared to KC within a liver means that their total capacity may be similar (Johansson et al., 2000). Circulating immune complex clearance can cause tissue damage and inflammation in some conditions (Johansson et al., 2000) and thus sinusoidal endothelial cells contribute to the process of clearance via the FcR interaction (Johansson et al., 2000). This may be particularly important when the load of circulating IgG is high (Johansson et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Simple Summary Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. With the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, NAFLD is becoming the most common liver disorder worldwide. More than 10% of NAFLD patients progress to an inflammatory and fibrotic form called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can lead to end-stage liver disease. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are highly specialized cells located at the interface between the flowing blood in the liver and the other liver cells. The current review highlights the recent knowledge of the role of LSEC in the development of NASH, and how LSEC change their structure and function during NAFLD progression. Moreover, the review discusses the pathogenic role of nanometer-sized particles called extracellular vesicles that mediate intercellular communication in the NASH liver. The current manuscript has a special emphasis on the role of adhesion molecules expressed on the LSEC surface in the recruitment of circulating leukocytes to the liver, a critical step in liver inflammation in NASH. Furthermore, the review shed some lights on LSEC-targeted potential therapeutic strategies in NASH. Abstract Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has become a growing public health problem worldwide, yet its pathophysiology remains unclear. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) have unique morphology and function, and play a critical role in liver homeostasis. Emerging literature implicates LSEC in many pathological processes in the liver, including metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, angiogenesis, and carcinogenesis. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge of the role of LSEC in each of the progressive phases of NASH pathophysiology (steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma). We discuss processes that have important roles in NASH progression including the detrimental transformation of LSEC called \u201ccapillarization\u201d, production of inflammatory and profibrogenic mediators by LSEC as well as LSEC-mediated angiogenesis. The current review has a special emphasis on LSEC adhesion molecules, and their key role in the",

            "text": "Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) developed in fibrotic liver does not respond well to immunotherapy, mainly due to the stromal microenvironment and the fibrosis-related immunosuppressive factors. The characteristic of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in contributing to fibrosis and orchestrating immune response is responsible for the refractory to targeted therapy or immunotherapy of HCC. We aim to seek a new strategy for HCC treatment based on an old drug simvastatin which shows protecting effect on LSEC. Method The features of LSECs in mouse fibrotic HCC model and human HCC patients were identified by immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. The effect of simvastatin on LSECs and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was examined by immunoblotting, quantitative RT-PCR and RNA-seq. LSEC-targeted delivery of simvastatin was designed using nanotechnology. The anti-HCC effect and toxicity of the nano-drug was evaluated in both intra-hepatic and hemi-splenic inoculated mouse fibrotic HCC model. Results LSEC capillarization is associated with fibrotic HCC progression and poor survival in both murine HCC model and HCC patients. We further found simvastatin restores the quiescence of activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) via stimulation of KLF2-NO signaling in LSECs, and up-regulates the expression of CXCL16 in LSECs. In intrahepatic inoculated fibrotic HCC mouse model, LSEC-targeted nano-delivery of simvastatin not only alleviates LSEC capillarization to regress the stromal microenvironment, but also recruits natural killer T (NKT) cells through CXCL16 to suppress tumor progression. Together with anti-programmed death-1-ligand-1 (anti-PD-L1) antibody, targeted-delivery of simvastatin achieves an improved therapeutic effect in hemi-splenic inoculated advanced-stage HCC model.

            "text": "Cell-specific targeting of mRNA therapies and vaccines may be crucial to developing safe and effective drug products. Conjugation of a cell targeting moiety (ligand or antibody) to the cholesterol or PEGylated lipid (Figure 3B) is commonly used to generate cell specific LNPs (75). For example, mannose has been used to target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in the liver after intravenous injection (92) as well as antigen presenting cells in saRNA vaccines after intramuscular injection (93). Antibody conjugation has recently shown promise for CD4+ T cell targeting (94) albeit with leaky liver expression. The same group targeted lung and inflamed brain endothelial cells using anti-PECAM-1 (95) and -VCAM (96) antibodies conjugated to iLNPs and cLNPs respectively. However, conjugating antibodies to LNPs is inefficient and antibody-dependent optimization is required. Kedmi and colleagues overcame this issue by designing a modular platform, referred to as anchored secondary scFv enabling targeting or ASSET, which can incorporate any antibody onto the surface of an LNP (97). This method uses a plasmid encoding an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a peptide motif resulting in lipidation by E. coli, a single chain variable fragment (scFv) targeting rat IgG, and a His-tag for purification. After purification, cholesterol is added to produce micelles, and lipidation allows incorporation of the scFv into the micelles, which are mixed with pre-formulated mRNA-LNPs to form ASSET-LNPs (Figure 3C). Potentially any rat IgG antibody can be added to these ASSET-LNPs to create targeted LNPs. ASSET also uses significantly less antibodies as each antibody is positioned in the correct orientation as a result of the scFv, unlike conventional conjugation methods (Figure 3C compared to 3B).",

However, most types of nanocarriers accumulate strongly in the liver after systemic application. Due to the default tolerance-promoting role of liver non-parenchymal cells (NPCs), Kupffer cells (KCs), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), their potential role on the immunological outcome of systemic nano-vaccination approaches for therapy of tumors in the liver and in other organs needs to be considered. Concerning immunological functions, KCs have been the focus until now, but recent studies have elucidated an important role of LSECs and HSCs as well. Therefore, this review aims to summarize current knowledge on the employment of nanocarriers for immunotherapeutic therapy of liver diseases and the overall role of liver NPCs in the context of nano-vaccination approaches. With regard to the latter, we discuss strategies on how to address liver NPCs, aiming to exploit and modulate their immunological properties, and alternatively how to avoid unwanted engagement of nano-vaccines by liver NPCs for tumor therapy.",

Kupffer cells are mainly located in the periportal areas, where they have ready access to pathogens and particulate antigens entering the liver with portal-venous blood [10,11] . In contrast to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which mainly ingest soluble materials via pinocytosis, Kupffer cells take up particulate material via phagocytosis [12] . It is relevant to note, therefore, that while colloidal gold \u2264 100 nm diameter particle size is internalized almost exclusively by LSECs, colloidal carbon is taken up primarily by Kupffer cells. This apparent contradiction is explained by the fact that blood platelets bind carbon and the platelet-carbon complexes are subsequently phagocytosed by Kupffer cells [9] . Importantly, the phagocytic capacity of Kupffer cells is not altered by the ingestion of these complexes [13] . \n\nThe ability to isolate carbon-labeled Kupffer cells from intact tissue sections using LCM offers an attractive approach to studying gene expression under diverse conditions.

Liver sinusoidal ECs (LSECs) are flat and highly fenestrated (covering \u223c20% of the surface), allowing for passage of plasma across the endothelium into the space of Disse located between the endothelium and adjacent hepatocytes (Figure 1B). The passage of plasma across LSECs is important for hepatic blood clearance of harmful compounds and drugs from the circulation. This clearance is supported by Kupffer cells within the sinusoid that phagocytose particles too large to pass through LSECs. LSECs have minimal basement membrane with a lack of an organized basal lamina and also lack tight junctions (Wisse, 1972). \n\nLSECs have an interesting expression pattern that includes the lymphatic markers LYVE1, VEGFR3, and integrin \u03b19, but not PROX1 (Table 1; Couvelard et al., 1998;Mouta Carreira et al., 2001). Similar to the lymph nodes, the liver metabolizes hyaluronan which its receptor, LYVE1, in LECS likely supports (Vrochides et al., 1996). PDPN has been described as \"scantly\" expressed on LSECs (Yokomori et al., 2010), but that study did not address if the signal came from PDPN-positive Kupffer cells within the sinusoid (Hitchcock et al., 2015). The pan-endothelial markers TIE2 and VEGFR2 are expressed on LSECs, however, the expression of some other pan-endothelial and blood markers in LSECs are unusually low (vWF, CD31) or absent (VE-Cadherin, CD34) (Lalor et al., 2006). Though it should be noted that the expressions of CD31 and VE-Cadherin are controversial since both have been reported to be either expressed or not expressed on LSECs (Lalor et al., 2006;Ding et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Metastasis of various malignancies in the liver is influenced by several factors, such as blood flow pattern, tumor stage, and histopathological subtypes. The liver is rich in blood supply, receiving the double supply of the hepatic artery and portal vein. Therefore, gastrointestinal malignancies often metastasize to the liver via portal vein circulation. The liver has a unique microenvironment composed of highly specialized resident cells, mainly including hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), Kupffer cells (KCs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), dendritic cells, and resident natural killer cells (75). As circulating tumor cells enter the sinusoidal capillary network through the portal vein system, complex interactions occur between CTCs and these resident cells. According to the existing literature, circulating tumor cells must undergo four overlapping steps to complete seeding and proliferation in the liver: Microvascular phase, pre-angiogenic phase, Angiogenic phase, and Growth phase (76)(77)(78). \n\nIn the microvascular phase, cells first encountered by CTCs are Kupffer cells and LSECs. Kupffer cells are specialized macrophages in the liver which play a vital part in removing pathogens and induction of local immunity (79). Although Kupffer cells can clear CRC cells in hepatic sinuses by direct phagocytosis and dectin-2 mediated phagocytosis in the early stage of metastasis (80,81), tumor cells lucky enough to escape immune attack may benefit from it in subsequent colonization and proliferation. In recent years, tumor-derived exosomes have also been shown to promote the formation of liver premetastatic niches for CRCLM by interacting with Kupffer cells. Angiopoietin-like protein-1(ANGPTL-1) can reprogram the secretion pattern of Kupffer cells and enormously reduce the expression of MMP9, thereby preventing leakage of sinusoidal vessels.",

            "text": "Liver sinusoids are lined by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), which represent approximately 15 to 20% of the liver cells, but only 3% of the total liver volume. LSEC have unique functions, such as fluid filtration, blood vessel tone modulation, blood clotting, inflammatory cell recruitment, and metabolite and hormone trafficking. Different subtypes of liver endothelial cells are also known to control liver zonation and hepatocyte function. Here, we have reviewed the origin of LSEC, the different subtypes identified in the liver, as well as their renewal during homeostasis. The liver has the exceptional ability to regenerate from small remnants. The past decades have seen increasing awareness in the role of non-parenchymal cells in liver regeneration despite not being the most represented population. While a lot of knowledge has emerged, clarification is needed regarding the role of LSEC in sensing shear stress and on their participation in the inductive phase of regeneration by priming the hepatocytes and delivering mitogenic factors. It is also unclear if bone marrow-derived LSEC participate in the proliferative phase of liver regeneration. Similarly, data are scarce as to LSEC having a role in the termination phase of the regeneration process. Here, we review what is known about the interaction between LSEC and other liver cells during the different phases of liver regeneration. We next explain extended hepatectomy and small liver transplantation, which lead to \u201csmall for size syndrome\u201d (SFSS), a lethal liver failure. SFSS is linked to endothelial denudation, necrosis, and lobular disturbance. Using the knowledge learned from partial hepatectomy studies on LSEC, we expose several techniques that are, or could be, used to avoid the \u201csmall for size syndrome\u201d after extended hepatectomy or small liver transplantation.",

            "text": "As MuHV-1 is used as an in vivo model for human HHV-5, more knowledge about the initial steps of infection in target cell types, like endothelial cells, is needed in the mouse model. Endothelial cells are heterogenous across tissue vascular beds, reflecting organ-specific functions, but also vary in their structure and phenotype between vessel types within the organ (Jarvis and Nelson, 2007). The infection pathways may thus vary between endothelial cell types. \n\nThe endothelial cells that line the sinusoids in the liver, i.e. the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) make up a specialized, fenestrated endothelium with an extraordinarily high clearance capacity for blood-borne waste macromolecules, and various nanoparticles (< 100-200 nm), including some viruses and viruslike particles (Ganesan et al., 2011;Simon-Santamaria et al., 2014;Mates et al., 2017), thus contributing to the maintenance of homeostasis (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2012;Bhandari et al., 2021). The LSECs have a well-developed endocytic apparatus and express high levels of scavenger receptors, C-type lectins, and other receptors tailored to bind and internalize an array of endogenous and exogenous ligands, which are then efficiently degraded in the cells (Gramberg et al., 2005;S\u00f8rensen et al., 2012;Shetty et al., 2018;Bhandari et al., 2020;Pandey et al., 2020;Bhandari et al., 2021).

            "text": "Kupffer cells are maintained via self-renewal in specific microenvironmental niches, primarily the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). In this study, we propagated tissue-resident macrophages (M\u00f8) from mouse liver using mixed culture with hepatic fibroblastic cells. Propagated liver M\u00f8 express Id3, Lxra and Spic transcription factors, which are required for Kupffer cell characterization. Thus, Kupffer cell properties are likely to be maintained in liver M\u00f8 propagated using mixed culture with fibroblastic cells. We revealed (i) gene expression of certain Eph receptors and ephrin ligands including EphA2, ephrin-A1, EphB4, and ephrin-B1 in propagated liver M\u00f8 and primary LSECs, (ii) immunohistochemical localization of these Eph/ephrin member molecules indicating common expression in Kupffer cells and LSECs, and (iii) surface expression of several integrin \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits, including \u03b14\u03b21, \u03b1L\u03b22, \u03b1M\u03b22, and \u03b1X\u03b22 integrin in propagated liver M\u00f8 and that of the corresponding ligands ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in primary LSECs. Moreover, EphA/ephrin-A and EphB/ephrin-B interactions promoted liver M\u00f8 adhesion to the ICAM-1-adsorbed surface, which mimicked that of LSECs and may be implicated in the residence of Kupffer cells in the liver sinusoid. Further studies on regulating the residence and regeneration of Kupffer cells in related hepatic disorders are required to validate our findings.",

            "text": "A literature survey on this topic reveals that major cell physiological events spanning from receptor-mediated ligand internalization to lysosomal ligand processing, are more active in LSECs than in other liver cells and endothelial cells. First, the mode of endocytosis reported for ligands taken up via LSEC scavenger and mannose receptors is via the clathrin-mediated pathway (Smedsr\u00f8d et al., 1988;Eskild et al., 1989;Esbach et al., 1994;Hellevik et al., 1998;Kjeken et al., 2001;Hansen et al., 2005). Soluble immune complexes are also internalized via clathrincoated pits after binding to the LSEC Fc\u03b3RIIb2 (Mousavi et al., 2007). This distinguishes LSECs as a unique member of the family of endothelial cells, since it is generally held that caveolaemediated endocytosis is a characteristic of endothelial cells. LSECs express caveolin-1 (Yamazaki et al., 2013) but endocytosis via caveolae has not been described, and fluid-phase endocytosis is also of little importance for the scavenger function of LSECs (Kjeken et al., 2001). \n\nAbundance of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles has been reported repeatedly in LSECs (Wisse, 1970(Wisse, , 1972;;Kjeken et al., 2001;Falkowska-Hansen et al., 2007). These were described as \"bristle-coated pits and vesicles\" in the early, epoch-forming ultrastructural studies of LSECs by Wisse (1970Wisse ( , 1972)); clathrin was first described by Pearse (1976). Morphometric analyses of rat liver showed that the density of coated pits at the plasma membrane was about twice as high in LSECs compared to Kupffer cells and hepatocytes (Kjeken et al., 2001).",

            "text": "The liver has a central role in host defense [1,2]. Its extensive capillary network, the sinusoids, houses the body's most effective scavenger cell system comprising the Kupffer cells (KCs; the body's largest reservoir of resident macrophages [3]), and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). For decades KCs, facing the sinusoidal lumen, were believed to be the only liver cell responsible for the clearance of blood-borne material [4,5]. This view was challenged by a series of studies throughout the 1980s and 1990s showing that a number of physiological macromolecules and colloids were cleared chiefly by LSECs, but only to a minor extent by KCs [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]. Today it is accepted that LSECs and KCs together make up the hepatic \"dual cell principle of waste clearance\", with LSECs being geared to effective clathrin-mediated endocytosis of nanoparticles (< 200 nm), colloids, and macromolecules, and KCs taking up larger material [5]. The discovery that these cells share the task of blood clearance in this way suggested that LSECs are a highly specialized endothelium with characteristics in common with KCs, not only functionally, but at the molecular level as well. The present study was undertaken to study the similarities and differences of the two cells, by comparing their transcriptomes and proteomes. \n\nThe liver receives approximately 25% of cardiac output, exposing the sinusoidal cells to large volumes of blood, thus placing these cells in a unique position to monitor blood content. Approximately 80% of the organ blood supply drains the gut and contains (in addition to nutrients) toxins, bacterial components, viruses, and various waste products that are efficiently removed from blood by uptake in LSECs and KCs [5,15], thus preventing deposition and deleterious effects of such components elsewhere.",

            "text": "The endothelialization of parenchymal sinusoids is of equal importance to covering the macrovascular lumen, given that they form a barrier between sinusoidal blood and hepatocytes. This is particularly important if the parenchyma of transplanted reendothelialized liver grafts is also repopulated with hepatocytes. Direct contact between hepatocytes and blood is known to cause an instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR), in which inflammatory cells, including monocytes, granulocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells, are activated and cause inflammation. The occurrence of IBMIR can be prevented by an endothelial lining of the sinusoids in decellularized liver scaffolds. However, difficulties related to isolation and large-scale in vitro expansion of primary LSECs hamper their use in liver recellularization studies [85]. \n\nStem/Progenitor Cell-Derived Endothelial-like Cells Generation of endothelial-like cells from hiPSCs has been described using various differentiation protocols [86]. In addition, some studies showed that it might be possible to transform such iPsc endothelial cells to an LSEC phenotype via modification, TGF\u03b2 pathway inhibition, or genetic engineering [87][88][89]. These hiPSC-derived LSECs may be good candidates to cover the sinusoidal endothelial lining of the liver parenchyma. However, as Shaheen et al. found that HUVECs gain the expression of LYVE-1 when present in sinusoids in the liver parenchyma [84], it is also possible that grafting hiPSCderived endothelial cells not previously connected to LSECs might undergo a phenotype shift from a macrovascular-to a sinusoidal endothelial-like phenotype when they engraft in liver sinusoids. \n\nFrom the perspective of whole organ recellularization studies, the minimal endothelial cell requirements would be that they can cover the lumen of the vascular tract, show angiogenic behavior, and maintain viability on the long term.",

Based on this foundation, a spherical nucleic acid (SNAs) targeting LSEC was ingeniously crafted by assembling sulfhydryl and Au(I)-modified miR-325-3p into a mesmerizing spheroid polyhedron measuring approximately 39 nm through the captivating phenomenon of aurophilic interaction. Thanks to two remarkable factors: 1) the highly specific overexpression of scavenger receptor A (Scara) in hepatic fibrotic LSECs and 2) the Scara's exceptional affinity for spherical nucleic acids 17,18 , SNAs selectively infiltrates into LSECs. More significantly, SNAS effectively reversed the capillarization of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and exhibited remarkable therapeutic efficacy in three mouse models of liver fibrosis, encompassing oxidative stressinduced fibrosis caused by carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ), drug toxicityinduced fibrosis induced by thioacetamide (TAA), and cholestasisderived fibrosis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL). Importantly, these beneficial effects were accompanied by a maintained favorable biosafety profile. The development and translation of this SNAs into clinical applications, so to speak, has the potential to revolutionize the management of liver fibrosis, offering newfound hope for patients suffering from chronic liver diseases.",

The LNP-siPLK1 resulted in reducing the amount of secreted viral particles on HBV-infected primary human hepatocytes [176]. In the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), the accumulation of LNPs resulted in the secretion of several cytokines which are then followed by neutrophilic inflammation. To overcome this, Sato and groups prepared the LNPs which were modified on the surface with N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc), a hepatocyte-specific ligand. The modified LNPs improved the hepatocyte specificity and together with PEGylation displayed a reduction in the LNP-associated toxicity without affecting the gene-silencing activity in hepatocytes. It was evident that a single injection of LNPs, significantly reduced the HBV genomic DNA and antigen in chimeric mice with humanized livers infected with HBV without displaying any sign of toxicity [177].",

After intravenous injection of a liver cell-targeted delivery system (nanoparticles) containing a therapeutic molecule, the nanoparticle binds to plasma proteins, particularly albumin. Plasma protein binding reduces liver-specific uptake of the nanoparticle delivery system. Nanoparticles can be delivered to hepatocytes through receptormediated endocytosis, into Kupffer cells by phagocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis, into stellate cells by receptormediated endocytosis and into LSECs by pinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis. Of these endocytic routes, receptormediated endocytosis is the most commonly used method to deliver nanoparticles into the targeted liver cells. Most of the nanoparticles are taken up and removed by Kupffer cells and LSECs because they express a variety of receptors that limit the number of nanoparticles capable of reaching the hepatocytes and stellate cells. \n\nefficiency in vitro, their transfection efficiency is much lower in vivo because of the high endocytic capacity of Kupffer and LSECs. \n\nTo facilitate the selective transfer of therapeutic molecules into hepatocytes, the delivery system should have a small diameter to allow the delivery system to pass through the sinusoidal endothelial fenestrae (Rensen et al., 2001), which are 100 nm in diameter (Wisse et al., 1985).

Splenectomy in Balb/c rag-2 -/-mice did not result in an incremental effect 7 . This suggests that humoral factors produced by spleen lymphocytes may affect the clearance of adenoviral vectors by liver reticulo-endothelial cells in Balb/c mice. In contrast, no such effects on intrahepatic transgene DNA distribution were observed in splenectomized C57BL/6 mice and in C57BL/6 rag-1 -/-mice, suggesting highly heterogeneous effects of humoral factors produced by spleen lymphocytes on liver reticuloendothelial cells. Further evidence for a major role of liver reticulo-endothelial cells as a determinant of hepatocyte transduction comes from experiments with clodronate liposomes. Depletion of Kupffer cells and macrophages in the spleen by intravenous administration of clodronate liposomes results in significantly increased transgene DNA levels in parenchymal liver cells 7 and in increased transgene expression 6,7,48,49 . Since liver sinusoidal endothelial cell function may be modified by Kupffer cells 50,51 , it cannot be excluded that part of the effect of clodronate liposomes is due to reduced activation of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells by Kupffer cells.

To expand the scope of LNPs to non-hepatic cells, Cheng et al. developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles and achieved spleen-and lungselective mRNA delivery by incorporating anionic phospholipids and permanently cationic lipids into conventional four-component LNPs, respectively (Cheng et al. 2020). SORT LNPs were reported to follow a similar mechanism to conventional LNPs for organ targeting, but they adsorbed different types of serum proteins by distinct surface charges, which might direct them to non-liver organs (Dilliard et al. 2021). Different from endogenous targeting via serum proteins, numerous ligands were utilized to functionalize LNPs to achieve targeted nucleic acid delivery through active targeting. In this section, we summarize the currently reachable organs and cell types by ligand-modified nucleic acid-LNPs (supplementary Table S2).",

Simvastatin functions as hepatic endothelium protector stimulates KLF2-NO signaling in LSECs to regress HSC activation. Simvastatin also up-regulates CXCL16 in LSECs which can recruit NKT cells. In order to exert the dual effect of simvastatin on LSEC, we targeteddelivered simvastatin to LSECs by a PLGA-PEG-MAN NP formulation. LSEC-targeted delivery of simvastatin not only alleviates LSEC capillarization to regress the stromal microenvironment, but also recruits NKT cells to remodel immunosuppressive microenvironment and inhibit tumor progression in murine HCC model (Fig. 7). In advanced-stage HCC, combination therapy of simvastatin NP and anti-PD-L1 antibody achieves an improved therapeutic effect.\n\nLSECs are highly specialized endothelial cells in liver, which lies between blood cells on the sinusoidal side and hepatocytes and HSCs on the abluminal side [28]. With the structure of fenestrae, LSECs represent a permeable barrier allowing exchanges between two sides. However, LSECs do not simply form a barrier but exert instrumental effect in maintaining microenvironment homeostasis and mediating immune response in liver. Differentiated LSECs are the gatekeeper to maintain HSC in their quiescent state, which are critical to suppress fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis [29]. LSECs also influence the composition of hepatic immune populations by expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines [9]. The unique positioning, phenotype and function make LSECs an attractive candidate for organspecific therapy. In our study, simvastatin exerted dual effect via LSECs to deactivate aHSCs and recruit NKT cells, leading to stromal regression and tumor suppression. Since LSECs are able to take up molecules by scavenger receptors, nanoparticles with target ligand can be an excellent way to apply therapy",

Bellinger utilized multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to interact with highly expressed asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on the hepatocytes, mediating an endogenous entry mechanism. 33 An optimized GalNAc-modified LNPs formulated by ionizable lipid GL6 based on the lysine-based scaffold and covalently linked to the sugar moiety and scaffold exhibited significant adenine base editing capability targeting ANGPTL3 in the liver in a somatic LDLR-deficient nonhuman primates (NHP) model. The GalNAc-LNPs increased liver editing from 5% to 61% in the NHP model and resulted in an 89% reduction in ANGPTL3 protein in the blood for 6 months after administration. 34 Besides, O-series LNPs (ILs containing an ester bond in the tail) have shown a preference for accomplishing liver-selective mRNA delivery. 35 Qiaobing Xu's team developed a novel O-series LNPs, 306-O12B LNPs, to perform a specific hepatocyte delivery of Cas9 (CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats)-associated protein 9) mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting ANGPTL3 (sgAngptl3). 36 n spite of the fact that the ability of LNPs to target hepatocytes has been widely explored, the targeted delivery of LNPs to other liver cells, such as HSCs, hepatic macrophages, Kupffer cells (KCs), and LSECs, remains a challenge. Fortunately, several studies have shown that strategies for targeting other hepatic cells with LNPs are possible. In the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships.",

            "text": "Obesity and insulin resistance can cause NAFLD, which is characterized by liver metabolic dysregulation, such as hyperlipidemia (95). Recent epidemiology of NAFLD and its connection with CVD suggest that blocking endothelial dysfunction would be beneficial (96), since endothelial function is impaired in patients with NAFLD (97).\n\nLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells are highly specialized ECs, which form the wall of liver sinusoids and represent up to 20% of liver cells (98). LSECs are well known for their crucial roles in liver regeneration (99)(100)(101) and chronic liver diseases associated with obesity (e.g., fibrosis) (102). LSECs maintain hepatic stellate cells and hepatocytes in quiescence at basal condition but induce hepatocyte proliferation and angiogenesis during regeneration and undergo morphological and functional changes during fibrosis (103). It is believed that LSECs accomplish these by interacting with other hepatic cell types to maintain liver homeostasis. Since healthy LSECs facilitate the rapid transfer of fatty acids formed from cholesteryl esters to parenchymal cells, LSECs injury contributes to NAFLD (104). LSECs injury has been associated with NAFLD progression, where NAFLD may alter LSECs-mediated transport of nutrients, lipids, and lipoproteins. A recent study in choline-deficient, l-amino acid-defined, and high-fat diet models that mimic human NAFLD indicated that LSEC injury functions as \"gatekeeper\" in the progression from simple steatosis to the early non-alcoholic steatohepatitis stage, and LSEC injury may activate Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells, which in turn results in chronic liver injuries (105). In this regard, LSECs operate as a traffic-director at the crossroad of regeneration and fibrosis (106). It is yet to be determined whether LSEC-derived factors are required for this function.",

            "text": "It is unclear in vivo whether platelets would come in contact with hepatocytes that are separated from the hepatic sinusoidal microcirculation by the sinusoidal endothelium and the perisinusoidal space (space of Disse) [17]. The size of liver sinusoidal endothelial fenestrates (~180 nM in size) is much smaller than that of platelets (~500 nm in diameter) so that platelets cannot pass through readily [9]. The liver also contains an abundance of a professional type of phagocytes known as Kupffer cells, which comprises the largest population of resident tissue macrophages in the body [17,18]. Our recent study supports Kupffer cells, instead of hepatocytes, in playing the major role in clearance of desialylated platelets [9]. \n\nKupffer cells express multiple endocytic lectin receptors including a C-type lectin CLEC4F (Kupffer cell receptor) [19,20]. CLEC4F has high binding affinity for desialylated glycans bearing exposed \u03b2-gal or \u03b2-GalNAc. CLEC4F was first purified from rat liver extract and exhibits a higher affinity for desialylated glycan moieties with a Gal, Gal-NAc, or fucose terminus [9,[21][22][23]. However, the expression pattern and biological function of CLEC4F, in regards to the destruction of desialylated platelets in vivo, has remained unclear. In this study, we generated new CLEC4F-deficient mouse lines (Clec4f \u2212/\u2212 ) and demonstrated an important role for CLEC4F on Kupffer cells in mediating the clearance of desialylated platelets induced by bacteria-derived neuraminidases in the liver in vivo.",

            "text": "The liver constitutes a vital organ that assumes a pivotal role in various physiological processes encompassing metabolism, detoxification, and immune modulation. However, liver diseases such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer are prevalent and can be life-threatening. LNPs have been shown to selectively accumulate in the liver due to their uptake and clearance by liver macrophages, the largest population of phagocytes in the body. Moreover, the interplay between LNPs and plasma proteins substantially influences their systemic clearance dynamics post-administration. Therefore, liver-targeted delivery using LNPs represents a promising avenue for the treatment of liver-related diseases, as it can minimize the occurrence of side effects and improve the efficacy of therapeutic agents. \n\nIn the past few years, LNPs always selectively accumulate in the liver, which correlates with nanoparticle uptake and clearance by liver macrophages, the largest population of phagocytes in the body. 152 In addition, the interaction of LNPs with plasma proteins plays an important role in the clearance process of LNPs after entering the body. 153 ost of the studies on carriers selectively delivered to the liver are conducted from ApoE, which promotes receptormediated cellular entry. 99 A recent study indicated that the binding of ApoE can induce the rearrangement of the shell and core lipids of LNPs containing mRNA. 154 According to Zheng et al., 155 the ability to attain liver targeting can be accomplished by systematically refining the nanoparticle vector formulation using the central composite design approach. \n\nThe human liver is primarily composed of parenchymal cells and nonparenchymal cells. Focusing on these specific cell types provides a precise approach to treating disease. Liver parenchymal cells are commonly implicated in hepatitis especially the HBV and other related diseases, whereas nonparenchymal cells, such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells, 156 are closely associated with chronic liver conditions like liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. 157,158",

            "text": "As a consequence of rising global rates of metabolic disease and alcohol-related injury, the research community has a heightened interest in understanding the mechanisms which underlie hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis. Specific immune cell populations and hepatic stellate cells have obvious significance in this regard, but one underestimated cell population deserves greater prominence. Hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells are vital to metabolic and functional homeostasis, and changes in their phenotype as a consequence of injury or aging have an impact on disease pathophysiology. In this article series our authors have highlighted both novel mechanistic approaches, and novel features of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) which have great potential for preclinical development. \n\nBhandari et al. review the phagocytic and clearance roles of LSEC to consider their function as part of the hepatic reticuloendothelial system. Scavenger functions protect liver parenchyma from exposure to noxious substances. Hence scavenger receptors contribute to clearance of viruses, macromolecules, and nanosized pharmaceuticals and also contribute to immune defense by supporting immune cell recruitment. In addition to their consideration of key receptors involved in clearance, the authors also comment on anatomical features of LSEC such as their fenestrations, large surface area and abundant endocytic machinery which support the fast and efficient clearance roles of these cells. There is also consideration of the evolutionary conservation of scavenger endothelial functions to emphasize the conserved importance of the clearance capacities of such cells in vertebrate species. In another contribution, Pandey et al. provide more detail on the structure of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and revisit key scavenger receptors expressed by LSEC to highlight the importance of the clearance capacity of these cells. Here, the authors highlight the diversity of possible ligands cleared by LSEC. They also consider both homeostatic clearance of endogenous lipids and degradation products, and the uptake of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), pathogen associated molecules and oxidized lipids in a diseased context. Changes in receptor expression profiles which occur in chronic disease or cancer in both rodents and humans are also reviewed.",

            "text": "LSECs occur mainly in the sinusoidal wall of the liver and have minimal basement membranes in the endothelium and open fenestrations that facilitate the steric transport of cargo from the sinusoidal space to the parenchyma and the space of Disse [20,21]. LSECs are involved in the regulation of sinusoidal blood flow through carbon monoxide production. When the function of KCs deteriorates, LSECs uptake and process foreign substances in the blood. LSECs are clusters of differentiation 4 (CD4) +, express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins, undergo excessive endocytosis, and have scavenger receptors that support the most potent scavenger system in the body [22,23]. Antigen uptake and antigen presentation via scavenger receptors of LSECs are key steps in promoting T cell tolerance under physiological conditions. Furthermore, LSECs play important roles in immune regulation within the liver through leukocyte adhesion, bacterial processing, and viral clearance [21,24]. LSECs also contribute to leukocyte trafficking by recruiting these leucocytes from the peripheral circulation into the liver. Through a multistep adhesion cascade that involves several receptor-ligand interactions, the activated endothelium captures insulating immune cells and allows leukocyte migration to sites of tissue injury or infection [24]. Thus, in the liver, lymphocytes frequently migrate via the transcellular route, whereas in other organs they migrate through the paracellular route between endothelial cell junctions [25]. As excessive immunosuppressive leukocyte subsets promote pathogen escape and tumorigenesis, LSECs also play active roles in regulating the microenvironment in persistent hepatitis.",

As a consequence, the biodistribution shifted from hepatocytes to LSECs and KCs, respectively, using cholesterol-oleate or oxidized cholesterol [143,144]. Additionally, the distribution of commercial LNP formulations with DLin-MC3 compared to the ionizable lipid cKK-E12 was assessed, revealing that both formulations were not only delivered to hepatocytes but partly to LSECs and KCs [142]. Furthermore, variations within the alkyl chains of the phospholipids giving \"constrained\" adamantyl-phospholipids which delivered the cargo specifically to KCs and LSECs, but not to immune cells outside the liver were evaluated [145].\n\nRecently, Pattipeiluhu et al. developed LNPs for delivery of mRNA to hepatic RES resembling the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. By replacing the phospholipid within the LNP from the zwitterionic 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) to the anionic 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DSPG) a negative surface charge was created and specific uptake by LSECs under participation of Stabilin receptors in embryonic zebrafish and mice was achieved [146].",

However, there are conflicting reports on the expression of CD206 on Kupffer cells, and Kupffer cell homogeneity in general [124,130]. In healthy murine livers, the existence of two subsets of Kupffer cell populations has been proposed, based on the expression of CD206 and endothelial cellselective adhesion molecule (ESAM): a major CD206 lo ESAM - population (KC1) and a minor CD206 hi ESAM + population (KC2) [131,132]. However, all genes specifically found in KC2s (e.g. CD36) are also expressed by LSECs, suggesting the possibility of crosscontamination between these populations [130,131]. In contrast, a transcriptome and proteome profiling study in rats found that LSECs and Kupffer cells equally express CD206, but revealed that CD36 was expressed on Kupffer cells while absent on LSECs [133]. Further research is required to elucidate the receptor profiles of Kupffer cells and LSECs. While both cell types have had their receptors and scavenging activity investigated individually, comparative studies considering both components of the dual-cell system remain a rarity. Furthermore, in the context of injury and necrotic cell debris clearance, there is limited knowledge regarding which DAMPs are scavenged by the expressed receptors. Table 4 presents a comparative summary of the receptors expressed by LSECs and Kupffer cells with their respective necrotic cell debris ligands. It is important to note that while the expression of receptors and the binding of ligands have been confirmed, the clearance of necrotic debris ligands by these cells and receptors remains unverified. Once the debris is taken up, the LSECs and Kupffer cells utilize an array of lysosomal enzymes to degrade the endocytosed contents, including but not limited to acid phosphatase, acid lipase, acid DNase (i.e.",

            "text": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) comprise about 15-20% of the total number of liver cells and line the sinusoidal lumen of the liver sinusoids. LSECs are highly specialized endothelial cells characterized by fenestrae and lack of a basement membrane (1) making these cells the most permeable cells in the mammalian body (2). LSEC permeability is important for liver function as it permits plasma, solutes, and small substrates such as albumin (3) and insulin (4) to diffuse from the blood toward the parenchymal cells. Besides working as a filter and first barrier of the liver, these cells have other functions such as the production of coagulation factor VIII (5), antigen presentation (6,7), leukocyte recruitment and endocytosis of virus particles (8), oxidized LDL (9) and immunocomplexes by the abundant expression of multiple scavenger receptors (10). Expression of specific scavenger receptors and other characteristic proteins can vary across the liver acinus (11,12). \n\nMaintenance of the specialized LSEC phenotype is essential for liver homeostasis (13). During liver injury LSECs can become dysfunctional, characterized by the loss of fenestrae and the appearance of a basement membrane, also known as capillarization (4,(14)(15)(16). LSECs can contribute to liver regeneration and healing by orchestrating an angiocrine response that can lead to a pro-regenerative response after an acute injury or to a maladaptive pro-fibrotic response after chronic injury, which in turn leads to fibrosis (17). Moreover, LSECs are described to have a gatekeeper function in liver fibrosis as differentiated LSECs promote HSC quiescence, and restoration of LSEC differentiation can prevent fibrosis progression and accelerate fibrosis regression (18). Although it is known that LSECs play an important role in the response to acute and chronic liver injury, research on the transcriptomic and phenotypic change of LSECs during acute and chronic injury is still limited.",

            "text": "The capillaries in the liver are formed by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which comprise about 50% of the non-parenchymal cells. The fenestrae observed in LSECs vary from 100 to 150nm in diameter, freely allowing the diffusion of blood and stromal soluble factors. These cells can also actively transport drugs, polypeptides, and cationic components, for example, increasing the exchange of soluble factors in the organ [129]. Besides, LSECs are highly phagocytic and express multiple pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and scavenger receptors, such as stabilin-1 and -2, mannose receptors, and FcRs, that help clear antigens and potentially toxic molecules from the circulation. For example, in the liver, these cells are responsible for eliminating more than 75% of LPS that arrives from the intestines. \n\nLSECs express low levels of MHC II and co-stimulatory molecules, like CD80, CD86, and CD40, and can cross-present antigens in MHC I molecules [130,131]. They also express CD54 (ICAM-I), CD105, and endothelial markers as CD106 (VCAM-I) and CD31. Most importantly, LSECs express Fas-L, PD-L1, and LSECtin (Figure 2), a molecule that recognizes CD44 on the surface of T lymphocytes and inhibits T cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions [132]. These cells also secrete low levels of IL-12 and, therefore, mostly lead to differentiation of Th2 over Th1 lymphocytes and Treg cells [117,133]. \n\nThe LSECs are also involved in liver regeneration, and this capacity is at least partially due to the release of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and angiopoietin-2. Besides, the recruitment of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells occurs mostly through the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by LSECs [134].",

They were identified by their relatively small size (8 -10 m), clear cytoplasm, and oval nuclei (Fig. 1A). LSEC preparations typically were 90% pure and contained Kupffer cells (2%) and red blood cells (8%) as contaminants. \n\nAnalysis of the LSEC preparation by flow cytometry demonstrated that the cells expressed cell surface markers ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 and contained a subpopulation of the cells that bound wheat germ agglutinin (Fig. 2). LSECs did not stain with the monocyte/macrophage-specific marker CD14 or the endothelial marker VCAM-1 (data not shown). These findings are similar to previously described phenotypic characteristics of murine LSECs, which were ICAM-1 \u03e9 /PECAM-1 \u03e9 /VCAM-1 \u03e9 and contained two subpopulations that differentially bound wheat germ agglutinin (18,19). The reason for the lack of VCAM-1 staining in our LSEC preparation is not known, although the cells became VCAM-1 \u03e9 after cell culture. \n\nQuantitation of FVIII mRNA by Competitive RT-PCR-Ini- tial experiments demonstrated that fVIII mRNA could be identified by RT-PCR in LSECs and hepatocytes, but not Kupffer cells (data not shown).",

            "text": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) form a unique barrier between the liver sinusoids and the underlying parenchyma, and thus play a crucial role in maintaining metabolic and immune homeostasis, as well as actively contributing to disease pathophysiology. Whilst their endocytic and scavenging function is integral for nutrient exchange and clearance of waste products, their capillarisation and dysfunction precedes fibrogenesis. Furthermore, their ability to promote immune tolerance and recruit distinct immunosuppressive leukocyte subsets can allow persistence of chronic viral infections and facilitate tumour development. In this review, we present the immunological and barrier functions of LSEC, along with their role in orchestrating fibrotic processes which precede tumourigenesis. We also summarise the role of LSEC in modulating the tumour microenvironment, and promoting development of a pre-metastatic niche, which can drive formation of secondary liver tumours. Finally, we summarise closely inter-linked disease pathways which collectively perpetuate pathogenesis, highlighting LSEC as novel targets for therapeutic intervention.",

            "text": "Organ-specific mRNA delivery systems are designed to selectively treat lesions in specific organs, tissues, or cell types.Targeted drugs can effectively maximize therapeutic efficacy and decrease toxic and side effects on unrelated tissues or organs. [122]LNPs are known for their highly effective RNA delivery to liver hepatocytes.For example, Onpattro, an LNP formulation of siRNA, which was approved by FDA for treating polyneuropathies in 2018, delivers siRNA to hepatocytes with high potency. [123]To translate the clinically approved delivery platform to mRNA-based therapy, Wang et al. used liver-homing MC3 LNPs to selectively deliver mRNA to the liver with a high transfection efficacy while drastically less in other organs. [124]Similarly, Rybakova et al. used liver-targeting LNPs to deliver modified mRNA encoding an anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibody, trastuzumab, into the liver which reached the expression of full-size therapeutic antibodies to elicit potent antitumor effect. [125]Apart from targeting hepatocytes, transporting mRNA to liver microenvironmental cells represents an attractive strategy for treating liver cancer.Paunovska et al. formulated LNP with oxidized cholesterol which preferentially delivered mRNA into liver microenvironmental cells (e.g., liver endothelial cells, Kupffer cells), with a five-fold transfection rate than hepatocytes. [126]These liver-targeting mRNA-delivering platforms hold great potential in hepatoma immunotherapy.\n\nGiven that most of the systemically administrated mRNA delivery systems are intended to accumulate in the liver, [58,86c,124,127] transporting mRNA outside the liver is urgently needed for certain extrahepatic diseases, such as extrahepatic cancers. [128]By varying the lipid-to-mRNA weight ratio and subsequently adjusting the surface charges of LNP, Kranz et al. reported a pioneering study for surfacecharge dependent organ tropism of mRNA-LNP, opening the prelude to using LNP to deliver mRNA in vivo.

            "text": "In the context of systemic delivery for protein replacement therapy, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in blood serum has been identified to facilitate liver homing of intravenously injected lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). LNPs, particularly those with ionizable lipids, exhibit tissue tropism influenced by their charge, as observed in ApoE-dependent hepatic uptake [64]. To address excessive liver homing, a selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy has been explored, incorporating specific lipid classes into LNPs for tissue-specific gene delivery [65]. Manipulating the charge of formulated LNPs using SORT molecules, such as DOTAP or 18PA, allows for lung-or spleen-specific gene delivery, demonstrating adaptability for therapeutic goals. Additionally, strategies for targeting specific cell subsets in the liver, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, have been pursued by adjusting particle size and incorporating targeting ligands [65]. \n\nNovel ionizable amino lipids and an ASSET system, utilizing cell-targeting antibodies, have been employed to enhance tissue specificity [66]. Although challenges persist in achieving systemic delivery into tumors, RNA-lipoplexes (RNA-LPX) have shown promise in cancer immunotherapy by targeting antigen-presenting cells and inducing T-cell activation. The modRNA, such as 1-methylpseudouridine (m1\u03a8) RNA, contributes to reduced inflammatory responses and improved therapeutic outcomes in autoimmune disease models [22,67]. These studies underscore the importance of careful LNP design and RNA modification for tissue-specific delivery and therapeutic efficacy, providing valuable insights for advancing RNA-based therapeutics.",

            "text": "Intravenous administration of lipid nanoparticles has been the most common route to deliver therapeutic genes to endothelial cells, as these cells are located in the inner surface of blood vessels and are in direct contact with the blood. However, when nanoparticles enter the blood circulation, they are often eliminated by cells of the reticuloendothelial system or preferentially transfect hepatocytes, which prevents nanoparticles from reaching and transfecting endothelial cells [69,94,[186][187][188][189]. As such, strategies have been developed to bypass hepatocytes in order to reach and transfect endothelial cells. Among the strategies developed, the use of cationic lipids or polymers to generate nanoparticles that target endothelial cells has made considerable progress. Dorkin et al. showed that incorporation of the permanently cationic lipid, DOTAP, to LNPs that otherwise target the liver could be redirected to transfect pulmonary endothelial cells [182]. Dorkin et al. also found that liver-targeted lipid nanoparticles, which are nanoparticles that preferentially transfect hepatocytes on their own, specifically C12-200, cKK-E12, and 503O13 nanoparticles, could have a shift in their tropism and transfect pulmonary endothelial cells by incorporating the lipid DOTAP in their formulation [182]. This finding was later expanded by Cheng et al. to include additional cationic lipids, such as DDAB and EPC, to other liver-targeted nanoparticles like 5A2-SC8 and DLin-MC3-DMA to enable transfection of pulmonary endothelial cells [181]. The mechanism by which these nanoparticles target and deliver nucleic acids to the lung may be due to association with a protein or group of proteins that binds to the surface of the nanoparticles and selectively delivers them to the pulmonary endothelium [95,190]. For example, lipid compositions can shift the protein corona abundance away from ApoE, which is a recognized driver of hepatocyte LNP uptake and transfection [191",

Liver mononuclear cells were isolated from livers of control and HCC-bearing mice, and F4-80 high MHCII C cells were identified. To exclude Kupffer cell/endothelial cell doublets (some are not excluded in the classical SSC-Height/SSC-Area plot), an anti-CD68 membrane labeling was performed. CD68 is highly expressed at the surface of endothelial cells, and primarily in the cytoplasm of Kupffer cells ( 19 and data not shown). Single Kupffer cells were therefore selected as CD68 low cells. In addition, the selected population did not express Ly6C, while circulating macrophages do express this marker. 20,21 We further analyzed whether Kupffer cells in the liver lobes harboring HCC expressed positive and negative co-stimulatory molecules differently than Kupffer cells residing in non-tumorous liver lobes (surrounding parenchyma) or in control livers (Fig. 1B).

Therefore, the discovery of new ligands for liver targeting, instead of the use of the conventional ligands, is very important. Another ligand for hepatocytes was investigated by Lin et al. [114] in which chitosan nanoparticles surface was modified with glycyrrhizin (CS-NPs-GL) as new hepatocyte-targeted delivery vehicles and concluded that CS-NPs-GL could be a promising hepatocyte-targeted delivery carrier. But Negishi et al. [66] showed that the number of binding sites for glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is much more than that for GL. Therefore, Tion et al. [115] prepared glycyrrhetinic acid-modified chitosan/poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles for liver-targeted delivery and found that the cellular uptake of nanoparticles modified with glycyrrhetinic acid by rat hepatocytes was 19-fold higher than that of unmodified ones. In fact delivery of NDDS (like liposomes, niosomes, nanoparticles, and phytosomes) and proteins to the hepatocytes using ASGP-R as a target receptor was one of the first options for the cell specific delivery to the liver cells although this has not led to any clinical application yet. \n\n6.1.2.

Since endothelial cells express unique surface molecules such as sugars and proteins, lipid nanoparticles have been coated with molecules that target endothelial surface molecules. For example, Kusumoto et al. developed a lipid nanoparticle coated with GALA peptides on their surface to selectively target pulmonary endothelial cells [123]. The GALA peptides were capable of directing the nanoparticles to endothelial cells by targeting the sialic acid-terminated sugar chains on the pulmonary endothelium, which subsequently delivered the encapsulated nucleic acids to the endothelial cytosol via endosomal membrane fusion [123].\n\nSimilarly, Kim et al. reported that the addition of mannose to lipid nanoparticles enabled selective RNA delivery to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, as mannose receptors are preferentially expressed in the liver endothelium and therefore nanoparticles containing mannose on their surface would be scavenged by liver endothelial cells [93]. In the same form, Parhiz et al. and Marquez et al. demonstrated that the addition of PECAM-1 antibody or chondroitin sulfate allowed the selective delivery of LNPs to endothelial cells by targeting proteins ubiquitously expressed on the endothelium [96,157].\n\nOther reports have demonstrated that the addition of antibodies or binding peptides that target adhesion proteins on an activated endothelium directs LNPs to endothelial cells from different organs. One example of such work was produced by Kowalski et al. who showed that addition of anti-VCAM-1 antibodies to the surface of SAINT-O-Some lipid nanoparticles facilitated the delivery of siRNA to inflamed renal endothelial cells [129].

They serve as a location for the oxygen-rich blood from the hepatic artery and the nutrient-rich blood from the portal vein, and transport blood from the porta hepatis to the inferior vena cava through the liver [1]. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are highly specialized and line the hepatic sinusoidal wall [2][3][4]. They are one of the first hepatic cell population that come to contact with blood, separating blood in the sinusoid from the extracellular space of Disse and surrounding hepatocytes [5][6][7]. Although LSEC number represent a small percentage of all liver cells [8][9][10], they have specific and important physiological functions that are not yet fully appreciated. \n\nLSEC participate in the endocytosis and metabolism of a wide range of macromolecules [8], and are in intimate contact with leukocytes passing through the liver [11]. LSEC together with macrophages and hepatocytes take up liposomes through direct recognition of phospholipid head groups by the scavenger receptors expressed on their cell surface [12]. LSEC in combination with Kupffer cells constitute the most powerful scavenger system in the body [13,14]. LSEC also play a key role in the regulation of iron homeostasis by expression of bone morphogenic protein 6 (BMP6) and the production of iron regulatory hormone, hepcidin, by hepatocytes [15]. \n\nLSEC are an important component of the complex network of cellular interactions, which cooperate to sustain liver function [8]. They facilitate and regulate the bi-directional transfer of substrates between the blood and liver parenchyma, forming a blood-hepatocyte barrier [16,17]. In order to maximize the transfer of substrates between blood and hepatocytes, LSEC exhibit a unique morphology with cytoplasmic extensions that are very thin and perforated with pores called fenestrations [18].",

Lalor 1,2 and David H. Adams 1,2 * Abstract | Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) line the low shear, sinusoidal capillary channels of the liver and are the most abundant non-parenchymal hepatic cell population. LSECs do not simply form a barrier within the hepatic sinusoids but have vital physiological and immunological functions, including filtration, endocytosis, antigen presentation and leukocyte recruitment. Reflecting these multifunctional properties, LSECs display unique structural and phenotypic features that differentiate them from the capillary endothelium present within other organs. It is now clear that LSECs have a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis within the liver and in mediating the immune response during acute and chronic liver injury. In this Review , we outline how LSECs influence the immune microenvironment within the liver and discuss their contribution to immune-mediated liver diseases and the complications of fibrosis and carcinogenesis. \n\nfenestrations lack a diaphragm or basal lamina and are grouped into organized sieve plates, rendering LSECs highly permeable (Fig. 1d). Many studies have implicated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as an essential factor for regulation of fenestrations 21 , but dynamic changes in hepatic fenestration number and size can occur rapidly in response to agents such as alcohol 22 , diet ary constituents 23 and fasting 24 or calorie restriction 25 . The fenestrations act as a 'dynamic filter' (reF. 26 ) to permit the access of macromolecules to parenchymal cells, and in addition, these pores might allow circulating viruses to gain access to hepatocytes 27 .",

These narrow vessels, which are lined with sieve-like fenestrated endothelial cells (liver sinusoidal endothelial cells; LSECs), form a highly permeable barrier that facilitates the rapid exchange of biological and xenobiotic compounds between the blood and the metabolic hepatocytes. As blood passes through this highly efficient filtration system, it is surveyed by local populations of immune cells adjacent to the LSECs, including Kupffer cells (resident hepatic macrophages) and other circulating lymphocytes (Fig. 3). 62 Within the lumen of hepatic sinusoids, CTCs have the potential to extravasate to initiate a metastasis; however, relatively few do. Although a number of CTCs might pass through the hepatic sinusoids, many will be killed by a complex sinusoidal immune surveillance network. 63,64 Importantly, the sinusoids function as active cellular suppressors of metastasis, with cytokine and chemokine crosstalk between sinusoidal endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and circulating lymphocytes acting together to identify CTCs and mark them for cellular killing. 65 This multicellular approach involves the release of pro-apoptotic factors, such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and interferon-\u03b3, by sinusoidal endothelial cells, thereby inducing the direct apoptosis of CTCs. 66 In tandem with this, Kupffer cells lining the sinusoids are able to detect the presence of cancer cells and, through the release of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, recruit a transient lymphocyte niche senses and targets metastatic cells, thereby clearing them from the microvasculature and preventing them from establishing a new metastatic tumour. 67,68",

            "text": "et al., 2019). It is worth noting that the therapeutic effect of L1-10, at least in part, is mediated by LSECs as evidenced by the downregulation of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and CCL2 expression in liver endothelial cells isolated from the liver of NASH mouse (Lefere et al., 2019). Besides, LECT2, a functional ligand of endothelial cell-specific receptor Tie1, was recently found to promote liver fibrosis by inhibiting portal angiogenesis and promoting capillarization of liver sinusoids in various liver fibrosis models, providing a novel possible target for LSECs-mediated liver fibrosis (Xu et al., 2019). Therefore, studies on angiogenesis in the liver including capillarization of LSECs may provide new targets for NASH treatment.",

            "text": "Moreover, the cell yield was relatively high (30-40 million LSECs per liver), and immune staining of liver sections using this antibody showed continuous staining along all sinusoids, to the LSEC specific endocytosis receptor stabilin-2, further validating SE-1/Fc\u03b3RIIb2 as a reliable LSEC marker in rat. The same co-distribution of SE-1 and stabilin-2 in rat liver was reported by [46]. Moreover, flow cytometry of rat NPCs showed that 97.4% of SE-1/Fc\u03b3RIIb2 positive cells were also CD31 positive, supporting their endothelial identity. Rat LSEC expression of CD31 was confirmed by positive staining in rat liver sections, albeit more weakly than in endothelial cells in other vessels, consistent with [69]. Of note, CD31 is upregulated in LSECs in liver inflammation [36,69,70]. CD31 has been reported in KCs. However, a recent study employing macrophage and endothelial reporter mice concluded that what seemed to be a population of CD31 positive KCs after FACS were instead contaminating endothelial cells [71]. CD31 is regularly used as endothelial marker in studies of KC functions in mice [72]. In the present study CD31 staining was only observed along vessel structures in the liver tissue, and co-localized with stabilin-2 in the sinusoids. \n\nThe expression level and intralobular distribution of Fc\u03b3RIIb2, and other LSEC markers may vary between species. Recently, the lack of periportal expression of Fc\u03b3RIIb, and LYVE-1, another commonly used LSEC marker, was reported on immune stained human liver sections [58], suggesting that isolating LSECs from human liver using these receptors as targets may introduce selection bias [36].",

            "text": "The vasculature of the liver is highly specialised, with blood entering through the portal circulation and passing through sinusoids. These narrow vessels, which are lined with sieve-like fenestrated endothelial cells (liver sinusoidal endothelial cells; LSECs), form a highly permeable barrier that facilitates the rapid exchange of biological and xenobiotic compounds between the blood and the metabolic hepatocytes. As blood passes through this highly efficient filtration system, it is surveyed by local populations of immune cells adjacent to the LSECs, including Kupffer cells (resident hepatic macrophages) and other circulating lymphocytes (Fig. 3). 62 Within the lumen of hepatic sinusoids, CTCs have the potential to extravasate to initiate a metastasis; however, relatively few do. Although a number of CTCs might pass through the hepatic sinusoids, many will be killed by a complex sinusoidal immune surveillance network. 63,64 Importantly, the sinusoids function as active cellular suppressors of metastasis, with cytokine and chemokine crosstalk between sinusoidal endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and circulating lymphocytes acting together to identify CTCs and mark them for cellular killing. 65 This multicellular approach involves the release of pro-apoptotic factors, such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and interferon-\u03b3, by sinusoidal endothelial cells, thereby inducing the direct apoptosis of CTCs. 66 In tandem with this, Kupffer cells lining the sinusoids are able to detect the presence of cancer cells and, through the release of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, recruit a transient lymphocyte niche senses and targets metastatic cells, thereby clearing them from the microvasculature and preventing them from establishing a new metastatic tumour. 67,68",

            "text": "The liver is a frontline immune tissue in which antigen-rich blood from the gastrointestinal tract enters via the portal vein and is passed through a network of sinusoids (the capillary bed of the liver). Antigens are effectively trapped by sinusoidal resident APC, such as Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), and DC (229), and the relatively slow sinusoidal blood flow promotes effective interaction of circulating immune cells with these APC (230). Fenestrated sinusoidal endothelium also enables the direct surveillance of hepatocytes by circulating T cells (231). \n\nRecent studies have demonstrated that liver-resident memory CD8 + T cells are established in the sinusoid following systemic infection or vaccination (232) (Figure 7). Liver CD8 + TRM cells in mice are mostly CD69 + , CXCR3 + , and CXCR6 + , but lack the expression of CD103, presumably reflecting the lack of tight junctions in the sinusoidal endothelium. The situation in humans is slightly different since a subset of CD8 + TRM in the human liver are CD103 + in both healthy and hepatitis B virusinfected individuals. In this case, the sequential exposure of the cells to IL-15 and TGF-\u03b2 induces the development of liveradapted CD103 + CD8 + TRM cells (233). Interestingly, mouse liver CD8 + TRM cells exhibit an amoeboid shape and migrate with a crawling action along the sinusoids, whereas circulating CD8 + TEM cells exhibit a round shape and flow rapidly in the sinusoid (232). Lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) has been found to be crucial for the patrolling behavior of liver CD8 + TRM cells in the sinusoid (234). It is also known that Kupffer cells, macrophages, and LSEC in the sinusoid constitutively express CXCL16, a CXCR6 ligand (235)(236)(237), which attracts NK cells, another resident cell population in the sinusoid (238).",

            "text": "Immunoengineering is a dynamic and growing field that leverages the immune system's capabilities to combat diseases, notably cancer and autoimmune disorders. LNPs have revolutionized this field by offering precise delivery of immunomodulatory molecules, transforming immune cells into precise, targeted therapeutic agents. An essential area of focus is the creation of tolerogenic vaccines that promote immune tolerance, potentially transforming treatments for autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis [16], preventing anaphylaxis for peanut allergies [15], and allergic airway disease [192,193]. These vaccines function by inducing antigen-specific regulatory T cells (iTregs). LNPs serve as delivery vessels, carrying mRNA that encodes the target antigens or allergens to specific antigen-presenting cells, such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) or tolerogenic dendritic cells [194]. By employing mannose ligands that bind to the mannose receptor CD206 on LSECs and optimizing the LNP composition with PEGylated lipids, this mannose-mediated approach efficiently homes in on the target cells. This strategy, utilizing liver-targeting ionizable lipids like 246C10 and MC3 for LSEC targeting, has been validated in several studies [15,145,195]. Inflammatory diseases have also been addressed using LNPs. For instance, Veiga et al. attached anti-Ly6c antibodies to LNPs to home in on and treat Ly6c + inflammatory leukocytes involved in inflammatory bowel disease [196]. In cardiology, Rurik et al. utilized LNPs outfitted with anti-CD5 antibodies to target T cells in the spleen. These modified T cells are then reprogrammed into CAR-T cells that target the fibroblast activation protein (FAP), offering a novel strategy to treat cardiac injury [197].",

            "text": "The aim of the present review is to give an outline of the blood clearance function of the mammalian liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which constitute one of the two cellular arms of the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). It is generally accepted today that the hepatic RES consists of two types of specialized clearance cells, namely the liver macrophages, or Kupffer cells, that are geared to take up particles (>200 nm) via phagocytosis, and the non-phagocytic LSECs that are specially equipped for clearance of macromolecules and colloids by receptor-mediated endocytosis (Seternes et al., 2002). This understanding is the result of a scientific evolution that has taken place over more than a century, starting with the discovery of the macrophage (Metchnikoff, 1884(Metchnikoff, , 1968)), and the use of vital stains to locate the anatomical sites of uptake of blood-borne exogenous and endogenous waste material (Kiyono, 1914;Aschoff, 1924). Uptake of vital stains (a type of colloidal particles) occurred in so-called \"reticuloendothelial cells\" (Aschoff, 1924), which are endothelial cells with high scavenging activity (Seternes et al., 2002). Readers who wish to look deeper into the historical backdrops and the scientific evolution of the development of the RES concept are referred to Smedsr\u00f8d (2004) and S\u00f8rensen et al. (2012). \n\nA series of experiments during the 1980s established that soluble macromolecules and nanoparticles of various kinds were rapidly cleared from the circulation of mammals mainly by specialized endothelial cells in the liver sinusoids, with negligible uptake in the Kupffer cells (Smedsr\u00f8d et al., 1990b). Violating the paradigm at the time, that the Kupffer cells alone constituted the RES (Van Furth et al., 1972), these findings came as a surprise.",

            "text": "Another important cell type involved in the relationship between microvascular thrombosis and fibrosis progression is hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). It is commonly recognized that LSECs interact with other cells, such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, HSCs, hepatocytes, and Kupffer cells, which is critical in the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to fibrosis [49]. Healthy endothelial cells, on the other hand, express molecules that inhibit platelet activation, coagulation, and thrombosis [50]. Expression of pro-and anti-thrombotic elements changes when LSECs lose their antithrombotic phenotype due to endothelial dysfunction [51,52]. The expression of thrombomodulin, nitric oxide, or prostaglandin I2 is attenuated in the presence of dysfunctional LSECs, which also expose Von Willebrand factor (VWF), integrins, and other receptors that interact with activated platelets and cause clot formation [53,54]. It has also been shown that hepatitis viruses, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and murine acute hepatitis virus 3, a member of the Coronaviridae, can induce LSECs to overexpress Fgl2/fibroleukin prothrombinase, which is crucial for the initiation and progression of fibrin deposition [55][56][57]. Recent histological and molecular studies in a mouse model of congestive hepatopathy demonstrated that LSECs exposed to mechanical stretch upregulate Notch-dependent transcription factors through an integrin-dependent pathway and interaction with the mechanosensitive piezocalcium channel. As a result, LSECs increase the production of neutrophil chemoattractant C-X-C motif ligand (CXCL) 1, attracting platelets and neutrophils into hepatic sinusoids and leading to the formation of extracellular neutrophil traps (NETs).",

[39,40] showed that CRC circulating cells trigger the release of proinflammatory TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 from KCs, thereby upregulating the expression of E-selectin and other adhesion molecules on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and enhancing liver metastases [39,40].",

            "text": "The number of NP-positive HSCs in the hydrophilic-NP-PBS treated liver was significantly highest among all NP-treated livers (Figure 5B), and so hydrophilic surface-modified NPs might be more likely to reach HSCs when compared with the hydrophobic surface-modified NPs. Besides the surface characteristic of NPs, their size is also a highly important factor affecting NP cellular distribution in the liver [32]. In the liver, NPs should penetrate LSECs to reach HSCs and hepatocytes. NPs mainly pass the LSECs through the fenestrae [32]. Generally, the size of LSEC fenestrae in mice varies between 50 and 280 nm [33], and therefore the NPs we used in the present study could be delivered to HSCs, as well as hepatocytes. However, it is thought that comparatively smaller-sized NPs would be more effective for delivery to HSCs and hepatocytes. Importantly, NPs greater than 280 nm may be highly specific to targeting Kupffer cells. Interestingly, there was a significant difference in the ratio of NP-positive HSCs between hydrophobic-NP-PBS treated liver and hydrophobic-NP-olive oil treated liver. Thus, the NPs' size depends on the presence or absence of silica NP aggregation. In the absence of NP aggregation, NPs seem to pass the LSEC barrier easily via the fenestrae, due to the smaller size of the NPs relative to the fenestrae diameters. \n\nNP delivery to the HSCs has been one of the most important issues for the treatment of chronic liver fibrosis [34][35][36], a condition induced by the activation of HSCs and their transformation to a myofibroblast-producing collagen-rich extracellular matrix, resulting in severe disruption of the liver architecture. Kupffer cells, LSECs, and a collagenous extracellular matrix have been insurmountable obstacles for NP or drug delivery to HSCs to treat liver fibrosis, despite several studies on this issue [33].",

This would result in the induction of antigen-specific T effector cells, which can home to each tissue, and thereby also reach metastases irrespective of their location. However, as delineated in preclinical rodent biodistribution studies, systemically administered NPs of larger size (\u2265 200 nm diameter) may accumulate e.g., in lung as reported e.g., for mesoporous silica particles [166] or chitosan NP [167]. Moreover, most NP formulations tested so far accumulate in the liver [168] as a consequence of the general clearance function of the liver [169], conferred by Kupffer cells (KC) as the major liver-resident macrophage population [170] and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) [171]. KC and LSEC are equipped with a number of danger receptors, including different C-type lectin receptors (CLR) as e.g., the mannose receptor CD206 [172,173], and scavenger receptors that broadly bind negatively charged ligands [174,175]. Besides, KC [176] and LSEC [177] express high affinity Fc receptors, and KC also express complement receptors [178]. Therefore, it is conceivable that NPs, depending on the characteristics of the protein corona formed in vivo [179], also including complement activation as shown for lectin-coated NP [180], may be internalized preferentially by KC and LSEC. The formation of a pronounced protein corona may be attenuated by PEGylation, shown to reduce unwanted binding to KC [181] and LSEC [182], and by conjugation with CD47, which serves as a 'do not-eat-me' ignal for macrophages as evaluated for liposomes [183]. Furthermore, targeting moieties on NP may engage according receptors on either non-parenchymal liver cell population. An example is mannose, which",

            "text": "LNPs are the most researched liver-specific targeting nanosystems loaded with mRNA. The main liver-specific targeting mechanisms are passive and endogenous targeting, owing to the structure and function of the liver. Research indicates that LNPs with a pKa value of six -seven are best-suited for mRNA delivery to the liver [114]. Among them, ionizable cationic lipids containing amino groups, such as DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) [46], 5A2-SC8 [103], 306O i10 [104], and cationic lipid-modified aminoglycosides (CLAs) [105] exhibit high liver-targeting efficacy. The distribution of the LNPs with amino groups in liver can be as high as 81%, with the mRNA expression over 90% [104]. Nevertheless, the targeted precision delivery of mRNA should be carefully evaluated at the cellular level, as the degree of mRNA expression varies among different liver cell types in the above-mentioned research. \n\nHepatocytes account for about 80% of liver tissue and are implicated in many hereditary diseases, making them the primary targets for mRNA delivery. To enter the Disse space and directly contact hepatocytes, mRNA-LNPs for hepatocyte-targeted delivery are generally smaller than the fenestration of hepatic vascular endothelium, which measures approximately 150 nm. Hashiba et al. [115] synthesized a series of mRNA-LNPs with varying particle sizes and demonstrated that LNPs with sizes ranging from 60 to 100 nm can pass through the sinusoidal endothelial fenestrae of the liver, enhancing the hepatocyte targeting efficiency of mRNAs. Siegwart et al. [106,116,117] proposed a selector organ targeting (SORT) strategy (Fig. 7A). They synthesized 5A2-SC8-mRNA-LNPs with a particle size of approximately 122 nm. Incorporation of 20% ionizable cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammonium-propane (DODAP) into LNPs improved the uptake efficiency of hepatocytes to as high as 93% [106].",

            "text": "Depletion of Kupffer cells to minimize liver sequestration and enhance nanoparticle circulation to target tissues. For example, clodronate liposomes are used to selectively target macrophages, resulting in their depletion. [40] Hepatocytes are the main parenchymal cells of the liver, responsible for liver-specific metabolic functions, including the synthesis of proteins (e.g., albumin), detoxification, and lipid metabolism. Because of interactions with LDL receptors, these cells are highly permeable to LNPs, especially those smaller than 100 nm in diameter. ApoE-coated LNPs bind to LDL receptors and allow LNP uptake into hepatocytes. 23 The heterogeneity of hepatocytes is also remarkable; they exhibit zonation across the liver acinus, with different metabolic roles depending on their location. 34 Hepatocyte zonation influences LNP behavior. Zone 1 (periportal) hepatocytes perform oxidative metabolism, while Zone 3 (pericentral) hepatocytes specialize in detoxification and lipid metabolism. Zone 3 hepatocytes enhance ApoE-mediated LNP uptake through higher LDL receptor expression. 23 Smaller LNPs (<100 nm) use the fenestrations in LSECs to target Zone 3, while the proximity of Zone 1 to blood flow facilitates rapid uptake. 30,31 Therapeutic designs should consider the specific functions of hepatocyte zonation: for example, targeting Zone 3 for detoxification therapies due to its role in lipid and xenobiotic detoxification, and Zone 1 for metabolic disorders because of its focus on oxidative metabolism. 41 Moreover, variations in ploidy among hepatocytes are vital in their spatial and functional specialization. This adds another dimension to the complexity of liver zonation, shaping critical metabolic processes, for example, lipid metabolism and the clearance of nanoparticles. 34,42 ECs are highly specified endothelial cells that line the liver sinusoids.",

            "text": "Endothelial cells are the \"gateway\" to the organs of the body and are significantly involved in cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Therefore, modulating endothelial gene expression could stand to impact and improve major chronic diseases. Substantial progress has been made in developing LNPs for nucleic acid delivery to endothelial cells. A major barrier to this field has been hepatic tropism, leading to nucleic acid delivery principally to the liver. Here, we reviewed major strategies to overcome this barrier: while modulation of lipid composition can drive nucleic acid delivery to pulmonary, splenic, and liver cells, these approaches are somewhat limited to these organs. Alternative methods have expanded nucleic acid delivery to other sites: incorporation of cationic lipids or antibodies can enable delivery to the endothelium.\n\nThe use of cationic lipids may present translational challenges due to their recognized toxicity [261]. This has motivated the development of ionizable lipids, which are conditionally cationic, as well as the use of antibodies and peptides that bind to endothelial-specific receptors through molecular recognition rather than non-specific electrostatic interactions. Further elucidation of the relationship between the protein corona and tissue tropism [190], coupled with profiling of tissue endothelial cell surface receptors during health and disease, could significantly inform LNP design. Moreover, a recent report highlighted the importance of nonintravenous routes in facilitating nucleic acid delivery to cells of the central nervous system [262], which is challenging to target from the blood space due to the blood-brain barrier. Creative application of alternative routes (e.g., stents, nonintravenous) with materials chemistry and proteomics could further expand the set of targetable tissue vasculature.\n\nNucleic acid cargos can also offer a degree of spatial (which tissues) and temporal (duration) control of gene modulation. DNA can be programmed with tissue-specific promoters for selective expression; recently mRNA can also be endowed with tissue-specific translation [263]. Moreover, a combination of designed Cas9 mRNA and pre-delivery of a mRNA-inhibiting siRNA to the liver can decrease liver gene editing and augment splenic and lung endothelial editing [264].

            "text": "Unlike the brain and lung, the vessels in the liver are fenestrated and lack an organized basement membrane that wraps endothelial cells. In this regard, liver metastatic cells face much less stress from tight junctional barriers during extravasation.\n\nLiver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are the first group of stromal cells that metastatic tumors encounter in liver. Upon the interaction with tumor cells, LSECs secrete nitric oxide (NO) and IFN-\u03b3, which result in the FasL-induced apoptosis to restrain liver colonization (Braet et al. 2007). Moreover, following liver colonization, Kupffer cells, which are bone marrow-derived macrophages, can recognize and eliminate tumor cells (Kimura et al. 2016). Furthermore, Kupffer cells release a variety of cytokines to activate other anti-tumor innate immune populations, such as NK cells (Van den Eynden et al. 2013). Collectively, these liver resident cells work together to prevent liver metastasis (Fig. 3C).\n\nAlthough LSECs, Kupffer cells, and NK cells serve as the first line of defense to prevent liver metastasis, the stresses they generate also drive the development of metastasis fitness pathways. For example, upon the interaction of tumor cells and LSECs, increased expression of prometastatic surface adhesion molecules, such as VCAM-I, ICAM-I and E-selectin have been observed (Brodt et al. 1997). LSECs also contribute to liver metastasis by facilitating EMT and tumor-induced angiogenesis Banerjee et al. 2015). Similarly, adhesion to tumor cells promote the Kupffer cells to produce cytokines and growth factors, such as IL-6, VEGF, MMP9 and MMP14, to enhance tumor survival, proliferation and migration, and thereby promote liver metastasis ( Fig. 3C; Brodt 2016). The blood-brain barrier serves as the first line of defense to prevent brain colonization. However, tumor cells transmigrate the barrier by enhancing adhesion, facilitating angiogenesis, inducing endothelial cell apoptosis, and degrading ECM and tight junctions. Upon colonization, while capable of inducing tumor",

            "text": "Inflammation is an essential part involved in the process of liver fibrosis. Hepatitis and NAFLD, especially NASH, have recently received increasing attention (70). LSECs interact with portal circulation via expression of surface receptors and release of paracrine factors, such as intercellular adhesion molecule, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, VAP-1, chemokines and cytokines (71), recruiting the circulating leucocytes to enter the liver parenchyma. Exploring these inflammatory mediators may help to discover new therapeutic targets for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Gola et al (72) considered LSECs as a microbiome sensor, sustaining commensal-induced MyD88-dependent signaling to regulate the composition of the peri-cellular matrix involved in chemokine gradient formation. In vitro and in vivo findings demonstrate that specific focal adhesion proteins recruited by phosphofructokinase can parlay LSEC mechanotransduction into stiffness-induced angiocrine signaling and mediate neutrophil infiltration and promote liver fibrosis (73). By contrast, Brozat et al found that LSEC-derived JAM-A had no effect on cell migration from sinusoids or adhesion to LSECs (10), suggesting a complex role of leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in promoting liver fibrosis. \n\nLSECs and platelets. At present, an increasing number of individuals realize that the platelets are no longer bystanders in liver diseases and anti-platelet therapy has been proven effective in treating chronic liver injury (74,75). In vitro studies show that platelet adhesion is partly mediated by integrin (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and \u03b1v\u03b23) with human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (76), leading to platelet and endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment. On the other hand, in wild-type mice after chronic CCl 4 challenge plasma Von Willebrand factor levels are increased (77), which could be associated with the interaction between platelets and LSECs. However, it is not clear whether platelet adhesion is associated with capillarization.",

            "text": "Sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) are highly specialized endothelial cells hallmarked by an absence of basal lamina and fenestrae that constitute the units of sinusoids. Sinusoids are vessels identified only in liver, spleen, and bone marrow. (42,43) SECs in the liver, named LSECs, are fundamental for hepatic tissue homeostasis, even though they account only for a small percentage of total liver tissue. Because of the low number of cells and the highly specialized phenotype, protocols for LSEC isolation and culture are extremely challenging. (24,25) Thus, optimized methods are required to prepare highly pure preparations of primary mouse LSECs. To achieve an efficient yield and purity, most of the available protocols for mouse LSEC isolation require the application of immunoselection, (44) a process that might alter the phenotype of cultured cells. \n\nHere, we used a method, which is applicable to mouse and rat, wherein the immunoselection step is substituted by selective cell adherence. (26) With this protocol, we isolated mouse and rat LSECs with a very high yield, excellent viability (\u224899%), and purity (\u224895%). \n\nCultured LSECs from mice were critical for this study in order to analyze whether cytokines secreted from LSECs exert autocrine effects. We performed ligand/receptor analysis of publicly available RNAsequencing data from murine LSECs and showed that TGF\u03b2 family members are strongly enriched, whereby BMP2, BMP6, and TGF\u03b21 are the most highly expressed ligands (Fig. 1). Here, we explored the autocrine effects of BMP2, BMP6, and TGF\u03b21 ligands in LSECs. \n\nUnexpectedly, LSECs do not respond to BMP2 and BMP6 stimulation despite high expression of the respective signaling machinery (receptors and transducers). The unresponsiveness of LSECs to BMPs is partially explained by high levels of the BMP type-I receptor inhibitor FKBP12. (30,31)",

Various studies have highlighted this phenomenon, with Lunov et al. showing that 20-nm and 60-nm SPIONs accumulated irrespective of their size in macrophages via clathrin-mediated and scavenger receptor A endocytosis, with the larger SPIONs exhibiting up to 60 times greater uptake than the smaller ones [39]. Kupffer cells have also been shown to take up low-density lipoprotein (LDL) NBMs and liposomes of sizes ranging from 27 to 590 nm [40]. Despite their low abundance and challenging location, i.e., their residence in the space of Disse adjacent to endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have also been shown to take up various NBMs, including liposomes, AuNPs, SPIONS, and polymeric NBMs [41][42][43][44][45]. HSC-targeting NBMs also have implications in the treatment of liver fibrosis, with surface receptors allowing NBMs to directly target HSCs, provided they have not been removed from circulation by LSECs or Kupffer cells [27]. LSECs, the cell type which forms continuous linings along the vasculature of the liver sinusoid, may also have implications for NBMs, with studies from Kamps et al. Akhter et al. and Kren et al. illustrating that they can successfully take up both AuNPs, micelles and liposomes [40,46,47].",

            "text": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are specific to the liver microcirculation. LSEC line the liver capillaries and transport blood from branches of the portal vein and the hepatic artery into the central vein of liver lobules. They provide a porous barrier between blood components and liver parenchymal cells, i.e., hepatocytes. Moreover their endocytic capacities make them effective scavengers for molecules such as albumin, acetylated low-density lipoproteins (Ac-LDL) and antigens in the bloodstream [1,2]. \n\nAt the interface between blood components and parenchymal cells, LSEC are able to interact with various cell types and participate in several physiological and pathological events. For example, LSEC dysregulation is believed to constitute a critical step in liver fibrosis [3] and in non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis progression [4]. Moreover, LSEC have dual roles in liver tissue in the surgical setting, having deleterious effects through involvement in ischemia-reperfusion injury during liver transplantation [5,6] and beneficial effects through regulating and orchestrating liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy [7]. Notably, we detailed in a recent review the potential role of the interactions between platelets and LSEC in the regenerative process [8,9]. \n\nTo study the biological functions of LSEC and to identify the interplay between LSEC and other blood or liver cells, techniques allowing for the isolation and purification of LSEC have been developed over the last decades. Early methods for liver cell dispersion relied on liver tissue mechanical disruption or on differences in cell-specific sensitivity to enzymatic digestion. LSEC enrichment was obtained by isopycnic gradient centrifugation or selective adherence to materials. Currently, published isolation protocols rely on liver tissue enzymatic digestion, discarding parenchymal cells and then further purification of LSEC from the non-parenchymal cell fraction.",

Other receptors expressed by LSECs (L-SIGN, liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin; and LSECtin, liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin) have been shown to interact with surface glycoproteins of Ebola virus, HIV, SARS coronavirus (CoV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Shetty et al., 2018), and recently with SARS-CoV-2 FIGURE 1 | Fate of extracellular matrix turnover products, the dual cell principle of waste clearance and the role of liver scavenger cells in waste clearance. (A) Molecular fragments are continuously released during the constant turnover of the extracellular matrix. Some of the degradation products are digested locally but a large proportion is drained to lymph nodes where they are endocytosed by macrophages and sinusoidal endothelial cells (Laurent et al., 1986a;Fraser et al., 1997). The fragments that escape uptake in lymph node cells leak to the blood circulation (\u00d8stgaard et al., 1995), and are removed from blood by endocytosis in liver scavenger cells. (B) Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells, which together make up the largest population of scavenger cells in the body, share the scavenging workload in the liver (Seternes et al., 2002). LSECs are specialized on effective clathrin-mediated endocytosis of soluble macromolecules and nanoparticles, whereas larger particles, such as bacteria and dead and dying cells are cleared by the Kupffer cells, illustrating \"the dual cell principle of waste clearance\" (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2012). (C) The uptake of soluble macromolecules in LSECs are mediated by a range of endocytic receptors, with the mannose receptor, stabilin-1, stabilin-2, and Fc\u03b3RIIb2 being the most investigated.",

This approach holds the potential to mitigate the undesirable delivery of LNPs to extrahepatic organs, thereby minimizing the occurrence of side effects. The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) is overexpressed on the surface of hepatoma cells. It has been suggested that ASGPR-mediated endocytosis is an effective delivery strategy. 6][167][168] Another idea is to conjugate the LNPs with ASGPR mAb, which may be an attempt. 167 n a study by Kim et al., 169 it was found that achieving LSEC-specific RNA delivery, could not succeed by controlling the size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. Due to the specific expression of mannose receptors on human and mouse LSECs, they prepared LNPs doped with 0.5-4.5% mannose PEG-lipid, and found that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) has the best LSECs selective delivery effect. 169,170 Miao et al. 171 have proposed a glycolipid-like polymer named galactosylated chitosan oligosaccharide-SS-octadecylamine (Gal-CSSO). The galactosyl residues modified on it can selectively target HCs, the chitosan oligosaccharide is conducive to the endosomal escape, and the structure of -SS-can help the HC microenvironment respond to facilitate drug release. \n\nMany carriers with excellent liver selective delivery have been approved for drug delivery or have started clinical trials.

Thus, we screened the propagated liver M\u00f8 for the expression of certain integrins that are generally expressed in leukocytes [14,20]. We found that M\u00f8 expressed Itga4, Itga5, Itga6, Itgal, Itgam, Itgax, Itgb1, and Itgb2, but not Itga1, Itga2, Itga3, and Itgad using RT-PCR (Figure 5A), and we confirmed the expression of these proteins in M\u00f8 using flow cytometry analysis (Figure 5B). These findings indicated that liver M\u00f8 likely express \u03b14\u03b21, \u03b15\u03b21, \u03b16\u03b21, \u03b1L\u03b22, \u03b1M\u03b22, and \u03b1X\u03b22 integrins.

We found clear Icam-1 and Vcam-1 expression in these cells using RT-PCR, strong ICAM-1, and substantial VCAM-1 expression in LSECs using flow cytometry (Figure 6A,B).

In healthy liver, LSECs display unique morphology characterized by the presence of non-diaphragmed transcellular pores, or so-called fenestrae, and the lack of basement membrane [3]. These structural and phenotypic features maintain proper liver functions and homeostasis, promote efficient trafficking of lipoproteins, and regulate liver regeneration and immune tolerance [1,2,4,5]. The sizes of LSEC fenestrae range from approximately 50 to 200 nm in diameter and the majority of them are grouped into several-tens ultrastructures termed as sieve plates [6,7].

            "text": "Aging is associated with gradual changes in liver structure and physiological/pathological functions in hepatic cells including hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). LSECs are specialized hepatic endothelial cells that regulate liver homeostasis. These cells actively impact the hepatic microenvironment as they have fenestrations and a thin morphology to allow substance exchange between circulating blood and the liver tissue. As aging occurs, LSECs have a reduction in both the number and size of fenestrations, which is referred to as pseudocapillarization. This along with the aging of the liver leads to increased oxidative stress, decreased availability of nitric oxide, decreased hepatic blood flow, and increased inflammatory cytokines in LSECs. Vascular aging can also lead to hepatic hypoxia, HSC activation, and liver fibrosis. In this review, we described the basic structure of LSECs, and the effect of LSECs on hepatic inflammation and fibrosis during aging process. We briefly summarized the changes of hepatic microcirculation during liver inflammation, the effect of aging on the clearance function of LSECs, the interactions between LSECs and immunity, hepatocytes or other hepatic nonparenchymal cells, and the therapeutic intervention of liver diseases by targeting LSECs and vascular system. Since LSECs play an important role in the development of liver fibrosis and the changes of LSEC phenotype occur in the early stage of liver fibrosis, the study of LSECs in the fibrotic liver is valuable for the detection of early liver fibrosis and the early intervention of fibrotic response.",

            "text": "Immune cells are important targets for nucleic acid delivery because they play a key role in many diseases, including cancer, inflammatory conditions, and autoimmune diseases. In addition to the reticuloendothelial system of the liver, immune cells are distributed throughout the body, particularly in the spleen. The delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids to leukocytes, such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and lymphocytes, provides an immune stimulation strategy to introduce genetic material with anti-inflammatory potential or to induce T-cell regulation. Targeting immune cells can directly affect the immune response, which is particularly important in treating diseases related to immune system dysfunction [36,37]. \n\nTo enhance mRNA delivery efficiency and cell specificity, researchers have developed LNPs that target specific cells. These LNPs are designed for selective uptake by particular cells, facilitating efficient protein expression of the encapsulated mRNA within the target cells. Cell-specific uptake usually relies on ligand-receptor interactions in which the ligand binds to a specific receptor on the cell surface and promotes the internalization of LNPs. Surface modification is an effective strategy for enhancing the targeting ability",

            "text": "Kupffer cells phagocytose and destroy pathogens and other foreign objects present in the blood. The uptake and retention rate are highly associated with the nanoparticle's surface charge, size, and ligand chemistry. In vitro study shows that nanoparticles with strong anionic or cationic surface charges will interact with serum protein, forming a protein corona and aggregates, causing an increased interaction with macrophages [35,36]. PEGylated nanoparticles are less efficiently taken by phagocytes. Sinusoidal endothelial cells found lining the vasculature of the liver sinusoid are also involved in innate immunity. It is involved in the elimination of waste macromolecules, including components of connective tissue and hyaluronan from blood circulation by receptor-ligand interactions. Both Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells likely compete for the nanoparticles present in the circulation. In addition, the nanoparticles' physicochemical properties, such as the hydrodynamic size, influence the mechanism of cellular internalization. Nanoparticles with a diameter greater than 100 nm or aggregated nanoparticles lower than 100 nm will have greater interaction with Kupffer cells. In contrast, sinusoidal endothelial cells might take up smaller monodisperse nanoparticles to a higher degree [36]. Several key studies discussed above found that the liver preferentially took up the folate-targeting nanoparticles more than its non-targeting counterpart. Perhaps this phenomenon might be due to the FR-\u03b2 expressed by activated macrophages present in the liver. Several studies noted that the EPR effect may have a lack of impact on shortcirculating folate-functionalized nanoparticles due to rapid uptake by the liver [14,18]. \n\nAltering folate blood serum levels may have an impact on the folate-functionalized nanoparticles' effectiveness by affecting liver uptake. Low-folate diets are demonstrated to elevate tissue retention of the folate-functionalized carrier, subsequently depleting the amount present in the circulation [14,37].",

In the physiological state, HCC-TAM and LSEC prevent immune responses by suppressing CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes. Similar to LSEC, KCs and HDCs secrete suppressive cytokines and induce an increase in Treg cells. 107 Furthermore, the HCC microenvironment is characterized by the high expression of immune checkpoint molecules. The combination of LipC6 bound CD8 + cells and eliminated the immune response leads to a significant decrease in the activity of the effectors of anti-tumor immune responses, which results in tumor immune evasion. In light of these findings, improving the tumor microenvironment is key for the treatment of HCC. 108 Li et al have developed a liposome containing C6ceramide (LipC6) and showed that it not only binds to the CD8 + T cell-mediated immune response to eliminate liver tumors in situ, but also promoted the polarization of TAMs to the M1 phenotype. 109 Immunoliposomes are monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments modified on the surface of liposomes that can actively target tumor tissue for specific immunotherapeutic purposes.

Liver fibrosis results in a continual accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and paves the way for replacement of parenchyma with nonfunctional scar tissue. The fibrotic condition results in drastic changes in the local mechanical, chemical, and biological microenvironment of the tissue. Liver parenchyma is supported by an efficient network of vasculature lined by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). These nonparenchymal cells are highly specialized resident endothelial cell type with characteristic morphological and functional features. Alterations in LSECs phenotype including lack of LSEC fenestration, capillarization, and formation of an organized basement membrane have been shown to precede fibrosis and promote hepatic stellate cell activation. Here, we review the interplay of LSECs with the dynamic changes in the fibrotic liver microenvironment such as matrix rigidity, altered ECM protein profile, and cell-cell interactions to provide insight into the pivotal changes in LSEC physiology and the extent to which it mediates the progression of liver fibrosis. Establishing the molecular aspects of LSECs in the light of fibrotic microenvironment is valuable towards development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic targets of liver fibrosis.",

            "text": "Although multiple molecules and factors promote systemic clearance of cell debris, the role of the cellular reticuloendothelial system in debris clearance cannot be overstated. A century ago, Aschoff introduced the concept of the reticuloendothelial system, outlining a principle of particle uptake and degradation by both tissue-specific macrophages and endothelial cells of the liver, adrenal gland, pituitary gland, spleen and bone marrow sinusoids [124]. The liver is home to the largest reticuloendothelial system in the body, comprising both the Kupffer cells and the fenestrated liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Kupffer cells are the tissue-resident macrophages of the liver, constituting 80% to 90% of all resident tissue macrophages in the entire body, which highlights their importance. Positioned in the sinusoid vasculature, particularly near the portal areas, Kupffer cells are directly exposed to the circulation and form the first line of hepatic defense by utilizing their array of PRRs to scavenge DAMPs released by dying cells [125]. Upon activation, Kupffer cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and TNF) and chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8, and CCL2), resulting in the recruitment of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes to the site of injury [126]. In parallel, with a total surface area of 210 m 2 in an adult human liver, the LSECs are responsible for filtering vast amounts of particles passing through the bloodstream. They are the only fenestrated endothelium in the body with open passage between the blood and underlying parenchyma, with the numerous 100-150 nm diameter fenestrations of the LSECs clustered together in \"sieve plates\". These facilitate the internalization of a myriad of macromolecules [127,128]. Of note, not all species have their SECs in the liver, as mammals do.",

LSECs can express PD-L1. PD-L1 interacts with PD-1 on T cells, which hinders T cell function and suppresses its anti-tumor activity, which mediates liver immune tolerance (87)(88)(89)(90). Moreover, LSECs also employ other inhibitory or immunomodulatory molecules such as Fas ligand, LSECtin, and IL-10 to effectively regulate T-cells function (91). Furthermore, both in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that LSECs can facilitate the conversion of Treg into functional suppressor cells (92). In summary, LSECs possess robust immunomodulatory capabilities and play a pivotal role in maintaining immune tolerance. Ongoing evaluations are currently underway for antibodies targeting PD-L1 expression in LSECs, such as durvalumab (93). Consequently, future research endeavors should focus on elucidating the expression of PD-L1 within LSECs and its significance within the vascular-immune niche in VC.",

Compared to monocyte-derived macrophages, Kupffer cells favor tolerance by expression of IL-10 which induces Tregs and PD-L1 under steady-state conditions [23,37]. Kupffer cells are also the first line of defense from cancer cells derived from other organs that metastasize to the liver [38]. Further contributing to tolerance, monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) can be recruited to the liver from the bone marrow; once there, cytokines such as macrophage colonystimulating factor and hepatocyte growth factor induce a tolerogenic phenotype [39].\n\nTwo non-bone marrow-derived cell types unique to the liver, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), are critical to these interactions with gut flora and mediation of tolerance by the liver. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are specialized endothelial cells which sample portal venous blood and act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with the ability to cross-prime T cells [40,41]. LSECs constitutively express TLR4 resulting in NF\u03baB signaling and produce inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species in response to LPS [35,42].

The clearance of liver sinusoidal endothelial cell of nanotheranostic agents from the blood circulation is the most important reason for short blood circulation time of nanotheranostic agents. Any strategy, either modulation of nanotheranostic agents or regulation of liver sinusoidal endothelial cell clearance ability, that prolongs blood circulation time can increase delivery efficiency to disease cells. Previous studies usually focused on modulating the surface of nanotheranostic agents. For example, the stealth coating of nanotheranostic agents, such as PEG-coated agents, can increase blood circulation time to cross vasculature wall to reach disease cells, improving theranostic outcomes. Recently, a new strategy has been developed based on regulation of liver sinusoidal clearance ability, such as beforehand injecting scavenger ligands (fucoidan, polyinosinic acid (poly-I), and dextran sulfate, agents used for receptor) to saturate the availability of clearance pathways. However, liver sinusoid has diverse clearance pathways, decorating a ligand on the nanotheranostic agents is difficult to saturate all clearance pathways. \n\nIn 2020, Kataoka and co-workers used precisely designed oligo(l-lysine) (OligoLys) conjugated with two-armed PEG at its carboxyl end (two-arm-PEG-OligoLys) for anchoring PEG to liver sinusoidal walls, which implement transient and selective stealth coating of liver sinusoidal endothelium (uncoated the endothelium of other tissues). [145] PEG coating of liver sinusoidal endothelium effectively and simultaneously inhibited of various clearance pathways. Additionally, OligoLys with a two-armed PEG was finally cleared from sinusoidal walls to the bile, while OligoLys with linear PEG was difficult to be cleared from the sinusoidal walls, possibly resulting in persistent disturbance of liver functions.",

To overcome this limitation and to attain a pure LEC population, we recommend FACS sorting of cells positive for endothelial cell marker CD31 and negative for hematopoietic marker CD45. Second, the isolation of LEC-enriched population yields on average 1.5-2.5 million cells of enriched LECs per mouse. After FACS, the number of sorted LECs isolated from an adult wild-type mouse liver varies between 190,000 and 300,000 cells. The low cell number can be limiting for some downstream applications. To overcome this second limitation, pooling of cells from several mice may be required. Third, this protocol enriches for all LEC types. Notably, 80% of LECs are liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The field is still lacking specific antibodies and protocols which selectively identify and therefore distinguish LSECs, macrovascular venous ECs, such as portal vein and central vein ECs, macrovascular arterial ECs, and lymphatic ECs.",

            "text": "The crosstalk between LSECs and other cells of the HCC TME is crucial for the progression of liver fibrosis and, subsequently, HCC development. Viral and bacterial infections affect morphological changes of LSECs, and stimulate the release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) (Table 1), while reducing the production of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and PGE 2 , thereby disturbing liver tolerance (Figure 1) [41]. Limmer et al. showed that LSECs are a non-myeloid cell population able to the cross-present exogenous antigens. In contrast to cross-presentation of antigens by professional antigen-presenting cells, LSECs lead to tolerance, rather than activation, of CD8 + T cells [42]. LSECs promote CD8 + T cell tolerance development towards antigens from apoptotic tumor cells, contributing to tumor immune escape [43]. It was also observed that during HCC, LSECs overexpress PD-L1 [44] to inhibit T cell activity and support tumor immune evasion [45]. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are specialized fenestrated endothelial cells without a basement membrane lining the hepatic sinusoids. LSECs form a barrier between parenchymal cells and sinusoidal capillaries, crucial for maintaining immune and metabolic homeostasis [37]. Their primary function is the clearance of blood-born waste from systemic circulation and the digestive tract by filtration and endocytosis [38]. During some pathological conditions, LSECs undergo capillarization by losing their fenestration and developing a basement membrane [39]. Under physiological conditions, fenestrated LSECs promote liver stem cell quiescence, whereas capillarized LSECs initiate stem cell activation through the release of PDGF (Table 1), and decreased expression of vasoprotective Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), preceding liver fibrosis, whereas in a normal state, fenestrated LSECs keep liver stem cells in quiescence [40].",

We studied CPP liver clearance by intravital 2-photon microscopy. Figure 2A shows that primary CPP clearance from sinusoids into liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) occurred in <1 min. Since the sinusoidal endothelial cells are typically thin, the CPP associated signal is difficult to see on the stills of Figure 2A and can more easily be studied in the videos (Supplementary Movie 1). Kupffer cells showed a strong CPP associated fluorescence as early as 2 min after injection. Thereafter, primary CPP in Kupffer cells were rapidly degraded, shown by a fast decline in signal after about 15 min. Figure 3 illustrates secondary CPP clearance from sinusoids, first into Kupffer cells within 2 min, and only later \u223c25 min after injection into LSEC as illustrated by the cartoons above the micrographs. Unlike in primary CPP, no decline in Kupffer cellassociated fluorescence was observed with secondary CPP during the observation period. Kupffer cell-associated fluorescence following secondary CPP clearance was three-to four-fold higher than sinusoidal endothelial cell-associated fluorescence following primary CPP suggesting preferential clearance of crystalloid particles like secondary CPP over soft colloidal particles like primary CPP. Supplementary Movies 1, 2 provided in the supplement illustrate complete clearance sequences of primary and secondary CPP in the liver underscoring differential clearance by LSEC and Kupffer cell macrophages, respectively.",

Using these mannose-modified LNPs, a single intravenous dose of 0.5 mg/kg siRNA was reported to reduce the serum concentration of factor VIII, which is mainly produced by LSECs, by nearly 10%. Notably, its significant reduction was not observed in the original LNPs. In this report, the mannose modification changed their particle sizes from~40 nm to~100 nm, and this difference may also contribute to LSEC targeting. By using galactose-modified LNPs as a control, it was demonstrated that the ApoE protein corona-mediated uptake of LNPs can be switched to active targeting via receptor-mediated endocytosis. In addition, the effect of active targeting by mannose modification to LNPs has been investigated in intramuscularly and intradermally administered mRNA vaccines using mannose-cholesterol amine conjugate, which enhanced the induction of liquid and cellular immunities [76].\n\nAnother example is the brain-targeting LNPs modified with neurotransmitters, which are known to penetrate the BBB [48]. Specifically, the lipidoid NT1-O14B having tryptamine, a neurotransmitter, in its head and two alkyl chains in its tail connected by disulfide and ester bonds was developed. For preparation of antisense oligonucleotides-encapsulating LNPs, NT1-O14B was mixed with 306-O12B-3, a bioreducible and biodegradable lipid with disulfide and ester bonds. 306-O12B-3 has been demonstrated to be useful in the LNP-based delivery of antisense oligonucleotides, in a 3:7 wt ratio, in addition to 4 wt % of DSPE-PEG2000.

            "text": "The parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells in the liver microenvironment play a unique role in the pathology of liver fibrosis. The progression and regression of liver fibrosis rely on a complex interplay between the hepatocytes, LSECs, stellate cells, and Kupffer cells and the noncellular components of the fibrotic microenvironment [14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in fibrosis progression has a number of clinical implications, including the development of therapeutic interventions to impede or reverse hepatic fibrosis, some of which are already available [1,2,21]. \n\nThe high metabolic activity of the liver demands an efficient vasculature in the organ. The intricate network of capillaries of the liver is lined by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), a specialized endothelial cell type that is phenotypically different from vascular endothelial cells [22]. LSECs are characterized by their unique morphological characteristics such as lack of a basement membrane in the endothelium and presence of open fenestrations [22]. These fenestrations are clustered throughout the cytoplasm to form dynamic sieve plates and facilitate the steric transport of cargo from the lumen (sinusoidal space) to the space of Disse and into the parenchyma [23]. The alterations in the diameter and frequency of fenestrations on LSECs are correlated with several liver injuries, toxins, and diseases and have implications in the loss of overall liver function [23,24]. LSECs also possess a characteristically high scavenger function for a diverse array of macromolecules. These cells contain a large number of endocytic vesicles that perform degradation and recycling of macromolecular wastes from lumen such as extracellular matrix breakdown, immune complexes, and lysosomal enzymes [25]. Additionally, LSECs play an active role in the immune regulation of the organ through bacterial processing, leukocyte adhesion, and viral clearance [26][27][28].",

            "text": "ApoE binds to LNP in circulation and facilitates binding to low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes, allowing the endocytosis of LNP-mRNA to the cell. Thus, most of the currently existing preclinical and clinical RNA protein replacement, as well as rare disease studies, consider liver diseases or utilize the liver as a protein production factory by using classical LNP formulations of smaller diameter (<100 nm) that are naturally accumulating in hepatocytes. That the size of the LNP particle >100 nm may be a limiting factor for hepatocyte targeting, especially in humans, could be inferred from Wisse at al., who measured the sizes of fenestrae [153]. Fenestrae are the pores in liver sinusoids with the size of 107 \u00b1 1.5 nm in humans without liver pathology and with a significantly larger size in rodents: C57BL/6 mice (141 \u00b1 5.4 nm) and Sprague-Dawley rats (161 \u00b1 2.7 nm) [153]. To reach hepatocytes, LNP-mRNA must pass through the fenestrae, thus limiting the size of the LNP-mRNA to about 100 nm for hepatocyte targeting. \n\nThe localization of LNP to other organs typically requires the optimization of LNP or active targeting. The importance of LNP composition optimization in screening carried out by Sago et al. resulted in finding 7C2 and 7C3 LNPs that efficiently target endothelial cells, as previously noted [147]. Using the same screening methodology as Sago et al., Gan et al. recently tested a library of 109 LNPs composed of \"constrained phospholipids\" that contained an adamantylhydrocarbon chain [154]. This study identified a novel LNP that delivers mRNA to Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes, without targeting ligands [154].",

Therefore, a proposed <100 nm diameter has been suggested [24,113]. Hepatocyte-targeting has also been achieved with nanoparticle coating and compositions. Cholesterol-TWEEN 80 unilamellar vesicles and lipopeptide cKK-E12 showed preferential uptake by hepatocytes over sinusoidal cells while cKK-E12 lipoprotein NPs displayed gene silencing selectivity in hepatocytes over nonliver organs, liver endothelial cells, and liver leukocytes [113,114]. Hepatocyte-specific ligands have also been difficult to identify (Figure 4D). The most popularly implemented is the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) due to its primary expression on hepatocytes, at ~1.8 million receptors/cell, and minimal expression on extrahepatic cells [14]. With a high affinity for N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), galactose (Gal), and glucose, ASGPR has been tested for targeting with these and modified versions of these ligands, such as asialofetuin-PEG residue and galactosylated chitosan [115][116][117]. However, because Kupffer cells also demonstrate Gal/GalNAc scavenging, they could divert nanoparticles intended for hepatocytes [14]. Although less specific, glycyrrhizin/glycyrrhetinic acid receptors found on hepatocyte membranes, as well as kidney, stomach, and colon cells have also been targeted [118]. Glycyrrhizin-modified chitosan NPs, for example, have shown preferential endocytosis by hepatocytes over hepatic non-parenchymal cells [119].",

            "text": "A further way of overcoming the issues detailed above with regard to the composition of conventional 2D liver cultures is by forming cultures comprising multiple liver cell types. The liver is an extremely diverse organ, with varied cellular composition containing not only hepatocytes, but also many non-parenchymal cell types (comprising the 20% of the total liver mass) in the form of Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatic stellate cells, fibroblasts, biliary epithelial cells, immune cells, and adult stem cells [21], all of which play critical roles in the liver. Proper liver function is highly dependent on the interactions between these varying cell types and hepatocytes; therefore, by incorporating multiple cell types in a 2D culture, it is possible to produce a more physiologically relevant model with tissue characteristics and increased liver functionality [80,81]. Recently, many co-culture cell systems have been developed. For example, hepatocyte/macrophage co-cultures have been successfully used to model acute responses to septic liver injury and liver regeneration [18, 23,82]. Culturing hepatocytes with LSECs, in the presence or absence of collagen, allows LSECs to maintain their phenotype and hepatocytes to increase their in vivo-like function also enhanced (e.g., CYP activity) [83]. Similarly, when HepG2 cells are co-cultured with LSECs [84], CYP enzyme induction is enhanced, suggesting that the introduction of endothelial cells influences hepatocyte function in vitro (46). Furthermore, in addition to LSECs enhancing hepatocyte function, similarly hepatocytes support LSEC function [83], influencing LSECs ability to control important repair mechanisms in the liver following injury [85]. Kupffer cell/ hepatocyte co-cultures have also been reported, exhibiting responses to a variety of inflammatory stimuli not observed in monocultures [86]. Metabolic functions are also dramatically increased when KCs are cultured with hepatocytes, as demonstrated by Yagi et al. [87]. Various other immune cells have also been co-cultured with",

Hepatocytes are the major reservoir supporting HCV replication and the contribution of other cell types in the viral lifecycle remain largely unexplored. 3 LSEC hepatocyte interactions are critical for normal liver development and function and regulate the organ's response to injury. 4 One of the best-characterized paracrine signals between these endothelial and epithelial cells is vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), which maintains the sinusoidal endothelial fenestrated phenotype and promotes hepatocyte growth factor expression in response to injury. [4][5][6] VEGF-A is a multifunctional cytokine originally described for its ability to increase endothelial permeability, and subsequently reported to have critical roles in vascular development and cancer angiogenesis. 7 We previously reported that HCV infection promotes VEGF-A expression, resulting in hepatocyte depolarization and enhanced viral entry. [8][9][10] Treating HCVinfected hepatocytes with VEGF-A inhibitors, including sorafenib, restored their ability to polarize and limited viral infection, 8,11 suggesting a therapeutic role for VEGF-A inhibitors in HCV infection.\n\nThese reports led us to investigate the role of LSEC in the HCV lifecycle and to establish coculture systems to study endothelial-epithelial cell interactions.

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) show an even higher specialization level, being characterized by discontinuous surfaces, diffuse fenestrae for the passage of macromolecules, and the absence of a basal membrane [2]. LSECs actively cross-talk with hepatocytes, stellate cells, and Kupffer cells, contributing to all liver physiological processes: for instance, LSECs inhibit the profibrotic and vasoconstrictive activity of stellate cells [2]. In chronic liver diseases, in response to direct or indirect harmful stimuli, LSECs undergo so-called \"endothelization\" (or \"capillarization\") [3], with loss of fenestrae and acquisition of a phenotype commonly seen in usual capillaries, among which the expression of CD34 is the most evident, as well as the most useful in histopathological practice [4]. During chronic damage and endothelization, LSEC lose the inhibitory function on stellate cells, moving towards profibrotic and vasoconstrictive activity [2]. \n\nIn the few last decades, the poor availability of grafts for liver transplantation has led to the search for new strategies to increase the donor pool: one of these strategies is the use of organs from extended criteria donors (ECD). The ECD inclusion criteria are age >60-65 years, and/or the presence of other criteria, such as donors in cardiovascular death (DCD), high transaminase levels or hypernatremia, long intensive care, or prolonged cold ischemia time [5].",

            "text": "unique vascular bed in the liver, which receives blood from both the hepatic artery and the portal veins into the hepatic parenchyma (Fig. 1). Studies of these cells isolated from animals usually refer to them as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), whereas isolated human cells have also been referred to as human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs). For the purpose of this Review, we use the term LSEC. The exposure of these sinusoidal endothelial cells to blood originating from both the gut and the systemic circulation means they are ideally situated to remove and recycle bloodborne proteins and lipids. In combination with Kupffer cells (KCs; liver-resident macrophages), LSECs constitute the most powerful scavenger system in the body 1 . This activity is facilitated by the presence of fenestrae in LSECs, their lack of a classical basement membrane and their expression of promiscuous scavenger receptors combined with the most potent endocytic capacity in the body 2 . Thus, virus particles 3 , advanced glycation end products 4 and modified LDL cholesterol 5 can be cleared from the circulation within minutes by this route. \n\nEndothelial cells in different vascular beds are generated from common early embryological precursors and have broadly similar histological appearance and functional roles throughout the body. However, extensive variations in phenotype and function arise as a consequence of local microenvironmental signals dependent on anatomical localization 6 . The vascular architecture in the human liver is acquired by 17-25 weeks of gestation, but different vessels within the liver have distinct embryonic origins. Thus, portal vessels are derived from vitelline veins, whereas sinusoids develop from capillary vessels of the septum transversum and acquire their distinctive fenestrated phenotype by week 20 of gestation 7 under the control of transcription factor GATA4 (reF. 8 ). From this point onward, sinusoidal endothelial cells remain functionally and phenotypically distinct from the other vascular endothelial cells in the liver microenvironment and assume a phenotype that has many similarities with lymphatic endothelial cells 9 .",

            "text": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) constitute a unique endothelium considering their ultrastructure, gene expression, and physiological functions. Specialized LSEC functions include a high endocytic (\"scavenger\") activity towards many bloodborne macromolecules, such as spent plasma proteins, oxidized lipoproteins, small, soluble immune complexes, nanoparticles, and waste products from matrix production and turnover (Bhandari et al., 2021;Smedsr\u00f8d et al., 1990;S\u00f8rensen et al., 2012). For this purpose, the cells express a wide repertoire of scavenger receptors and other endocytosis receptors, and a well-developed endo-lysosomal apparatus for degradation of internalized ligands (Bhandari et al., 2021;Pandey et al., 2020;Bhandari et al., 2020). LSECs further have immune regulatory roles contributing to liver immune tolerance (Wohlleber and Knolle, 2016;Shetty et al., 2018). A third essential function of the cells is ultrafiltration of plasma. LSECs lack an organized basal lamina and are perforated with transcellular nanosized holes (average diameter approximately 100-200 nm in diameter), named fenestrae or fenestrations, arranged in sieve plates which ease the bidirectional traffic of lipoproteins and other molecules between blood and hepatocytes (Wisse et al., 1985;Szafranska et al., 2021). Loss of LSEC fenestrations, altered cell signaling, and/or reduced scavenging capacity are reported in aging and liver disease and are postulated to contribute to hepatic and extra-hepatic pathologies (Le Couteur et al., 2008;Fraser et al., 2012;Gracia-Sancho et al., 2021;Simon-Santamaria et al., 2010;Ito et al., 2007;Le Couteur et al., 2002;Antwi et al., 2023).",

Through this methodology, we successfully identified 11 distinct cell types, including differentiated liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (Di LSEC) and dedifferentiated liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (De LSEC) (Fig. 4A). The heatmap illustrated the top five genes that were uniquely expressed in each cell type, as depicted in Fig. 4B. Notably, among the genes expressed in dedifferentiated LSECs (De LSEC), Scara3 emerged as an outer membrane protein, which may serve as a promising target for delivery applications 30 . Furthermore, the expression level of Scara3 in dedifferentiated LSEC was significantly higher compared to other cells within the fibrotic liver tissue (Fig. 4C), indicating its promising feasibility as a target for efficient LSEC-specific delivery. Moreover, ELISA was utilized to quantify the levels of Scara3 in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) isolated from fibrotic and healthy liver tissues. The results demonstrated that Scara3 levels were significantly elevated in fibrotic samples compared to those in healthy controls (Supplementary Fig. 4A). Furthermore, within fibrotic liver tissue, Scara3 expression was markedly higher in LSECs than in Kupffer cells (Supplementary Fig. 4B), providing additional evidence for Scara3 as a marker specific to dedifferentiated LSECs.

            "text": "The liver is the major organ for protein synthesis and immune defense. Following intravenous injection, mRNA NPs tend to accumulate in liver, mainly due to its abundant blood supply, low flow velocities, and unique fenestrated type of hepatic sinusoidal endothelium (Fig. 6) [102]. Hepatic sinusoidal endothelium differs from the Fig. 6 Schematic illustration of the structure of the liver and the journey of mRNA NPs to all kinds of cells in the liver via intravenous injection. The passive and active targeting characteristics of hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells and hepatic endothelial cells are also presented endothelia in other organs, with a fenestrae range of approximately 150 nm but lacking a basement membrane [89]. Consequently, hepatic sinus endothelium can act as an effective \"ultrafiltration system\" or \"sieve, \" allowing small-sized NPs to enter the Disse space where hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are located without restriction, and thereafter deliver mRNA into hepatocytes and HSCs. Conversely, large NPs will be absorbed by Kupffer cells (hepatic macrophages) around the hepatic sinus. This suggests that the size of mRNA NPs is an important factor that affects cellular targeted delivery. Moreover, the adhesion of protein coronas in blood is also a critical factor in the preferential accumulation of mRNA NPs in liver. Despite some progress made in hepatic targeted mRNA delivery through nanocarriers, challenges still exist in successfully delivering mRNA to specific liver cells. Accordingly, this section focuses on the specific cell types in the liver and, based on the LNP and polymer category, provides a comprehensive discussion of the targeting strategies for delivering mRNA to different cell types (Table 1).",

Inflammatory SASP components (such as IL1, IL6, and IL8) are both targets and activators of transcription factors NF-\u03baB and C/EBP\u03b2. Therefore, \"local\" inflammatory cytokine signaling from senescent cells can be amplified in a juxtacrine manner (Acosta et al. 2013). However, it remains unclear how senescent cells communicate with more distal circulating immune cells, normally separated from parenchymal cells by the blood vessel endothelium. Our recent study suggested that liver endothelial cells are a nonautonomous target of the SASP (Hoare et al. 2016), where the SASP modulates endothelial-dependent immunocyte recruitment. \n\nImmunocyte recruitment to the liver occurs within the low-flow channels of the hepatic sinusoids, which are lined by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), a unique, specialized endothelial cell forming a physical barrier between the circulation and the liver parenchyma (Shetty et al. 2018). Interactions between LSECs and both resident and circulating immune cells are crucial in recruitment (Shetty et al. 2018) to the liver microenvironment. Under differing conditions, LSECs selectively recruit specific immune subsets with differing functionality, such as T regs and B lymphocytes, through differential expression of adhesion receptors (Shetty et al. 2011(Shetty et al. , 2012)). \n\nThe role of LSECs as a major organizing center integrating microenvironmental signaling and controlling liver regeneration has been shown in acute liver injury (Ding et al. 2014).",

This LSEC scavenger function has been insufficiently characterized in liver disease. The Glmpgt/gt mouse lacks expression of a subunit of the MFSD1/GLMP lysosomal membrane protein transporter complex, is born normal, but soon develops chronic, mild hepatocyte injury, leading to slowly progressing periportal liver fibrosis, and splenomegaly. This study examined how LSEC scavenger function and morphology are affected in the Glmpgt/gt model. FITC-labelled formaldehyde-treated serum albumin (FITC-FSA), a model ligand for LSEC scavenger receptors was administered intravenously into Glmpgt/gt mice, aged 4 months (peak of liver inflammation), 9\u201310 month, and age-matched Glmpwt/wt mice. Organs were harvested for light and electron microscopy, quantitative image analysis of ligand uptake, collagen accumulation, LSEC ultrastructure, and endocytosis receptor expression (also examined by qPCR and western blot). In both age groups, the Glmpgt/gt mice showed multifocal liver injury and fibrosis. The uptake of FITC-FSA in LSECs was significantly reduced in Glmpgt/gt compared to wild-type mice. Expression of LSEC receptors stabilin-1 (Stab1), and mannose receptor (Mcr1) was almost similar in liver of Glmpgt/gt mice and age-matched controls. At the same time, immunostaining revealed differences in the stabilin-1 expression pattern in sinusoids and accumulation of stabilin-1-positive macrophages in Glmpgt/gt liver.

            "text": "LSECs are also essential cells of the liver. They are highly specialized endothelial cells that constitute the permeable interface that controls the trafficking of molecules and cells between hepatocytes and the blood stream. Additionally, LSECs play an important role in immunity, liver disease, and regeneration [58,59]. Although important in the maintenance of normal liver functions, there are still few protocols for differentiation of hPSCs into LSECs. In fact, to our best knowledge, there is only one protocol using hPSCs that specifically generates LSECs [60], and a second one using mouse ESCs [61]. Both studies assume that LSECs diverge at some point in ontogeny from endothelial progenitors. Therefore, Koui and colleagues used FLK1 + CD31 + CD34 + endothelial cells derived from hiPSCs as the starting point to generate and promote a LSEC mature phenotype by adding A83-01 (a TGF\u03b2RI inhibitor) under hypoxic conditions. This protocol was able to produce LSECs expressing specific markers like FCGR2B, STAB2, F8, and LYVE1. Generically, many research groups have focused their work on the differentiation of hPSCs into endothelial cells, thus indirectly contributing to future methods for LSEC derivation. For general reviews on this topic, please see [62,63]. \n\nKupffer cells are the liver macrophages, the first line of defense against bacteria, microbial debris, and endotoxins with gastrointestinal origin [64]. In addition to their immunological role, they also cooperate with LSECs in blood clearance [59]. Recently, one study was able to differentiate hiPSCs into Kupffer cells, recapitulating their ontogeny by firstly differentiating hiPSCs into macrophage-precursors and subsequent exposure to hepatic cues by simply culturing these precursors in hepatocyte culture medium (HCM) and advanced DMEM [65]. \n\nFinally, HSCs are specialized pericytes that reside in the perisinusoidal space (or space of Disse), between hepatocytes and LSECs.",

Studies in rats have shown that the initial series of events are driven by the mechanical process by which cells enter vascular spaces beyond the portal areas, which is dependent upon the size of cells and the diameter of hepatic sinusoids [54]. The larger the size of cells, the more proximal will these be to portal areas, and the smaller the size of cells, the more distal in the liver lobule will these be in relationship to portal areas. This essential size-structure relationship drives the nature of cell-cell adhesions, as well as the extent of vaso-occlusive processes that may be initiated by cell transplantation. Rodent studies have shown that subsequent cell-cell signalling events are important. The ischemic injury rapidly activates neutrophils, Kupffer cells, LSECs and hepatic stellate cells [58,59]. The initial engraftment processes where vascular responses involve release of locally-acting vasoactive molecules, such as NO and prostacyclins, complement, platelet-related thrombogenic substances, endothelin, cyclooxygenases, cytokines/ chemokines/receptors, are largely deleterious. However, release of some substances, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from native hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, monocytes and hepatic stellate cells helps in permeabilization of endothelial cells. Coupled with the activation of LSEC, transplanted cells are able to penetrate the endothelial barrier and then integrate themselves into the liver parenchyma [56]. This part of the process requires 16-20 h from cell delivery. However, cumulatively, nearly 80-90% of all transplanted hepatocytes are destroyed due to sinusoidal events, including lack of entry into sinusoids, inadequate or no adhesion to sinusoidal endothelium, oxidative stress, cytokine-mediated toxicity,",

The complexity of liver cell-cell interactions makes it difficult to establish the chronology of cell-specific changes in structural and functional phenotypes [19]. Damage-associated molecular patterns and pro-inflammatory microvesicles (exosomes) released from steatotic and ballooned hepatocytes activate Kupffer cells [39] and the liver inflammasome [40]. LSECs respond to shear stress and hypoxia by losing B. NAFLD is associated with structural and functional changes that may profoundly affect sinusoid homeostasis by promoting endothelial dysfunction, distorting sinusoidal microanatomy and disrupting cross-talk among various liver cells, ultimately leading to increased intravascular hepatic resistance and contributing to disease progression (see main text and Figure 2 for cellular and molecular pathways involved in this process). LSEC: liver sinusoidal endothelial cell their fenestrated endothelium (capillarization), which is a cardinal feature of endothelial dysfunction [41]. Capillarized LSECs impair hepatic lipid transport and metabolism [42], secrete bioactive substances that promote microthrombosis and angiogenesis [43], and their diminished nitric oxide (NO) production allows hepatic stellate cells to change their phenotype [44]. First, upregulation of smooth muscle proteins actin and myosin in stellate cells increases their contractility, which may impede sinusoidal flow similar to pericytes in the systemic circulation [45]. Second, activated stellate cells become the source of extracellular matrix deposits, resulting in gradually more severe fibrosis and encroachment on the sinusoidal lumen [46,47].",

            "text": "With a blood flow of about 2 l/min and a sinusoidal blood lining surface area the size of a tennis court, the liver is one of the most vascularized tissues in the body. It is responsible for the clearance of large molecules and nanoparticles from blood, a function which is often counterproductive to the successful delivery of therapeutic compounds to other tissues or even specific cells within the liver. Several studies show that oligonucleotides (unmodified or conjugated) will end up in the liver to a far higher extent than the intended target tissue, although the rates vary between studies. In one study intravenous administration of an AON resulted in 40% and 18% accumulation in the liver and kidneys respectively (Bijsterbosch et al, 1997), whilst intravenous administration of CpG oligonucleotides resulted in 50% and 40% accumulation in the liver and kidneys respectively (Martin-Armas et al, 2006). The main cellular site of liver uptake are the extremely active scavenger liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) (Sorensen et al, 2015) followed by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells (KCs; (Bijsterbosch et al, 1997), however the degree of uptake in hepatocytes can vary from 40% in the first study to no apparent uptake in the CpG study. Similarly, a histological study revealed that phosphorothioate oligonucleotides accumulated mainly in KCs and LSECs (Butler et al, 1997). KCs specialize in phagocytic clearance of blood-borne particles larger than 200 nm while LSECs mediate the clearance of smaller particles such as oligonucleotides, peptides, large macromolecules and nanoparticles via rapid and powerful clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Sorensen et al, 2012). LSECs contain fenestrations with numerous open pores of 50-150 nm in diameter, enabling access into the underlying perisinusoidal space and therefore to hepatocytes. However, LSECs are also able to endocytose from the perisinusoidal space and do so at a",

The doping LNPs with lipids containing quaternary ammonium groups can selectively deliver mRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 for specific lung diseases in the lungs. 47 Similarly, both zwitterionic amino lipids and cationic quaternary sulfonamide amino lipids have permanent cationic quaternary ammonium functional groups and can also be used to design lung-targeted LNPs. 25 The more detailed LNPs compositions for extrahepatic delivery are summarized by Dilliard S.A. and Siegwart D.J. 20 Furthermore, the length of the alkyl chain on the phosphate side determines organ selectivity. The iPhos with 9-12 and 13-16 carbon chain lengths deliver mRNA to the liver and the spleen, respectively. 47 The possible underlying mechanism for only small difference in structure to cause such astonishing organ specificity may be the result of a specific protein or the synergistic action of several proteins, but further research is still needed. Once injected into the bloodstream, LNPs can selectively control the adsorption of specific plasma proteins, acting as targeted ligands to direct LNPs to selected organs. Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver. In addition, the zeta potential of the two LNP S did not differ significantly, and both showed a slightly negative surface charge, suggesting that surface charge may not be the only factor influencing the interaction between NPs and proteins in biological fluids. 35 verall, the ionization of lipid structure can be driven by the type of organs and cells.",

Apart from the above-mentioned methods, the use of quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles (1-20 nm) for the treatment of NAFLD has also emerged as an area of great interest [193]. An intravenous injection of mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA)-capped cadmium telluride/cadmium sulfide (CdTe/CdS/QDs) showed that negatively charged QDs were selectively taken up by sinusoidal cells (KCs and LSECs) in rat liver, indicating that CdTe/CdS/QDs can be used for drug delivery to the LSECs [194]. Furthermore, Zn-labelled CdSelenide/CdS/ZnS QDs were also found in the KCs and LSECs 2h after an intravenous injection of polymer-coated Qdots, indicating their efficiency in drug delivery to the sinusoidal cells [195]. In addition, via the usage of nanoparticles carrying honokiol or adenovirus with the endothelial-cell-specific arginylglycylaspartic acid-roundabout guidance receptor 4 (RGD-ROBO4), ERK1/2 activation was promoted, leading to induced liver regeneration and reduced hepatic fibrosis due to high degree of LSEC specificity [196]. \n\nThe main studies targeting endothelial dysfunction in animal models of NAFLD/NASH/cirrhosis are summarized in Table 1. \n\nTable 1.

Loss of LSECs exacerbates inflammation in liver disease [107]. Fang et al. found that LESCs could improve NASH by alleviating inflammation [108]. The underlying cause may be a decrease in NO secretion. LSEC-derived NO can effectively play an immunomodulatory role in the liver. Targeting LSECs for treatment has been shown to be effective [109]. Therefore, it may be a good choice to use LSECs to remodel the liver microenvironment in liver disease.",

Normal morphology of LSEC is flat with a nucleus and organelles regularly and expresses CD45 -CD146 \n\n+ surface marker. The distal cytoplasm displayed as a lamina with many fenestrae, lacking the basement membrane underneath the endothelium [8] . Less than 100 nm nano-molecules are diffuse through the fenestrae, attributing a sieve function to LSEC [9] . Therefore, LSEC are responsible for the clearance of various macromolecules from the blood such as proteins, poly saccharides, lipids and nucleic acids [10] . Kupffer cells are known as liver resident macrophage and derived from circulating monocytes that arise from bone marrow progenitors [11] . The major role of Kupffer cells is to clear circulating endotoxin, microorganism, dead cells and debris. Endotoxins from gut activate Kupffer cells and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2. Liver lymphocytes are found scattered throughout the parenchyma and in the portal tract [7] . Liver is especially abundant in innate immune cells such as natural killer (NK), NKT, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells; these comprise almost half of liver lymphocytes [6,7] . For example, the population of NK and NKT cells is approximately 30%-40% that of the total liver lymphocytes; \u03b3\u03b4 T cells account for 3% to 5% of these cells in mice and humans [6] . Infiltration of the liver by lymphocytes occurs in response to many insults such as autoimmune and toxic damage. The distribution of hepatic infiltration by lymphocytes varies depending on the inflammatory stimulus [12] .

Cell proliferation is triggered by several growth factors and cytokines, such as HGF, TGF-\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which activate their cognate receptors and, consequently, downstream signaling and transcription of the genes associated with cell cycle progression [52][53][54][55][56][57][58] . Among the signaling cascades mediating platelet effects on the process of liver regeneration, the most important are TNF-\u03b1/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), IL-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 STAT3, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt. \n\nPrevious studies indicate that platelets can exert positive effects on liver regeneration through cooperation with LSECs and Kupffer cells, and direct interaction with hepatocytes. \n\nLSECs mostly consist of sinusoidal cells which, through formation of a continuous thin layer of the sinusoidal endothelium, create a structural barrier between the hepatic parenchyma and blood flowing through the liver [59,60] . LSECs play an important role in the maintenance of hepatic functions by providing exchange of nutrients between circulating blood and hepatocytes because of the presence of open pores beneath the endothelium [61] . In addition, LSECs secrete immunoregulatory cytokines, including HGF, IL-1, IL-6 and interferons, affecting liver regeneration. Thus, impact of platelet-Kupffer cell interaction in liver fibrosis. However, it is evident that the contact between platelets and Kupffer cells cause activation of both cells.",

            "text": "film-coated polydimethylsiloxane gels. This work indicated that LSECs cultured on these gels exhibited loss of fenestrations, impaired hyaluronic acid endocytosis, and increased expression of cell adhesion molecules. Overall, these findings suggest a leading role of matrix stiffness in deregulating sinusoidal cells during liver disease progression. nasH Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Dufour's presentation (Inselspital) described the contribution of hepatic endothelial dysfunction to poor health outcomes in patients with NASH. Professor Dufour has previously outlined the therapeutic approaches for the treatment of NASH, (23) and in this lecture he updated the delegates on the current understanding of the role of sinusoidal cells in NASH. (24,25) Sinusoidal endothelial dysfunction precedes inflammatory and fibrotic progression in liver disease. (24) Of note, the loss of NO release from the endothelium contributes to increased intrahepatic resistance and activation of HSCs. (24) Targeting of cells expressing endothelial dysfunction markers, such as vascular adhesion-factor 1, with antifibrotic and inflammatory drugs may reduce the migration of immune cells to the liver and limit liver disease progression. (25) Other presented therapeutic approaches focused on targeting LSECs to resolve NASH. Miren Bravo (Vall d'Hebron Institut de Recerca [VHIR], Barcelona, Spain) presented data on the role of statins in restoring the LSEC phenotype and reducing portal pressure in a rat model of NASH without fibrosis. (26) NASH animals exhibited increased portal pressure, mainly due to endothelial dysfunction (decreased phosphorylated protein kinase B and phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase [NOS], increased endothelin 1 [ET-1] levels, and a higher predominance of dedifferentiated cluster of differentiation [CD]32b \u2212 LSECs). HSCs from these animals had reduced vitamin A storage and displayed activation of ET-1 downstream signaling. Treatment with statins resulted in a reduction in portal pressure levels, NASH reversion, and significant recovery of LSEC morphology, leading to a more quiescent phenotype of HSCs. (26",

            "text": "Tissue-specific endothelial cells are more than simply a barrier lining capillaries and are proved to be capable of remarkable plasticity to become active collagen matrix-producing myofibroblasts (MFs) in solid organs with fibrosis. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) also participate in the development of hepatic fibrosis, but the exact roles and underlying mechanism have been poorly understood in addition to capillarization. In this study, we demonstrate, by using single-cell RNA sequencing, lineage tracing, and colocalization analysis, that fibrotic LSECs undergo partial endothelial mesenchymal transition (EndMT) with a subset of LSECs acquiring an MF-like phenotype. These phenotypic changes make LSECs substantial producers of extracellular matrix (ECM) preferentially deposited in liver sinusoids but not septal/portal scars as demonstrated by immunofluorescence in animal models and patients with fibrosis/cirrhosis, likely due to their limited migration. Bioinformatic analysis verifies that LSECs undergo successive phenotypic transitions from capillarization to mesenchymal-like cells in liver fibrosis. Furthermore, blockade of LSEC capillarization by using YC-1, a selective eNOS-sGC activator, effectively attenuates liver damage and fibrogenesis as well as mesenchymal features of LSECs, suggesting that capillarization of LSECs might be upstream to their mesenchymal transition during fibrosis. In conclusion, we report that capillarized LSECs undergo a partial EndMT characterized by increased ECM production without activating cell mobility, leading to perisinusoidal ECM deposition that aggravate liver function and fibrogenesis. Targeting this transitional process may be of great value for antifibrotic treatment of liver fibrosis.",

            "text": "LSECs constituting the largest proportion of liver NPCs, 40 regulate liver homeostasis and through angiocrine factors. Welldifferentiated LSECs inhibit HSC activation and nourish hepatocyte proliferation [41][42][43] while dedifferentiated LSECs lose fenestrae and develop basement membrane, leading to HSC activation and hepatocyte damage. 1,3,17 Thus, exploring the mechanisms involved in LSEC biology and pathology is of great importance. \n\nTraditional scientific investigations have encountered challenges in identifying a distinctive biomarker for LSECs. This is due to the common embryonic origin shared by all endothelial cells found in various organs, which results in shared characteristics and functions. 4 Despite these similarities, LSECs possess remarkable phenotypic and functional attributes that are influenced by their unique microenvironment within the liver. LSECs play a vital role as guardians, patrolling the bloodstream through the portal vein, which carries both beneficial nutrients and harmful toxins from the gastrointestinal tract. 21 Working alongside Kupffer cells, LSECs form an exceptional scavenging system within the liver. 3,44 Unlike other organ-specific endothelial cells, LSECs lack a basal membrane and exhibit heightened permeability. This exceptional adaptation LSECs to act as dynamic filters, carefully regulating the passage of various substances and out of the liver. 3 By utilizing advanced sequencing techniques, such as and pair-cell sequencing, we have successfully identified specific markers that are unique to LSECs. This breakthrough not only deepens our understanding of these specialized cells but also paves the way for further scientific exploration in elucidating cellular marker across different organs, leading to potential advances in therapeutic interventions. \n\nNormally, LSECs are labeled by EC markers like Lyve1, CD31, VE-Cadherin, VEGFR2, or VEGFR3, and were isolated using anti-CD146 magnetic beads. 11 According to the scRNA-seq data we provided in this manuscript, none of the above-mentioned genes is liver specific.

Here, we propose a novel cell-based assay using human liver non-parenchymal cells (NPC) as an alternative method using LSEC. To identify the LSEC population, NPC were stained with CD31 and CD45, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of Fc gamma receptor IIB (Fc\u03b3RIIB), one of the LSEC markers was detected in the CD31-positive and the CD45-negative fractions. The concentration-dependent binding and internalization of the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody was also quantified in the LSEC fraction in human NPC. Saturated binding and internalization curves were obtained for the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody. In the case of the negative control antibody, however, binding and internalization were negligible. The findings reported here indicate that cell-based assays using fresh human liver NPC will be useful for evaluating the binding and internalization of biologics as well as for determining pharmacokinetic parameters.",

Similarly, Pattipeiluhu et al. reported that replacement of neutral DSPC with anionic DSPG in the formulation of patisiran nanoparticles significantly enhanced transfection of liver endothelial cells [184]. Other strategies that have been reported to augment or facilitate transfection of endothelial cells are the use of larger diameter nanoparticles to prevent nanoparticle elimination from the circulation or the use of mechanical stents to locally deliver nanoparticles to the surface of blood vessels. Kim et al. and Khan et al. reported that nanoparticles with larger diameter sizes preferentially transfected liver endothelial cells over hepatocytes, likely because the nanoparticles were not filtered through the fenestrations of the liver vasculature, while Brito et al. reported that lipid nanoparticles immobilized on a stainless-steel stent achieved local transfection of endothelial cells [82,93,177].",

Within the liver, most nanoparticles are thought to be sequestered by macrophages (Kupffer cells), although significant nanoparticle interactions with other hepatic cells have also been observed. To achieve effective cell-specific targeting of drugs through nanoparticle encapsulation, improved mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle\u2013liver interactions is required. Here, we show the caudal vein of the embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) can be used as a model for assessing nanoparticle interactions with mammalian liver sinusoidal (or scavenger) endothelial cells (SECs) and macrophages. We observe that anionic nanoparticles are primarily taken up by SECs and identify an essential requirement for the scavenger receptor, stabilin-2 (stab2) in this process. Importantly, nanoparticle\u2013SEC interactions can be blocked by dextran sulfate, a competitive inhibitor of stab2 and other scavenger receptors. Finally, we exploit nanoparticle\u2013SEC interactions to demonstrate targeted intracellular drug delivery resulting in the selective deletion of a single blood vessel in the zebrafish embryo. Together, we propose stab2 inhibition or targeting as a general approach for modifying nanoparticle\u2013liver interactions of a wide range of nanomedicines.",

            "text": "When breast tumor cells enter the hepatic microcirculation, they first encounter liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). LSECs are double-edged swords, as they can not only promote but also inhibit BC LM formation in the hepatic tissue microenvironment. \n\nRegarding the tumoricidal activities of LSECs, many studies have shown that the tumor cells can obstruct the sinusoids to trigger an ischemia and inflammatory response. LSECs release cytotoxic cytokines, which have damaging effects in adjacent tumor cells (73)(74)(75)(76)(77). LSECs can also remove or degrade the enzymes that promote angiogenesis and metastasis (78). Whether the tumoricidal action of LSECs exert a prominent effect on BCLM remains to be determined. \n\nOn the other hand, tumor cells can activate Kupffer cells (KCs) to secrete proinflammatory cytokines, which induce LSECs to express adhesion molecules and help tumor cells extravasate into hepatic parenchyma (49)(50)(51)72). Also, LSECs allow tumor cells directly adhere to the membrane proteins and promote metastasis (105). Although these findings came from studies on colorectal cancer or lung cancer, it is postulated that LSECs also possess tumor-promoting activities in BCLM. \n\nFurthermore, some critical molecules from LSECs or their surrounding microenvironment are involved in liver metastasis (64). The expression of chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) in cancer cells is associated with increased expression of chemokine ligand CXCL12 in LSECs' microenvironment and CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling drives metastasis (64).",

In C57BL/6 mouse liver, the mannose receptor is expressed in LSECs but not in Kupffer cells [26]. Some uptake of BK-and JC-VLPs was also seen in F4/80 positive Kupffer cells (Figure 4C, F), whereas no BK-or JC-VLP positive staining was observed in hepatocytes, endothelial cells of portal venules or arteries, bile ducts or other liver structures. \n\nTo characterize in greater detail the cells involved in the hepatic uptake of polyomavirus, freshly isolated liver NPCs were incubated with infectious BKV, non-labeled BK-VLPs, or JC-VLPs for various time periods (30 min-1 h), immune labeled and subjected to confocal microscopy (Figure 5A-F). Both LSECs and Kupffer cells took up BK-and JC-VLPs, and BKV in vitro. Results were confirmed by double labeling with anti-BK-VP1 antiserum and antibodies against the mannose receptor (LSEC marker in liver [26]; Figure 5A-C; Figure S2) or CD68 (Kupffer cell marker; Figure 5D-F).",

            "text": "To demonstrate the effective delivery of cGAMP for reprogramming costimulatory receptor expression in liver NPC populations, including LSECs, Kupffer cells, and DCs, LNP carriers were developed for Cy5-labeled cGAMP as well as an mRNA strand encoding green fluorescent protein (mGFP) expression (Figure 4). This required the creation of Cy5-cGAMP/mGFP/LNP using a microfluidics approach for which the components are shown in Figure 4A. The resulting Cy5-cGAMP/mGFP/LNP had a size of 132 nm, with the accompanying cryoEM features illustrated in Figure 4B,C. These particles were IV injected, followed by harvesting of major organs (including the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys) 6 h later for ex vivo IVIS imaging (Figure 4D). The Cy5 signal was exclusively discernible in the liver of animals receiving encapsulated but not free Cy5-cGAMP (Figure 4E). Quantitative analysis of the Cy5 radiance is shown in Figure 4F. No significant uptake of encapsulated particles was seen in other organs. Furthermore, harvested liver tissues were sectioned and subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy, which showed GFP expression throughout the liver, including uptake by red fluorescent-labeled LSECs (Figure 4G). The slides from untreated mice were used as a negative control. The average colocalization rate of GFP (green channel) and LSECs (red channel) in our experiment was 12.3% \u00b1 1.4%, as quantified using ImageJ software. Additionally, Mander's coefficients were calculated with ImageJ, yielding a value of 0.13 \u00b1 0.012. This is compatible with the demonstration that ionizable LNPs target multiple liver cell types, including hepatocytes and NPCs. 27 LSECs and Kupffer cells represent two of the principal tolerogenic APC types in the liver,  contributing to the tolerance and immune protection against cancer. 37",

            "text": "Furthermore, Kupffer cells (KCs), that constitute the major liver-resident macrophage population [13], and LSECs express various types of Fc and scavenger receptors [14] for the efficient uptake of larger KC [13] and smaller LSEC [15] macromolecules, and consequently also NPs [9]. Therefore, hepatocyte-targeting NPs need to circumvent unwanted uptake by the aforementioned liver NPC populations. \n\nThis review aims to summarize the strategies currently evaluated in preclinical in vivo models for the treatment of liver diseases with nanoformulations that may allow the poor solubility of drugs to be overcome by encapsulation and enable the codelivery of distinct compounds that act on different signaling pathways or effector molecules into the same cell to yield synergistic effects [16,17]. Consequently, nanoformulations are also intended to prevent systemic toxicity, as frequently observed, e.g., for systemically applied anti-cancer drugs [18,19]. Therefore, nanoformulations need to address their cellular target either via passive or active targeting [20]. Whereas the former is determined by the intrinsic properties of the NP-like size and charge, active targeting is achieved by the attachment of receptor-binding moieties on the NP surface. For the treatment of liverassociated disorders, nanoformulations need to exert disease-specific biological effects; for instance, in the case of virus-induced hepatitis nano-vaccines aim to evoke antiviral immune responses [21,22], whereas in the case of autoimmune hepatitis nanodrugs are intended to dampen inflammation [23]. \n\nLiver fibrosis, i.e., the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins due to the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), is commonly observed in the course of chronic liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [24]. Extensive liver fibrosis may result in cirrhosis, which, in turn, predisposes the liver to HCC [25]. Hence, a number of nanoformulations that revert HSC activation are under development.",

Several ligands (e.g., aptamers, sugars, antibodies and antibody fragments, vitamins, and aptamers) have been coupled on the LNP surface through various approaches, including direct conjugation of targeting ligands onto preformed LNPs and postinsertion of lipid conjugated molecules onto preformed LNPs, thus enabling targeted delivery. Antibodies and their various formats have been conjugated to LNPs, and the resultant conjugates have shown successful retargeting of LNPs to multiple extrahepatic cells and tissues, including immune cells, lymph nodes, bone marrow, cancer cells, and endothelial cells (Table 3). \n\nN-Acetyl Galactosamine.

It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood. Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-RIIb2 (17). These receptors are involved in the removal of blood-borne antigens by active endocytosis. For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25)...To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38)...we demonstrated a targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs by incorporating active ligands to LNPs. The mannose ligand can interact with specific receptors (CD206) expressed on LSECs.

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP\u2010based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP\u2010based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP\u2013mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES\u2010targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver\u2010specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano\u2013biointeractions involved.",

We noted that LNPs have historically been formulated with phospholipids containing unconstrained alkyl tails. Based on evidence that constrained adamantyl groups have unique properties that can improve small molecule drug delivery, we hypothesized that a phospholipid containing an adamantyl group would facilitate mRNA delivery in vivo. We quantified how 109 LNPs containing \u201cconstrained phospholipids\u201d delivered mRNA to 16 cell types in mice, then using a DNA barcoding\u2010based analytical pipeline, related phospholipid structure to in vivo delivery. By analyzing delivery mediated by constrained phospholipids, we identified a novel LNP that delivers mRNA to immune cells at 0.5 mg/kg.

We hypothesized that incorporating the same cholesterol variants into LNPs-which can be structurally similar to LDL and VLDL-would alter nanoparticle targeting in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we quantified how >100 LNPs made with six cholesterol variants delivered DNA barcodes to 18 cell types in wild-type, LDLR-/-, and VLDLR-/- mice that were both age-matched and female. By analyzing \u223c2000 in vivo drug delivery data points, we found that LNPs formulated with esterified cholesterol delivered nucleic acids more efficiently than LNPs formulated with regular or oxidized cholesterol when compared across all tested cell types in the mouse. We also identified an LNP containing cholesteryl oleate that efficiently delivered siRNA and sgRNA to liver endothelial cells in vivo. Delivery was as-or more-efficient as the same LNP made with unmodified cholesterol. Moreover, delivery to liver endothelial cells was 3 times more efficient than delivery to hepatocytes, distinguishing this oleate LNP from hepatocyte-targeting LNPs.

They often regulate the activity of other cells and play an important role in many hepatic diseases. In response to those pathological situations, they are activated, releasing cytokines and chemokines; they may attract circulating monocytes and exert functions that can aggravate the symptoms or drive reparation processes. As a result, liver macrophages are potential therapeutic targets that can be oriented toward a variety of aims, with emergent nanotechnology platforms potentially offering new perspectives for macrophage vectorization. Macrophages play an essential role in the final destination of nanoparticles (NPs) in the organism, as they are involved in their uptake and trafficking in vivo. Different types of delivery nanosystems for macrophage recognition and targeting, such as liposomes, solid-lipid, polymeric, or metallic nanoparticles, have been developed. Passive targeting promotes the accumulation of the NPs in the liver due to their anatomical and physiological features. This process is modulated by NP characteristics such as size, charge, and surface modifications. Active targeting approaches with specific ligands may also be used to reach liver macrophages. In order to design new systems, the NP recognition mechanism of macrophages must be understood, taking into account that variations in local microenvironment may change the phenotype of macrophages in a way that will affect the uptake and toxicity of NPs. This kind of information may be applied to diseases where macrophages play a pathogenic role, such as metabolic disorders, infections, or cancer. The kinetics of nanoparticles strongly affects their therapeutic efficacy when administered in vivo. Release kinetics could predict the behavior of nanosystems targeting macrophages and be applied to improve their characteristics. PBPK models have been developed to characterize nanoparticle biodistribution in organs of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) such as liver or spleen. Another controversial issue is the possible toxicity of non-degradable nanoparticles, which in many cases accumulate in high percentages in macrophage clearance organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidney.",

We developed a liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform to deliver mRNA-encoded peanut allergen epitopes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which function as robust tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells that induce FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects.

Lipid accumulation in hepatocytes are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic liver injury. CD36 is known to mediate long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) uptake and lipid metabolism. However, it is unclear whether LCFA directly promotes hepatocyte activation and the involved mechanisms have not been fully clarified. Mice were fed with a high fat diet (HFD) and normal hepatocyte cells (Chang liver cells) were treated with palmitic acid (PA) in vivo and in vitro. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were used to examine the gene and protein expression of molecules involved in hepatic fibrogenesis and hepatocyte activation. CD36 was knocked down by transfecting CD36 siRNA into hepatocyte cells. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected using commercial kits. HFD induced a profibrogenic response and up-regulated CD36 expression in vivo. Analogously, PA increased lipid accumulation and induced human hepatocyte activation in vitro, which was also accompanied by increased CD36 expression. Interestingly, knockdown of CD36 resulted in a reduction of hepatocyte lipid deposition and decreased expression of Acta2 (34% decrease), Vimentin (29% decrease), Desmin (60% decrease), and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway related genes. In addition, HFD and PA increased the production of H2O2 in vivo (48% increase) and in vitro (385% increase), and the antioxidant, NAC, ameliorated PA-induced hepatocyte activation. Furthermore, silencing of CD36 in vitro markedly attenuated PA-induced oxidative stress (H2O2: 41% decrease; ROS: 39% decrease), and the anti-activation effects of CD36 knockdown could be abolished by pretreatment with H2O2. Our study demonstrated that LCFA facilitates hepatocyte activation by up-regulating oxidative stress through CD36, which could be an important mechanism in the development of hepatic fibrosis."

The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects.

Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors.

We developed a liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform to deliver mRNA-encoded peanut allergen epitopes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which function as robust tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells that induce FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects. These results demonstrate an exciting application of mRNA/LNP for treatment of food allergen anaphylaxis, with the promise to be widely applicable to the allergy field."

They often regulate the activity of other cells and play an important role in many hepatic diseases. In response to those pathological situations, they are activated, releasing cytokines and chemokines; they may attract circulating monocytes and exert functions that can aggravate the symptoms or drive reparation processes. As a result, liver macrophages are potential therapeutic targets that can be oriented toward a variety of aims, with emergent nanotechnology platforms potentially offering new perspectives for macrophage vectorization. Macrophages play an essential role in the final destination of nanoparticles (NPs) in the organism, as they are involved in their uptake and trafficking in vivo. Different types of delivery nanosystems for macrophage recognition and targeting, such as liposomes, solid-lipid, polymeric, or metallic nanoparticles, have been developed. Passive targeting promotes the accumulation of the NPs in the liver due to their anatomical and physiological features. This process is modulated by NP characteristics such as size, charge, and surface modifications. Active targeting approaches with specific ligands may also be used to reach liver macrophages. In order to design new systems, the NP recognition mechanism of macrophages must be understood, taking into account that variations in local microenvironment may change the phenotype of macrophages in a way that will affect the uptake and toxicity of NPs. This kind of information may be applied to diseases where macrophages play a pathogenic role, such as metabolic disorders, infections, or cancer. The kinetics of nanoparticles strongly affects their therapeutic efficacy when administered in vivo. Release kinetics could predict the behavior of nanosystems targeting macrophages and be applied to improve their characteristics. PBPK models have been developed to characterize nanoparticle biodistribution in organs of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) such as liver or spleen. Another controversial issue is the possible toxicity of non-degradable nanoparticles, which in many cases accumulate in high percentages in macrophage clearance organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidney.",

Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

                            "While oral desensitization is capable of alleviating peanut allergen anaphylaxis, long-term immune tolerance is the sought-after goal. We developed a liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform to deliver mRNA-encoded peanut allergen epitopes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which function as robust tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells that induce FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects. These results demonstrate an exciting application of mRNA/LNP for treatment of food allergen anaphylaxis, with the promise to be widely applicable to the allergy field."

                            "Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (Wisse et al., 2008)",
                            "Nanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood. Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-RIIb2 (17). These receptors are involved in the removal of blood-borne antigens by active endocytosis. For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25)",
                            "To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38)",
                            "we demonstrated a targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs by incorporating active ligands to LNPs. The mannose ligand can interact with specific receptors (CD206) expressed on LSECs. We have shown that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) allowed selective delivery of mRNA/siRNA only to LSECs through mannose-CD206 interaction."

                            "Hepatic macrophage populations include different types of cells with plastic properties that can differentiate into diverse phenotypes to modulate their properties in response to different stimuli. They often regulate the activity of other cells and play an important role in many hepatic diseases. In response to those pathological situations, they are activated, releasing cytokines and chemokines; they may attract circulating monocytes and exert functions that can aggravate the symptoms or drive reparation processes. As a result, liver macrophages are potential therapeutic targets that can be oriented toward a variety of aims, with emergent nanotechnology platforms potentially offering new perspectives for macrophage vectorization. Macrophages play an essential role in the final destination of nanoparticles (NPs) in the organism, as they are involved in their uptake and trafficking in vivo. Different types of delivery nanosystems for macrophage recognition and targeting, such as liposomes, solid-lipid, polymeric, or metallic nanoparticles, have been developed. Passive targeting promotes the accumulation of the NPs in the liver due to their anatomical and physiological features. This process is modulated by NP characteristics such as size, charge, and surface modifications. Active targeting approaches with specific ligands may also be used to reach liver macrophages. In order to design new systems, the NP recognition mechanism of macrophages must be understood, taking into account that variations in local microenvironment may change the phenotype of macrophages in a way that will affect the uptake and toxicity of NPs. This kind of information may be applied to diseases where macrophages play a pathogenic role, such as metabolic disorders, infections, or cancer. The kinetics of nanoparticles strongly affects their therapeutic efficacy when administered in vivo. Release kinetics could predict the behavior of nanosystems targeting macrophages and be applied to improve their characteristics. PBPK models have been developed to characterize nanoparticle biodistribution in organs of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) such as liver or spleen. Another controversial issue is the possible toxicity of non-degradable nanoparticles, which in many cases accumulate in high percentages in macrophage clearance organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidney."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be highly efficient carriers of short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to hepatocytes in vivo; however, the precise mechanism by which this efficient delivery occurs has yet to be elucidated. We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

                            "Using mRNA to produce therapeutic proteins is a promising approach to treat genetic diseases. However, systemically delivering mRNA to cell types besides hepatocytes remains challenging. Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

Size-based targeting leverages the liver's unique architecture to achieve selective delivery to non-parenchymal cells without requiring additional targeting ligands. (5 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe size of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) plays a crucial role in determining their cellular tropism within the liver. This size-dependent targeting is primarily governed by the liver's distinctive architecture, particularly the presence of fenestrations between liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). These fenestrations measure approximately 100 nm in humans and 140 nm in mice, creating a natural size barrier that determines nanoparticle distribution among liver cell types. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nSmaller nanoparticles can pass through these fenestrations to reach hepatocytes, while larger particles that cannot penetrate through these openings are preferentially taken up by LSECs and Kupffer cells. This size-based targeting mechanism has been demonstrated in studies showing that LNPs with larger particle sizes can successfully deliver therapeutic payloads to LSECs, resulting in functional outcomes such as Tie2 gene silencing. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nDespite the efficacy of size-based targeting, researchers note that the detailed mechanisms underlying size-dependent cell-specific uptake are not fully understood. While size adjustment represents a passive targeting approach, it has been recognized as an effective strategy for directing LNPs to specific hepatic cell subsets. Recent research has systematically evaluated various LNP formulations with different PEG percentages and nanoparticle sizes to optimize LSEC targeting. <Paper corpusId=\"272554037\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe selective organ targeting (SORT) approach has further advanced size-based strategies by systematically engineering multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles to target specific tissues and cell types, including endothelial cells. <Paper corpusId=\"267271381\" paperTitle=\"(Kishore et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"214808084\" paperTitle=\"(Cheng et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nWhile size-based targeting provides a foundation for selective delivery to LSECs and Kupffer cells, researchers often combine this approach with other strategies, such as ligand incorporation, to enhance specificity. For comprehensive LSEC targeting, size-based approaches can be complemented by incorporating LSEC-specific ligands like mannose, which interacts with CD206 receptors expressed on LSECs, further improving targeting precision beyond what size alone can achieve. <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"272554037\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"257231907\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>",

                            "The mechanism of cellular uptake was well investigated, and adsorption of serum ApoE (apolipoprotein E) on the surface of LNPs was a major effector facilitating the intracellular delivery of LNPs into hepatocytes through low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (Akinc et al., 2010)",
                            "Because of the average diameter of liver fenestrae (~100 nm in human and ~140 nm in mouse), only small nanoparticles can penetrate through these holes (Wisse et al., 2008)",
                            "Nanoparticles that cannot penetrate through the fenestrae are taken up by different types of liver cells such as LSECs and Kupffer cells. It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood. Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-RIIb2 (17). These receptors are involved in the removal of blood-borne antigens by active endocytosis. For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25)",
                            "To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38)",
                            "we demonstrated a targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs by incorporating active ligands to LNPs. The mannose ligand can interact with specific receptors (CD206) expressed on LSECs. We have shown that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) allowed selective delivery of mRNA/siRNA only to LSECs through mannose-CD206 interaction."

                            "CRISPR\u2013Cas gene editing and messenger RNA-based protein replacement therapy hold tremendous potential to effectively treat disease-causing mutations with diverse cellular origin. However, it is currently impossible to rationally design nanoparticles that selectively target specific tissues. Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues. The addition of selective organ targeting molecules to nanoparticles allows the specific targeting of extrahepatic tissues, enabling gene editing of distinct cell populations outside the liver."

                            "While oral desensitization is capable of alleviating peanut allergen anaphylaxis, long-term immune tolerance is the sought-after goal. We developed a liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform to deliver mRNA-encoded peanut allergen epitopes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which function as robust tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells that induce FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects. These results demonstrate an exciting application of mRNA/LNP for treatment of food allergen anaphylaxis, with the promise to be widely applicable to the allergy field."

Recent research has demonstrated that altering the surface charge of LNPs can dramatically shift their biodistribution within the liver, providing a straightforward approach to target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells.\n\nA notable advancement in charge-based targeting comes from replacing zwitterionic phospholipids with anionic ones in LNP formulations. Pattipeiluhu and colleagues developed LNPs for delivery of mRNA to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system by making a single lipid change within an Onpattro\u00ae-like formulation. They replaced the zwitterionic 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) with the anionic 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DSPG), creating negatively charged LNPs that achieved specific uptake by LSECs through stabilin receptors in both zebrafish and mice models <Paper corpusId=\"247129065\" paperTitle=\"(Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"252309522\" paperTitle=\"(Steffens et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"257862241\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al._1, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe mechanism behind this targeting specificity involves the interaction between anionic particles and stabilin receptors expressed on LSECs. These studies confirm that anionic nanoparticles can be effectively taken up by LSECs through stabilin receptor-mediated endocytosis <Paper corpusId=\"257862241\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al._1, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This simple modification shifts LNP distribution from hepatocytes to liver microenvironmental cells, offering new opportunities to treat liver diseases where LSECs and Kupffer cells play key roles.\n\nBuilding on this concept, the selective organ targeting (SORT) approach incorporates molecules with different charges to precisely alter LNP biodistribution. This technology enables non-liver tissue-specific delivery by manipulating surface charge characteristics <Paper corpusId=\"275416405\" paperTitle=\"(Anand et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. The surface charge modification strategy offers several advantages, including its simplicity (requiring just a single lipid change) and its ability to significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic reticuloendothelial system cell types <Paper corpusId=\"247129065\" paperTitle=\"(Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAdditionally, researchers have explored variations in phospholipid structure to influence cell targeting. Gan and colleagues developed \"constrained phospholipids\" containing adamantyl groups that facilitated mRNA delivery to immune cells without preferentially targeting hepatocytes. These LNPs delivered mRNA to immune cells at clinically relevant doses without requiring additional targeting ligands <Paper corpusId=\"218998732\" paperTitle=\"(Gan et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"252309522\" paperTitle=\"(Steffens et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCombined with other targeting strategies such as size modification and ligand incorporation, charge-based approaches provide a versatile toolkit for directing LNPs to specific liver cell populations.

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral technologies for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP\u2010based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP\u2010based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP\u2013mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES\u2010targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver\u2010specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano\u2013biointeractions involved."

                            "Dahlman et al. used their barcode screening tool to tune the LNP biodistribution in mice based on alterations in the cholesterol component. As a consequence, the biodistribution shifted from hepatocytes to LSECs and KCs, respectively, using cholesterol-oleate or oxidized cholesterol (Paunovska et al., 2018)(Paunovska et al., 2019). Additionally, the distribution of commercial LNP formulations with DLin-MC3 compared to the ionizable lipid cKK-E12 was assessed, revealing that both formulations were not only delivered to hepatocytes but partly to LSECs and KCs (Sago et al., 2019). Furthermore, variations within the alkyl chains of the phospholipids giving \"constrained\" adamantyl-phospholipids which delivered the cargo specifically to KCs and LSECs, but not to immune cells outside the liver were evaluated (Gan et al., 2020).\n\nRecently, Pattipeiluhu et al. developed LNPs for delivery of mRNA to hepatic RES resembling the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. By replacing the phospholipid within the LNP from the zwitterionic 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) to the anionic 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DSPG) a negative surface charge was created and specific uptake by LSECs under participation of Stabilin receptors in embryonic zebrafish and mice was achieved (Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022)."

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can deliver mRNA to hepatocytes in humans, yet systemic non\u2010hepatocyte delivery at clinical doses remains difficult. We noted that LNPs have historically been formulated with phospholipids containing unconstrained alkyl tails. Based on evidence that constrained adamantyl groups have unique properties that can improve small molecule drug delivery, we hypothesized that a phospholipid containing an adamantyl group would facilitate mRNA delivery in vivo. We quantified how 109 LNPs containing \"constrained phospholipids\" delivered mRNA to 16 cell types in mice, then using a DNA barcoding\u2010based analytical pipeline, related phospholipid structure to in vivo delivery. By analyzing delivery mediated by constrained phospholipids, we identified a novel LNP that delivers mRNA to immune cells at 0.5 mg/kg. Unlike many previous LNPs, these (a) did not preferentially target hepatocytes and (b) delivered mRNA to immune cells without targeting ligands. These data suggest constrained phospholipids may be useful LNP components."

It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood. Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-RIIb2 (17). These receptors are involved in the removal of blood-borne antigens by active endocytosis. For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25)",

                            "In spite of the fact that the ability of LNPs to target hepatocytes has been widely explored, the targeted delivery of LNPs to other liver cells, such as HSCs, hepatic macrophages, Kupffer cells (KCs), and LSECs, remains a challenge. Fortunately, several studies have shown that strategies for targeting other hepatic cells with LNPs are possible",
                            "Frederick Campbell and colleagues rationally designed an anionic LNP that switched neutral LNPs surface charge into anionic based on the formulation of Onpattro, (Adams et al., 2018) which preferentially targeted mRNA delivery to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) made up of LSECs and KCs through scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and -2 mediating anionic recognition of LNPs with LSECs. (Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022) elective targeting of liver cells by using ligand-modified LNPs is another potential strategy. Mannose-modified LNPs can achieve selective delivery of nucleic acids to LSECs through the mannose receptor, which is specifically expressed on LSECs. (Kim et al., 2021)40 This strategy was employed by Andre E. Nel and his team, where they used mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid moiety of LNPs (Figure 1A), enabling LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA at the cellular level (Figure 1B), and also enhancing in vivo lung gathering of man-LNPs with the dose of 1 mg/kg (Figure 1C).

                            "While oral desensitization is capable of alleviating peanut allergen anaphylaxis, long-term immune tolerance is the sought-after goal. We developed a liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform to deliver mRNA-encoded peanut allergen epitopes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which function as robust tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells that induce FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects. These results demonstrate an exciting application of mRNA/LNP for treatment of food allergen anaphylaxis, with the promise to be widely applicable to the allergy field."

                            "In vitro internalization in primary cultures of LSECs of the three FPM formulations with the specific ligands for CD32b, CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 receptors demonstrated that specific ligand-receptor interactions plus passive targeting promoted uptake by a greater number of healthy LSECs than the micelles conjugated with their scrambled variants",
                            "Intravenous treatment of healthy rats with the different fluorescent formulations confirms that, in all cases, functionalization confers greater efficiency in entering the main liver cells than passive targeting; the capture of FPMs was clearly superior to that achieved by non-functionalized PMs, and LSECs were the liver cells with the highest uptake. Furthermore, in endothelial cells, all three types of functionalization were equally effective. In vivo cell internalization experiments also confirmed that the receptors selected as LSEC targets for our nanoparticles were also expressed in healthy Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, allowing functionalized nanoparticles to enter both cell types quite efficiently. This was expected for CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 , as their expression in the liver is elevated not only in LSECs, but also in other hepatic cell types (Liu et al., 2018)(Patsenker et al., 2009). However, CD32b, an Fc\u03b3R conferring LSECs the highest endocytic capacity of any cell in the human body, is known to be the most specific marker of these cells in the liver. Yet, recent studies have shown that CD32b is not only expressed in LSECs but also in Kupffer cells, with a liver level expression of 90% and 10%, respectively [36]."

However, it is currently impossible to rationally design nanoparticles that selectively target specific tissues. Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues. The addition of selective organ targeting molecules to nanoparticles allows the specific targeting of extrahepatic tissues, enabling gene editing of distinct cell populations outside the liver."

However, cholesterol is naturally esterified and oxidized in vivo, and these cholesterol variants are differentially trafficked in vivo via lipoproteins including LDL and VLDL. We hypothesized that incorporating the same cholesterol variants into LNPs-which can be structurally similar to LDL and VLDL-would alter nanoparticle targeting in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we quantified how >100 LNPs made with six cholesterol variants delivered DNA barcodes to 18 cell types in wild-type, LDLR-/-, and VLDLR-/- mice that were both age-matched and female. By analyzing \u223c2000 in vivo drug delivery data points, we found that LNPs formulated with esterified cholesterol delivered nucleic acids more efficiently than LNPs formulated with regular or oxidized cholesterol when compared across all tested cell types in the mouse. We also identified an LNP containing cholesteryl oleate that efficiently delivered siRNA and sgRNA to liver endothelial cells in vivo. Delivery was as-or more-efficient as the same LNP made with unmodified cholesterol. Moreover, delivery to liver endothelial cells was 3 times more efficient than delivery to hepatocytes, distinguishing this oleate LNP from hepatocyte-targeting LNPs. RNA delivery can be improved by rationally selecting cholesterol variants, allowing optimization of nanoparticle targeting."

Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B.

                            "Dahlman et al. used their barcode screening tool to tune the LNP biodistribution in mice based on alterations in the cholesterol component. As a consequence, the biodistribution shifted from hepatocytes to LSECs and KCs, respectively, using cholesterol-oleate or oxidized cholesterol (Paunovska et al., 2018)(Paunovska et al., 2019). Additionally, the distribution of commercial LNP formulations with DLin-MC3 compared to the ionizable lipid cKK-E12 was assessed, revealing that both formulations were not only delivered to hepatocytes but partly to LSECs and KCs (Sago et al., 2019). Furthermore, variations within the alkyl chains of the phospholipids giving \"constrained\" adamantyl-phospholipids which delivered the cargo specifically to KCs and LSECs, but not to immune cells outside the liver were evaluated (Gan et al., 2020).\n\nRecently, Pattipeiluhu et al. developed LNPs for delivery of mRNA to hepatic RES resembling the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. By replacing the phospholipid within the LNP from the zwitterionic 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) to the anionic 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DSPG) a negative surface charge was created and specific uptake by LSECs under participation of Stabilin receptors in embryonic zebrafish and mice was achieved (Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022)."

                            "Hepatic macrophage populations include different types of cells with plastic properties that can differentiate into diverse phenotypes to modulate their properties in response to different stimuli. They often regulate the activity of other cells and play an important role in many hepatic diseases. In response to those pathological situations, they are activated, releasing cytokines and chemokines; they may attract circulating monocytes and exert functions that can aggravate the symptoms or drive reparation processes. As a result, liver macrophages are potential therapeutic targets that can be oriented toward a variety of aims, with emergent nanotechnology platforms potentially offering new perspectives for macrophage vectorization. Macrophages play an essential role in the final destination of nanoparticles (NPs) in the organism, as they are involved in their uptake and trafficking in vivo. Different types of delivery nanosystems for macrophage recognition and targeting, such as liposomes, solid-lipid, polymeric, or metallic nanoparticles, have been developed. Passive targeting promotes the accumulation of the NPs in the liver due to their anatomical and physiological features. This process is modulated by NP characteristics such as size, charge, and surface modifications. Active targeting approaches with specific ligands may also be used to reach liver macrophages. In order to design new systems, the NP recognition mechanism of macrophages must be understood, taking into account that variations in local microenvironment may change the phenotype of macrophages in a way that will affect the uptake and toxicity of NPs. This kind of information may be applied to diseases where macrophages play a pathogenic role, such as metabolic disorders, infections, or cancer. The kinetics of nanoparticles strongly affects their therapeutic efficacy when administered in vivo. Release kinetics could predict the behavior of nanosystems targeting macrophages and be applied to improve their characteristics. PBPK models have been developed to characterize nanoparticle biodistribution in organs of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) such as liver or spleen. Another controversial issue is the possible toxicity of non-degradable nanoparticles, which in many cases accumulate in high percentages in macrophage clearance organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidney."

This approach has been successfully applied beyond basic drug delivery, with researchers developing liver-targeting LNP platforms decorated with lipid-anchored mannose ligands to deliver mRNA-encoded peanut allergen epitopes to LSECs, which function as tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells that induce regulatory T-cells and suppress allergic responses <Paper corpusId=\"257231907\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"272554037\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nStabilin receptor targeting represents another effective approach for LSEC-specific delivery. Pattipeiluhu and colleagues developed LNPs for delivery of mRNA to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system by replacing the zwitterionic phospholipid DSPC with the anionic DSPG in an Onpattro\u00ae-like formulation. This simple modification created negatively charged LNPs that achieved specific uptake by LSECs through stabilin receptors in both zebrafish and mice models <Paper corpusId=\"247129065\" paperTitle=\"(Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"257862241\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al._1, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

In vitro internalization studies in primary LSEC cultures demonstrated that these specific ligand-receptor interactions, combined with passive targeting, promoted uptake by a greater number of healthy LSECs compared to micelles conjugated with scrambled ligand variants <Paper corpusId=\"264137468\" paperTitle=\"(Gil et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, it's important to note that achieving absolute cell-type specificity remains challenging. For example, while CD32b was initially considered highly specific for LSECs, recent studies have shown it is also expressed in Kupffer cells, with liver expression distributed approximately 90% in LSECs and 10% in Kupffer cells <Paper corpusId=\"264137468\" paperTitle=\"(Gil et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor comprehensive targeting strategies, researchers often combine receptor-mediated approaches with other methods.

Additionally, researchers have explored using \"constrained phospholipids\" containing adamantyl groups that facilitate mRNA delivery to immune cells without preferentially targeting hepatocytes and without requiring additional targeting ligands <Paper corpusId=\"218998732\" paperTitle=\"(Gan et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese receptor-mediated targeting approaches can be implemented through various methods, including direct introduction of targeting ligands during LNP production or by post-insertion of targeting ligands into preformed LNPs <Paper corpusId=\"272554037\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

It was shown that LNPs with larger particle size can be delivered to LSECs and induced Tie2 gene silencing (23). The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood. Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-RIIb2 (17).

For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25)",

Fortunately, several studies have shown that strategies for targeting other hepatic cells with LNPs are possible",
                            "Frederick Campbell and colleagues rationally designed an anionic LNP that switched neutral LNPs surface charge into anionic based on the formulation of Onpattro, (Adams et al., 2018) which preferentially targeted mRNA delivery to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) made up of LSECs and KCs through scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and -2 mediating anionic recognition of LNPs with LSECs. (Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022) elective targeting of liver cells by using ligand-modified LNPs is another potential strategy. Mannose-modified LNPs can achieve selective delivery of nucleic acids to LSECs through the mannose receptor, which is specifically expressed on LSECs. (Kim et al., 2021)40 This strategy was employed by Andre E. Nel and his team, where they used mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid moiety of LNPs (Figure 1A), enabling LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA at the cellular level (Figure 1B), and also enhancing in vivo lung gathering of man-LNPs with the dose of 1 mg/kg (Figure 1C).

                            "While oral desensitization is capable of alleviating peanut allergen anaphylaxis, long-term immune tolerance is the sought-after goal. We developed a liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform to deliver mRNA-encoded peanut allergen epitopes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which function as robust tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells that induce FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects. These results demonstrate an exciting application of mRNA/LNP for treatment of food allergen anaphylaxis, with the promise to be widely applicable to the allergy field."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral technologies for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP\u2010based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP\u2010based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP\u2013mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES\u2010targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver\u2010specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano\u2013biointeractions involved."

It is reported that increasing the size of LNPs and surface modification of LNP with hydrophobic molecules could enhance the cellular uptake and promote immune regulation of Kupffer cells. (Colino et al., 2020) Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) reside in the liver sinusoids and are responsible for blood filtration, metabolism regulation, antigen presentation, and lipid metabolism. (Xu et al., 2023) To realize the Kupffer cell or LSECs specific mRNA delivery, Dahlem group applied many different kinds of cholesterol in the prescription of LNP, and found the structure of cholesterol has a great influence on the targeting ability of LNP. (Paunovska et al., 2019) They screened LNP formulated with different oxidized cholesterol with fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) system, and conclude that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol will deliver mRNA to cells in the liver microenvironment, including Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells, which is different from the traditional LNP that mainly target to hepatocyte",

                            "Dahlman et al. used their barcode screening tool to tune the LNP biodistribution in mice based on alterations in the cholesterol component. As a consequence, the biodistribution shifted from hepatocytes to LSECs and KCs, respectively, using cholesterol-oleate or oxidized cholesterol (Paunovska et al., 2018)(Paunovska et al., 2019). Additionally, the distribution of commercial LNP formulations with DLin-MC3 compared to the ionizable lipid cKK-E12 was assessed, revealing that both formulations were not only delivered to hepatocytes but partly to LSECs and KCs (Sago et al., 2019). Furthermore, variations within the alkyl chains of the phospholipids giving \"constrained\" adamantyl-phospholipids which delivered the cargo specifically to KCs and LSECs, but not to immune cells outside the liver were evaluated (Gan et al., 2020).\n\nRecently, Pattipeiluhu et al. developed LNPs for delivery of mRNA to hepatic RES resembling the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. By replacing the phospholipid within the LNP from the zwitterionic 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) to the anionic 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DSPG) a negative surface charge was created and specific uptake by LSECs under participation of Stabilin receptors in embryonic zebrafish and mice was achieved (Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022)."

                            "Intravenous treatment of healthy rats with the different fluorescent formulations confirms that, in all cases, functionalization confers greater efficiency in entering the main liver cells than passive targeting; the capture of FPMs was clearly superior to that achieved by non-functionalized PMs, and LSECs were the liver cells with the highest uptake. Furthermore, in endothelial cells, all three types of functionalization were equally effective. In vivo cell internalization experiments also confirmed that the receptors selected as LSEC targets for our nanoparticles were also expressed in healthy Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, allowing functionalized nanoparticles to enter both cell types quite efficiently. This was expected for CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 , as their expression in the liver is elevated not only in LSECs, but also in other hepatic cell types (Liu et al., 2018)(Patsenker et al., 2009). However, CD32b, an Fc\u03b3R conferring LSECs the highest endocytic capacity of any cell in the human body, is known to be the most specific marker of these cells in the liver. Yet, recent studies have shown that CD32b is not only expressed in LSECs but also in Kupffer cells, with a liver level expression of 90% and 10%, respectively [36]."

                            "Abstract Once inside the cytoplasm of a cell, mRNA can be used to treat disease by upregulating the expression of any gene. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can deliver mRNA to hepatocytes in humans, yet systemic non\u2010hepatocyte delivery at clinical doses remains difficult. We noted that LNPs have historically been formulated with phospholipids containing unconstrained alkyl tails. Based on evidence that constrained adamantyl groups have unique properties that can improve small molecule drug delivery, we hypothesized that a phospholipid containing an adamantyl group would facilitate mRNA delivery in vivo. We quantified how 109 LNPs containing \"constrained phospholipids\" delivered mRNA to 16 cell types in mice, then using a DNA barcoding\u2010based analytical pipeline, related phospholipid structure to in vivo delivery. By analyzing delivery mediated by constrained phospholipids, we identified a novel LNP that delivers mRNA to immune cells at 0.5 mg/kg. Unlike many previous LNPs, these (a) did not preferentially target hepatocytes and (b) delivered mRNA to immune cells without targeting ligands. These data suggest constrained phospholipids may be useful LNP components."

Combining multiple targeting strategies often yields superior results compared to single-mechanism approaches. (5 sources)",
                "text": "\nWhen comparing the various strategies for targeting liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells, each approach demonstrates distinct advantages and limitations in terms of targeting specificity, delivery efficiency, and practical implementation. Understanding these comparative differences is essential for selecting the optimal targeting strategy for specific therapeutic applications.\n\nSurface ligand approaches targeting specific receptors generally demonstrate superior targeting precision compared to passive strategies based solely on size or charge. In vitro studies with functionalized polymeric micelles targeting CD32b, CD36, and integrin \u03b1V\u03b23 receptors showed that specific ligand-receptor interactions combined with passive targeting promoted uptake by a significantly greater number of healthy LSECs compared to non-functionalized variants or those with scrambled ligands <Paper corpusId=\"264137468\" paperTitle=\"(Gil et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, in vivo experiments revealed that while these functionalized formulations achieved superior liver cell uptake compared to non-functionalized versions, the receptors targeted were not exclusively expressed on LSECs. Even CD32b, initially considered highly specific for LSECs, showed expression in Kupffer cells (approximately 10% versus 90% in LSECs) <Paper corpusId=\"264137468\" paperTitle=\"(Gil et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAmong the various receptor-targeting approaches, mannose-based targeting (targeting CD206) and anionic charge-based targeting (engaging stabilin receptors) have demonstrated particularly high specificity for LSECs. These approaches effectively redirect LNPs from hepatocytes to LSECs, with minimal uptake by other liver cell types. In contrast, oxidized cholesterol modifications achieve a more balanced targeting profile between LSECs and Kupffer cells, making them particularly suitable for applications requiring delivery to both cell types <Paper corpusId=\"272838041\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe structure of modified cholesterols significantly influences targeting efficiency. Studies using the Fast Identification Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) system demonstrated that LNPs containing oxidized cholesterol efficiently deliver mRNA to liver microenvironmental cells, including both Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells, at clinically relevant doses (0.05 mg/kg) <Paper corpusId=\"272838041\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"73435998\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Importantly, these LNPs target liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes without requiring additional targeting ligands, highlighting the remarkable efficiency of this approach <Paper corpusId=\"272838041\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"73435998\" paperTitle=\"(Paunovska et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nWhen targeting hepatocytes specifically while minimizing LSEC uptake, GalNAc ligand modifications have proven effective. This approach is particularly important in applications where LSEC activation should be avoided, as research has shown that LNP accumulation in LSECs can activate endothelial cells and trigger neutrophilic inflammation, potentially inducing both hepatic and systemic toxicity <Paper corpusId=\"268147071\" paperTitle=\"(Lin et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor applications requiring enhanced Kupffer cell targeting and immunoregulation, strategies including increasing LNP size and modifying LNP surfaces with hydrophobic molecules have shown promise <Paper corpusId=\"272838041\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"212114474\" paperTitle=\"(Colino et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. These approaches leverage the phagocytic nature of Kupffer cells and their preference for larger, more hydrophobic particles.\n\nCombination strategies that integrate multiple targeting mechanisms often yield superior results compared to single-mechanism approaches. For example, combining size-based targeting with surface ligand modifications or incorporating both charge modifications and specialized cholesterols can enhance targeting specificity and delivery efficiency beyond what can be achieved with any single strategy alone <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nThe optimal targeting strategy ultimately depends on the specific therapeutic application, target cell population, and desired pharmacokinetic profile. For applications requiring high LSEC specificity, mannose receptor targeting appears most effective, while oxidized cholesterol modifications offer a balanced approach for targeting both LSECs and Kupffer cells. When hepatocyte-specific delivery is required with minimal LSEC uptake, GalNAc modifications represent the preferred approach <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.",

                            "Intravenous treatment of healthy rats with the different fluorescent formulations confirms that, in all cases, functionalization confers greater efficiency in entering the main liver cells than passive targeting; the capture of FPMs was clearly superior to that achieved by non-functionalized PMs, and LSECs were the liver cells with the highest uptake. Furthermore, in endothelial cells, all three types of functionalization were equally effective. In vivo cell internalization experiments also confirmed that the receptors selected as LSEC targets for our nanoparticles were also expressed in healthy Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, allowing functionalized nanoparticles to enter both cell types quite efficiently. This was expected for CD36 and integrin \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 , as their expression in the liver is elevated not only in LSECs, but also in other hepatic cell types (Liu et al., 2018)(Patsenker et al., 2009). However, CD32b, an Fc\u03b3R conferring LSECs the highest endocytic capacity of any cell in the human body, is known to be the most specific marker of these cells in the liver. Yet, recent studies have shown that CD32b is not only expressed in LSECs but also in Kupffer cells, with a liver level expression of 90% and 10%, respectively [36]."

                            "Using mRNA to produce therapeutic proteins is a promising approach to treat genetic diseases. However, systemically delivering mRNA to cell types besides hepatocytes remains challenging. Fast identification of nanoparticle delivery (FIND) is a DNA barcode\u2010based system designed to measure how over 100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that functions in the cytoplasm of target cells in a single mouse. By using FIND to quantify how 75 chemically distinct LNPs delivered mRNA to 28 cell types in vivo, it is found that an LNP formulated with oxidized cholesterol and no targeting ligand delivers Cre mRNA, which edits DNA in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells at 0.05 mg kg\u22121. Notably, the LNP targets liver microenvironmental cells fivefold more potently than hepatocytes. The structure of the oxidized cholesterols added to the LNP is systematically varied to show that the position of the oxidative modification may be important; cholesterols modified on the hydrocarbon tail associated with sterol ring D tend to outperform cholesterols modified on sterol ring B. These data suggest that LNPs formulated with modified cholesterols can deliver gene\u2010editing mRNA to the liver microenvironment at clinically relevant doses."

                            "Hepatic macrophage populations include different types of cells with plastic properties that can differentiate into diverse phenotypes to modulate their properties in response to different stimuli. They often regulate the activity of other cells and play an important role in many hepatic diseases. In response to those pathological situations, they are activated, releasing cytokines and chemokines; they may attract circulating monocytes and exert functions that can aggravate the symptoms or drive reparation processes. As a result, liver macrophages are potential therapeutic targets that can be oriented toward a variety of aims, with emergent nanotechnology platforms potentially offering new perspectives for macrophage vectorization. Macrophages play an essential role in the final destination of nanoparticles (NPs) in the organism, as they are involved in their uptake and trafficking in vivo. Different types of delivery nanosystems for macrophage recognition and targeting, such as liposomes, solid-lipid, polymeric, or metallic nanoparticles, have been developed. Passive targeting promotes the accumulation of the NPs in the liver due to their anatomical and physiological features. This process is modulated by NP characteristics such as size, charge, and surface modifications. Active targeting approaches with specific ligands may also be used to reach liver macrophages. In order to design new systems, the NP recognition mechanism of macrophages must be understood, taking into account that variations in local microenvironment may change the phenotype of macrophages in a way that will affect the uptake and toxicity of NPs. This kind of information may be applied to diseases where macrophages play a pathogenic role, such as metabolic disorders, infections, or cancer. The kinetics of nanoparticles strongly affects their therapeutic efficacy when administered in vivo. Release kinetics could predict the behavior of nanosystems targeting macrophages and be applied to improve their characteristics. PBPK models have been developed to characterize nanoparticle biodistribution in organs of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) such as liver or spleen. Another controversial issue is the possible toxicity of non-degradable nanoparticles, which in many cases accumulate in high percentages in macrophage clearance organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidney."
