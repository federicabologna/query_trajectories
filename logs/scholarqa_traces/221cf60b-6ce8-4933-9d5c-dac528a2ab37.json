This combination enables targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents to tumor site through recognizing target antigens by antibody while minimizing off-target effects on healthy tissues. Clinically, ADCs overcome the limitations of traditional chemotherapy, which lacks target specificity, and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies, providing higher efficacy and fewer toxicity anti-tumor biopharmaceuticals. ADCs have ushered in a new era of targeted cancer therapy, with 15 drugs currently approved for clinical use. Additionally, ADCs are being investigated as potential therapeutic candidates for autoimmune diseases, persistent bacterial infections, and other challenging indications. Despite their therapeutic benefits, the development and application of ADCs face significant challenges, including antibody immunogenicity, linker instability, and inadequate control over the release of cytotoxic agent. How can ADCs be designed to be safer and more efficient? What is the future development direction of ADCs? This review provides a comprehensive overview of ADCs, summarizing the structural and functional characteristics of the three core components, antibody, linker, and payload. Furthermore, we systematically assess the advancements and challenges associated with the 15 approved ADCs in cancer therapy, while also exploring the future directions and ongoing challenges. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of next-generation ADCs for wider clinical applications.",

                    "text": "Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy. These linkers also tend to inhibit bystander effects, because the released catabolites have poor cellular permeability. Consequently, identifying alternatives to improve drug release and enhance therapeutic outcomes has become a major focus of ongoing research. \n\nCurrently, 73.3% (11/15) of approved ADCs and 75.0% (18/24) of phase III ADCs employ cleavable linkers, with peptide linkers being the most common subtype. These account for 46.7% (7/15) of approved ADCs and 58.3% (14/24) of those in phase III. In comparison to chemically cleavable linkers, enzyme-cleavable linkers exploit abundant intracellular hydrolases to facilitate controlled drug release. This enzymatic mechanism ensures greater stability in plasma, making enzyme-cleavable linker more competitive for future ADC development. To enhance linker solubility and mitigate polymerization, polar groups such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be incorporated into the linker structure. This strategy has been employed in the marketed ADCs loncastuximab tesirine and sacituzumab govitecan, as well as in phase III clinical candidates such as trastuzumab duocarmazine, ARX-788, and DP-303c. Additionally, designing linkers with multiple attachment sites for payloads enhances the number and diversity of the conjugated drugs, which not only improves therapeutic efficacy but also reduces the potential for resistance.",

These linkers enhance plasma stability, rendering them less susceptible to the chemical or enzymatic environment in vivo following the internalization of ADCs by target cells [144,145]. Once internalized, the antibody component of the ADCs is degraded within lysosomes, resulting in a complex of amino acids, linker, and cytotoxic agent. This mechanism ensures precise drug delivery to tumor cells, minimizing nonspecific drug release and reducing off-target effects [146]. Trastuzumab emtansine, the first ADC to utilize a non-cleavable linker, employs N-succinimidyl-4-(maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid (SMCC), a flexible dualreactive (amine/thiol) linker, to conjugate the cytotoxic agent DM1 (emtansine) to trastuzumab [147]. This ADC targets HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (HER2 + mBC) cells, and upon lysosomal degradation, releases lysine-MCC-DM1, leading to direct tumor cell killing [148]. Similarly, belantamab mafodotin, an approved ADC for R/R MM, utilizes the MC linker to attach cytotoxic agents to mAbs [149]. Furthermore, oxime-type and triazole-type linkers are now also employed in the design of non-cleavable linkers, such as in FS-1502, currently in phase III, which utilizes geranyl ketone pyrophosphate oxime to conjugate cytotoxins for HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2 + BC) [150]. Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy.",

This combination enables targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents to tumor site through recognizing target antigens by antibody while minimizing off-target effects on healthy tissues. Clinically, ADCs overcome the limitations of traditional chemotherapy, which lacks target specificity, and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies, providing higher efficacy and fewer toxicity anti-tumor biopharmaceuticals. ADCs have ushered in a new era of targeted cancer therapy, with 15 drugs currently approved for clinical use. Additionally, ADCs are being investigated as potential therapeutic candidates for autoimmune diseases, persistent bacterial infections, and other challenging indications. Despite their therapeutic benefits, the development and application of ADCs face significant challenges, including antibody immunogenicity, linker instability, and inadequate control over the release of cytotoxic agent. How can ADCs be designed to be safer and more efficient? What is the future development direction of ADCs? This review provides a comprehensive overview of ADCs, summarizing the structural and functional characteristics of the three core components, antibody, linker, and payload. Furthermore, we systematically assess the advancements and challenges associated with the 15 approved ADCs in cancer therapy, while also exploring the future directions and ongoing challenges. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of next-generation ADCs for wider clinical applications.\n## Non-cleavable linkers\nNon-cleavable linkers, including thioether and maleimidocaproyl (MC) types, offer significant advantages due to their stable chemical bonds, which prevent proteolytic cleavage and contribute to reduced off-target toxicity. These linkers enhance plasma stability, rendering them less susceptible to the chemical or enzymatic environment in vivo following the internalization of ADCs by target cells [144,145]. Once internalized, the antibody component of the ADCs is degraded within lysosomes, resulting in a complex of amino acids, linker, and cytotoxic agent. This mechanism ensures precise drug delivery to tumor cells, minimizing nonspecific drug release and reducing off-target effects [146]. Trastuzumab emtansine, the first ADC to utilize a non-cleavable linker, employs N-succinimidyl-4-(maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid (SMCC), a flexible dualreactive (amine/thiol) linker, to conjugate the cytotoxic agent DM1 (emtansine) to trastuzumab [147]. This ADC targets HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (HER2 + mBC) cells, and upon lysosomal degradation, releases lysine-MCC-DM1, leading to direct tumor cell killing [148]. Similarly, belantamab mafodotin, an approved ADC for R/R MM, utilizes the MC linker to attach cytotoxic agents to mAbs [149]. Furthermore, oxime-type and triazole-type linkers are now also employed in the design of non-cleavable linkers, such as in FS-1502, currently in phase III, which utilizes geranyl ketone pyrophosphate oxime to conjugate cytotoxins for HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2 + BC) [150]. Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy.\n...\nDespite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy. These linkers also tend to inhibit bystander effects, because the released catabolites have poor cellular permeability. Consequently, identifying alternatives to improve drug release and enhance therapeutic outcomes has become a major focus of ongoing research. \n\nCurrently, 73.3% (11/15) of approved ADCs and 75.0% (18/24) of phase III ADCs employ cleavable linkers, with peptide linkers being the most common subtype. These account for 46.7% (7/15) of approved ADCs and 58.3% (14/24) of those in phase III. In comparison to chemically cleavable linkers, enzyme-cleavable linkers exploit abundant intracellular hydrolases to facilitate controlled drug release. This enzymatic mechanism ensures greater stability in plasma, making enzyme-cleavable linker more competitive for future ADC development. To enhance linker solubility and mitigate polymerization, polar groups such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be incorporated into the linker structure. This strategy has been employed in the marketed ADCs loncastuximab tesirine and sacituzumab govitecan, as well as in phase III clinical candidates such as trastuzumab duocarmazine, ARX-788, and DP-303c. Additionally, designing linkers with multiple attachment sites for payloads enhances the number and diversity of the conjugated drugs, which not only improves therapeutic efficacy but also reduces the potential for resistance.",

Consequently, this drug class has demonstrated activity in multiple malignancies refractory to standard therapeutic options. Despite this, limitations exist, including narrow therapeutic windows, unique toxicity profiles, development of therapeutic resistance, and appropriate biomarker selection.

Optimal linkers are stable in the circulation, which prevents premature payload release and systemic toxicities, but then rapidly cleaved once internalised in malignant cells, promoting efficient cell death [19,20]. There are two types of linkers, classified based on the payload release mechanism: cleavable and noncleavable [21]. Cleavable linkers are designed to be degraded intracellularly, in response to a change from the extracellular environment to the intracellular environment [20]. There are a variety of triggers for the degradation of cleavable linkers, including specific lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B (which cleaves Val-Cit and Val-Ala linkers coupled with PABC), acidic pH (which cleaves hydrazone), and glutathione (which cleaves disulfide bonds) [20]. The majority of currently approved ADCs use cleavable linkers, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and inotuzumab ozogamicin [6,21]. The advantages of cleavable linkers are the intracellular release of the payload and stability in the circulation, while disadvantages include potential premature cleavage in the peripheral circulation [20,[22][23][24]. \n\nIn contrast, non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds that are resistant to proteolysis [21]. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers rely on the near complete degradation of the antibody component by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases, which leaves the payload attached to the linker and an amino acid residue derived from the antibody [21].",

Lim\n## Abstract\nAntibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have provided new therapeutic options and significant promise for patients with cancer, particularly where existing treatments are limited. Substantial effort in ADC development is underway globally, with 13 ADCs currently approved and many more in development. The therapeutic benefits of ADCs leverage the ability to selectively target cancer cells through antibody binding, resultant relative sparing of non-malignant tissues, and the targeted delivery of a cytotoxic payload. Consequently, this drug class has demonstrated activity in multiple malignancies refractory to standard therapeutic options. Despite this, limitations exist, including narrow therapeutic windows, unique toxicity profiles, development of therapeutic resistance, and appropriate biomarker selection. This review will describe the development of ADCs, their mechanisms of action, pivotal trials, and approved indications and identify common themes. Current challenges and opportunities will be discussed for this drug class in cancer therapeutics at a time when significant developments in antibody therapies, immunotherapy, and targeted agents are occurring.\n## Linkers\nLinkers play a critical role in ensuring ADC stability and in optimising the delivery of the cytotoxic payload to tumour cells. Optimal linkers are stable in the circulation, which prevents premature payload release and systemic toxicities, but then rapidly cleaved once internalised in malignant cells, promoting efficient cell death [19,20]. There are two types of linkers, classified based on the payload release mechanism: cleavable and noncleavable [21]. Cleavable linkers are designed to be degraded intracellularly, in response to a change from the extracellular environment to the intracellular environment [20]. There are a variety of triggers for the degradation of cleavable linkers, including specific lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B (which cleaves Val-Cit and Val-Ala linkers coupled with PABC), acidic pH (which cleaves hydrazone), and glutathione (which cleaves disulfide bonds) [20]. The majority of currently approved ADCs use cleavable linkers, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and inotuzumab ozogamicin [6,21]. The advantages of cleavable linkers are the intracellular release of the payload and stability in the circulation, while disadvantages include potential premature cleavage in the peripheral circulation [20,[22][23][24]. \n\nIn contrast, non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds that are resistant to proteolysis [21]. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers rely on the near complete degradation of the antibody component by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases, which leaves the payload attached to the linker and an amino acid residue derived from the antibody [21].",

Among them, chemically unstable linkers can undergo cleavage in the acidic environment of tumors to release drugs efficiently, but their stability in the blood circulation is relatively poor, which usually leads to premature drug delivery [73,81,82]. The emergence of enzyme-sensitive linkers has solved this problem by improving stability and delivery efficiency through specific cleavage using specific enzymes overexpressed in tumors [83,84]. Non-cleavable linkers release the drug by enzymatic complete degradation within the lysosome, which has the advantage of high stability and low off-target toxicity, but their low release efficiency and inability to produce a bystander effect need to be optimized by optimizing the payload structure to improve the efficacy [85].",

            "abstract": "Simple Summary Since the first antibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC) was approved in 2000, the landscape of these targeted drugs has evolved over the years, profoundly changing the treatment scenario of various advanced-stage cancers, including solid tumors. With a better understanding of the construct\u2019s mechanism of action and tumor biology, continuous efforts are made to fine-tune the ADC design and enhance the therapeutic index and tolerability of next-generation conjugates, promising to become the future of personalized cancer medicines. In this review, we outline the evolution of ADC development and discuss the existing challenges and future trends in the field. Abstract Introduced almost two decades ago, ADCs have marked a breakthrough in the targeted therapy era, providing clinical benefits to many cancer patients. While the inherent complexity of this class of drugs has challenged their development and broad application, the experience gained from years of trials and errors and recent advances in construct design and delivery have led to an increased number of ADCs approved or in late clinical development in only five years. Target and payload diversification, along with novel conjugation and linker technologies, are at the forefront of next-generation ADC development, renewing hopes to broaden the scope of these targeted drugs to difficult-to-treat cancers and beyond. This review highlights recent trends in the ADC field, focusing on construct design and mechanism of action and their implications on ADCs\u2019 therapeutic profile. The evolution from conventional to innovative ADC formats will be illustrated, along with some of the current hurdles, including toxicity and drug resistance. Future directions to improve the design of next-generation ADCs will also be presented.",

                    "text": "Due to their resistance to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, these linkers enjoy the advantages of increased plasma stability, longer half-lives, and lower off-target toxicity than the cleavable counterpart, rendering them potentially superior for targeting homogenously expressed Ag [2,25,32,43,44]. Nonetheless, as most tumors display heterogenous Ag expression, constructs incorporating cleavable linkers with membranepermeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects, unlike the non-cleavable linker type [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nAs the ADC field evolves dynamically and the payload arsenal rapidly expands, linker optimization has become crucial to maximizing the therapeutic index while improving biodistribution and PK profiles [1,6,25,32,43]. The currently explored strategies include (1) increasing the linker hydrophilicity (e.g., by incorporating negatively charged groups, like sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), phosphate, or pyrophosphate groups) to enhance systemic stability by reducing payload hydrophobicity-driven ADC aggregation and clearance [43,44]; (2) polyvalent or branched hydrophilic linkers, such as Fleximer TM linkers or PEG chain additions, that enable high DAR without compromising the ADC physicochemical properties and PK [6]; and (3) tandem or dual-cleavage linkers requiring successive cleavage by lysosomal enzymes, which ensure tumor specificity while increasing both stability and tolerability [6,25,32]. Other recently emerged cleavable linker classes with higher plasma stability include lysosomal protease-cleavable linkers such as sulfatase-and legumain-cleavable linkers [53,54], while more innovative, albeit still exploratory, linker technologies include photo-sensitive and biorthogonal cleavable linkers, which widen up the opportunity for nonendocytic ADCs [32,43].",

                    "text": "The linker, tethering the cytotoxic payload to the mAb, is another crucial factor influencing ADCs therapeutic index and PK, as it determines plasma stability and release profile of the payload [2,4,25,32]. Generally, most ADC drugs incorporate two types of covalent linkers, cleavable and non-cleavable, which differ in their intracellular processing and systemic stability. While both have been shown to be safe in preclinical and clinical settings, cleavable linkers currently dominate the ADC landscape. For a comprehensive overview of the topic, the readers are advised to refer to [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nCleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the cancer TME over healthy tissues or systemic circulation [2,25,32,43,44]. They can be either chemically or enzymatically labile. Chemical linkers include hydrazone-or disulfide-bond-based linkers. The first type, used in commercially available Mylotarg \u00ae and Besponsa \u00ae , is sensitive to low pH and can be hydrolyzed within acidic early endosomes post-uptake. The second one can undergo reduction via intracellular thiols such as glutathione (GSH), whose levels are generally elevated in cancer cells (1-10 mmol/L) than in blood (5 \u00b5mol/L) [45]. These linker types generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload able to promote bystander killing [1,2,32]. Notably, acid-sensitive linkers are insufficiently stable and can occasionally be hydrolyzed in the plasma, leading to premature drug release and off-target toxicity. This liability is one of the causes leading to the voluntary Mylotarg \u00ae withdrawal by Pfizer from the US market in 2000, following the severe liver toxicity seen in patients [46][47][48]. The subsequent linker redesign and dosing schedule optimization have led to ADC reapproval in 2017 [46,49,50].",

Engelholm\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Since the first antibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC) was approved in 2000, the landscape of these targeted drugs has evolved over the years, profoundly changing the treatment scenario of various advanced-stage cancers, including solid tumors. With a better understanding of the construct\u2019s mechanism of action and tumor biology, continuous efforts are made to fine-tune the ADC design and enhance the therapeutic index and tolerability of next-generation conjugates, promising to become the future of personalized cancer medicines. In this review, we outline the evolution of ADC development and discuss the existing challenges and future trends in the field. Abstract Introduced almost two decades ago, ADCs have marked a breakthrough in the targeted therapy era, providing clinical benefits to many cancer patients. While the inherent complexity of this class of drugs has challenged their development and broad application, the experience gained from years of trials and errors and recent advances in construct design and delivery have led to an increased number of ADCs approved or in late clinical development in only five years. Target and payload diversification, along with novel conjugation and linker technologies, are at the forefront of next-generation ADC development, renewing hopes to broaden the scope of these targeted drugs to difficult-to-treat cancers and beyond. This review highlights recent trends in the ADC field, focusing on construct design and mechanism of action and their implications on ADCs\u2019 therapeutic profile. The evolution from conventional to innovative ADC formats will be illustrated, along with some of the current hurdles, including toxicity and drug resistance. Future directions to improve the design of next-generation ADCs will also be presented.\n## The Linker-A Balancing Bridge\nThe linker, tethering the cytotoxic payload to the mAb, is another crucial factor influencing ADCs therapeutic index and PK, as it determines plasma stability and release profile of the payload [2,4,25,32]. Generally, most ADC drugs incorporate two types of covalent linkers, cleavable and non-cleavable, which differ in their intracellular processing and systemic stability. While both have been shown to be safe in preclinical and clinical settings, cleavable linkers currently dominate the ADC landscape. For a comprehensive overview of the topic, the readers are advised to refer to [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nCleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the cancer TME over healthy tissues or systemic circulation [2,25,32,43,44]. They can be either chemically or enzymatically labile. Chemical linkers include hydrazone-or disulfide-bond-based linkers. The first type, used in commercially available Mylotarg \u00ae and Besponsa \u00ae , is sensitive to low pH and can be hydrolyzed within acidic early endosomes post-uptake. The second one can undergo reduction via intracellular thiols such as glutathione (GSH), whose levels are generally elevated in cancer cells (1-10 mmol/L) than in blood (5 \u00b5mol/L) [45]. These linker types generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload able to promote bystander killing [1,2,32]. Notably, acid-sensitive linkers are insufficiently stable and can occasionally be hydrolyzed in the plasma, leading to premature drug release and off-target toxicity. This liability is one of the causes leading to the voluntary Mylotarg \u00ae withdrawal by Pfizer from the US market in 2000, following the severe liver toxicity seen in patients [46][47][48]. The subsequent linker redesign and dosing schedule optimization have led to ADC reapproval in 2017 [46,49,50].\n...\nDue to their resistance to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, these linkers enjoy the advantages of increased plasma stability, longer half-lives, and lower off-target toxicity than the cleavable counterpart, rendering them potentially superior for targeting homogenously expressed Ag [2,25,32,43,44]. Nonetheless, as most tumors display heterogenous Ag expression, constructs incorporating cleavable linkers with membranepermeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects, unlike the non-cleavable linker type [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nAs the ADC field evolves dynamically and the payload arsenal rapidly expands, linker optimization has become crucial to maximizing the therapeutic index while improving biodistribution and PK profiles [1,6,25,32,43]. The currently explored strategies include (1) increasing the linker hydrophilicity (e.g., by incorporating negatively charged groups, like sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), phosphate, or pyrophosphate groups) to enhance systemic stability by reducing payload hydrophobicity-driven ADC aggregation and clearance [43,44]; (2) polyvalent or branched hydrophilic linkers, such as Fleximer TM linkers or PEG chain additions, that enable high DAR without compromising the ADC physicochemical properties and PK [6]; and (3) tandem or dual-cleavage linkers requiring successive cleavage by lysosomal enzymes, which ensure tumor specificity while increasing both stability and tolerability [6,25,32]. Other recently emerged cleavable linker classes with higher plasma stability include lysosomal protease-cleavable linkers such as sulfatase-and legumain-cleavable linkers [53,54], while more innovative, albeit still exploratory, linker technologies include photo-sensitive and biorthogonal cleavable linkers, which widen up the opportunity for nonendocytic ADCs [32,43].",

The MC linker in particular has seen varied use, employed both alone as part of a non-cleavable ADC (e.g., AbbVie's depatuxizumab mafodotin [49]) or as a spacer unit separating a mAb and cleavable dipeptide linker sequence (e.g., Adcetris \u00ae [49]), and all marketed ADCs containing monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) or monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) warheads use this linker [42].",

Rahman\n## Abstract\nAntibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) are a family of targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. ADC development is a rapidly expanding field of research, with over 80 ADCs currently in clinical development and eleven ADCs (nine containing small-molecule payloads and two with biological toxins) approved for use by the FDA. Compared to traditional small-molecule approaches, ADCs offer enhanced targeting of cancer cells along with reduced toxic side effects, making them an attractive prospect in the field of oncology. To this end, this tutorial review aims to serve as a reference material for ADCs and give readers a comprehensive understanding of ADCs; it explores and explains each ADC component (monoclonal antibody, linker moiety and cytotoxic payload) individually, highlights several EMA- and FDA-approved ADCs by way of case studies and offers a brief future perspective on the field of ADC research.\n## Linkers\nOne of the biggest challenges in the development of ADCs is the selection of a suitable linker with which to conjugate the cytotoxic payload to the mAb. Linker chemistry impacts various ADC properties including toxicity, specificity, stability and potency, and thus a wide range of possible linker structures have been investigated. Linkers can be broadly classified as either cleavable (the payload is able to separate from the mAb at the tumour site) or non-cleavable (payload and mAb remain bound together, mAb is degraded following internalisation), and this, in turn, effects the modes of action of individual ADCs [39].\n\n## Non-Cleavable Linkers\nWhile cleavable linkers undergo hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage, non-cleavable linkers do not fragment and, following antigen-specific internalisation, only release the cytotoxic payload after complete lysosomal degradation of the mAb [6]. Key advantages of non-cleavable linkers over their cleavable competitors are that non-cleavable linkers grant ADCs longer plasma half-lives, reduced off-target toxicity and-frequently-wider therapeutic windows [39]. Common types of non-cleavable linkers used in ADCs are those based on a maleimide-type structure such as the maleimidocaproyl (MC, found in AbbVie's depatuxizumab mafodotin [49]) and 4-maleimidomethyl cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (MCC, found in Kadcyla \u00ae [49]) linkers (Figure 3) [42]. The MC linker in particular has seen varied use, employed both alone as part of a non-cleavable ADC (e.g., AbbVie's depatuxizumab mafodotin [49]) or as a spacer unit separating a mAb and cleavable dipeptide linker sequence (e.g., Adcetris \u00ae [49]), and all marketed ADCs containing monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) or monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) warheads use this linker [42]. \n\nases, such as cathepsin B, which are overexpressed in several cancer cell types [45]. Examples include valine-citrulline (Val-Cit, found in Adcetris \u00ae [30]), valine-alanine (Val-Ala, found in ADC Therapeutics' loncastuximab tesirine [46]) and alanine-alanine (Ala-Ala, found in ImmunoGen's IMGN632 [47]) dipeptide linkers.\n...\nWhile cleavable linkers undergo hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage, non-cleavable linkers do not fragment and, following antigen-specific internalisation, only release the cytotoxic payload after complete lysosomal degradation of the mAb [6].

In addition to targeting antigen-expressing tumor cells, bystander effects have been engineered to extend cytotoxic killing to low-antigen-expressing or negative tumor cells in the heterogenous tumor milieu. Inevitably, myelosuppression is a common side effect with most of the ADCs due to the effects of the cytotoxic payload. Also, other unique side effects are specific to the tissue antigen that is targeted for, such as the cardiac toxicity with Her-2 targeting ADCs, and the hemorrhagic side effects with the tissue factor (TF) targeting Tisotumab vedotin. Further exciting developments are centered in the strategies to improve the tolerability and efficacy of the ADCs to improve the therapeutic window; as well as the development of novel payloads including (1) peptide\u2013drug conjugates (PDCs), with the peptide replacing the monoclonal antibody, rendering greater tumor penetration; (2) immune-stimulating antibody conjugates (ISACs), which upon conjugation of the antigen, cause an influx of pro-inflammatory cytokines to activate dendritic cells and harness an anti-tumor T-cell response; and (3) the use of radioactive isotopes as a payload to enhance cytotoxic activity.",

Depending on the methods of releasing the payload in cells, there are two types of linkers, including cleavable and non-cleavable [22]. The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity [23]. Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level [24]. The enzyme sensitive linkers are sensitive to the lysosomal protease that is generally overexpressed in cancer cells, enabling an accurate drug release in the cells after internalization [25]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability [26,27], and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]. For instance, Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has a cleavable enzymatic linker as opposed to trastuzuma",

Aside from circulatory stability and targeted release, one other key characteristic of a good linker is its low hydrophobicity, due to the fact that hydrophobic linkers can interact with the hydrophobic payloads, leading to aggregates that can possibly cause an immune reaction [25]. Linkers are principally categorized into two: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers release the payload either upon interacting with the low pH environment of the (endo)-lysosome, e.g., hydrazone linkers [26], or upon direct cleavage via lysosomal cathepsins [27], e.g., peptide linkers. A subgroup of cleavable linkers contains disulfide bonds that are sensitive to intracellular glutathione, releasing the payload upon the chemical reduction in these bonds by glutathione [28]. Such linkers might prove useful for the development of future ADCs for many cancers, including ovarian, head and neck, and lung cancers, since increased tumor glutathione levels have been reported in the literature for these cancers [5,29]. Non-cleavable linkers generally present higher levels of plasma stability [26] but require the cytotoxic molecule to remain active after complete lysosomal degradation [27]. Although the latter might appear as a disadvantage at first sight, there are reports of enhanced ADC cytotoxicity when conjugated with a non-cleavable linker in comparison to cleavable ones [27]-as demonstrated by the development of Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (Trastuzumab emtansine) by Phillips et al. [30]. Site-specific degradation mechanisms of non-cleavable linkers are actively being researched to improve their efficacy over cleavable counterparts [31].",

A subgroup of cleavable linkers contains disulfide bonds that are sensitive to intracellular glutathione, releasing the payload upon the chemical reduction in these bonds by glutathione [28]. Such linkers might prove useful for the development of future ADCs for many cancers, including ovarian, head and neck, and lung cancers, since increased tumor glutathione levels have been reported in the literature for these cancers [5,29]. Non-cleavable linkers generally present higher levels of plasma stability [26] but require the cytotoxic molecule to remain active after complete lysosomal degradation [27]. Although the la er might appear as a disadvantage at first sight, there are reports of enhanced ADC cytotoxicity when conjugated with a noncleavable linker in comparison to cleavable ones [27]-as demonstrated by the development of Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (Trastuzumab emtansine) by Phillips et al. [30]. Sitespecific degradation mechanisms of non-cleavable linkers are actively being researched to improve their efficacy over cleavable counterparts [31].",

The antibody component reduces the cytotoxic effects on off-targets, making ADCs a popular area of research for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. This review article aims to provide an overview of ADCs in today\u2019s cancer therapy landscape. We summarize the currently used ADCs with their cytotoxic payloads, targets, and therapeutic indications. We discuss the mechanisms of action of ADCs, as well as the associated toxicities and newly emerging mechanisms of drug resistance. We also elaborate on some of the current efforts to advance present ADC strategies, as well as opportunities for the future of ADC-based cancer therapy.\n## The Chemical Linker\nThe linker molecule connecting the antibody and the cytotoxic drug should keep the conjugate in bound form until the desired target site is reached [24] and is, hence, an important determinant of the pharmacokinetics and the therapeutic index of the conjugate [5]. Aside from circulatory stability and targeted release, one other key characteristic of a good linker is its low hydrophobicity, due to the fact that hydrophobic linkers can interact with the hydrophobic payloads, leading to aggregates that can possibly cause an immune reaction [25]. Linkers are principally categorized into two: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers release the payload either upon interacting with the low pH environment of the (endo)-lysosome, e.g., hydrazone linkers [26], or upon direct cleavage via lysosomal cathepsins [27], e.g., peptide linkers. A subgroup of cleavable linkers contains disulfide bonds that are sensitive to intracellular glutathione, releasing the payload upon the chemical reduction in these bonds by glutathione [28]. Such linkers might prove useful for the development of future ADCs for many cancers, including ovarian, head and neck, and lung cancers, since increased tumor glutathione levels have been reported in the literature for these cancers [5,29]. Non-cleavable linkers generally present higher levels of plasma stability [26] but require the cytotoxic molecule to remain active after complete lysosomal degradation [27]. Although the latter might appear as a disadvantage at first sight, there are reports of enhanced ADC cytotoxicity when conjugated with a non-cleavable linker in comparison to cleavable ones [27]-as demonstrated by the development of Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (Trastuzumab emtansine) by Phillips et al. [30]. Site-specific degradation mechanisms of non-cleavable linkers are actively being researched to improve their efficacy over cleavable counterparts [31].\n...\nThe linker molecule connecting the antibody and the cytotoxic drug should keep the conjugate in bound form until the desired target site is reached [24] and is, hence, an important determinant of the pharmacokinetics and the therapeutic index of the conjugate [5].

Antibody conjugates (ADCs) have changed the way cancer is treated. However, because only a tiny fraction of patients experienced long-term advantages, current cancer preclinical and clinical research has been focused on combination trials. The complex interaction of ADCs with the tumor and its microenvironment appear to be reliant on the efficacy of a certain ADC, all of which have significant therapeutic consequences. Several clinical trials in various tumor types are now underway to examine the potential ADC therapy, based on encouraging preclinical results. This review tackles the potential use of ADCs in cancer therapy, emphasizing the essential processes underlying their positive therapeutic impacts on solid and hematological malignancies. Additionally, opportunities are explored to understand the mechanisms of ADCs action, the mechanism of resistance against ADCs, and how to overcome potential resistance following ADCs administration. Recent clinical findings have aroused interest, leading to a large increase in the number of ADCs in clinical trials. The rationale behind ADCs, as well as their primary features and recent research breakthroughs, will be discussed. We then offer an approach for maximizing the potential value that ADCs can bring to cancer patients by highlighting key ideas and distinct strategies.",

Linkers are typically designed to be constant in the blood system (enabling for a prolonged timeframe of bloodstream), but labile enough to efficiently deliver the cytotoxic payload to the tumour [51]. \n\nCleavable and non-cleavable linkers are the two types of linkers. Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Non-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced.

Cenciarelli, A. Hasan\n## Abstract\nThe primary purpose of ADCs is to increase the efficacy of anticancer medications by minimizing systemic drug distribution and targeting specific cells. Antibody conjugates (ADCs) have changed the way cancer is treated. However, because only a tiny fraction of patients experienced long-term advantages, current cancer preclinical and clinical research has been focused on combination trials. The complex interaction of ADCs with the tumor and its microenvironment appear to be reliant on the efficacy of a certain ADC, all of which have significant therapeutic consequences. Several clinical trials in various tumor types are now underway to examine the potential ADC therapy, based on encouraging preclinical results. This review tackles the potential use of ADCs in cancer therapy, emphasizing the essential processes underlying their positive therapeutic impacts on solid and hematological malignancies. Additionally, opportunities are explored to understand the mechanisms of ADCs action, the mechanism of resistance against ADCs, and how to overcome potential resistance following ADCs administration. Recent clinical findings have aroused interest, leading to a large increase in the number of ADCs in clinical trials. The rationale behind ADCs, as well as their primary features and recent research breakthroughs, will be discussed. We then offer an approach for maximizing the potential value that ADCs can bring to cancer patients by highlighting key ideas and distinct strategies.\n## Linker design and technologies\nThe specificity, efficacy, and safety of an ADC are determined by the design, structure, and chemistry of the linker that connects the cytotoxic payload to the antibody. Linkers are typically designed to be constant in the blood system (enabling for a prolonged timeframe of bloodstream), but labile enough to efficiently deliver the cytotoxic payload to the tumour [51]. \n\nCleavable and non-cleavable linkers are the two types of linkers. Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Non-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability [53]. T-DM1 with mafodotin belantamab is one of two FDA-approved ADCs with non-cleavable linkers [18]. \n\nThe systemic stability of ADCs post administration is one of the crucial issues to ensure the efficacy of ADCs, and several strategic approaches are taken for overcoming this issue. ADCs should ideally remain stable or intact in the circulation before entering target cells, but there are cases where ADC catabolites are still biologically active [54,55]. ADC stability refers primarily to metabolic stability or integrity. To improve ADC stability, several approaches involving conjugation site selection and linker modification have been developed [54]. In general, modifications to each component (e.g., antibody, linker, and payload) can be performed for this purpose. The conjugation site, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are effective general approaches for site-specific ADCs and should be more broadly applicable to a variety of ADC platforms [54].",

In addition to conjugation, the linkers maintain ADCs\u2019 stability during the preparation and storage stages of the ADCs and during the systemic circulation period. The design of linkers for ADCs is a challenge in terms of extracellular stability and intracellular release, and intracellular circumstances, such as the acid environment, the reducing environment and cathepsin, are considered as the catalysts to activate the triggers for initiating the cleavage of ADCs.

The greatest advantage of non-cleavable linkers compared to cleavable linkers is their increased plasma stability. Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug [45]. Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells [43,46]. In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability. \n\nYelena et al. synthesized the huC242-SMCC-DM1 conjugate binding DM1 to the humanized monoclonal antibody (huC242) via an N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 -carboxylate (SMCC) for non-cleavable thioether linker and tested the cytotoxicity of conjugate on COLO 205 cells and Namalwa cells. Compared with the cantuzumab mertansine (huC242-DM1) containing a cleavable disulfide linker, the huC242-SMCC-DM1 is efficacious only against tumors in which all proliferating cells express the target antigen, and displayed significantly lower in vivo activity in multiple xenograft tumor models (Figure 4) [47]. \n\nNon-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug [45].",

An appropriate linker between the antibody and the cytotoxic drug provides a specific bridge, and thus helps the antibody to selectively deliver the cytotoxic drug to tumor cells and accurately releases the cytotoxic drug at tumor sites. In addition to conjugation, the linkers maintain ADCs\u2019 stability during the preparation and storage stages of the ADCs and during the systemic circulation period. The design of linkers for ADCs is a challenge in terms of extracellular stability and intracellular release, and intracellular circumstances, such as the acid environment, the reducing environment and cathepsin, are considered as the catalysts to activate the triggers for initiating the cleavage of ADCs. This review discusses the linkers used in the clinical and marketing stages for ADCs and details the fracture modes of the linkers for the further development of ADCs.\n## Non-Cleavable Linkers\nMany non-cleavable linkers have been explored in ADC development. The greatest advantage of non-cleavable linkers compared to cleavable linkers is their increased plasma stability. Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug [45]. Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells [43,46]. In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability. \n\nYelena et al. synthesized the huC242-SMCC-DM1 conjugate binding DM1 to the humanized monoclonal antibody (huC242) via an N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 -carboxylate (SMCC) for non-cleavable thioether linker and tested the cytotoxicity of conjugate on COLO 205 cells and Namalwa cells. Compared with the cantuzumab mertansine (huC242-DM1) containing a cleavable disulfide linker, the huC242-SMCC-DM1 is efficacious only against tumors in which all proliferating cells express the target antigen, and displayed significantly lower in vivo activity in multiple xenograft tumor models (Figure 4) [47]. \n\nNon-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug [45].",

When incorporated with trastuzumab and the highly potent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload, the arylsulfate-containing ADC 2 and ADC 3 were more cytotoxic than the non-cleavable ADC 4 against HER2-positive cells, while maintaining selectivity over HER2-negative cells. We propose that the stability, solubility and synthetic tractability of our arylsulfate linkers make them an attractive new motif for cleavable ADC linkers, with clear benefits over the widely used dipeptidic linkers.\n",

It was demonstrated that cleavable linkers have the advantage of releasing the cytotoxic payload more efficiently. However, non-cleavable linkers may release their chemotherapy payloads with more specificity, but the antibody needs to be completely degraded in the lysosomes that might affect the payload. Non-cleavable linkers are associated with higher plasma stability and relatively longer half-lives [17][18][19]. \n\nThe ADCs can be categorized by an important indicator, the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). The DAR represents the number of cytotoxic moieties attached to each antibody. The ADCs with the highest DAR might be more potent, but they have faster drug clearance and, potentially, increased toxicity. However, ADCs with lower DAR might have lower activities but higher therapeutic indices [20,21].",

We also discuss the different mechanisms of resistance to ADCs, as well as the ways to overcome this resistance, such as bispecific ADCs and the combination of ADCs with immune-checkpoint inhibitors or tyrosine-kinase inhibitors.\n## Linkers\nThe linkers connect the antibodies to the cytotoxic payloads and contribute to the stabilization of the ADCs [16]. These linkers can be non-cleavable, in which case they require more processing to release the payload, or cleavable, in which case they are related to tumor-specific factors, such lysosomal enzymes or changes in pH (low pH). It was demonstrated that cleavable linkers have the advantage of releasing the cytotoxic payload more efficiently. However, non-cleavable linkers may release their chemotherapy payloads with more specificity, but the antibody needs to be completely degraded in the lysosomes that might affect the payload. Non-cleavable linkers are associated with higher plasma stability and relatively longer half-lives [17][18][19]. \n\nThe ADCs can be categorized by an important indicator, the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). The DAR represents the number of cytotoxic moieties attached to each antibody. The ADCs with the highest DAR might be more potent, but they have faster drug clearance and, potentially, increased toxicity. However, ADCs with lower DAR might have lower activities but higher therapeutic indices [20,21].",

                    "text": "The linker is a crucial component in ADC design, facilitating the connection between the antibody and the cytotoxic payload through covalent coupling. While primarily serving to link the antibody and effector molecule, the linker plays a multifaceted role beyond mere connection. 51 Various properties of the linker, such as conjugation chemistry, length, and steric hindrance, directly impact the toxicity, specificity, stability, and efficacy of ADCs. 52 An optimal linker should exhibit stability in circulation (with a half-life approximately 10 times longer than that of the ADC) and efficiently release the cytotoxic payload within the tumor post-internalization. 53,54 Additionally, the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of the linker can influence payload coupling and reduce immunogenicity. \n\nResearchers have explored different types of linkers, which can be broadly classified into two categories: cleavable and noncleavable linkers. 51,55,56 Cleavable linkers have the ability to release a metabolite of the effector molecules from the ADC, allowing it to enter cells, either at the tumor site or within endosomes and lysosomes. These cleavable linkers are further divided into chemically cleavable linkers and enzymatically cleavable linkers, such as peptide-based linkers, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers, and phosphate-based linkers. 51 Notably, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers consist of \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers and \u03b2-galactosidase-sensitive linkers. Premature cleavage of these linkers can lead to the effector molecules harming normal cells. 57 On the other hand, noncleavable linkers, such as thioether linkers and maleimido caproyl linkers, require internalization of the ADC into cells and subsequent breakdown by lysosomes to release the effector molecules. ADCs with noncleavable linkers depend on complete lysosomal enzymatic degradation of the antibody for payload release, resulting in simultaneous dissociation of the linker. 58",

This review aims to outline the history of ADC development, their structure, mechanism of action, recent composition advancements, target selection, completed and ongoing clinical trials, resistance mechanisms, and intervention strategies. Additionally, it will delve into the potential of ADCs with novel markers, linkers, payloads, and innovative action mechanisms to enhance cancer treatment options. The evolution of ADCs has also led to the emergence of combination therapy as a new therapeutic approach to improve drug efficacy.\n## Linker\nThe linker is a crucial component in ADC design, facilitating the connection between the antibody and the cytotoxic payload through covalent coupling. While primarily serving to link the antibody and effector molecule, the linker plays a multifaceted role beyond mere connection. 51 Various properties of the linker, such as conjugation chemistry, length, and steric hindrance, directly impact the toxicity, specificity, stability, and efficacy of ADCs. 52 An optimal linker should exhibit stability in circulation (with a half-life approximately 10 times longer than that of the ADC) and efficiently release the cytotoxic payload within the tumor post-internalization. 53,54 Additionally, the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of the linker can influence payload coupling and reduce immunogenicity. \n\nResearchers have explored different types of linkers, which can be broadly classified into two categories: cleavable and noncleavable linkers. 51,55,56 Cleavable linkers have the ability to release a metabolite of the effector molecules from the ADC, allowing it to enter cells, either at the tumor site or within endosomes and lysosomes. These cleavable linkers are further divided into chemically cleavable linkers and enzymatically cleavable linkers, such as peptide-based linkers, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers, and phosphate-based linkers. 51 Notably, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers consist of \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers and \u03b2-galactosidase-sensitive linkers. Premature cleavage of these linkers can lead to the effector molecules harming normal cells. 57 On the other hand, noncleavable linkers, such as thioether linkers and maleimido caproyl linkers, require internalization of the ADC into cells and subsequent breakdown by lysosomes to release the effector molecules. ADCs with noncleavable linkers depend on complete lysosomal enzymatic degradation of the antibody for payload release, resulting in simultaneous dissociation of the linker. 58\n...\nADCs with noncleavable linkers depend on complete lysosomal enzymatic degradation of the antibody for payload release, resulting in simultaneous dissociation of the linker. 58 Therefore, the use of noncleavable linkers must ensure that the linker-drug complex retains the ability to kill tumor cells. Considering the cytotoxicity of the payload and bystander effect, cleavable linkers are prioritized in ADC development, despite a few approved noncleavable effective linkers. \n\nIn recent decades, significant progress has been made in optimizing the structure and expanding the mechanisms of ADCs. 0][61] These novel cleavable linkers have shown increased selectivity for targeting tumors. Among them, cathepsin, glutathione, and acid-cleavable linkers have been extensively researched and incorporated into approved ADCs. 58,62 Notably, phosphatase-responsive and bioorthogonal cleavable linkers have the potential to overcome intracellular drug release limitations seen in traditional ADCs. 51,63 Early data on these new linkers are promising and are expected to significantly advance the development of ADC drugs in the future.",

They disengage their cytotoxic payload during the lysosomal degradation of the antibodydrug conjugate inside the tumor environment, bypassing the non-specific dispersion of the toxic preparation [37]. \n\nNon-cleavable linkers are an innovational array of first-generation linkers with more advanced plasma stability than many cleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers do not seem to contain a definable payload dispersion mode, and ADCs developed with this mechanism depend on the lysosomal proteolytic decomposition of the antibody after ingestion to deliver the cytotoxic medicine. Via this strategy, the non-cleavable linker transporting the medication is attached to the conjugation amino acid within the antibody. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers are more contingent on the membrane biology of the neoplasm than cleavable linkers. ADCs designed with non-cleavable linkers have amplified plasma stability via an enhanced therapeutic index [37]. Due to the bystander sequence, this opposition to extracellular cleavage improves the specificity of payload delivery. Numerous clinical data and in vivo studies prove ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers surpass the efficacy of those with cleavable linkers [38]. \n\nAnother advantage of non-cleavable linkers is heightened plasma stability. In vivo research studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linked ADCs outperform cleavable equivalents. mAb degradation contained in the lysosome after ADC ingestion is necessary for non-cleavable linkers to liberate their medical preparation. The payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs destroys the target cells, and non-cleavable linkers may theoretically offer a superior medicinal opportunity versus cleavable linkers. With a reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable ADCs, non-cleavable ADCs may offer improved stability and tolerability [39].",

Pettinato\n## Abstract\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are innovative biopharmaceutical products in which a monoclonal antibody is linked to a small molecule drug with a stable linker. Most of the ADCs developed so far are for treating cancer, but there is enormous potential for using ADCs to treat other diseases. Currently, ten ADCs have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and more than 90 ADCs are under worldwide clinical development. Monoclonal antibodies have evolved from research tools to powerful therapeutics in the past 30 years. Tremendous strides have been made in antibody discovery, protein bioengineering, formulation, and delivery devices. This manuscript provides an overview of the biology, chemistry, and biophysical properties of each component of ADC design. This review summarizes the advances and challenges in the field to date, with an emphasis on antibody conjugation, linker-payload chemistry, novel payload classes, drug-antibody ratio (DAR), and product development. The review emphasizes the lessons learned in the development of oncology antibody conjugates and look towards future innovations enabling other therapeutic indications. The review discusses resistance mechanisms to ADCs, and give an opinion on future perspectives.\n## Non-Cleavable Linkers\nNon-cleavable linkers are a significant building block of antibody-drug conjugates. They disengage their cytotoxic payload during the lysosomal degradation of the antibodydrug conjugate inside the tumor environment, bypassing the non-specific dispersion of the toxic preparation [37]. \n\nNon-cleavable linkers are an innovational array of first-generation linkers with more advanced plasma stability than many cleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers do not seem to contain a definable payload dispersion mode, and ADCs developed with this mechanism depend on the lysosomal proteolytic decomposition of the antibody after ingestion to deliver the cytotoxic medicine. Via this strategy, the non-cleavable linker transporting the medication is attached to the conjugation amino acid within the antibody. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers are more contingent on the membrane biology of the neoplasm than cleavable linkers. ADCs designed with non-cleavable linkers have amplified plasma stability via an enhanced therapeutic index [37]. Due to the bystander sequence, this opposition to extracellular cleavage improves the specificity of payload delivery. Numerous clinical data and in vivo studies prove ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers surpass the efficacy of those with cleavable linkers [38]. \n\nAnother advantage of non-cleavable linkers is heightened plasma stability. In vivo research studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linked ADCs outperform cleavable equivalents. mAb degradation contained in the lysosome after ADC ingestion is necessary for non-cleavable linkers to liberate their medical preparation. The payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs destroys the target cells, and non-cleavable linkers may theoretically offer a superior medicinal opportunity versus cleavable linkers. With a reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable ADCs, non-cleavable ADCs may offer improved stability and tolerability [39].",

Specific antibodies used to guide potent warheads to tumor tissues can effectively reduce undesired side effects of the cytotoxic drugs. An in-depth understanding of antibodies, linkers, conjugation strategies, cytotoxic drugs, and their molecular targets has led to the successful development of several approved ADCs. These ADCs are powerful therapeutics for cancer treatment, enabling wider therapeutic windows, improved pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, and enhanced efficacy. Since tubulin inhibitors are one of the most successful cytotoxic drugs in the ADC armamentarium, this review focuses on the progress in tubulin inhibitor-based ADCs, as well as lessons learned from the unsuccessful ADCs containing tubulin inhibitors. This review should be helpful to facilitate future development of new generations of tubulin inhibitor-based ADCs for cancer therapy.",

A linker must be stable enough in systemic circulation and be able to rapidly and efficiently release the cytotoxic agent upon internalization of the ADC within cancer cells [50]. According to the drug release mechanism, linkers for ADCs are generally categorized into cleavable linkers (acid-labile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers (Table 1) [51]. The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, proteasecleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers. Acid-cleavable linkers such as hydrazine linkers are designed to be stable at a neutral pH of circulation but can be hydrolyzed in lysosomes with a low pH Enzyme-labile \u00df-Glucuronide linker Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, protease-cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers. Acid-cleavable linkers such as hydrazine linkers are designed to be stable at a neutral pH of circulation but can be hydrolyzed in lysosomes with a low pH environment.

Arnst, Duane D. Miller, Wei Li\n## Abstract\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of highly potent biopharmaceutical drugs generated by conjugating cytotoxic drugs with specific monoclonal antibodies through appropriate linkers. Specific antibodies used to guide potent warheads to tumor tissues can effectively reduce undesired side effects of the cytotoxic drugs. An in-depth understanding of antibodies, linkers, conjugation strategies, cytotoxic drugs, and their molecular targets has led to the successful development of several approved ADCs. These ADCs are powerful therapeutics for cancer treatment, enabling wider therapeutic windows, improved pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, and enhanced efficacy. Since tubulin inhibitors are one of the most successful cytotoxic drugs in the ADC armamentarium, this review focuses on the progress in tubulin inhibitor-based ADCs, as well as lessons learned from the unsuccessful ADCs containing tubulin inhibitors. This review should be helpful to facilitate future development of new generations of tubulin inhibitor-based ADCs for cancer therapy.\n## Linker Selection for ADC\nSelecting a linker between the mAb and the cytotoxic agent is also important for ADC development. A linker must be stable enough in systemic circulation and be able to rapidly and efficiently release the cytotoxic agent upon internalization of the ADC within cancer cells [50]. According to the drug release mechanism, linkers for ADCs are generally categorized into cleavable linkers (acid-labile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers (Table 1) [51]. The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, proteasecleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers. Acid-cleavable linkers such as hydrazine linkers are designed to be stable at a neutral pH of circulation but can be hydrolyzed in lysosomes with a low pH Enzyme-labile \u00df-Glucuronide linker Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, protease-cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers. Acid-cleavable linkers such as hydrazine linkers are designed to be stable at a neutral pH of circulation but can be hydrolyzed in lysosomes with a low pH environment. Mylotarg, for example, was generated by conjugating calicheamicin with mAb against the CD33 antigen through an acid-cleavable hydrazine linker [52].

Since the approval of first ADC (Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (trade name: Mylotarg)) for the treatment of CD33-positive acute myelogenous leukemia, several ADCs have been developed for the treatment of cancer. The goal of an ADC as a cancer agent is to release the cytotoxic drug to kill the tumor cells without harming the normal or healthy cells. With time, it is being realized that ADCS can also be used to manage or cure other diseases such as inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, and bacteremia and some research in this direction is ongoing. The focus of this review is on the clinical pharmacology aspects of ADC development. From the selection of an appropriate antibody to the finished product, the entire process of the development of an ADC is a difficult and challenging task. Clinical pharmacology is one of the most important tools of drug development since this tool helps in finding the optimum dose of a product, thus preserving the safety and efficacy of the product in a patient population. Unlike other small or large molecules where only one moiety and/or metabolite(s) is generally measured for the pharmacokinetic profiling, there are several moieties that need to be measured for characterizing the PK profiles of an ADC. Therefore, knowledge and understanding of clinical pharmacology of ADCs is vital for the selection of a safe and efficacious dose in a patient population.",

Non-cleavable linkers are a new generation of linkers with improved plasma stability compared to cleavable linkers. The ADCs prepared by non-cleavable linkers rely on the complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody after internalization to release the cytotoxic small molecule drug. The ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are dependent on the biology of the target cell compared to cleavable linkers and have an improved therapeutic index due to their greater plasma stability. Since non-cleavable linkers can provide greater stability and tolerance than cleavable linkers, in the circulation, these linkers reduce off-target toxicity and also provide a larger therapeutic window [44][45][46].",

Mahmood\n## Abstract\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are biopharmaceutical products where a monoclonal antibody is linked to a biologically active drug (a small molecule) forming a conjugate. Since the approval of first ADC (Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (trade name: Mylotarg)) for the treatment of CD33-positive acute myelogenous leukemia, several ADCs have been developed for the treatment of cancer. The goal of an ADC as a cancer agent is to release the cytotoxic drug to kill the tumor cells without harming the normal or healthy cells. With time, it is being realized that ADCS can also be used to manage or cure other diseases such as inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, and bacteremia and some research in this direction is ongoing. The focus of this review is on the clinical pharmacology aspects of ADC development. From the selection of an appropriate antibody to the finished product, the entire process of the development of an ADC is a difficult and challenging task. Clinical pharmacology is one of the most important tools of drug development since this tool helps in finding the optimum dose of a product, thus preserving the safety and efficacy of the product in a patient population. Unlike other small or large molecules where only one moiety and/or metabolite(s) is generally measured for the pharmacokinetic profiling, there are several moieties that need to be measured for characterizing the PK profiles of an ADC. Therefore, knowledge and understanding of clinical pharmacology of ADCs is vital for the selection of a safe and efficacious dose in a patient population.\n## Non-Cleavable Linkers\nNon-cleavable linkers are an important component of ADCs [43][44][45]. Non-cleavable linkers are a new generation of linkers with improved plasma stability compared to cleavable linkers. The ADCs prepared by non-cleavable linkers rely on the complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody after internalization to release the cytotoxic small molecule drug. The ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are dependent on the biology of the target cell compared to cleavable linkers and have an improved therapeutic index due to their greater plasma stability. Since non-cleavable linkers can provide greater stability and tolerance than cleavable linkers, in the circulation, these linkers reduce off-target toxicity and also provide a larger therapeutic window [44][45][46].",

Most importantly, the linker is expected to remain stable in circulation to avoid premature detachment of the drug while allowing its release within the targeted cell. Two categories of linkers have been developed and can be distinguished based on their cleavability. Cleavable linkers are either sensitive to pH for hydrazone linkers, to glutathione or disulfide isomerase for disulfide linkers and to proteases such as cathepsin B for dipeptide bonds. Non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation of the antibody moiety, thereby conserving at least one amino acid, most commonly lysine or cysteine, attached to the payload-linker complex. This approach improves the linkage stability since antibody digestion is required for payload release. While it is emphasized that the more stable the linker is, the less off-target toxicity it triggers, these technologies were often found to be too stringent to support anti-tumoral activity. Safety of ADCs remains a major challenge in their design and ontarget in addition to off-target toxicity is not only driven by the instability of the linker-payload. On-target toxicity is rather always driven by the mAb and its affinity/avidity to the target, together with the payloads' mechanism of action, again illustrating how important the match between tumor type, target antigen and ADC construction is recent interest in linker design improvement has led to the development of hydrophilic linkers to balance payload hydrophobicity [26][27][28][29]. Sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polysarcosine (PSAR) or more recently DNA-based linkers have significantly improved ADC stability and pharmacokinetics, leading to less toxic and more active ADCs [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37].",

Conilh, L. Sad\u00edlkov\u00e1, W. Viricel, C. Dumontet\n## Abstract\nAntibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) is a fast moving class of targeted biotherapeutics that currently combines the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies with the potency of a payload consisting of cytotoxic agents. For many years microtubule targeting and DNA-intercalating agents were at the forefront of ADC development. The recent approval and clinical success of trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu^\u00ae) and sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy^\u00ae), two topoisomerase 1 inhibitor-based ADCs, has shown the potential of conjugating unconventional payloads with differentiated mechanisms of action. Among future developments in the ADC field, payload diversification is expected to play a key role as illustrated by a growing number of preclinical and clinical stage unconventional payload-conjugated ADCs. This review presents a comprehensive overview of validated, forgotten and newly developed payloads with different mechanisms of action.\n## Introduction\nThe linker plays a major role in ADC design since it strongly impacts on the safety, potency and activity of the ADC. Most importantly, the linker is expected to remain stable in circulation to avoid premature detachment of the drug while allowing its release within the targeted cell. Two categories of linkers have been developed and can be distinguished based on their cleavability. Cleavable linkers are either sensitive to pH for hydrazone linkers, to glutathione or disulfide isomerase for disulfide linkers and to proteases such as cathepsin B for dipeptide bonds. Non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation of the antibody moiety, thereby conserving at least one amino acid, most commonly lysine or cysteine, attached to the payload-linker complex. This approach improves the linkage stability since antibody digestion is required for payload release. While it is emphasized that the more stable the linker is, the less off-target toxicity it triggers, these technologies were often found to be too stringent to support anti-tumoral activity. Safety of ADCs remains a major challenge in their design and ontarget in addition to off-target toxicity is not only driven by the instability of the linker-payload. On-target toxicity is rather always driven by the mAb and its affinity/avidity to the target, together with the payloads' mechanism of action, again illustrating how important the match between tumor type, target antigen and ADC construction is recent interest in linker design improvement has led to the development of hydrophilic linkers to balance payload hydrophobicity [26][27][28][29]. Sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polysarcosine (PSAR) or more recently DNA-based linkers have significantly improved ADC stability and pharmacokinetics, leading to less toxic and more active ADCs [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37].",

            "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in 20\u201330% of breast cancers and is associated with poor prognosis and worse overall patient survival. Most women with HER2-positive breast cancer receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted therapies. The development of HER2-directed therapeutics is an important advancement in targeting invasive breast cancer. Despite the efficacy of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies, they are still being combined with adjuvant chemotherapy to improve overall patient outcomes. Recently, significant progress has been made towards the development of a class of therapeutics known as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which leverage the high specificity of HER2-targeted monoclonal antibodies with the potent cytotoxic effects of various small molecules, such as tubulin inhibitors and topoisomerase inhibitors. To date, two HER2-targeting ADCs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer: Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1; Kadcyla\u00ae) and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-Dxd; Enhertu\u00ae). Kadcyla and Enhertu are approved for use as a second-line treatment after trastuzumab-taxane-based therapy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The success of ADCs in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer provides novel therapeutic advancements in the management of the disease. In this review, we discuss the basic biology of HER2, its downstream signaling pathways, currently available anti-HER2 therapeutic modalities and their mechanisms of action, and the latest clinical and safety characteristics of ADCs used for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.",

Linkers should be highly stable in the blood circulation to allow the release and internalization of the ADC, though only upon antibody binding with the antigen. Unstable linkers may release the cytotoxic drug prematurely before reaching the tumor, hence, reducing the efficacy of the ADC treatment and increasing chances of off-target toxicity [35]. \n\nA linker can be classified as either cleavable or non-cleavable depending on its composition and susceptibility to proteolytic degradation within the cell. Non-cleavable linkers are more stable in circulation [115]; however, after proteolytic degradation, charged amino acid residues may be retained on the cytotoxic payload and can interfere with the overall efficacy of the drug [115]. The most commonly used type of non-cleavable linkers in ADCs is thioether linkers, currently used in T-DM1 [123]. Cleavable linkers depend on the physiological conditions of the cell and can be subdivided into two types: pH-sensitive and protease-cleavable linkers [35,115]. pH-sensitive linkers utilize the lower pH in the endosomes and lysosomes of target tumor cells to trigger hydrolysis of acid labile groups within a linker, while protease-cleavable linkers utilize common proteases, found in lysosomes of target tumor cells, for specific peptide sequence recognition and cleavage in the linker [35,115,124]. It is important to note, however, that cleavable linkers display nonspecific release of the cytotoxic drug [35,115]. The most commonly used cleavable linkers include acid-labile hydrazones, or disulfides [35,115].",

Najjar, Sara G Manore, Angelina T Regua, H. Lo\n## Abstract\nHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in 20\u201330% of breast cancers and is associated with poor prognosis and worse overall patient survival. Most women with HER2-positive breast cancer receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted therapies. The development of HER2-directed therapeutics is an important advancement in targeting invasive breast cancer. Despite the efficacy of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies, they are still being combined with adjuvant chemotherapy to improve overall patient outcomes. Recently, significant progress has been made towards the development of a class of therapeutics known as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which leverage the high specificity of HER2-targeted monoclonal antibodies with the potent cytotoxic effects of various small molecules, such as tubulin inhibitors and topoisomerase inhibitors. To date, two HER2-targeting ADCs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer: Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1; Kadcyla\u00ae) and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-Dxd; Enhertu\u00ae). Kadcyla and Enhertu are approved for use as a second-line treatment after trastuzumab-taxane-based therapy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The success of ADCs in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer provides novel therapeutic advancements in the management of the disease. In this review, we discuss the basic biology of HER2, its downstream signaling pathways, currently available anti-HER2 therapeutic modalities and their mechanisms of action, and the latest clinical and safety characteristics of ADCs used for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.\n## Linker\nLinkers within the ADC function to conjugate the monoclonal antibody with the cytotoxic payload. Linkers should be highly stable in the blood circulation to allow the release and internalization of the ADC, though only upon antibody binding with the antigen. Unstable linkers may release the cytotoxic drug prematurely before reaching the tumor, hence, reducing the efficacy of the ADC treatment and increasing chances of off-target toxicity [35]. \n\nA linker can be classified as either cleavable or non-cleavable depending on its composition and susceptibility to proteolytic degradation within the cell. Non-cleavable linkers are more stable in circulation [115]; however, after proteolytic degradation, charged amino acid residues may be retained on the cytotoxic payload and can interfere with the overall efficacy of the drug [115]. The most commonly used type of non-cleavable linkers in ADCs is thioether linkers, currently used in T-DM1 [123]. Cleavable linkers depend on the physiological conditions of the cell and can be subdivided into two types: pH-sensitive and protease-cleavable linkers [35,115]. pH-sensitive linkers utilize the lower pH in the endosomes and lysosomes of target tumor cells to trigger hydrolysis of acid labile groups within a linker, while protease-cleavable linkers utilize common proteases, found in lysosomes of target tumor cells, for specific peptide sequence recognition and cleavage in the linker [35,115,124]. It is important to note, however, that cleavable linkers display nonspecific release of the cytotoxic drug [35,115]. The most commonly used cleavable linkers include acid-labile hydrazones, or disulfides [35,115].",

Formed from three main components\u2014an antibody, a linker molecule, and a cytotoxic agent (\u201cpayload\u201d), ADCs have the unique ability to deliver cytotoxic agents to cells expressing a specific antigen, a great leap forward from traditional chemotherapeutic approaches that cause widespread effects without specificity. A variety of payloads can be used, including most frequently microtubular inhibitors (auristatins and maytansinoids), as well as topoisomerase inhibitors and alkylating agents. Finally, linkers play a critical role in the ADCs\u2019 effect, as cleavable moieties that serve as linkers impact site-specific activation as well as bystander killing effects, an upshot that is especially important in solid tumors that often express a variety of antigens. While ADCs were initially used in hematologic malignancies, their utility has been demonstrated in multiple solid tumor malignancies, including breast, gastrointestinal, lung, cervical, ovarian, and urothelial cancers. Currently, six ADCs are FDA-approved for the treatment of solid tumors: ado-trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan, both anti-HER2; enfortumab-vedotin, targeting nectin-4; sacituzuzmab govitecan, targeting Trop2; tisotumab vedotin, targeting tissue factor; and mirvetuximab soravtansine, targeting folate receptor-alpha. Although they demonstrate utility and tolerable safety profiles, ADCs may become ineffective as tumor cells undergo evolution to avoid expressing the specific antigen being targeted. Furthermore, the current cost of ADCs can be limiting their reach. Here, we review the structure and functions of ADCs, as well as ongoing clinical investigations into novel ADCs and their potential as treatments of solid malignancies.",

The success of second-generation ADCs, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-Dxd) is largely attributed to cleavable linker technology. However, there is no consensus on which linkers are more promising. Selection of a linker depends on a variety of factors, including the target indication, payload size and toxicity, and the desired pharmacokinetics of the ADC. There are two large categories of linkers currently in use, including cleavable and non-cleavable ones. Cleavable linkers are further subdivided into three categories: peptide linkers (lysosomal enzyme sensitive), such as valine-citrulline linker (or vc linker), disulfide linkers (sensitive to reducing agents like glutathione), and hydrazone linkers (acid-sensitive). \n\nCleavable linkers have two major advantages compared to the non-cleavable moiety; increased site-specific activation and bystander killing effect.

Riano, R. Kurzrock, J. Adashek\n## Abstract\nAntibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) are at the forefront of the drug development revolution occurring in oncology. Formed from three main components\u2014an antibody, a linker molecule, and a cytotoxic agent (\u201cpayload\u201d), ADCs have the unique ability to deliver cytotoxic agents to cells expressing a specific antigen, a great leap forward from traditional chemotherapeutic approaches that cause widespread effects without specificity. A variety of payloads can be used, including most frequently microtubular inhibitors (auristatins and maytansinoids), as well as topoisomerase inhibitors and alkylating agents. Finally, linkers play a critical role in the ADCs\u2019 effect, as cleavable moieties that serve as linkers impact site-specific activation as well as bystander killing effects, an upshot that is especially important in solid tumors that often express a variety of antigens. While ADCs were initially used in hematologic malignancies, their utility has been demonstrated in multiple solid tumor malignancies, including breast, gastrointestinal, lung, cervical, ovarian, and urothelial cancers. Currently, six ADCs are FDA-approved for the treatment of solid tumors: ado-trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan, both anti-HER2; enfortumab-vedotin, targeting nectin-4; sacituzuzmab govitecan, targeting Trop2; tisotumab vedotin, targeting tissue factor; and mirvetuximab soravtansine, targeting folate receptor-alpha. Although they demonstrate utility and tolerable safety profiles, ADCs may become ineffective as tumor cells undergo evolution to avoid expressing the specific antigen being targeted. Furthermore, the current cost of ADCs can be limiting their reach. Here, we review the structure and functions of ADCs, as well as ongoing clinical investigations into novel ADCs and their potential as treatments of solid malignancies.\n## Linkers\nThe linker is a critical component of any ADC. The nature of the linker and spacer determines important features of ADCs, such as hydrophobic or lipophilic properties of payload, nontarget payload delivery, systemic toxicity, and most importantly, bystander killing [44]. The success of second-generation ADCs, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-Dxd) is largely attributed to cleavable linker technology. However, there is no consensus on which linkers are more promising. Selection of a linker depends on a variety of factors, including the target indication, payload size and toxicity, and the desired pharmacokinetics of the ADC. There are two large categories of linkers currently in use, including cleavable and non-cleavable ones. Cleavable linkers are further subdivided into three categories: peptide linkers (lysosomal enzyme sensitive), such as valine-citrulline linker (or vc linker), disulfide linkers (sensitive to reducing agents like glutathione), and hydrazone linkers (acid-sensitive). \n\nCleavable linkers have two major advantages compared to the non-cleavable moiety; increased site-specific activation and bystander killing effect. The first FDA-approved ADC, Mylotarg \u00ae , used a hydrazine-based acid-cleavable linker. One of the most recently approved agents, Trodelvy \u00ae (sacituzumab govitecan), is using polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer technology.",

There has been significant progress in linker technology since the beginning of ADC research, which has contributed enormously to the clinical achievements of ADC formulations until now (60). For linkers, there are both noncleavable and cleavable linkers that ensure the requirements of ADC design mentioned above. Non-cleavable linkers are made up of stable bonds e.g., non-reducible thioether linkage (SMCC), maleimidocaproyl linkage etc. that can withstand the proteolytic degradation inside the cytosol and release of cytotoxic payloads only occurs after antigen-specific internalization of the conjugate and full breakdown of mAb by lysosomal proteolytic degradation (12,14,20). Thus, the resultant release of the cytotoxic drugs is linked to the antibody's linker and an amino acid residue, which specifically kills tumor cells and doesn't release at non-target locations to cause any damage to healthy cells. Additionally, the non-cleavable linkers have provision to modify the chemical characteristics of small molecules to enhance the affinity of the transporter and increase its effectiveness. Although they have lesser membrane permeability, these linkers are more stable than cleavable ones and increase the therapeutic window by minimizing the off-target toxicities. Examples of non-cleavable linkers include thioether linkers (used in T-DM1) and maleimidebased linkers (used in belantamab mafodotin) (61).",

Results: In our analysis, dose reductions, dose delays, treatment discontinuations, and \u2265G3 toxicities were not significantly different across payload types.

Linkers are considered critical for ADC safety because they influence payload release. Designing linkers requires a careful balance between chemical stability and the controlled release of the cytotoxic agent. The ADC must remain stable in the bloodstream to prevent premature release of the cytotoxic component, which could result in off-target toxicity. At the same time, the linker must allow for the effective release of the cytotoxic agent within the target cell after the ADC is internalized. The chemical composition of the linker, along with the conjugation method and site, plays a critical role in determining the DAR, as well as influencing the therapeutic index, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the ADC. In general terms, cleavable linkers may lead to faster payload release, potentially increasing off-target effects, while non-cleavable linkers generally improve ADC stability in circulation. In this context, recirculation of the ADCs can be higher for those with non-cleavable linkers. Additionally, ADCs with homogeneous drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) exhibit reduced heterogeneity in blood levels, which may lower the risk of extra-exposure to the payload [17]. In addition, the optimization of linkers could increase efficacy and safety. For instance, exo-linkers provide a two-step activation mechanism, where the first cleavage event exposes a secondary recognition site, ensuring greater stability in circulation and precise drug release in the tumor microenvironment [18]. Tandem-cleavable linkers, on the other hand, incorporate multiple cleavage mechanisms (e.g., protease-sensitive + redox-responsive) to enhance payload release efficiency within tumors while minimizing systemic toxicity, offering a promising strategy for next-generation ADCs [19].",

            "abstract": "Simple Summary Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy and while patients can have long responses to therapy, most patients will eventually develop treatment-resistant disease. Over the last thirty years, improved understanding of multiple myeloma and therapeutic advancements have dramatically improved outcomes for patients. Recently, advances in immunotherapy have revolutionized standard-of-care therapies and provided therapeutic options for patients with heavily pretreated, relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. Immunotherapy is a rapidly evolving field, and this review encompasses the immunotherapies that are currently used to treat myeloma patients as well as recent advances that are poised to advance myeloma therapeutics in the coming years. Abstract Multiple myeloma is an incurable disease of malignant plasma cells and an ideal target for modern immune therapy. The unique plasma cell biology maintained in multiple myeloma, coupled with its hematological nature and unique bone marrow microenvironment, provide an opportunity to design specifically targeted immunotherapies that selectively kill transformed cells with limited on-target off-tumor effects. Broadly defined, immune therapy is the utilization of the immune system and immune agents to treat a disease. In the context of multiple myeloma, immune therapy can be subdivided into four main categories: immune modulatory imide drugs, targeted antibodies, adoptive cell transfer therapies, and vaccines. In recent years, advances in all four of these categories have led to improved therapies with enhanced antitumor activity and specificity. In IMiDs, modified chemical structures have been developed that improve drug potency while reducing dose limiting side effects. Targeted antibody therapies have resulted from the development of new selectively expressed targets as well as the development of antibody drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies. Adoptive cell therapies, particularly CAR-T therapies, have been enhanced through improvements in the manufacturing process, as well as through the development of CAR constructs that enhance CAR-T activation and provide protection from a suppressive immune microenvironment. This review will first cover in-class breakthrough therapies for each of these categories, as well as therapies currently utilized in the clinic. Additionally, this review will explore up and coming therapeutics in the preclinical and clinical trial stage.",

Developments in linker technology have greatly increased the ability of ADCs to selectively deliver their payload to target cells while limiting their systemic effects [86]. Linkers generally fall into one of two categories: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers rely on differences in the blood microenvironment and intracellular tumor environment to induce linker degradation. These take three forms: hydrazone, disulfide and peptide linkers, each of which is cleaved or degraded through a different mechanism [86]. Hydrazone linkers are pH-sensitive and undergo acidic hydrolysis in the lysosomal microenvironment [86]. Disulfide linkers are degraded by thiols, which commonly accumulate in tumor cells, where they act as antioxidants [86,94]. Peptide linkers are degraded by pH-dependent proteases, which are only active in the lysosome [86]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers rely on the near-complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody to release the cytotoxic agent. This makes them entirely dependent on being endocytosed to release their drug product. However, this tradeoff provides enhanced stability while the ADC is in circulation, as well as improvements in the ADC half-life [86].",

Ackley, M. A. Ochoa, Delta Ghoshal, K. Roy, S. Lonial, L. Boise\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy and while patients can have long responses to therapy, most patients will eventually develop treatment-resistant disease. Over the last thirty years, improved understanding of multiple myeloma and therapeutic advancements have dramatically improved outcomes for patients. Recently, advances in immunotherapy have revolutionized standard-of-care therapies and provided therapeutic options for patients with heavily pretreated, relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. Immunotherapy is a rapidly evolving field, and this review encompasses the immunotherapies that are currently used to treat myeloma patients as well as recent advances that are poised to advance myeloma therapeutics in the coming years. Abstract Multiple myeloma is an incurable disease of malignant plasma cells and an ideal target for modern immune therapy. The unique plasma cell biology maintained in multiple myeloma, coupled with its hematological nature and unique bone marrow microenvironment, provide an opportunity to design specifically targeted immunotherapies that selectively kill transformed cells with limited on-target off-tumor effects. Broadly defined, immune therapy is the utilization of the immune system and immune agents to treat a disease. In the context of multiple myeloma, immune therapy can be subdivided into four main categories: immune modulatory imide drugs, targeted antibodies, adoptive cell transfer therapies, and vaccines. In recent years, advances in all four of these categories have led to improved therapies with enhanced antitumor activity and specificity. In IMiDs, modified chemical structures have been developed that improve drug potency while reducing dose limiting side effects. Targeted antibody therapies have resulted from the development of new selectively expressed targets as well as the development of antibody drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies. Adoptive cell therapies, particularly CAR-T therapies, have been enhanced through improvements in the manufacturing process, as well as through the development of CAR constructs that enhance CAR-T activation and provide protection from a suppressive immune microenvironment. This review will first cover in-class breakthrough therapies for each of these categories, as well as therapies currently utilized in the clinic. Additionally, this review will explore up and coming therapeutics in the preclinical and clinical trial stage.\n## Mechanism of Action\nLinkers are a critical component of the ADC and are key to the design of a safe, potent, and selective ADC [86]. Developments in linker technology have greatly increased the ability of ADCs to selectively deliver their payload to target cells while limiting their systemic effects [86]. Linkers generally fall into one of two categories: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers rely on differences in the blood microenvironment and intracellular tumor environment to induce linker degradation. These take three forms: hydrazone, disulfide and peptide linkers, each of which is cleaved or degraded through a different mechanism [86]. Hydrazone linkers are pH-sensitive and undergo acidic hydrolysis in the lysosomal microenvironment [86]. Disulfide linkers are degraded by thiols, which commonly accumulate in tumor cells, where they act as antioxidants [86,94]. Peptide linkers are degraded by pH-dependent proteases, which are only active in the lysosome [86]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers rely on the near-complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody to release the cytotoxic agent. This makes them entirely dependent on being endocytosed to release their drug product. However, this tradeoff provides enhanced stability while the ADC is in circulation, as well as improvements in the ADC half-life [86].",

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach, combining monoclonal antibody specificity with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic payloads. This review highlights recent advancements, opportunities, and challenges in ADC application for urinary tumors. We discuss the FDA-approved ADCs and other novel ADCs under investigation, emphasizing their potential to improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, we explore strategies to address challenges, such as toxicity management, predictive biomarker identification, and resistance mechanisms. Additionally, we examine the integration of ADCs with other treatment modalities, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies, and radiation therapy. By addressing these challenges and exploring innovative approaches, the development of ADCs may significantly enhance therapeutic options and outcomes for patients with advanced urinary tumor.",

                    "text": "ADCs are composed of three integral components: a monoclonal antibody that selectively targets tumor antigens, a cytotoxic payload designed to disrupt DNA or tubulin within the targeted cancer cells, and a linker that covalently attaches the antibody to the payload. The efficacy of ADCs depends on the specificity and affinity of the antibody, the potency of the payload, and the stability of the linker in circulation, as well as its rapid release within the targeted cells (Figure 1). \n\nOver the years, various conjugation modalities and linker chemistries have been investigated to optimise ADC development. Early ADCs primarily relied on lysine-based or cysteine-based chemical conjugation methods, which resulted in heterogeneous products with variable drug-antibody ratios (DARs) (24,25). This heterogeneity often negatively impacted ADC efficacy and therapeutic windows, leading to failures in clinical trials. To overcome these issues, researchers have turned to alternative strategies, such as engineered cysteines, non-natural amino acids, and enzymatic conjugation using sortase or transglutaminase (26)(27)(28). These techniques enable the production of homogeneous ADCs with con trolled DARs that exhibit improve d pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes. Linker properties play a vital role in ADC stability, cytotoxicity, and pharmacokinetics. Traditionally, cleavable linkers have been used, which are designed to release payloads intracellularly in response to pH changes or the action of specific enzymes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers necessitate complete antibody degradation for payload release. Current research is focused on developing novel linkers that offer optimal stability, solubility, and release profiles, as well as site-specific conjugation methods (24,25). \n\nIn addition to linker design, the selection of appropriate target antigens and payloads is crucial to the potency of ADCs. An ideal target antigen is highly and uniformly expressed on tumor cells, but minimally expressed on healthy cells. However, antigen density does not always correlate well with ADC potency due to differences in internalisation rates.",

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach, combining monoclonal antibody specificity with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic payloads. This review highlights recent advancements, opportunities, and challenges in ADC application for urinary tumors. We discuss the FDA-approved ADCs and other novel ADCs under investigation, emphasizing their potential to improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, we explore strategies to address challenges, such as toxicity management, predictive biomarker identification, and resistance mechanisms. Additionally, we examine the integration of ADCs with other treatment modalities, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies, and radiation therapy. By addressing these challenges and exploring innovative approaches, the development of ADCs may significantly enhance therapeutic options and outcomes for patients with advanced urinary tumor.\n## The three key components of ADC and development strategies\nADCs are composed of three integral components: a monoclonal antibody that selectively targets tumor antigens, a cytotoxic payload designed to disrupt DNA or tubulin within the targeted cancer cells, and a linker that covalently attaches the antibody to the payload. The efficacy of ADCs depends on the specificity and affinity of the antibody, the potency of the payload, and the stability of the linker in circulation, as well as its rapid release within the targeted cells (Figure 1). \n\nOver the years, various conjugation modalities and linker chemistries have been investigated to optimise ADC development. Early ADCs primarily relied on lysine-based or cysteine-based chemical conjugation methods, which resulted in heterogeneous products with variable drug-antibody ratios (DARs) (24,25). This heterogeneity often negatively impacted ADC efficacy and therapeutic windows, leading to failures in clinical trials. To overcome these issues, researchers have turned to alternative strategies, such as engineered cysteines, non-natural amino acids, and enzymatic conjugation using sortase or transglutaminase (26)(27)(28). These techniques enable the production of homogeneous ADCs with con trolled DARs that exhibit improve d pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes. Linker properties play a vital role in ADC stability, cytotoxicity, and pharmacokinetics. Traditionally, cleavable linkers have been used, which are designed to release payloads intracellularly in response to pH changes or the action of specific enzymes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers necessitate complete antibody degradation for payload release. Current research is focused on developing novel linkers that offer optimal stability, solubility, and release profiles, as well as site-specific conjugation methods (24,25). \n\nIn addition to linker design, the selection of appropriate target antigens and payloads is crucial to the potency of ADCs. An ideal target antigen is highly and uniformly expressed on tumor cells, but minimally expressed on healthy cells. However, antigen density does not always correlate well with ADC potency due to differences in internalisation rates.",

For the chemical linker in ADCs, both cleavable and non-cleavable chemical structures have been utilized. Cleavable linkers enable controlled release of the cytotoxic payload intracellularly or within the tumor microenvironment. The cleavable ADC linkers can be categorized into three types: protease-sensitive linkers utilizing protease cleavable peptide sequences like cathepsin B sensitive valine-citrulline (VC) dipeptide, pH-sensitive linkers attached to acid-labile groups such as hydrazone, and glutathione-sensitive linkers containing disulfide bonds. Whereas, non-cleavable linkers, including thioether or maleimidocaproyl (MC) groups, exhibit enhanced plasma stability, and potentially improving the therapeutic index. [44] The extensive ADC research and its notable efficacy have resulted in the FDA approval for 12 ADCs, with over 260 undergoing clinical trials as of 2022. [45]  limitations of ADCs have arisen from their uniform payloads, which are driving ADC research towards payload diversification and prompting the development of degrader-antibody conjugates (DACs).

[47] To overcome these limitations, DACs have been developed by harnessing mAb-mediated PROTAC delivery. Given the pivotal role of BET family proteins in various cancers, [48][49][50] bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) targeting DACs have been developed. [34,51]",

By providing a selective targeting mechanism for cytotoxic drugs, ADCs improve the therapeutic index in clinical practice. In this review, the chemistry of ADC linker conjugation together with strategies adopted to improve antibody tolerability (by reducing antigenicity) are examined, with particular attention to ADCs approved by the regulatory agencies (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)) for treating cancer patients. Recent developments in engineering Immunoglobulin (Ig) genes and antibody humanization have greatly reduced some of the problems of the first generation of ADCs, beset by problems, such as random coupling of the payload and immunogenicity of the antibody.

One of the main aims for the effective systemic delivery of an ADC is that the drug is released only at the target site; the linker, thus, must be stable enough in a biological environment (i.e., blood circulation) to avoid unwanted release of the pharmacological molecule. \n\nThere are two types of linkers available: cleavable and non-cleavable (Figure 3). The former can be used either in the design of either an internalizing or not internalizing ADC, because the release of the payload is required to take place in either the extracellular tumor environment, or within the lysosome or cytosol. This is possible because the extracellular environment of the tumor is highly reducing due to the presence of glutathione, which allows the release of payloads linked to the antibody via thiolic bonds. It also allows payload release via the degradation of peptide bonds in the presence of proteases such as Cathepsin B, whose overexpression in cancer drives its normal lysosomal localization towards extracellular secretion [24]. A cleavable linker, therefore, exploits differential conditions of reducing power or enzymatic degradation that can be present either outside or inside the target cell. Due to the chemical reactions needed to release the payload, the site of conjugation on the antibody is crucial to induce both stability in the plasma and availability to reduction or degradation on/into the target cell [25,26]. Non-cleavable linker-based ADC must, however, be internalizing, because to release their cytotoxic payload, the antibody component needs to be degraded by lysosomal or cytoplasmic proteases [27]. Furthermore, drugs linked to such linkers usually cannot exert a by-stander effect because upon degradation of the antibody by cellular proteases, they are released as fragments of antibody peptides that have a poor ability to permeate the cells.",

Novel targeted therapies are currently being investigated in an attempt to reduce adverse events and improve survival outcomes. Antibody therapies represent a form of targeted therapy that offers a new treatment paradigm. Monoclonal antibodies are active in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are currently in Phase III trials. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are the next generation of antibodies where a highly potent cytotoxic agent is bound to an antibody by a linker, resulting in selective targeting of leukemia cells. ADCs are currently being tested in clinical trials for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and ALL. Bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) antibodies are a construct whereby each antibody contains two binding sites, with one designed to engage the patient\u2019s own immune system and the other to target malignant cells. BiTE antibodies show great promise as a novel and effective therapy for childhood leukemia. This review will outline recent developments in targeted agents for pediatric leukemia including monoclonal antibodies, ADCs, and BiTE antibodies.",

Acid labile-hydrazone linkers that are degraded in the acidic environment of lysosomes (pH ~5) (Unstable, acid-cleavable). 2. Disulfide-based linkers that are selectively cleaved in the intracellular milieu of the cytosol (Unstable, acid-cleavable). 3. Peptide linkers such as citrulline-valine that are highly stable in circulation and are degraded by lysosome proteases in the target cells. They are generally more stable than disulfides or hydrazones. 4. Non-cleavable thioether linkers that release the active cytotoxic drug after degradation of the antibody in the lysosomes. \n\nStable linkers such as peptide linkers have the advantage of extending the half-lives of cytotoxic drugs from hours to several days. Unstable linkers can reduce the half-lives of monoclonal antibodies, resulting in free antibody, which will competitively bind to the target antigen thereby reducing the efficacy of the ADC (29). Intermediate linker stability results in the most effective ADCs, since highly stable linkers result in decreased cytotoxic drug release following internalization of the ADC-antigen compound. For example, a serum-stable but intracellularly cleavable linker used to join epratuzumab to SN-38 used in B cell malignancies was shown to be 40-to 55-fold less potent than the more labile CL2A linker in in vitro studies (30). \n\nAntibody-drug conjugates linked by a disulfide linker (but not thioether bond) are capable of exerting a bystander effect on cells that express none or low levels of the target antigen. Hence ADCs can be engineered to exert a bystander effect by being linked by a disulfide bond or exert more precise killing of cells expressing the target antigen and sparing nearby normal cells by being linked by a thioether bond.",

Ziegler\n## Abstract\nDespite increasing cure rates for pediatric leukemia, relapsed disease still carries a poor prognosis with significant morbidity and mortality. Novel targeted therapies are currently being investigated in an attempt to reduce adverse events and improve survival outcomes. Antibody therapies represent a form of targeted therapy that offers a new treatment paradigm. Monoclonal antibodies are active in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are currently in Phase III trials. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are the next generation of antibodies where a highly potent cytotoxic agent is bound to an antibody by a linker, resulting in selective targeting of leukemia cells. ADCs are currently being tested in clinical trials for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and ALL. Bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) antibodies are a construct whereby each antibody contains two binding sites, with one designed to engage the patient\u2019s own immune system and the other to target malignant cells. BiTE antibodies show great promise as a novel and effective therapy for childhood leukemia. This review will outline recent developments in targeted agents for pediatric leukemia including monoclonal antibodies, ADCs, and BiTE antibodies.\n## LINKERS\nLinker technology is an area in ADC drug development that has progressed rapidly in recent years. There are four main types of linkers currently in use ( 27): \n\n1. Acid labile-hydrazone linkers that are degraded in the acidic environment of lysosomes (pH ~5) (Unstable, acid-cleavable). 2. Disulfide-based linkers that are selectively cleaved in the intracellular milieu of the cytosol (Unstable, acid-cleavable). 3. Peptide linkers such as citrulline-valine that are highly stable in circulation and are degraded by lysosome proteases in the target cells. They are generally more stable than disulfides or hydrazones. 4. Non-cleavable thioether linkers that release the active cytotoxic drug after degradation of the antibody in the lysosomes. \n\nStable linkers such as peptide linkers have the advantage of extending the half-lives of cytotoxic drugs from hours to several days. Unstable linkers can reduce the half-lives of monoclonal antibodies, resulting in free antibody, which will competitively bind to the target antigen thereby reducing the efficacy of the ADC (29). Intermediate linker stability results in the most effective ADCs, since highly stable linkers result in decreased cytotoxic drug release following internalization of the ADC-antigen compound. For example, a serum-stable but intracellularly cleavable linker used to join epratuzumab to SN-38 used in B cell malignancies was shown to be 40-to 55-fold less potent than the more labile CL2A linker in in vitro studies (30). \n\nAntibody-drug conjugates linked by a disulfide linker (but not thioether bond) are capable of exerting a bystander effect on cells that express none or low levels of the target antigen. Hence ADCs can be engineered to exert a bystander effect by being linked by a disulfide bond or exert more precise killing of cells expressing the target antigen and sparing nearby normal cells by being linked by a thioether bond.",

The considerations in their development and clinical use are complex, and consist of multiple components and variables that can affect the pharmacologic characteristics. It is critical to understand the mechanisms employed by ADCs in navigating biological barriers and how these factors affect their biodistribution, delivery to tumors, efficacy, and toxicity. Thus, future studies are warranted to better understand the complex pharmacology and interaction between ADC carriers and biological systems, such as the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and tumor microenvironment.

Typically, linkers used in ADC formulations are classified as being either \"cleavable\" or \"non-cleavable\". Cleavable linkers respond to physiological stimuli, such as low pH or proteolytic cleavage, to release the cytotoxic drug from its ADC carrier [21].

Price, Allison N. Schorzman, Mallory Storrie, J. Piscitelli, Juan Razo, W. Zamboni\n## Abstract\nMajor advances in therapeutic proteins, including antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs), have created revolutionary drug delivery systems in cancer over the past decade. While these immunoconjugate agents provide several advantages compared to their small-molecule counterparts, their clinical use is still in its infancy. The considerations in their development and clinical use are complex, and consist of multiple components and variables that can affect the pharmacologic characteristics. It is critical to understand the mechanisms employed by ADCs in navigating biological barriers and how these factors affect their biodistribution, delivery to tumors, efficacy, and toxicity. Thus, future studies are warranted to better understand the complex pharmacology and interaction between ADC carriers and biological systems, such as the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and tumor microenvironment. This review provides an overview of factors that affect the pharmacologic profiles of ADC therapies that are currently in clinical use and development.\n## Linkers\nTo attach a cytotoxic payload to a mAb, the use of a chemical linker is required. Linkers are comprised of functional groups, such as disulfides, hydrazones, and thioethers, to connect the mAb and SM drug, and control the release, distribution, and delivery of the cytotoxic agent to the target cell [6,19]. If a drug in released from the mAb carrier prior to delivery to the tumor, it can cause severe off-target toxicities by killing healthy cells. Because these linkers play an essential role in determining the PK and therapeutic index of an ADC, they should ideally be stable enough to allow the ADC to release the drug efficiently, but only at the targeted cells. Hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers, used as a single chain or arrangement, are particularly attractive as a conjugation linker to improve ADC solubility or reduce ADC aggregation [6,20].

            "abstract": "Simple Summary Survival for patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC) is poor, especially in the advanced stage, where curative treatments are not available. While chemotherapy and immunotherapy are used in standard practice, antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a novel therapy option. ADCs potentially enhance cancer cell death and reduce side effects. The anti-HER2 ADC Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-Dxd) has shown survival benefit for patients whose tumours are HER2-positive, including a subgroup of BTCs. In April 2024, the regulatory authority FDA approved T-Dxd for adults with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive solid tumours, including BTCs, lacking other treatment options. Ongoing trials are exploring other potentially actionable BTC molecular alterations. This review will discuss the current evidence and ongoing research in this subject area. Abstract Background: Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are aggressive in nature, often presenting asymptomatically until they are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Surgical resection or liver transplantation are potential curative options. However, a large proportion of patients present with incurable locally advanced or metastatic disease and most of these patients are only eligible for palliative chemotherapy or best supportive care. More recently, targeted therapies have proven beneficial in a molecularly selected subgroup of patients with cholangiocarcinoma who have progressed on previous lines of systemic treatment. However, only a minority of patients with BTCs whose tumours harbour specific molecular alterations can access these therapies. Methods: In relation to ADCs, studies regarding use of antibody\u2013drug conjugates in cancer, particularly in BTCs, were searched in Embase (1974 to 2024) and Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to 2024) to obtain relevant articles. Examples of current clinical trials utilising ADC treatment in BTCs were extracted from the ClinicalTrials.gov trial registry. Conclusions: Overall, this review has highlighted that ADCs have shown encouraging outcomes in cancer therapy, and this should lead to further research including in BTCs, where treatment options are often limited. The promising results observed with ADCs in various cancers underscore their potential as a transformative approach in oncology, warranting continued exploration and development and the need for education on the management of their specific toxicities. By addressing current challenges and optimising ADC design and application, future studies could potentially improve treatment outcomes for patients with BTCs and beyond, potentially in both early and advanced stage settings.",

                    "text": "The linker is pivotal in ensuring that the antibody and payload are bound whilst in the bloodstream, subsequently releasing the cytotoxic payload into the target cancer cells. Therefore, it is the component that determines the stability of an ADC, its pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Linkers can either be cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers can be degraded in certain environments, for example, based on pH levels, enzymatic activity (proteolysis), or glutathione levels [40]. This can be via endosomes or lysosomes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers require complete lysosomal degradation for the payload to be released. They have shown superior safety profile than ADCs with cleavable linkers, owing to their increased stability in the circulation and a longer half-life [40,41]. \n\nThe payload represents the final key component of the ADC by delivering the chemotherapeutic agent to the tumour cell following internalisation. These payloads include tubulin inhibitors, immunomodulators, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damaging agents [36,40,41]. ADCs primarily target positive or neutral charges on the tumour cells for selective cytotoxicity. Specific charges on the payload and linker are carefully engineered to influence targeting, delivery, and solubility [42]. Positively charged payloads tend to interact more effectively with the negatively charged phospholipid membranes of cancer cells, aiding in cellular uptake and internalisation. One example is the use of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a commonly used payload that is positively charged at physiological pH and has demonstrated strong cytotoxic activity in targeted cancer cells [36,43]. However, balancing the charge is vital, as highly charged molecules can result in off-target toxicity or rapid systemic clearance. Neutral or hydrophilic payloads are often favoured as they reduce off-target toxicity by limiting nonspecific interactions with other cells or proteins in the bloodstream. They can reduce aggregation of the ADC in the circulation and prevent rapid clearance or immune system activation [44].",

Aleem, Timothy Jacobs, M. Frizziero, Victoria Foy, Richard Hubner, M. McNamara\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Survival for patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC) is poor, especially in the advanced stage, where curative treatments are not available. While chemotherapy and immunotherapy are used in standard practice, antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a novel therapy option. ADCs potentially enhance cancer cell death and reduce side effects. The anti-HER2 ADC Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-Dxd) has shown survival benefit for patients whose tumours are HER2-positive, including a subgroup of BTCs. In April 2024, the regulatory authority FDA approved T-Dxd for adults with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive solid tumours, including BTCs, lacking other treatment options. Ongoing trials are exploring other potentially actionable BTC molecular alterations. This review will discuss the current evidence and ongoing research in this subject area. Abstract Background: Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are aggressive in nature, often presenting asymptomatically until they are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Surgical resection or liver transplantation are potential curative options. However, a large proportion of patients present with incurable locally advanced or metastatic disease and most of these patients are only eligible for palliative chemotherapy or best supportive care. More recently, targeted therapies have proven beneficial in a molecularly selected subgroup of patients with cholangiocarcinoma who have progressed on previous lines of systemic treatment. However, only a minority of patients with BTCs whose tumours harbour specific molecular alterations can access these therapies. Methods: In relation to ADCs, studies regarding use of antibody\u2013drug conjugates in cancer, particularly in BTCs, were searched in Embase (1974 to 2024) and Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to 2024) to obtain relevant articles. Examples of current clinical trials utilising ADC treatment in BTCs were extracted from the ClinicalTrials.gov trial registry. Conclusions: Overall, this review has highlighted that ADCs have shown encouraging outcomes in cancer therapy, and this should lead to further research including in BTCs, where treatment options are often limited. The promising results observed with ADCs in various cancers underscore their potential as a transformative approach in oncology, warranting continued exploration and development and the need for education on the management of their specific toxicities. By addressing current challenges and optimising ADC design and application, future studies could potentially improve treatment outcomes for patients with BTCs and beyond, potentially in both early and advanced stage settings.\n## Key Components and Mechanism of Action of ADCs\nThe linker is pivotal in ensuring that the antibody and payload are bound whilst in the bloodstream, subsequently releasing the cytotoxic payload into the target cancer cells. Therefore, it is the component that determines the stability of an ADC, its pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Linkers can either be cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers can be degraded in certain environments, for example, based on pH levels, enzymatic activity (proteolysis), or glutathione levels [40]. This can be via endosomes or lysosomes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers require complete lysosomal degradation for the payload to be released. They have shown superior safety profile than ADCs with cleavable linkers, owing to their increased stability in the circulation and a longer half-life [40,41]. \n\nThe payload represents the final key component of the ADC by delivering the chemotherapeutic agent to the tumour cell following internalisation. These payloads include tubulin inhibitors, immunomodulators, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damaging agents [36,40,41]. ADCs primarily target positive or neutral charges on the tumour cells for selective cytotoxicity. Specific charges on the payload and linker are carefully engineered to influence targeting, delivery, and solubility [42]. Positively charged payloads tend to interact more effectively with the negatively charged phospholipid membranes of cancer cells, aiding in cellular uptake and internalisation. One example is the use of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a commonly used payload that is positively charged at physiological pH and has demonstrated strong cytotoxic activity in targeted cancer cells [36,43]. However, balancing the charge is vital, as highly charged molecules can result in off-target toxicity or rapid systemic clearance. Neutral or hydrophilic payloads are often favoured as they reduce off-target toxicity by limiting nonspecific interactions with other cells or proteins in the bloodstream. They can reduce aggregation of the ADC in the circulation and prevent rapid clearance or immune system activation [44].",

Non-cleavable linkers, e.g., the one in trastuzumab emtansine (Figure 3a), remain attached to the cytotoxic drug after proteolytic degradation of the antibody in the lysosome. The drug, with an attached linker and an amino acid or short proteolytic peptide to which the linker is conjugated, is released to the cytosol and exerts its cytotoxic activity [129,130]. Cleavable linkers, on the other hand, are cleaved by lysosomal enzymes, or by low pH or a reducing environment inside endosomes; the drug-attached fragment after cleavage is typically removed by self-immolative reaction, releasing the free cytotoxic payload [131]. Brentuximab vedotin, for example, has a cathepsin-cleavable linker (valine-citrulline linker), and MMAE is released by the self-immolative reaction of the remaining linker fragment [101]. \n\nRegardless of the type, the linker for ADC has to be highly stable in blood in order to minimize the release of highly cytotoxic free drugs into circulation and to maintain maximum amount of intact ADC molecules targeting cancer cells. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg\u2122) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa\u2122), for example, both have an acid-labile hydrazone linker, which is relatively stable at pH 7.4 but hydrolyzed with high efficiency in the acidic environment of lysosome [74]. However, the acid-labile hydrazone linker can be considerably less stable than some of the other types of cleavable linkers, which may contribute to the narrow therapeutic window and high toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin [132].",

Their conjugation mechanism, stability, and chemistry are crucial in preventing unintended drug release into the bloodstream and in facilitating easy cleavage upon internalization into the cancer cell, allowing the payload to be released exclusively at the intended site. They are essential in figuring out the ADCs' pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and therapeutic window. The currently FDA-approved ADCs use two classes of linkers, which differ in the payload release mechanism: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers [24,56,57]. \n\nThe four most used cleavable linkers are \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers, Glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide linkers, cathepsin B-sensitive linkers, and hydrazone linkers. The previously described bystander effect, which impacts normal cells in the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells with no or low target expression, is more likely to occur with ADCs that utilize cleavable linkers [58,59]. Non-cleavable linkers, as opposed to cleavable linkers, have better plasma stability, less off-target toxicity, and resistance to proteolytic degradation, as they have non-reducible bonds with the amino acid residues of the antibody. Generally, non-cleavable linkers are formed by thioether or Maleimidocaproyl groups. Non-cleavable linkers that are attached to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody must have the antibody moiety completely broken down by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases to release the payload following ADC internalization [60,61].

This inventiveness of endocytosis and intracellular trafficking has given considerable momentum recently to develop specific antibodies and ADCs to treat cancer cells. It is significantly advantageous to emphasize the endocytosis and intracellular trafficking pathways efficiently and to design potent engineered conjugates and biological entities to boost efficient therapies enormously for cancer treatment.

                    "text": "Endocytosis and trafficking of ADCs by tumor cells are typically sorted by endosomal/lysosomal pathways. Many studies reported the active release of drugs in lysosome either by cleavage of the linker or by antibody backbone degradation. This release of drugs largely depends on linker design and its chemistry. Generally, linkers must have high stability in circulation and the ability to release a drug in the targeted regions of tumor cells. Currently four different types of linkers in use are broadly divided into cleavable and noncleavable linkers. 54 Acid-labile hydrazine linkers, peptide linkers, and disulfide linkers are included in cleavable linkers. Acid-labile hydrazine linkers are cleaved in the lysosome compartment as a result of low pH. Unfortunately, acid labile hydrazine linkers have established off-target release in clinical examination. 55,56 Peptide linkers conceivably selective for cleavage in lysosome by activity of cathepsin B. 57 Unlike the hydrazine linker, peptide linkers show high serum stability and improved antitumor effects of ADC. Phe-Lys and Val-Cit are physiological stable peptide linkers but hydrolyze rapidly in the presence of enzymes. 58 The longer half-life of peptide linkers was recorded as compared to other cleavable linkers. 59 Disulfide linkers also raise questions of non-specific cytotoxicity and instability and off-target release of drugs. \n\nRecent advancement in linker technology has been covered by non-cleavable linkers. The chemical bond of non-cleavable linkers is highly stable in circulation and inside the cell. The release of an active potent drug inside a tumor cell is realized by degradation of antibodies in the lysosome. 57 More importantly, the recently approved ADC, trastuzumab-DM1 (Kadcycla), also utilized non-cleavable linkers to treat metastatic breast cancer. More effective studies were also reported in vivo analysis by using non-cleavable linkers compared to their disulfide counterpart. 60,61 he linker is one of the most vital components of ADCs that anchor cytotoxic drugs to an antibody.",

Kalim, Jie Chen, Shenghao Wang, Caiyao Lin, Saif Ullah, Keying Liang, Qian Ding, Shuqing Chen, Jinbiao Zhan\n## Abstract\nAntibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC) is a milestone in targeted cancer therapy that comprises of monoclonal antibodies chemically linked to cytotoxic drugs. Internalization of ADC takes place via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and pinocytosis. Conjugation strategies, endocytosis and intracellular trafficking optimization, linkers, and drugs chemistry present a great challenge for researchers to eradicate tumor cells successfully. This inventiveness of endocytosis and intracellular trafficking has given considerable momentum recently to develop specific antibodies and ADCs to treat cancer cells. It is significantly advantageous to emphasize the endocytosis and intracellular trafficking pathways efficiently and to design potent engineered conjugates and biological entities to boost efficient therapies enormously for cancer treatment. Current studies illustrate endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of ADC, protein, and linker strategies in unloading and also concisely evaluate practically applicable ADCs.\n## Linker strategy and drug release\nEndocytosis and trafficking of ADCs by tumor cells are typically sorted by endosomal/lysosomal pathways. Many studies reported the active release of drugs in lysosome either by cleavage of the linker or by antibody backbone degradation. This release of drugs largely depends on linker design and its chemistry. Generally, linkers must have high stability in circulation and the ability to release a drug in the targeted regions of tumor cells. Currently four different types of linkers in use are broadly divided into cleavable and noncleavable linkers. 54 Acid-labile hydrazine linkers, peptide linkers, and disulfide linkers are included in cleavable linkers. Acid-labile hydrazine linkers are cleaved in the lysosome compartment as a result of low pH. Unfortunately, acid labile hydrazine linkers have established off-target release in clinical examination. 55,56 Peptide linkers conceivably selective for cleavage in lysosome by activity of cathepsin B. 57 Unlike the hydrazine linker, peptide linkers show high serum stability and improved antitumor effects of ADC. Phe-Lys and Val-Cit are physiological stable peptide linkers but hydrolyze rapidly in the presence of enzymes. 58 The longer half-life of peptide linkers was recorded as compared to other cleavable linkers. 59 Disulfide linkers also raise questions of non-specific cytotoxicity and instability and off-target release of drugs. \n\nRecent advancement in linker technology has been covered by non-cleavable linkers. The chemical bond of non-cleavable linkers is highly stable in circulation and inside the cell. The release of an active potent drug inside a tumor cell is realized by degradation of antibodies in the lysosome. 57 More importantly, the recently approved ADC, trastuzumab-DM1 (Kadcycla), also utilized non-cleavable linkers to treat metastatic breast cancer. More effective studies were also reported in vivo analysis by using non-cleavable linkers compared to their disulfide counterpart. 60,61 he linker is one of the most vital components of ADCs that anchor cytotoxic drugs to an antibody.",

            "text": "Non-cleavable linkers are a significant building block of antibody-drug conjugates. They disengage their cytotoxic payload during the lysosomal degradation of the antibodydrug conjugate inside the tumor environment, bypassing the non-specific dispersion of the toxic preparation [37]. \n\nNon-cleavable linkers are an innovational array of first-generation linkers with more advanced plasma stability than many cleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers do not seem to contain a definable payload dispersion mode, and ADCs developed with this mechanism depend on the lysosomal proteolytic decomposition of the antibody after ingestion to deliver the cytotoxic medicine. Via this strategy, the non-cleavable linker transporting the medication is attached to the conjugation amino acid within the antibody. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers are more contingent on the membrane biology of the neoplasm than cleavable linkers. ADCs designed with non-cleavable linkers have amplified plasma stability via an enhanced therapeutic index [37]. Due to the bystander sequence, this opposition to extracellular cleavage improves the specificity of payload delivery. Numerous clinical data and in vivo studies prove ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers surpass the efficacy of those with cleavable linkers [38]. \n\nAnother advantage of non-cleavable linkers is heightened plasma stability. In vivo research studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linked ADCs outperform cleavable equivalents. mAb degradation contained in the lysosome after ADC ingestion is necessary for non-cleavable linkers to liberate their medical preparation. The payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs destroys the target cells, and non-cleavable linkers may theoretically offer a superior medicinal opportunity versus cleavable linkers. With a reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable ADCs, non-cleavable ADCs may offer improved stability and tolerability [39].",

The greatest advantage of non-cleavable linkers compared to cleavable linkers is their increased plasma stability. Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug [45]. Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells [43,46]. In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability. \n\nYelena et al. synthesized the huC242-SMCC-DM1 conjugate binding DM1 to the humanized monoclonal antibody (huC242) via an N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 -carboxylate (SMCC) for non-cleavable thioether linker and tested the cytotoxicity of conjugate on COLO 205 cells and Namalwa cells. Compared with the cantuzumab mertansine (huC242-DM1) containing a cleavable disulfide linker, the huC242-SMCC-DM1 is efficacious only against tumors in which all proliferating cells express the target antigen, and displayed significantly lower in vivo activity in multiple xenograft tumor models (Figure 4) [47]. \n\nNon-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug [45].",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are now established as an important class of therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. There are currently seven FDA-approved ADCs, with at least 60 more in clinical development. 1 The success of ADCs arises from the combination of the exquisite cell-selectivity of monoclonal antibodies and the cytotoxicity of small molecule chemotherapies. However, for the mAb and drug to exert their maximum therapeutic potential, the covalent linker between the two groups must exhibit the following properties: (1) high plasma stability; the long circulatory lifetimes (t 1/2 > 1 week) of ADCs places stringent stability requirements on the linker to avoid off-target payload release. (2) High aqueous solubility to aid bioconjugation of lipophilic payloads and avoid antibody aggregation. (3) Release of a potent cytotoxin from the antibody in the target cell. 2 The majority of ADCs employ antibodies that target internalising antigens, overexpressed on the surface of certain cancer cells. Upon antibody-antigen binding at the target cell, the ADC is endocytosed and trafficked to the highly hydrolytic lysosomal compartments, where the antibody is broken down into its constituent amino acids. 3 In the case of a non-cleavable linker, the active intracellular cytotoxin is released as the linker-payload with the terminal amino acid from the mAb still attached. 4 Conversely, a cleavable linker is designed to release the unmod-i\ue103ed drug at this point, or upon subsequent entry to the cytosol.\n\nCleavable linkers are generally preferred to non-cleavable linkers in ADC research for a number of reasons. 5 First, traceless drug release allows the unmodi\ue103ed payload to perform its intracellular function without an unwanted linker appendage, thereby maximising cytotoxicity. Second, the unmodi\ue103ed payload can be uncharged, allowing it to diffuse into 'bystander' tumour cells that may not be expressing the target antigen. This 'bystander effect' provides an important mechanism for eradicating tumours with heterogeneous antigen expression. 6 Enzyme",

This targeted release is essential for effectively delivering the cytotoxic payload to cancer cells, as premature release can result in systemic off-target toxicity [19]. Linkers can be classified into two types: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release their payloads in response to specific conditions, such as the pH of cancer cells, reducing agents, and enzymes. Cleavable linkers may increase the efficiency of payload release, causing a bystander effect, but they also have a higher risk of increasing toxicity in normal tissues. On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma, so they only release the drug after the antibody has been completely degraded in the lysosome. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are not expected to induce a bystander effect. Currently, most ADCs use cleavable linkers.",

Recently, Burke et al reported PEGylated \u03b2-glucuronide-MMAE linkers that improved PK stability of ADCs with eight DARs, and increased potency in xenografts compared to the non-PEGylated controls (Burke et al., 2015 7 ). However, clinical improvement of the therapeutic window for ADCs using glucuronic acid-based linkers has yet to be demonstrated.\n\nNon-cleavable linkers: In contrast to the cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers that possess potent antitumor activity were unexpectedly discovered. Non-cleavable thioether and maleimidocaproyl (mc) linkers were initially synthesized for use as controls for the evaluation of cleavable linker conjugates. However, ADCs linked with these non-cleavable linkers, such as huC242-MCC-DM1 and cAC10-L4-MMAF, were as active as the conjugates with the cleavable linkers (Doronina et al., 2006;Erickson et al., 2006). Studies on the mechanism of action of the non-cleavable linker conjugates showed that antibody degradation of ADC components in lysosomes, following internalization, was necessary and resulted in release of \"active\" cytotoxic payload derivatives. Interestingly, the payload from non-cleavable ADCs remained covalently bonded to the linker via the residues to which the linkers were conjugated (Doronina et al., 2006;Erickson et al., 2006;Alley et al., 2008). This payload derivative then subsequently killed the target cells. Thus, non-cleavable linkers can provide greater stability and tolerability, as well as potentially greater therapeutic windows compared to the conjugates with cleavable linkers.

Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells [43,46]. In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability. \n\nYelena et al. synthesized the huC242-SMCC-DM1 conjugate binding DM1 to the humanized monoclonal antibody (huC242) via an N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1carboxylate (SMCC) for non-cleavable thioether linker and tested the cytotoxicity of conjugate on COLO 205 cells and Namalwa cells. Compared with the cantuzumab mertansine (huC242-DM1) containing a cleavable disulfide linker, the huC242-SMCC-DM1 is efficacious only against tumors in which all proliferating cells express the target antigen, and displayed significantly lower in vivo activity in multiple xenograft tumor models (Figure 4) [47]. The cAC10-L4-MMAF in which cAC10 (anti-CD30) linked to the antimitotic auristatin derivative MMAF via a non-cleavable maleimidocaproyl linker was approximately as potent as cAC10-L1-MMAF with a dipeptide linker in vitro against a large panel of cell lines and was equally potent in vivo (Figure 5) [48,49].",

Thus, non-cleavable linkers can provide greater stability and tolerability, as well as potentially greater therapeutic windows compared to the conjugates with cleavable linkers. However, additional efficacy from bystander effects are not expected with non-cleavable drug conjugates, presumably due to the cell's impermeability to the \"hydrophilic\" drug-linker complex. However, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates was observed .\n\nSome ADCs with non-cleavable linkers showed in vivo efficacy that was better than ADCs with cleavable linkers. For example, the anti-CD70-mcMMAF conjugate demonstrated an improved therapeutic index, as a result of higher MTD and antitumor efficacy in various renal cell carcinoma models compared with anti-CD70-vcMMAF conjugates (Oflazoglu et al., 2008). Similarly, the thioether-linked trastuzumab-DM1 (trastuzumab-MCC-DM1) conjugate showed improved efficacy, PK, and tolerability compared to the disulfide-linked trastuzumab-DM1 (Lewis Phillips et al., 2008). The thioetherlinked huC242-MCC-DM1 conjugate, however, showed more unfavorable in vivo efficacy in xenograft tumor models than the disulfide-linked huC242-SPDB-DM4 conjugate, even though the thioether-linked conjugate had improved stability with comparable in vitro efficacy as did the huC242-SPDB-DM4 conjugate (Tolcher et al., 2003;Kellogg et al., 2011). Therefore, the ultimately achieved therapeutic window of the ADC with non-cleavable linkers will likely be dependent on the biology of the target, the target cells, and the delivery of antibody for subsequent lysosomal degradation. Nonetheless, the expectation of potential enhancement of stability and tolerability for ADCs with non-cleavable linkers",

These linkers can be non-cleavable, in which case they require more processing to release the payload, or cleavable, in which case they are related to tumor-specific factors, such lysosomal enzymes or changes in pH (low pH). It was demonstrated that cleavable linkers have the advantage of releasing the cytotoxic payload more efficiently. However, non-cleavable linkers may release their chemotherapy payloads with more specificity, but the antibody needs to be completely degraded in the lysosomes that might affect the payload. Non-cleavable linkers are associated with higher plasma stability and relatively longer half-lives [17][18][19]. \n\nThe ADCs can be categorized by an important indicator, the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). The DAR represents the number of cytotoxic moieties attached to each antibody. The ADCs with the highest DAR might be more potent, but they have faster drug clearance and, potentially, increased toxicity. However, ADCs with lower DAR might have lower activities but higher therapeutic indices [20,21].",

            "text": "Linkers are the most important and intricate part in the development of a successful ADC, since they form the link between the therapy and antibody. Their conjugation mechanism, stability, and chemistry are crucial in preventing unintended drug release into the bloodstream and in facilitating easy cleavage upon internalization into the cancer cell, allowing the payload to be released exclusively at the intended site. They are essential in figuring out the ADCs' pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and therapeutic window. The currently FDA-approved ADCs use two classes of linkers, which differ in the payload release mechanism: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers [24,56,57]. \n\nThe four most used cleavable linkers are \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers, Glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide linkers, cathepsin B-sensitive linkers, and hydrazone linkers. The previously described bystander effect, which impacts normal cells in the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells with no or low target expression, is more likely to occur with ADCs that utilize cleavable linkers [58,59]. Non-cleavable linkers, as opposed to cleavable linkers, have better plasma stability, less off-target toxicity, and resistance to proteolytic degradation, as they have non-reducible bonds with the amino acid residues of the antibody. Generally, non-cleavable linkers are formed by thioether or Maleimidocaproyl groups. Non-cleavable linkers that are attached to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody must have the antibody moiety completely broken down by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases to release the payload following ADC internalization [60,61]. A general basic structure is illustrated in Figure 2 [62]. \n\nThe four most used cleavable linkers are \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers, Glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide linkers, cathepsin B-sensitive linkers, and hydrazone linkers.",

Their main roles are to prevent the premature release of the payload in the circulation while ensuring its release at the target site. Linkers can be broadly categorized into either cleavable or non-cleavable variants depending on the release mechanisms of their cytotoxic payloads [45]. Cleavable linkers are versatile and widely employed in ADC development. These linkers chemically release the payload through reduction, proteolysis, or hydrolysis based on specific tumor cell-associated processes, such as acidification, glutathione reduction, or lysosomal protease activity [46,47]. Non-cleavable linkers consist of chemical structures that are not fragmented by enzymatic degradation. They resist conventional biochemical processes and require complete lysosomal degradation for payload release. This increases the likelihood of payload release within the target cells while minimizing cytotoxic effects on healthy cells [48]. Non-cleavable linkers generally result in less toxicity and have a longer half-life when compared to cleavable linkers [32,49]. One major disadvantage of non-cleavable linkers, however, is the lack of antitumor activity against adjacent neoplastic cells that may not express the target antigen of the ADC (i.e., bystander killing) [50].",

The previously described bystander effect, which impacts normal cells in the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells with no or low target expression, is more likely to occur with ADCs that utilize cleavable linkers [58,59]. \n\nNon-cleavable linkers, as opposed to cleavable linkers, have better plasma stability, less off-target toxicity, and resistance to proteolytic degradation, as they have nonreducible bonds with the amino acid residues of the antibody. Generally, non-cleavable linkers are formed by thioether or Maleimidocaproyl groups. Non-cleavable linkers that are attached to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody must have the antibody moiety completely broken down by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases to release the payload following ADC internalization [60,61]. A general basic structure is illustrated in Figure 2 [62]. General basic structure of an ADC. An ADC consists of a chimeric or humanized (less immunogenic) antibody that has strong binding activity to an antigen expressed on the surface of a lymphoma cancer cell. Antibodies should have a higher half-life in circulation to be delivered to the target cell surface. Antibodies are linked to payloads of different structures (mainly, tubulin inhibitors or DNA interacting), which are highly effective drugs with ideal drug/antibody ratio. The linkage between the antibody and payload is through cleavable or non-cleavable linkers, which should have precise binding, stability in circulation, and ensure efficient payload distribution at their targets.

            "text": "Antibodyedrug conjugate (ADC), comprising a monoclonal antibody (mAb), the cytotoxic payload and the linker, has developed rapidly in recent years and is gradually revolutionizing clinical cancer therapy. This technology appeared a century ago 1 , but it is becoming mature in the past 5 years. Currently, 10 ADCs have been approved and more than 80 ADCs are at different phases of clinical trials 2e8 . \n\nThe linker connects the antibody and the cytotoxic payload and is a key component in the function of ADCs. The linker imparts the following characteristics to ADCs: (1) high stability in the circulation, and (2) specific release of payload in the target tissue. These seemingly contradictory requirements of stability and release lead to the major challenge in the development of linkers. To achieve the above requirement, various linkers have been developed and can be divided into two types according to their cleavage method. The first type is the cleavable linker, which has a chemical trigger in its structure that can be efficiently cleaved to release the cytotoxic payload in the tumor. More than 80% of the clinically approved ADCs employ cleavable linkers 9 , such as inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa) and brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris) 10,11 . The other type of linker is noncleavable. In contrast to the cleavable linker, there are no chemical triggers in this structure, and the linker is part of the payload. This type of linker has been employed only in adotrastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla, T-DM1) among the approved ADCs 12 . \n\nAlthough ADCs have achieved great success, future development is increasingly constrained by the linkers. The defects of the classical linkers employed in the marketed ADCs include the following aspects: (1) the nonspecific release of payloads in nontumorous tissues, leading to off-target toxicity and a limited therapeutic window. The most notable case is that of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) developed by Pfizer.",

            "text": "Cytotoxic payloads, which are smallmolecule drugs, are engineered to selectively eliminate tumor cells [30]. Due to the limited bioavailability of ADCs-only approximately 2% reach the target tumor site following intravesical administration-the payload compounds must possess high toxicity, typically with IC50 values in the nM to pM range [18]. The efficacy of an ADC in delivering cytotoxic agents depends on three primary factors: the number of target cell surface antigens available for antibody binding, the internalization efficiency of the antigen-antibody complex, and the release of active cytotoxic agents from the intracellular antigen-antibody complex. Currently, ADC payloads exert their therapeutic effects primarily by disrupting microtubule polymerization and inducing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage [31]. This approach emphasizes the targeted and precise mechanism of ADCs in eliminating cancer cells. \n\nLinkers. Cytotoxic payloads in ADCs are conjugated to the antibody via a linker, which must remain stable in vivo to ensure ADC integrity until it reaches the tumor cell. However, this linkage should be easily cleaved upon internalization. Maintaining ADC stability during circulation is essential to prevent premature payload release due to linker degradation, which could cause damage to healthy tissues. Simultaneously, ADCs must be capable of efficiently releasing their cytotoxic payloads once internalized by the target cells. Linkers are classified as cleavable or non-cleavable. Non-cleavable linkers include two main categories: thioether and maleimidocaproyl [32]. Cleavable linkers are further divided into three types: acid-cleavable, reducible disulfides, and those cleaved by exogenous stimuli [33]. Within the cleavable category, linkers can be potential of pH-sensitive, protease-sensitive, or glutathione-sensitive, based on their specific characteristics [34,35]. Cleavable linkers are designed to break down in response to the distinct conditions of the tumor microenvironment, promoting the release of small molecule payloads.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) consist of tumor-targeting mAbs, which are conjugated to cytotoxic payloads via chemical linkers. [42] Each component plays a crucial role in the efficacy and safety profile of ADCs. The mAb part of ADCs contributes to cancer cell selectivity, stability, and pharmacokinetic properties, while the payloads of ADCs exert anti-tumor effects by inducing cytotoxicity such as DNA damage or microtubule inhibition. For the chemical linker in ADCs, both cleavable and non-cleavable chemical structures have been utilized. Cleavable linkers enable controlled release of the cytotoxic payload intracellularly or within the tumor microenvironment. The cleavable ADC linkers can be categorized into three types: protease-sensitive linkers utilizing protease cleavable peptide sequences like cathepsin B sensitive valine-citrulline (VC) dipeptide, pH-sensitive linkers attached to acid-labile groups such as hydrazone, and glutathione-sensitive linkers containing disulfide bonds. Whereas, non-cleavable linkers, including thioether or maleimidocaproyl (MC) groups, exhibit enhanced plasma stability, and potentially improving the therapeutic index. [44] The extensive ADC research and its notable efficacy have resulted in the FDA approval for 12 ADCs, with over 260 undergoing clinical trials as of 2022. [45]  limitations of ADCs have arisen from their uniform payloads, which are driving ADC research towards payload diversification and prompting the development of degrader-antibody conjugates (DACs). [46] espite the promising potential of PROTACs, their development remains challenging due to their metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK). [47] To overcome these limitations, DACs have been developed by harnessing mAb-mediated PROTAC delivery. Given the pivotal role of BET family proteins in various cancers, [48][49][50] bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) targeting DACs have been developed. [34,51]",

Cleavable linkers rely on the physiological environment, such as there being high glutathione concentrations, low pH, and special protease, which could assist the linkers in enabling chemical or biochemical reactions by way of hydrolyzation or proteolysis [3,43]. Non-cleavable linkers despond on the monoclonal antibody degradation after ADCs' internalization within the lysosomes and endosomes to generate the metabolites containing the active cytotoxic drugs with or without a portion of the linkers. On account of different mechanism strategies, differences between the potential ADC metabolisms and the varying characteristics of cytotoxic drugs should be taken into consideration [44]. \n\nEach release strategy must account for many factors: the various activities of cytotoxic drugs, the characteristics of monoclonal antibodies, and the particular disease.

            "text": "Linkers are short bridges that bind the drug to the antibody covalently. The stability of linkers is a significant challenge faced in ADC use. In blood circulation, a stable linker will keep the drug tightly intact to the antibody and perform intercellular cleavage after reaching the targeted cell. Linker acts as a critical parameter in ADC designation as it influences the safety and efficacy of the drug in patients. An unstable linkage will degrade and release the drug before reaching the targeted cell, leading to off-target cytotoxicity. Thus, an ADC's safety and efficacy will significantly reduce with an unstable linkage. The two main types of linkers include cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Although non-cleavable linkage performs better than the cleavable, the most suitable linkage for each ADC will be selected mainly based on its stability with the functional group of ADC and environment [149]. \n\nTo exert their cytotoxic effects, Ado-trastuzumab emtansine, an ADC drug with a noncleavable linker such as thioether, must be internalised by the target cell for the antibody and degraded before drug release. But since this type of ADC often comprises a potent tubulinbinding maytansine derivative which is DM1, the cleaved drug product would not reach neighbouring cells to exhibit bystander killing activity due to the low drug penetration (positively charged drug). As a result, non-cleavable ADCs are indeed efficacious against target antigen-expressing cells after internalisation and are favourable to malignancies with high and homogeneous antigen expression [145]. Despite the unpredictable translational consequences from pre-clinical to clinical trials, obtaining the most optimal dose would lead to a more precise therapeutic index assumption. It is recommended to use integrated linker design approaches to attain the highest intratumoural payload PK profiles by driving above the threshold dose [151].",

Two main types of linkers exist: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers, while cleavable linkers include chemically unstable and enzyme-sensitive linkers. Among them, chemically unstable linkers can undergo cleavage in the acidic environment of tumors to release drugs efficiently, but their stability in the blood circulation is relatively poor, which usually leads to premature drug delivery [73,81,82]. The emergence of enzyme-sensitive linkers has solved this problem by improving stability and delivery efficiency through specific cleavage using specific enzymes overexpressed in tumors [83,84]. Non-cleavable linkers release the drug by enzymatic complete degradation within the lysosome, which has the advantage of high stability and low off-target toxicity, but their low release efficiency and inability to produce a bystander effect need to be optimized by optimizing the payload structure to improve the efficacy [85].",

Cleavable linkers are further subdivided into chemical cleavage linkers and enzyme cleavage linkers. These linkers offer the advantage of precisely releasing cytotoxic drugs, taking into account systemic circulation and environmental disparities between normal cells and cancer cells. On the contrary, non-cleavable linkers are connected as amino acid residues within the breakdown products of the antibody, displaying low activity in the general chemical and enzymatic environments within the body, ensuring high plasma stability. Typically, non-cleavable linkers rely on enzyme hydrolysis of the ADC's antibody component, primarily facilitated by proteases, culminating in the release of the payload in a complex form.",

            "text": "The analysis of linker types was limited because only two approved ADCs-belantamab mafodotin and trastuzumab emtansine-utilize non-cleavable linkers, precluding meaningful comparisons across groups. Linkers are considered critical for ADC safety because they influence payload release. Designing linkers requires a careful balance between chemical stability and the controlled release of the cytotoxic agent. The ADC must remain stable in the bloodstream to prevent premature release of the cytotoxic component, which could result in off-target toxicity. At the same time, the linker must allow for the effective release of the cytotoxic agent within the target cell after the ADC is internalized. The chemical composition of the linker, along with the conjugation method and site, plays a critical role in determining the DAR, as well as influencing the therapeutic index, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the ADC. In general terms, cleavable linkers may lead to faster payload release, potentially increasing off-target effects, while non-cleavable linkers generally improve ADC stability in circulation. In this context, recirculation of the ADCs can be higher for those with non-cleavable linkers. Additionally, ADCs with homogeneous drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) exhibit reduced heterogeneity in blood levels, which may lower the risk of extra-exposure to the payload [17]. In addition, the optimization of linkers could increase efficacy and safety. For instance, exo-linkers provide a two-step activation mechanism, where the first cleavage event exposes a secondary recognition site, ensuring greater stability in circulation and precise drug release in the tumor microenvironment [18]. Tandem-cleavable linkers, on the other hand, incorporate multiple cleavage mechanisms (e.g., protease-sensitive + redox-responsive) to enhance payload release efficiency within tumors while minimizing systemic toxicity, offering a promising strategy for next-generation ADCs [19].",

            "text": "The biological molecules known as linkers used in ADCs are for the linkage between the antibody and the warhead. Effective linkers must ensure ADC stability in the circulation as well as efficient cleavage upon internalization by the tumor cells. Since premature drug release into the blood might increase in systemic toxicity with consequent reduced therapeutic index, effective linker design must achieve an equilibrium between the necessity for long-term stability in the circulation and effective cleavage upon internalization into the target cell (59,60). There has been significant progress in linker technology since the beginning of ADC research, which has contributed enormously to the clinical achievements of ADC formulations until now (60). For linkers, there are both noncleavable and cleavable linkers that ensure the requirements of ADC design mentioned above. Non-cleavable linkers are made up of stable bonds e.g., non-reducible thioether linkage (SMCC), maleimidocaproyl linkage etc. that can withstand the proteolytic degradation inside the cytosol and release of cytotoxic payloads only occurs after antigen-specific internalization of the conjugate and full breakdown of mAb by lysosomal proteolytic degradation (12,14,20). Thus, the resultant release of the cytotoxic drugs is linked to the antibody's linker and an amino acid residue, which specifically kills tumor cells and doesn't release at non-target locations to cause any damage to healthy cells. Additionally, the non-cleavable linkers have provision to modify the chemical characteristics of small molecules to enhance the affinity of the transporter and increase its effectiveness. Although they have lesser membrane permeability, these linkers are more stable than cleavable ones and increase the therapeutic window by minimizing the off-target toxicities. Examples of non-cleavable linkers include thioether linkers (used in T-DM1) and maleimidebased linkers (used in belantamab mafodotin) (61).",

            "text": "The basic principle of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) is to enhance the tumor selectivity of cancer treatment with highly cytotoxic small molecules by covalently linking them to antibody molecules directed against tumor-specific cell surface antigens. Although it sounds simple, this underlying principle has proven very difficult to implement in practice, as illustrated by the fact that two decades of ADC development efforts by biotech and pharma companies have so far only yielded four FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved, commercially available products. Currently, more than 150 ADC programs are being actively pursued in different stages of preclinical and clinical development [1]. Although few, the success stories prove that a therapeutic window can be achieved with ADCs despite the required use of payloads that are 100-1000 fold more cytotoxic than standard chemotherapeutics. Such extremely high cytotoxic potency of the payloads is necessary because only a very small portion of the applied dose of an ADC is actually delivered to the targeted tumor (depending on the antibody used between 0.003%-0.08% of injected dose/g tumor), while the vast remainder distributes throughout the body, where it is antigen-independently taken up and catabolized by non-target cells. Therefore, it is not too surprising that clinical dosing is limited by adverse effects that are typically off-target and are determined primarily by the combined effect of the linker/conjugation chemistry and the payload used. \n\nADC linkers are either non-cleavable or cleavable. In the latter case, depending on the chemical nature of the linker, either low pH or lysosomal enzymes or reducing conditions promote cleavage, which allows the payload to escape from endosomes or lysosomes to the cytosol and to exert its cytotoxic effect. In the case of non-cleavable linkers, the antibody has to be completely degraded in lysosomes to allow cytosolic escape of the active metabolite which consists of the payload still attached by the linker to the single amino acid residue it has been conjugated to.",

Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives.",

            "text": "The specificity, efficacy, and safety of an ADC are determined by the design, structure, and chemistry of the linker that connects the cytotoxic payload to the antibody. Linkers are typically designed to be constant in the blood system (enabling for a prolonged timeframe of bloodstream), but labile enough to efficiently deliver the cytotoxic payload to the tumour [51].\n\nCleavable and non-cleavable linkers are the two types of linkers. Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Fig. 1 The development, purification, and production of antibody-drug conjugates cathepsins). pH-sensitive hydrazone (found in brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, polatuzumab vedotin, trastuzumab deruxtecan, and sacituzumab govitecan) is another enzyme-cleavable peptide-based linker (T-DXd) [51,52].\n\nNon-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability [53]. T-DM1 with mafodotin belantamab is one of two FDA-approved ADCs with non-cleavable linkers [18].\n\nThe systemic stability of ADCs post administration is one of the crucial issues to ensure the efficacy of ADCs, and several strategic approaches are taken for overcoming this issue. ADCs should ideally remain stable or intact in the circulation before entering target cells, but there are cases where ADC catabolites are still biologically active [54,55]. ADC stability refers primarily to",

            "text": "Linkers are divided into non-cleavable and cleavable linkers [108]. Non-cleavable linkers form stable bonds with antibodies and have a longer half-life in circulation. Further, after internalization, non-cleavable linkers should degrade in the lysozyme to release the drug molecule inside the targeted tumor cell. The stability of cleavable linkers depends on the physiological conditions in the tumor tissue and the expression of enzymes for cleavage of the linker to release the drug in the tumor site. The tumor toxicity of the ADC depends on the choice of payload (drug molecule) attached to the antibody. Conventional cancer drugs, such as DOX or mitomycin, have been used with ADCs. In general, the payload in ADCs is engineered to target either DNA or tubulin to interfere with cell division and proliferation. The conjugation chemistry affects the drug pharmacokinetics and therapeutic index of ADC. The conjugation of the payload largely occurs through the linker via the alkylation or acetylation of lysine side chains in the backbone of the antibody [106]. \n\nNanomaterials 2021, 11, 1755 15 of 25 binds with a high specificity to the antibody to minimize off-target toxic side effects to healthy cells. The number and density of target antigen molecules on the surface of CSCs affect the extent of the ADC engulfment by tumor cells. Further, antigen secretion by the CSCs to the circulation should be minimal to limit the circulatory detection of the ADCantigen and activation of the immune system. Table 1 summarizes the list of surface antigens on tumor cells used in designing antibody-drug conjugates for different types of cancers [104,106]. Another factor is the selection of an antibody to target the antigens on the surface of CSCs with a high specificity, strong binding affinity, and long circulation half-life for prolonged uptake and retention by the tumor tissue. The efficient internalization by CSCs and low immunogenicity of the ADC are important factors in the selection process [106,107].",

For this type of linker to be effective, the cytotoxic agent must maintain its activity, despite still being attached to part of the linker [22]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are considered to have improved therapeutic index because of their greater plasma stability, although new designs of cleavable linkers have significantly improved stability [23]. \n\nIt is clear that the disposition of a mAb is dependent upon several factors (Figure 1), and not just the therapeutic entity conjugated to it, in the case of an ADC. While mAbs trigger an effector function on their own, ADCs act more like prodrugs, and may or may not exert an anti-cancer effect until the SM drug is released from the mAb carrier. Thus, the pharmacology of mAbs and ADCs are complex. As a result, analytical and PK studies must be performed to assess the disposition of not just conjugated and released forms of ADCs, but also the effects of modifications on the mAbs after administration. \n\nAntibodies 2018, 7, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 28 improve ADC solubility or reduce ADC aggregation [6,20]. Typically, linkers used in ADC formulations are classified as being either \"cleavable\" or \"non-cleavable\". Cleavable linkers respond to physiological stimuli, such as low pH or proteolytic cleavage, to release the cytotoxic drug from its ADC carrier [21]. In theory, these linkers are catalyzed in a tumor cells, due to the presence, or increased presence, of their catalyst, to allow for selective release of the cytotoxic agent [5,21]. An example of a cleavable linker is seen in brentuximab vedotin, where the monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) cytotoxic payload is released by protease activity (Adcetris, Settle Genetics, Seattle, WA, USA).",

            "text": "The specificity, efficacy, and safety of an ADC are determined by the design, structure, and chemistry of the linker that connects the cytotoxic payload to the antibody. Linkers are typically designed to be constant in the blood system (enabling for a prolonged timeframe of bloodstream), but labile enough to efficiently deliver the cytotoxic payload to the tumour [51]. \n\nCleavable and non-cleavable linkers are the two types of linkers. Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Non-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability [53]. T-DM1 with mafodotin belantamab is one of two FDA-approved ADCs with non-cleavable linkers [18]. \n\nThe systemic stability of ADCs post administration is one of the crucial issues to ensure the efficacy of ADCs, and several strategic approaches are taken for overcoming this issue. ADCs should ideally remain stable or intact in the circulation before entering target cells, but there are cases where ADC catabolites are still biologically active [54,55]. ADC stability refers primarily to metabolic stability or integrity. To improve ADC stability, several approaches involving conjugation site selection and linker modification have been developed [54]. In general, modifications to each component (e.g., antibody, linker, and payload) can be performed for this purpose. The conjugation site, linker length, and linker steric hindrance are effective general approaches for site-specific ADCs and should be more broadly applicable to a variety of ADC platforms [54].",

Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is an example of an ADC with a non-cleavable linker yielding a lysine-linker-cytotoxic (DM1) complex (22). \n\nCytotoxins used for ADC synthesis are highly potent because of the limited number of payloads that each individual antibody molecule can carry.

Cleavable linkers release the payload based on some factors of cancer cell such as pH, reducing agents and lysosomal protease. While cleavable linkers have the advantage of providing a bystander effect, they have the disadvantage of increased toxicity in normal tissues. Conversely, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasm, so that they release payload only after complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody and limit premature release of payload. Whereas these features of non-cleavable linkers offer less toxicity, bystander effect is not expected because of the extremely low cell membrane permeability. Among the 13 approved ADCs, cleavable linkers are the most common (11 of 13) and noncleavable linkers are only two (trastuzumab emtansine, belantamab mafodotin).",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent one of the most rapidly expanding classes of anticancer drugs.Over the last few years, several ADCs have been approved as monotherapy for cancer treatment (Table 1 and 2) and many others are currently in clinical development [1].\n\nADCs consist of three main components: a monoclonal antibody (mAb), a linker, and a cytotoxic drug (also known as the payload) (Figure 1).The payload is connected to the mAb through the linker.Once the mAb component binds to its target antigen, the complex antigen-ADC is internalized in the tumor cell, and the payload is delivered and released at the tumor site.The linker is presently classified as cleavable and non-cleavable.Among cleavable linkers, there are varying degrees of stability: linkers less stable may trigger the bystander effect when cleaved, releasing the payload far from the targeted tumor cells and causing the destruction of neighboring cells.Non-cleavable linkers are stable in circulation and release the payload after internalization in response to lysosomal enzymes.Considering that the bystander effect is recognized as a significant component of ADC activity, optimizing linker stability is crucial for ADC effectiveness.The proportions of the three components circulating in the bloodstream differ based on the type of linker used and the overall integrity of the molecule [2].\n\nDespite the initial activity, tumor cells eventually develop resistance to ADCs limiting their use [3,4].Several mechanisms of resistance have been described, including changes at the antigen level (such as altered expression or mutations), changes in endocytosis mechanisms and vesicular trafficking, defects of lysosomal activity (pH, proteolytic enzymes), imbalance in proapoptotic and antiapoptotic factors, alteration of signaling pathways, increased activity of the drug efflux pumps [3,4].",

            "text": "The linker molecule connecting the antibody and the cytotoxic drug should keep the conjugate in bound form until the desired target site is reached [24] and is, hence, an important determinant of the pharmacokinetics and the therapeutic index of the conjugate [5]. Aside from circulatory stability and targeted release, one other key characteristic of a good linker is its low hydrophobicity, due to the fact that hydrophobic linkers can interact with the hydrophobic payloads, leading to aggregates that can possibly cause an immune reaction [25]. Linkers are principally categorized into two: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers release the payload either upon interacting with the low pH environment of the (endo)-lysosome, e.g., hydrazone linkers [26], or upon direct cleavage via lysosomal cathepsins [27], e.g., peptide linkers. A subgroup of cleavable linkers contains disulfide bonds that are sensitive to intracellular glutathione, releasing the payload upon the chemical reduction in these bonds by glutathione [28]. Such linkers might prove useful for the development of future ADCs for many cancers, including ovarian, head and neck, and lung cancers, since increased tumor glutathione levels have been reported in the literature for these cancers [5,29]. Non-cleavable linkers generally present higher levels of plasma stability [26] but require the cytotoxic molecule to remain active after complete lysosomal degradation [27]. Although the la er might appear as a disadvantage at first sight, there are reports of enhanced ADC cytotoxicity when conjugated with a noncleavable linker in comparison to cleavable ones [27]-as demonstrated by the development of Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (Trastuzumab emtansine) by Phillips et al. [30]. Sitespecific degradation mechanisms of non-cleavable linkers are actively being researched to improve their efficacy over cleavable counterparts [31].",

Non-cleavable linkers rely on complete degradation of the antibody component of ADC by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases, which eventually liberates a payload molecule linked to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody (Fig. 8). As such, when coupled with a non-cleavable linker, the payload structure must be carefully selected and designed so that payload can exert comparable or even better anti-tumor potency in such a modified form. For that purpose, it may be necessary to examine PK/PD and toxicity profiles of all possible metabolites of ADCs with non-cleavable linkers. A successful example of ADCs using a non-cleavable linker is the humanized anti-HER2 antibody-maytansine conjugate trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, or Kadcyla \u00ae ) (LoRusso et al., 2011;Verma et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are monoclonal antibodies connected to a cytotoxic agent known as the payload via a chemical linker. It was hoped that ADCs would be \"magic bullets,\" delivering high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy directly to cancer cells without affecting surrounding normal tissues. However, this has not borne out in clinical practice. Though many factors affect toxicity, the toxicities of currently approved ADCs appear to be driven primarily by premature release of the payload into the bloodstream by the linker, by an excessively prominent bystander effect [1], or even payload released by the lysed tumor cells [2]. \n\nADC linkers can be divided broadly into two groups: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers such as hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers rely on physiologic factors (i.e., cathepsin, glutathione (GSH), and low pH) within the cell to cleave the linker. Because these conditions can occur independently of antigen internalization, cleavable linkers are often less stable in the blood, resulting in various off-target effects [3]. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as the thioether or maleimidocaproyl linkers, require internalization by the target cell, so that the antibody, rather than the linker, can be degraded by the lysosome before the drug is released. This latter mechanism does not produce efficient bystander killing and thus results in lower toxicity profiles [4]. For these reasons, other novel linkers, including conditionally released linkers, are currently in rapid development [5,6]. \n\nPreclinical studies have shown that compared to ADCs with non-cleavable linkers, those with cleavable linkers likely release free payload prematurely, leading to increased systemic toxicity.

            "text": "Non-cleavable linkers such as thioether and maleimidocaproyl (MMC) linkers, are not susceptible to environmental or enzymatic cleavage and instead are only broken down to release the cytotoxic payload after tumor cell internalization and subsequent antibody degradation in the endosomes and lysosomes [14]. The advantage of non-cleavable linkers includes improved stability and plasma half-life as well as reduced off-target toxicities [15]. \n\nThe specific targeting of ADCs has allowed for the use of extremely potent drug payloads which are magnitudes of order more potent than standard cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs [15]. Additionally, as only a limited number of drugs can be conjugated to an antibody molecule, and only a fraction of the administered ADC will reach the tumor, extremely potent cytotoxic drugs are required for therapeutic efficacy [22]. Most payloads used in ADCs fall into the classes of tubulin inhibitors or DNAinteracting agents. Tubulin inhibitor payloads, which represent the majority of approved payloads, disrupt the progression of cell division by stabilizing microtubules (auristatin) [23] or de-stabilizing microtubules (maytansinoids) [24]. DNA-interacting payloads can induce cell death by a number of different mechanisms including the induction of DNA double-stranded breaks (calicheamicins) [25], DNA alkylation (duocarmycins) [26], or different modes of DNA cross-linking (PBD dimers) [27] and interference with DNA replication (camptothecins) [28,29]. DNA-targeting payloads have the advantage of targeting cells at any stage of the cell cycle, and some, such as PBD dimers, are not substrates for multidrug resistance pumps [30]. \n\nCurrently, FDA-approved ADCs are used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors including breast cancer, urothelial cancer and HER2 + gastric adenocarcinoma [13].",

            "text": "The linker molecule connecting the antibody and the cytotoxic drug should keep the conjugate in bound form until the desired target site is reached [24] and is, hence, an important determinant of the pharmacokinetics and the therapeutic index of the conjugate [5]. Aside from circulatory stability and targeted release, one other key characteristic of a good linker is its low hydrophobicity, due to the fact that hydrophobic linkers can interact with the hydrophobic payloads, leading to aggregates that can possibly cause an immune reaction [25]. Linkers are principally categorized into two: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers release the payload either upon interacting with the low pH environment of the (endo)-lysosome, e.g., hydrazone linkers [26], or upon direct cleavage via lysosomal cathepsins [27], e.g., peptide linkers. A subgroup of cleavable linkers contains disulfide bonds that are sensitive to intracellular glutathione, releasing the payload upon the chemical reduction in these bonds by glutathione [28]. Such linkers might prove useful for the development of future ADCs for many cancers, including ovarian, head and neck, and lung cancers, since increased tumor glutathione levels have been reported in the literature for these cancers [5,29]. Non-cleavable linkers generally present higher levels of plasma stability [26] but require the cytotoxic molecule to remain active after complete lysosomal degradation [27]. Although the latter might appear as a disadvantage at first sight, there are reports of enhanced ADC cytotoxicity when conjugated with a non-cleavable linker in comparison to cleavable ones [27]-as demonstrated by the development of Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (Trastuzumab emtansine) by Phillips et al. [30]. Site-specific degradation mechanisms of non-cleavable linkers are actively being researched to improve their efficacy over cleavable counterparts [31].",

To this end, cleavable linkers are usually sensitive to conditions specifically found in lysosomes (e.g., acidic condition or lysosomic proteases (cathepsin B, glycosidase, phosphatase)) or high intracellular glutathione concentrations [38] and thereby release the payload only after endocytosis is achieved, leading to death of the target cell [38] (Figure 2). \n\nRegarding non-cleavable linkers, the drug is active after internalization and enzymatic digestion of the antibody into the lysosome, allowing the release of an active metabolite, amino acid-linker-drug complex (e.g., trastuzumab emtansine) [7]. Non-cleavable linkers allow increased ADC stability, leading to reduced toxicity in non-target tissues [7]. Payloads such as MMAF or DM1 are classically used in this setting.",

Use of cleavable linkers is a more traditional approach where the cytotoxic drug is intended to be released after being processed inside the cell. Examples of cleavable linkers-based ADCs include: gemtuzumab ozogamicin (pH-sensitive hydrazone linkers), sacituzumab govitecan, brentuximab vedotin, polatuzumavedotin, enfortumab vedotin, and trastuzumab deruxtecan (proteasesensitive linkers) and mirvetuximab soravtansine and indatuximab ravtansine (glutathione-sensitive linkers) (20,60). Even though they are specifically designed to maintain stability during circulation, it has been suggested that nonspecific drug release may occur in case of acid cleavable linkers, which can be overcome by using non-cleavable linkers. Both types of linkers are featured in the FDA approved list of ADCs with their own advantages (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Following ADC dosing, the released (i.e., \"free\") payload rapidly appears within the systemic circulation. Plasma exposure to free payload relates, in part, to premature deconjugation of the payload in the systemic circulation (e.g., due to inadequate linker stability) [24]. There are two main classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers contain chemical or enzymatic liable chemistries formulated to exploit specific conditions unique to the intracellular or tumor extracellular environments, with the goal of maintaining good stability in the systemic circulation and rapid cleavage at the target site [25,26]. In practice, cleavable linkers are often hydrolyzed in plasma at an appreciable rate, leading to the premature release of the payload in the extra-tumoral compartments. Lipophilic payloads exhibit high permeability through plasma membranes and, consequently, the released payload enters non-targeted cells efficiently (e.g., via membrane diffusion), potentially leading to unwanted cytotoxicity. For example, the hydrazone linker used in the first-generation, calicheamicin-based ADC, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, was designed to be cleaved in the acidic environment of cellular lysosomes (i.e., following cell entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis). However, this linker exhibits an appreciable rate of hydrolysis in plasma, leading to substantial payload release prior to the ADC's engagement with the targeted antigen, and decreasing the fraction of intact ADC delivered to targeted cells [25,27]. \n\nIt is important to note that ADCs with cleavable linkers may be considered to be prodrugs, and it may be expected that 100% of the administered drug (i.e., payload) is eventually liberated through linker hydrolysis.",

A linker must be stable enough in systemic circulation and be able to rapidly and efficiently release the cytotoxic agent upon internalization of the ADC within cancer cells [50]. According to the drug release mechanism, linkers for ADCs are generally categorized into cleavable linkers (acid-labile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers (Table 1) [51]. The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, proteasecleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers.

            "text": "The most used non-cleavable linkers are alkylic and polymeric. For example, the MCC amine-to-sulfhydryl bifunctional cross-linker contains a cyclohexane ring structure that through steric hindrance protects the resulting thioether bond from hydrolysis [46]. The greatest advantage of non-cleavable versus cleavable linkers is their improved plasma stability; that results in reduced off-target toxicity in comparison to conjugates with cleavable linkers and thus provides greater stability and tolerability [47,48]. It is noteworthy that non-cleavable ADCs often have less activity against tumors due to the heterogeneity of target antigen expression where a bystander effect is an important contributor to therapeutic efficacy [49]. As described earlier, non-cleavable linkers require mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization to release the drug to the site of pharmacological activity in the cytosol. If the payload is linked to a charged amino acid such as lysine) with a Pi < 9.5, this will prevent escape of the drug by diffusion through the cell membrane and result in higher levels of drug-accumulation in the tumor cell which as a consequence should overcome the limitations of any bystander effect. In summary the major advantage of non-cleavable linkers is that they minimize drug release into the circulation thus limiting non-specific toxicity whilst maintaining, good in vivo stability [50]. \n\nUsually, non-cleavable linkers contain a thioether or maleimidocaproyl group. Examples of non-cleavable linker-based ADCs containing monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), an anti-mitotic drug, where it was demonstrated that the drug is more potent if linked via a simple alkyl chain to the antibody.

Linkers should be highly stable in the blood circulation to allow the release and internalization of the ADC, though only upon antibody binding with the antigen. Unstable linkers may release the cytotoxic drug prematurely before reaching the tumor, hence, reducing the efficacy of the ADC treatment and increasing chances of off-target toxicity [35]. \n\nA linker can be classified as either cleavable or non-cleavable depending on its composition and susceptibility to proteolytic degradation within the cell. Non-cleavable linkers are more stable in circulation [115]; however, after proteolytic degradation, charged amino acid residues may be retained on the cytotoxic payload and can interfere with the overall efficacy of the drug [115]. The most commonly used type of non-cleavable linkers in ADCs is thioether linkers, currently used in T-DM1 [123]. Cleavable linkers depend on the physiological conditions of the cell and can be subdivided into two types: pH-sensitive and protease-cleavable linkers [35,115]. pH-sensitive linkers utilize the lower pH in the endosomes and lysosomes of target tumor cells to trigger hydrolysis of acid labile groups within a linker, while protease-cleavable linkers utilize common proteases, found in lysosomes of target tumor cells, for specific peptide sequence recognition and cleavage in the linker [35,115,124]. It is important to note, however, that cleavable linkers display nonspecific release of the cytotoxic drug [35,115]. The most commonly used cleavable linkers include acid-labile hydrazones, or disulfides [35,115].",

Effective linkers have to guarantee ADC stability in the bloodstream as well as to allow an efficient cleavage upon internalization into tumor cells. Linkers can be classified into cleavable and non-cleavable according to their chemical properties [2,6]. Non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds resistant to proteolytic degradation, so that cleavage occurs only after lysosome internalization and complete degradation of the antibody. These linkers have higher stability than cleavable ones, but can suffer from lower membrane permeability. Conversely, cleavage of cleavable linkers can depend on external pH (acid-labile linkers), specific lysosomal proteases (protease-cleavable linkers) or glutathione reduction (disulphide linkers) [2,[6][7][8]. All aspects of ADC pharmacology can be influenced by the specific design of the linker, as drug stability into circulation, tumor cell permeability, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR, i.e. the number of payload moleculas carried by each antibody), and extent of the bystander effect [2,7].",

            "text": "While in theory antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) deliver high-dose chemotherapy directly to target cells, numerous side effects are observed in clinical practice. We sought to determine the effect of linker design (cleavable versus non-cleavable), drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), and free payload concentration on systemic toxicity. Two systematic reviews were performed via PubMed search of clinical trials published between January 1998\u2014July 2022. Eligible studies: (1) clinical trial for cancer therapy in adults, (2)\u2009\u2265\u20091 study arm included a single-agent ADC, (3) ADC used was commercially available/FDA-approved. Data was extracted and pooled using generalized linear mixed effects logistic models. 40 clinical trials involving 7,879 patients from 11 ADCs, including 9 ADCs with cleavable linkers (N\u2009=\u20092,985) and 2 with non-cleavable linkers (N\u2009=\u20094,894), were included. Significantly more composite adverse events (AEs) \u2265 grade 3 occurred in patients in the cleavable linkers arm (47%) compared with the non-cleavable arm (34%). When adjusted for DAR, for grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 toxicities, non-cleavable linkers remained independently associated with lower toxicity for any AE (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Higher DAR was significantly associated with higher probability of grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 toxicity for any AE. There was also a significant interaction between cleavability status and DAR for any AE (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Finally, higher measured systemic free payload concentrations were significantly associated with higher DARs (p\u2009=\u20090.043). Our results support the hypothesis that ADCs with cleavable linkers result in premature payload release, leading to increased systemic free payload concentrations and associated toxicities. This may help to inform future ADC design and rational clinical application.",

            "text": "Additionally, there have been developments in antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), which combine these monoclonal antibodies with cytotoxic drugs to augment the potency of targeted anticancer treatments [4]. \n\nADCs represents a cutting-edge anticancer drug with a specific mechanism of inducing cell death in cancer cells. This drug comprises three essential components: an antibody, a payload, and a linker. Its structure entails an antibody that binds to the target substance's epitope, a payload responsible for causing cell death, and a linker that connects the antibody to the payload. ADCs offer a significant advantage due to their monoclonal antibodies ability to selectively target and act on cancer cells, thereby reducing non-specific toxicity to healthy cells. Linkers can be categorized as cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release payloads into cancer cells, triggering cell death by exploiting the pH difference between cancer cells and normal cells. Non-cleavable linkers, although their exact mechanism remains unknown, release payloads through enzymatic degradation of lysosomes in targeted cancer cells. There are primarily two types of payloads in use: DNA-targeted and microtubule-targeted payloads. DNA-targeted payloads bind to the DNA of cancer cells, disrupting its structure and leading to cell death. On the other hand, microtubuletargeted payloads disrupt microtubules within cancer cells, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Creating an ADCs involves the conjugation of an antibody, linker, and payload. This can be achieved by utilizing amino acids present on the antibody's surface or through artificial modification of the antibody surface. Two critical factors influencing the stability of an ADCs are the number of payload drugs conjugated to the antibody and the conjugation site of the antibody and linker. The modulation of these factors can be categorized into stochastic conjugation and site-specific conjugation methods [5]. \n\nThe inception of the first generation of ADCs dates back to the mid-20th century, but they grappled with limitations such as inadequate control over drug binding sites on antibodies, reduced efficiency, and undesirable side effects.",

Linkers can be categorized into cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers can for example be split in the acidic environment of the lysosomes and therefore ensure a controlled releasing of the payload from the antibody. Aiming a higher bystander effect, the use of cleavable linkers is often favorable due to the ability to retain membrane-permeable properties of the payload. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers must undergo a complete proteasomal degradation before the payload is released. In some cases, this degradation does not lead to a complete separation of the payload from the antibody, so residues of the antibody can remain attached to the drug molecule. The remaining antibody residues could potentially interact with the function of the drug [16,19].",

Ideally, the linker should not interfere with the chemotherapeutic agent cytotoxicity, since the cytotoxic agent-linker by-product is what generates the innocent bystander effect. 16 In addition, the linker may serve to counteract resistance to the cytotoxic drug, since hydrophilic linkers generate metabolites that are not substrates for efflux or drug-expulsion active pumps, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). 17 wo main types of linkers are currently used in the development of ADCs: cleavable and non-cleavable. 17 leavable linkers are stable for as long as they are circulating and efficiently release the drug after the ADC is endocytosed by the tumor cell. Non-cleavable linkers remain bound to an amino acid of the antibody after its lysosomal degradation. This type of linker is unsuitable for inducing the innocent bystander effect, since the amino acid-linker-cytotoxic agent complex does not spread outside the tumor cell. 16 oth types of linkers take advantage of lysines or cysteines reactivity in the antibody to form covalent bonds. Conjugation to lysines is efficient, but it generates multiple antibody species with differences in the number of cytotoxic drug molecules and their localization. 18 In addition, since many reactive lysines are found in the C H 2 domain, conjugation increases ADC aggregation. 19 Conjugation to cysteines requires for them to be in their reduced form and, thus, if those that form interchain disulfide bridges are employed, linkers with two reactive groups must be used in order to allow the bridge to regenerate. This strategy allows better control of the number of molecules of the conjugated cytotoxic drug, but still, more than 100 ADC different species can be generated. 18 he diversity of species affects ADC's stability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 20",

            "text": "In one study, an ADC using a PEG 4 Mal linker with DM1 was markedly more effective in eradicating MDR-expressing xenograft tumors than the ADC with the MCC-DM1 linker (10). In a manner, an ADC using the sulfo-SPDB linker DM4 was considerably more potent against an MDR expressing cell line with an 50 =7-20 pM vs >3000 pM for the ADCs with SPDB or MCC linkers (28). \n\nTo reiterate, linkers can be classified as cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers possess functionalities susceptible to degradation through lysosomal processes (protease-sensitive, acid-sensitive, and reduction-sensitive). ADCs made with non-cleavable linkers, in comparison, have extended plasma half-life which is a desirable attribute. The activity of these non-cleavable linkers in the tumor cells relies on the degradation of the total antibody, ultimately releasing an amino-acid-linker-cytotoxin construct. Examples of well-established non-cleavable linkers include maleimidocaproyl (mc), used with MMAF, and MCC, often used with DM1 conjugates. (29). The acyl hydrazide is produced by the displacement of the methyltrisulfide moiety of \u03b3-calicheamicin with 3-mercapto-3-methylbutyryl hydrazide, termed N-acetyl \u03b3-calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide. It is worth noting that this linker construct was also utilized in Mylotarg\u00ae. Once internalized to the lysosome of the tumor cell, the payload undergoes a two-stage activation process. First, the acid-sensitive hydrazone is hydrolyzed and the aryl tetra saccharide portion of the drug binds to the minor groove of DNA (30).",

            "text": "One of the fundamental lessons learned from the first gen- eration of ADCs is that a suitably stable linker is as vital as the antibody and payload for maximization of therapeutic efficacy of the ADC. The ideal linker is systemically stable so that biophysiochemcial property of ADC are similar to that of the unconjugated antibody, but are still able to release the payload at the target site. Extensive research is being conducted to develop novel linkers for ADCs, and the most broadly evaluated and utilized linker platforms include both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers.\n\nCleavable linkers: The cleavable linkers include chemically-labile (e.g., hydrazones and disulfides) and protease-labile linkers. These cleavable linkers are designed to be stable in circulation, but release the toxic payloads due to differences between the extracellular and intracellular microenvironment following internalization of the ADC. For example, the acidlabile hydrazone linker of Mylotarg \u00ae liberates calicheamicin when encountering an acidic pH environment such as found in lysosomes and endosomes (pH 4~6) (van Der Velden et al., 2001;Ulbrich and Subr, 2004). Similarly, disulfide linkers have the advantage of differential reduction potential in the cytosol, so that reduction of the disulfide bond can subsequently liberate payloads, as in the anti-CD56-maytansine conjugate (Saito et al., 2003;Erickson et al., 2006;Chanan-Khan et al., 2010 6 ). It is worth noting that the presence of a stericallyhindered carbon near the sulfur atom in the disulfide linker increases the stability of the disulfide bond, thus providing an equivalent or improved in vitro potency.\n\nThe peptide-based linkers are also designed to be retained in the ADC formin circulation, but to release their payload upon cleavage by specific intracellular proteases. For example, Adcetris \u00ae uses the valine-citrulline (vc) dipeptide linker, which is hydrolyzed by",

An ideal linker should possess high water solubility, preventing both aggregation of the ADC and premature payload release in systemic circulation (39). Regarding intracellular stability and degradation patterns, linkers are classified into two distinct categories: cleavable and non-cleavable (40). Cleavable linkers exhibit sensitivity to intracellular environmental conditions and could be cleaved by acid, protease, a reducing substance, and so on (40). Typically, these linkers, including hydrazone bonds, disulfide bonds, and polypeptides, are cleaved within endosomes or lysosomes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers undergo cleavage only within lysosomes, leading to the degradation of their associated payloads into amino acids (65). Significantly, non-cleavable linkers offer the benefits of an enhanced therapeutic index and reduced off-target toxicity (66). While each strategy presents its own advantages and drawbacks, the optimal linker and conjugation chemistry must be precisely tailored to align with the specific properties of the antibody, the drug molecule, and the disease profile being targeted.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates are targeted agents that link a cytotoxic drug (also known as payload) to a monoclonal antibody. The antibody recognizes an antigen on the tumor and releases the cytotoxic drug into the cell, thereby reducing toxicity and improving efficacy [20]. The cytotoxic drug and the antibody are joined by a connector (linker). The linker is a critical component in the structure of ADCs; there are two types, \"cleavable\" and \"non-cleavable\". Linkers have to remain stable in circulation and be easily cleavable in the intracellular space to deliver the payload. \"Cleavable\" linkers release the drug by hydrolysis or proteolysis. \"Non-cleavable\" linkers depend on degradation of the antibody to release their cytotoxic payload. The average number of drugs conjugated per antibody is known as the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), and is an important feature of ADCs since it is relevant for potential efficacy and toxicity [21]. \n\nThe ADC-antigen complex is usually taken up by endocytosis or pinocytosis after binding to its target. An early endosome is created as a result of internalization by budding inward from the cell membrane. Before binding to lysosomes, early endosomes become late endosomes [21]. Cleavage processes of ADCs with cleavable linkers, such as hydrolysis, proteolytic cleavage or reductive cleavage, take place in early or late endosomes, but ADCs with non-cleavable linkers need sophisticated proteolytic cleavage by cathepsin B and plasmin in lysosomes. The cytotoxic payload is discharged from lysosomes to the cytoplasm after cleavage. Cytotoxic payloads target DNA and cause single-or doublestrand DNA breaks, or interfere with microtubules, leading to cell apoptosis [22].",

Since Mylotarg's first approval, 15 ADcs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of both solid and hematological cancers (table 1, Sasso et al. 2023)-including Mylotarg which returned to the market in 2017 with a lower suggested dose and a revised dosing schedule-and over 100 ADcs are currently in clinical trials, with more than 200 ADcs in preclinical development. \n\nwhat we have learned over two decades of research, is that each component of an ADc (the antibody, linker, and payload) confers pharmacokinetics and biodistribution properties that provide more on-target activity, but also a concomitant exposure to the rest of the body that results in off-target toxicities (colombo and Rich 2022; Sasso et al. 2023). to expand the therapeutic window, much research has been devoted to the development of cleavable and non-cleavable linkers that improve the stability, hydrophobicity, and specific release of the cytotoxic payloads. ideally, linkers are stable in circulation and release payload in cancer cells. to achieve this dual functionality, linkers with diverse release triggers have been developed including pH sensitive linkers, enzyme cleavable linkers (i.e. specifically cleaved by cathepsins, glycosidases, or sulfatases), and photo-sensitive linkers. the unique properties of these linkers convey functionality to ADcs, but an in-depth analysis of these is beyond the scope of this review (Su et al. 2021). in addition, a collection of different cytotoxins with various mechanisms of action and potencies have been used to reduce off-target effects (Beck et al. 2017). A critical consideration when designing an ADc is how protein engineering and the chemistry of conjugation can determine the individual components of the conjugate, and consequently, affect its overall stability, PK, efficacy, and safety. Here we discuss advances in protein engineering strategies and emerging technologies that are being developed to improve the functional properties of ADcs.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates are a promising class of antibody-based therapeutics that take advantage of antibody specificity and small molecule cytotoxicity. The combined approach can deliver cytotoxic agents more specifically to the target cells and minimize harmful side effects in anti-tumor treatments [1][2][3]. The cytotoxic drugs are typically linked to the antibody carrier through either cleavable or non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers contain a trigger that can release the cytotoxic agent after internalization and can utilize a change in pH, redox potential, or a proteolytic or other enzymatic event for linker processing [4,5]. Non-cleavable linkers, on the other hand, rely on the degradation of the antibody itself to release the drug-linker, typically with the amino acid residue it was conjugated to as the released species [4,6]. The choice of linker is one of the critical parameters of ADC design, and is usually experimentally determined for each target and cell type. Numerous examples of both linker types (cleavable and non-cleavable) are currently utilized in the clinic [7][8][9]. Regardless of its type, the ideal linker remains intact in systemic circulation, and releases the cytotoxic agent only after internalization in the target cell [9,10], either by the built-in trigger (cleavable linkers) or by degradation of the antibody (non-cleavable linkers). \n\nA number of non-cleavable linkers have been developed based on traditional conjugation methods using maleimide or N-hydroxysuccinimide ester coupling chemistry. The maleimide chemistry, although more specific due to lower number of potential target sites on the antibody, has been reported to uncouple in circulation, resulting in decreased exposure of the ADC relative to the total antibody [11][12][13]. Recently, several ways of reducing maleimide-based decoupling have been reported [12,14,15], overcoming a hurdle to future clinical development of those linkers.",

            "text": "Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy. These linkers also tend to inhibit bystander effects, because the released catabolites have poor cellular permeability. Consequently, identifying alternatives to improve drug release and enhance therapeutic outcomes has become a major focus of ongoing research. \n\nCurrently, 73.3% (11/15) of approved ADCs and 75.0% (18/24) of phase III ADCs employ cleavable linkers, with peptide linkers being the most common subtype. These account for 46.7% (7/15) of approved ADCs and 58.3% (14/24) of those in phase III. In comparison to chemically cleavable linkers, enzyme-cleavable linkers exploit abundant intracellular hydrolases to facilitate controlled drug release. This enzymatic mechanism ensures greater stability in plasma, making enzyme-cleavable linker more competitive for future ADC development. To enhance linker solubility and mitigate polymerization, polar groups such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be incorporated into the linker structure. This strategy has been employed in the marketed ADCs loncastuximab tesirine and sacituzumab govitecan, as well as in phase III clinical candidates such as trastuzumab duocarmazine, ARX-788, and DP-303c. Additionally, designing linkers with multiple attachment sites for payloads enhances the number and diversity of the conjugated drugs, which not only improves therapeutic efficacy but also reduces the potential for resistance.",

            "text": "Tandem linker. One drawback associated with cleavable linkers is the potential to release payloads in plasma circulation before tumor targeting. If the payloads are released systemically prematurely, the efficacy of the remaining circulating ADCs may be reduced, leading to off-target toxicity. Tandem cleavable linkers are novel linkers that incorporate a \u03b2-glucuronide moiety and require tandem enzymic cleavage events (47). These linkers reduce payloads release during circulation and off-target toxicity. \n\nSilencing the Fc portion of the ADCs. Whereas the Fc domain of the antibody induces immunogenicity, the internalisation of ADCs into non-targeted cells via Fc\u03b3 receptors on immune cells may provoke off-target toxicities. By silencing the Fc domain, Fc-mediated offtarget cytotoxicity was reduced (48). \n\nNovel site specific conjugation technologies. Conventional antibody conjugates have been constructed through cysteine or lysine residue side chains. These approaches were stochastic, non-specific conjugation and generated heterogenous ADCs. To overcome the drawback of non-specific conjugation, intense research to realise site specific conjugation has been conducted. Chemo-enzymatic methods include transglutaminase and glycan-mediated conjugation, and chemical methods include selective reduction of disulfides and N-terminal amine modifications (49).",

            "text": "One group prepared a series of maytansinoid-coupled ADCs with a DAR range from 2 to 14, using both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers, to evaluate the preclinical and clinical effects of DAR, including in vivo stability, efficacy, and tolerability [79,83]. Their results showed that agents with a high DAR (average 10, range 7-14) using both linker formats had faster distribution and clearance rates and decreased efficacy in vivo (Figure 4) [79,83]. On the other hand, ADCs with a DAR less than 6 displayed similar clearances, superior in vivo efficacy, and were well tolerated [79,83]. Hambelet et al. demonstrated similar conclusions in a study evaluating MMAE conjugated to a CD30 antibody using a MC-vc-PAB linker [78]. When DARs were manipulated to increase the cytotoxic payload with either 2, 4, or 8 drugs per antibody, the clearance increased [78]. These results may be related to the difference in the rate of uptake of these agents by the MPS and other non-target cells. \n\nAdditionally, the site of conjugation can play a role in augmenting the pharmacology of an ADC. Strop et al. created an ADC with an average DAR ~1.7, but directed conjugation using a novel enzymatic conjugation to precise points on the antibody backbone to create homogenous solutions [84]. Their study reported how the site of conjugation affected linker stability in a species-dependent manner, where conjugation on the light chain appears to be cleaved more quickly compared to heavy chain conjugation in mice, but stable in rats [84]. Additionally, heavy chain conjugation demonstrated dramatically different PK and faster rate of drug loss, compared to either light chain conjugated ADCs or naked mAbs in rats [84]. The uses of such technologies can allow for increased studies of the role of the linker, linker position, and cytotoxic payload to optimize the pharmacology and improve the therapeutic index of these agents.",

            "text": "A novel type of therapy that has recently been investigated in the clinical setting is the antibody drug conjugates (ADC). ADC are mAb against a specific tumor target on the surface of malignant cells that carry a small cytotoxic agent (payload), such as microtubule inhibitors and agents damaging DNA, utilizing a cleavable or non-cleavable linker [139,140]. When it reaches its target, the ADC is internalized with eventual release of the payload into the cytoplasm of malignant PCs, leading to cell death [140] (Figure 3). Cleavable linkers are degradated by enzymes in the cytoplasm of the malignant cells, whereas non-cleavable linkers require processing and degradation of the mAb complex into the lysosomes in order to release the toxic payload [140]. The target of ADC should ideally be a molecule highly expressed on the surface of malignant PCs with very low or no expression on other cell types, including hematopoeitic cells, to avoid systemic toxicity [141]. ADC can also exert their effects via ADCC, ADCP, or CDC [142,143]. a chimeric antigen receptor on their surface, which targets specific tumor antigens of malignant plasma cells. Similarly, bispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies targeting both an antigen on the malignant MM cells and simultaneously an antigen on the surface of physiologic T cells, creating an immunologic bridge. ADC are monoclonal antibodies against antigenic epitopes on the surface on MM cells, carrying a cytotoxic payload. The binding of the above agents to their antigenic targets on malignant MM cells leads to activation of the immune system, with subsequent destruction of the MM cells.",

            "text": "The linker in ADCs connects the antibody with the cytotoxic drug. It plays a critical role in the stability of ADCs and the release profiles of payloads, consequently influencing the therapeutic index of ADCs. An ideal linker should limit premature payload release in plasma while facilitating the active release of drugs at the desired target sites. Most ADCs employ two types of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. The first ones are designed to cleave under specific conditions, such as in a low-pH environment or in the presence of proteolytic enzymes [5]. \n\nThe cytotoxic payload is the active component that exerts cytotoxicity upon the internalization of ADCs into cancer cells. These compounds must remain stable under physiological conditions and possess functional groups suitable for conjugation with the antibody. To date, the cytotoxic payloads utilized in ADCs primarily comprise potent tubulin inhibitors and DNA-damaging agents [8,9]. In this light, the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) represents the average number of payload molecules (ranging from 2 to 8) attached to each monoclonal antibody. While ADCs with higher DARs exhibited greater potency in vitro, preclinical evidence demonstrated that they may have higher toxicity and a lower therapeutic index [10]. \n\nFollowing intravenous injection, ADCs bind to their target antigens and undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis for internalization within the cell. Once inside the cell, the cytotoxic payload carries out its cytotoxic role through its interaction with microtubules or DNA. In addition, apoptotic cells or ADCs may release the cytotoxic component into the extracellular space, potentially inducing cell death in neighboring cells, a phenomenon known as the \"bystander effect\" [11]. \n\nThe current review aims to explore the past, the present, and the future of ADCs as therapeutic agents for the treatment of advanced SCLC (Figure 1).",

ADCs are acting like a magic bullet which delivers cytotoxic drugs specifically to cancerous cells throughout the body, thus attacks these cells, while not harming healthy cells. ADCs are complex molecules that are composed of an antibody having targeting capability and linked-payload or cytotoxic drug killing cancerous cells. The key factors of the success in the development of ADC are selection of appropriate antibody, cytotoxic payload and linker for conjugation. Recently there was considerable progress in ADCs development, and a large number of ADCs gained US FDA approval. About 80 new ADCs are under active clinical studies. In this review we present a brief introduction of the US-FDA approved ADCs and global situation in the clinical studies of ADC pipelines. We address an overview on each component of an ADC design such as target antigens, payloads, linkers, conjugation methods, drug antibody ratio. In addition, we discuss on the trend of ADC market where global big pharmas and domestic biopharmaceutical companies are competing to develop safer and more effective ADCs.",

A diverse range of noncleavable alkyl and polymeric linkers have been investigated in ADCs development, including MCC amine-to-sulfhydryl bifunctional cross-linker, notably utilized in T-DM1 (25). The primary advantage of using non-cleavable linkers lies in their enhanced plasma stability compared to several cleavable linkers. Although non-cleavable linkers exhibit a limited 'bystander' effect, their resistance to cleavage outside target cells notably enhances the specificity of drug release (67).",

            "text": "The cleavable linkers normally take advantage of the difference of tumor microenvironment and normal physiological environment to release the payloads that may be membranepermeable and can produce the bystander effect. The non-cleavable linkers need to meet the requirement that the antibody and linker must be disconnected after the formation of the antigen-antibody complex enter the lysosomal trafficking. This may cause the bystander effect that is a passive transport process to weaken, caused by the membrane-impermeability of linker-payloads connected with polar amino acids. Both types of linkers have their advantages and disadvantages, which are applied to the clinical trials (Chari et al., 2014;Bialucha et al., 2017). However, about 2/3 ADCs used cleavable linkers in the current clinical trials (Lambert and Berkenblit, 2018), in which mainly are dipeptide linkers and disulfide linkers. The non-cleavable linkers are not only more stable to escape from the off-target toxicities than cleavable linkers (Lu et al., 2016), but also may overcome the barrier of multiple-drug resistance (MDR) (Shefet-Carasso and Benhar, 2015;Beck et al., 2017;Nasiri et al., 2018) for the reason that the payload connected with polar amino cannot be a substrate of MDR1, which will improve the MDR phenomenon. However, the non-cleavable linkers need a more elaborate process to produce activity such as the internalization and metabolism of the antibody in the lysosome, which is a prerequisite to release active payloads to exert killing activity (Rosenberg, 2006;Lambert and Berkenblit, 2018), and the polar amino-linker-payload also needs a distinct transporter to carry it from the lysosome to cytoplasm to work (Hamblett et al., 2015;Kinneer et al., 2018;Lee et al., 2018b), which makes the design of ADC more complex to limit the utilization of non-cleavable linkers.",

This advanced therapeutic approach addresses many challenges of traditional chemotherapy. 10 ADC payloads are designed to be highly potent, often active at picomolar concentrations, to counter the fact that only a small fraction of injected antibodies effectively reach tumor cells. ][26] The linker between the payload and the antibody is crucial for ADC effectiveness. It controls the release of the cytotoxic drug, directly impacting pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and the therapeutic index. A stable linker ensures controlled drug release at the target site, minimizing off-target effects. However, the stability of the linker must be carefully balanced: a too-weak linker may cause premature drug release, while an overly strong linker may hinder drug delivery. ADCs use both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers respond to specific enzymatic conditions within endosomes, releasing the drug payload upon cleavage. Non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation for drug release. 27,28 This sophisticated design allows ADCs to precisely target and destroy cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissues.",

            "text": "Although these linkers are more stable than cleavable linkers, the drug internalization may be impaired due to the low membrane permeability.Instead, the breakdown of cleavable linkers depends on external factors such as pH (acid unstable linker), the presence of specific proteases (protease-cleavable linker) or glutathione reduction (disulfide bond linker) [39][40][41].Currently, most ADC drugs are based on the internalizing mechanism, whereby ADC is internalized by endocytosis upon the binding to cancer cell surface antigen and degraded in lysosomes to release cytotoxic drug [37].In addition to this canonical process, ADCs can also induce tumor cell death through \"bystander effect\", an effect that occurs when cytotoxic payloads spread across the cell membrane to neighboring cells and induce apoptosis [42].The key to the design of an internalizing ADC is that the relatively strong linker between the antibody and the payload, which remains stable under physiological conditions of plasma circulation but is rapidly lysed after endocytosis by tumor cells.This design selectively delivers payloads into tumors and at the same time limits adverse side effects due to off-target toxicity [43].Non-internalizing ADCs do not require lysosomes to release payloads, and the linkers can be degraded in the tumor microenvironment to release the payload and exert cytotoxic effects [44].Besides, non-internalizing ADCs usually do not require the overexpression of cancer cell surface antigens and can take advantage of several physiological features of the tumor microenvironment (such as pH and hypoxia) for targeted delivery [44].Thus, non-internalizing ADCs are good candi-dates to target cancers with dense tumor stroma, such as TNBC and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) [45].\n\nThe antibodies used for ADC development are humanized antibodies, with significantly attenuated immunogenicity compared to murine and chimeric monoclonal antibody [46].",

            "text": "The efficient internalization by CSCs and low immunogenicity of the ADC are important factors in the selection process [106,107]. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ADC is affected by the choice of linker that connects the antibody to the drug molecule. The linker should stabilize the ADC in circulation but provide a mechanism for the release of the payload when the ADC reaches the tumor site. Linkers are divided into non-cleavable and cleavable linkers [108]. Non-cleavable linkers form stable bonds with antibodies and have a longer half-life in circulation. Further, after internalization, non-cleavable linkers should degrade in the lysozyme to release the drug molecule inside the targeted tumor cell. The stability of cleavable linkers depends on the physiological conditions in the tumor tissue and the expression of enzymes for cleavage of the linker to release the drug in the tumor site. The tumor toxicity of the ADC depends on the choice of payload (drug molecule) attached to the antibody. Conventional cancer drugs, such as DOX or mitomycin, have been used with ADCs. In general, the payload in ADCs is engineered to target either DNA or tubulin to interfere with cell division and proliferation. The conjugation chemistry affects the drug pharmacokinetics and therapeutic index of ADC. The conjugation of the payload largely occurs through the linker via the alkylation or acetylation of lysine side chains in the backbone of the antibody [106]. ADCs possess a higher tumor selectivity and cytotoxicity, compared to other targeted delivery approaches [103]. In a recent study, natural phospholipids were mixed with PTX and SLM conjugated to monoclonal antibody 2C5 to form PTX/SLM-ADC immunoliposomes for targeted delivery to bulk tumor cells and CSCs in TNBC. The in vitro studies with MDA-MB-231 TNBCs and HER2-positive SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells showed a specific uptake of PTX-ADC and SLM-ADC by bulk tumor cells and CSCs, respectively [109].",

            "text": "Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues. For instance, in a study by Polson et al., several ADCs were constructed by conjugating antibodies against a panel of non-Hodgkin lymphoma antigens to a DM1 payload via either a cleavable (SPP) or a non-cleavable (SMCC) linker and were tested for in vivo toxicity and efficacy [34]. The SMCC-ADCs showed efficacy against only two of the seven target antigens, while the SPP-ADCs were active against all targets. However, at the dose of 20 mg ADC/kg, the animals treated with an ADC bearing the cleavable linker SPP exhibited much more significant weight loss, hepatic toxicity, and hematological toxicities when compared with the results observed following dosing with ADC employing the non-cleavable linker SMCC. \n\nIn addition to the entry of released payload into non-targeted cells via passive diffusion across plasma membranes, the non-specific endocytosis of the intact ADC may also contribute to the off-site delivery of payload. Non-specific endocytosis may be influenced by the physicochemical properties of ADCs, including hydrophobicity and charge. Since most of the drug-linker compositions utilized in ADC technology are highly lipophilic, the hydrophobicity of the ADCs is often proportional to the drug loading (i.e., drug-to-antibody ratio, DAR). In a study by Hamblett et al., several anti-CD30-vc-MMAE ADCs with DARs of two, four, and eight were evaluated for in vivo pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity [35]. It was observed that the ADCs with higher DAR values had a faster systemic clearance, a lower tolerability, and a narrower therapeutic index than the ADCs with a lower DAR.",

            "text": "Almost neglected at the beginning of the ADC era, linker design has today become an independent chapter in the ADC pipeline, especially because, along with MAbs and cytotoxic drugs, the type of linker, its stability, site of conjugation, and the final drug/antibody ratio (DAR) are crucial parameters which affect ADC biophysical properties, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy. The junction between the antibody and the payload is generally a covalent bond or a chemical linker, while a fusion construct, including the MAb fragment and the effector joined by a peptide linker, can be devised in the case of an immunotoxin conjugate molecule; thus, expression of the entire polypeptide can be performed in a host. \n\nLinkers are classified into two categories: cleavable and uncleavable (Figure 3). They need to be stable in the circulation and must be cleaved, ideally, only inside the cells, thus preventing the drug payload from being shed before reaching the tumoral cell target. When the linker is unstable in the extracellular space, the free drug subsequently permeates the cell to reach its target. 22 This can be a useful mechanism to enhance on-target activity, but it can also be the cause of offtarget toxicity, which is absent with uncleavable linkers. 21 ncleavable linkers are cut by complete degradation of the MAb component in the lysosome, which leaves an active unit formed by the drug, the linker, and a lysine residue. 23,24 leavable linkers are selectively cleaved upon change of a biophysical property (eg, pH in the case of hydrazone linkers), 21 or when an appropriate protease is found. For example, lysosomal proteases (eg, cathepsin and plasmin) are present at elevated levels in certain tumor tissues. 25 hough established conjugation chemistries and linkers for antibody arming have already led to a significant improvement in therapeutic outcome, 26 a rapid evolution of both into a second generation is already under way.",

            "text": "Noncleavable linkers have the characteristic that following ADC lysosomal degradation the cytotoxic payload remains active while still being attached to the linker and an amino acid residue. T-DM1 is an ADC that uses a non-cleavable linker (Junttila et al, 2011;Shefet-Carasso and Benhar, 2015). \n\nCleavable linkers use different methods to release cytotoxic drug, increasing the possibility of the bystander effect. There are acidsensitive linkers that will release the free drug in the low pH conditions in lysosomes or endosomes. Such a mechanism was used by gemtuzumab ozogamicin and its linker was characterised by certain plasma instability (Hamann et al, 2002;Shefet-Carasso and Benhar, 2015). Inotuzumab ozogamicin, now in phase II trials, uses the same linker and it is more stable (Boghaert et al, 2008). Another type of cleavable linker are lysosomal protease-sensitive linkers with the licensed example of brentuximab vedotin (Senter and Sievers, 2012). A third type are glutathione-sensitive linkers that benefit from the higher concentration of glutathione in tumour cells. (Sapra et al, 2011). Each approach has different advantages and disadvantages, so the choice of the linker can only be determined by taking into account all the other components of the ADC. \n\nCytotoxic payload. To create an effective ADC, it is imperative to have a potent cytotoxic payload. The first generation of ADCs used classical chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin and methotrexate with the benefit of a well-known toxicity profile (Shefet-Carasso and Benhar, 2015). Repeated studies, however, have shown that the actual concentration of the cytotoxic payload in tumour cells is minimal with only 1-2% of the administered dose reaching the tumour (Teicher and Chari, 2011).",

            "text": "13 Depending on their stability, they can be classified into two main types: cleavable and noncleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers, being the most stable type, generally result in better tolerability, but ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate superior efficacy, partly attributable to the bystander effect. 14 The payload typically consists of a highly potent small molecule with nanomolar to picomolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. The payloads of FDA-approved ADCs for solid tumors currently fall into three classes: microtubular inhibitors (auristatins, maytansinoids), topoisomerase inhibitors (deruxtecan, SN-38-active form of irinotecan), and alkylating agents (duocarmazine). 15 The drug-antibody ratio (DAR) refers to the average number of drug molecules conjugated to an antibody in an ADC. \n\nIt is a critical parameter in ADC design, influencing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the conjugate. A higher DAR may increase the drug payload, potentially enhancing therapeutic efficacy, but it could also impact stability and increase the risk of off-target effects. On the other hand, a lower DAR may provide better stability but may limit the overall drug payload. Finding the optimal DAR is crucial in ADC development to balance therapeutic benefits and potential challenges. 16 ADCs were first approved for hematologic malignances (lymphoma, multiple myeloma), breast cancer, and gastric cancer. 17 Among gynecological cancers, mirvetuximab soravtansine has been recently approved by the FDA for relapsed platinum resistant ovarian cancer. 17 ncerning CC several targets are under evaluation, but TF is the most investigated.",

            "text": "The idea behind ADCs is the delivery of a potent cytotoxin to its target using a specific carrier. An ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) linked to the cytotoxic drug via specialized linking molecules. The likelihood of systemic exposure and toxicity is greatly reduced, depending on the molecular target for the antibody part of the ADC and the linker's chemical stability in the circulation. \n\nThe key to obtain a medically relevant ADC is to optimize a few parameters including a suitable target, a powerful cytotoxic payload, an appropriate linker, and the technology to conjugate these at a proper antibody conjugation site. [1] This shows the degree of complexity in the field of ADC design and production. Currently used cytotoxic payloads derive from microorganisms (Micromonospora echinospora, Actinomycetes spp.), plants (Maytenus spp.), small-molecular-weight drugs (tubulin inhibitors, DNA cross-linking molecules), or even sea animals such as the sea hare (Dolabella auricularia), and have been further modified to exploit their potential. [2] Antibody-drug conjugates use cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. [3] The first group includes pH-sensitive, glutathione-sensitive, lysosomal protease-sensitive, and \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers. Their main disadvantage is the potential to release the payload in the blood stream, and therefore increase systemic toxicity and decrease effectiveness. Non-cleavable linkers remain stable in the blood stream and the whole ADC complex undergoes degradation within the target cell, leaving a payload-linker remnant with retained activity. Moreover, there is another major challenge that appears in any anti-cancer therapy, which is multi-drug resistance. It is either inherent or acquired, and may result from altered expression of the target antigen, different signaling pathways, or overexpression of efflux transporter proteins. [4] Virtually all used payloads may become potential substrates for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and perhaps modifying the linking molecules of ADCs will effectively overcome this issue.",

            "text": "The linker component of the ADC, through which the covalent chemical bond between the drug and the antibody is created, should be chosen rationally, based on the mechanism of action of the antibody (whether internalizing or not) and limit potential chemical modifications to the drug in order to avoid loss of cytotoxicity. One of the main aims for the effective systemic delivery of an ADC is that the drug is released only at the target site; the linker, thus, must be stable enough in a biological environment (i.e., blood circulation) to avoid unwanted release of the pharmacological molecule. \n\nThere are two types of linkers available: cleavable and non-cleavable (Figure 3). The former can be used either in the design of either an internalizing or not internalizing ADC, because the release of the payload is required to take place in either the extracellular tumor environment, or within the lysosome or cytosol. This is possible because the extracellular environment of the tumor is highly reducing due to the presence of glutathione, which allows the release of payloads linked to the antibody via thiolic bonds. It also allows payload release via the degradation of peptide bonds in the presence of proteases such as Cathepsin B, whose overexpression in cancer drives its normal lysosomal localization towards extracellular secretion [24]. A cleavable linker, therefore, exploits differential conditions of reducing power or enzymatic degradation that can be present either outside or inside the target cell. Due to the chemical reactions needed to release the payload, the site of conjugation on the antibody is crucial to induce both stability in the plasma and availability to reduction or degradation on/into the target cell [25,26]. Non-cleavable linker-based ADC must, however, be internalizing, because to release their cytotoxic payload, the antibody component needs to be degraded by lysosomal or cytoplasmic proteases [27]. Furthermore, drugs linked to such linkers usually cannot exert a by-stander effect because upon degradation of the antibody by cellular proteases, they are released as fragments of antibody peptides that have a poor ability to permeate the cells.",

Linkers have two main functions; the primary one is maintaining stability in the bloodstream, keeping the cytotoxic payload attached to the antibody when it moves through the plasma; the other aspect is to efficiently release the payload into the tumor (8). The linkers should keep this attachment stable and unchanged in the bloodstream, with the drug being released only after antigen-antibody binding (21). Linkers are cleavable or non-cleavable depending on their chemical characteristics. Cleavable linkers are chemically unstable structures that can deliver drugs extracellularly and induce the killing of nearby tumor cells (22,23). The non-cleavable linker releases the drug solely when the antibody undergoes internalization and degradation within the lysosomes of the target cells. However, the cytotoxic payloads are released after the apoptosis of tumor cells, which may also result in the non-specific killing of surrounding tumor cells (24). \n\nThe cytotoxic payloads in ADCs now encompass a range of DNA-targeting agents, microtubule-binding proteins and some topoisomerase 1 inhibitors. The agents targeting microtubules are the most frequently used payloads, targeting the medenosine and periwinkle alkaloid sites. They interfere with the kinetics of microtubule protein polymerization and maintain the cell cycle in the G 2 /M phase, leading to cell death (25,26). Not all tumor types are sensitive to a given type of payload and, therefore, diversifying payloads is critical to expanding the indications of ADCs. \n\nADCs in tumor therapy . Alternative strategies based on the use of ADCs are highly effective in treating cancer.",

            "text": "ADCs consist typically of an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic payload through a linker (Fig. 2A). The underlying mechanism for all approved ADCs is the recognition of a cell surface antigen by the antibody moiety, internalization, payload release in the lysosome and tumour cell death. ADCs can also block oncogenic signalling pathways or induce antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) via their Fc region [35]. The field of ADC development is exploding, fuelled by antibody moieties targeting unique tumour associated antigens, and by technological innovations in ADC design. \n\nThere are currently 14 ADCs with FDA approval composed of 11 unique antibody targets (Table 1). Furthermore, ADCs with more than 50 unique targets are in different phases of clinical development and of these, approximately 85% focus on solid tumour indications, emphasizing the broad clinical scope of ADCs [36]. \n\nDespite their enormous potential for targeting a wide range of cancer types, ADC treatment is prone to toxicity-related side effects that arise from the antibody targeting healthy tissues as well as the premature, off-target release of their cytotoxic payload (Fig. 2B), narrowing expected therapeutic windows [37]. Additionally, ADCs can form long-lasting albumin-linker adducts, unintentionally increasing their halflife and systemic exposure [38]. \n\nTo address these challenges newer generations of ADCs incorporate structural innovations in their antibody, linker, and payload (reviewed in [39]; Figure 2C). These include bi-specific ADCs that simultaneously target two tumour antigens [40] and probody-drug conjugates, where the antigen-binding domain is only activated in the tumour microenvironment [41]. Advances in cleavable and non-cleavable linkers include variations in lengths and chemistry, enabling optimization of different drug-antibody ratios and the delivery of more than one payload class. Apart from potent chemotherapeutic agents, novel ADCs explore the potential of different payloads including immune-stimulating antibody conjugates [42] and proteolysis-targeting chimeras [43] (Fig. 2C).",

ADCs with cleavable linkers mediated in vivo efficacy via all these targets; ADCs with uncleavable linkers were only effective when targeted to CD22 and CD79b. In target-independent safety studies in rats, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity, presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation. Thus, our data suggest that ADCs with cleavable linkers work on a broad range of targets, and for specific targets, ADCs with uncleavable linkers provide a promising opportunity to improve the therapeutic window for ADCs in humans.",

            "text": "Linkers connect the antibody to the payload and are a key factor related to the stability of ADC and payload release profiles. Linkers are classified as cleavable and non-cleavable based on their cleavage mechanisms 20,21 , and are important for the eventual therapeutic index of the ADC 20 . Cleavable linkers are designed to break down and release the cytotoxic payload of the ADC in response to factors associated with the tumor; thus, by using the disparities between tumor cells and the systemic circulation, the payload is released in a guided, precise way. Cleavable linkers are divided into two classes, chemical (which include disulfide and hydrazone bond) and enzyme linkers (peptide and glucuronide bond) 20 . Hydrazone is a pH-sensitive linker, which allows for the ADC to remain stable in the systemic circulation and is hydrolyzed at specific pH (e.g., pH 4.8 induces release of the payload in lysosomes 20,22 . The degradation of cleavable linkers, therefore, can vary depending on a number of specific features, either outside or inside the target cell, such as external pH (acid-labile linkers), specific lysosomal proteases (protease-cleavable linkers) or glutathione reduction (disulfide linkers) 23 . Recent cleavable linkers (e.g., enfortumab vedotin, sacituzumab govitecan, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd)) 21 are stable in the systemic circulation, in contrast to non-cleavable linkers, e.g., ado-trastuzumab emtansine (TDM1). Non-cleavable linkers, meanwhile, are comprised of stable bonds which are more resistant to proteolytic cleavage in blood; following the internalization of ADCs by lysosomes or proteases, and subsequent antibody degradation, cleavage then occurs which then leads to release of the payload 23 .",

Approximately two-thirds of ADCs in clinical trials use cleavable linkers. The most frequently used are dipeptide, disulfide, and enzyme-cleavable, particularly hydrazone, cathepsin B-responsive disulfide and pyrophosphate diester linkers [34][35][36]. Non-cleavable linkers require the degradation of the antibody component before the drug is released. This mechanism may reduce the bystander effect.

The linker should be sufficiently stable in circulation to allow the payload to remain attached to the antibody while in circulation as it distributes into tissues (including solid tumor tissue), yet should allow efficient release of an active cell-killing agent once the ADC is taken up into the cancer cells [5]. Linkers can be characterized as either cleavable, where a chemical bond (or bonds) between the payload and the attachment site on the antibody (usually an amino acid) can be cleaved intracellularly [16][17][18], or as non-cleavable, where the final active metabolite released within the cell includes the payload and all elements of the linker still attached to an amino acid residue of the antibody, typically a lysine or a cysteine residue, following complete proteolytic degradation of the ADC within the lysosome of the cell [19][20][21]. \n\nThe design goal for an ADC is to harness the potent tumor cell-killing action of the payload to an antibody, while retaining the favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties of the immunoglobulin, as well as any intrinsic biologic or immunologic activity it may have [5-7, 21, 22]. Much of the selection of the optimal antibody, the ideal linker-payload chemistry, and the optimal number of payload molecules linked per antibody molecule, are determined empirically, with a focus on maximizing the therapeutic index of the ADC [5,22].",

Cleavable linkers can release the payload in response to conditions such as the presence of proteases, redox environments, or acidic pH in tumor cells or the microenvironment. Non-cleavable linkers are broken down inside the cancer cells by proteasomal degradation.

            "text": "The ADCs' linkers connect the antibody to the payload.The ideal linker should ensure that it is stable enough in the bloodstream not to divide prematurely, leading to off-target toxicity.It can also divide rapidly to release the payload once it enters the tumor cell for internalization.It is the critical component that determines the toxicity and efficacy of ADCs (27).\n\nCurrent linkers are categorized into cleavable and non-cleavable linkers based on their release mechanism (Figure 2) (28).Noncleavable linkers form a fundamental bond between a cytotoxic drug and an amino acid residue of an antibody, e.g., Thioether linkers, and Maleimido caproyl linkers.In contrast, cleavable linkers can be categorized into chemically cleavable and enzymatically cleavable linkers based on the cleavage mode.Chemically cleaved linkers are cleaved based on the different environments of blood and cytoplasm, e.g., stilbene linkers remain stable in a neutral blood environment.Still, they will be cleaved to release cytotoxins in an acidic cytoplasm.Disulfide linkers depend on the difference in glutathione concentration inside and outside the cell and release cytotoxins through redox reactions.The most widely used of the enzyme cleavage linkers is the peptide linker, which utilizes lysosomal proteases highly expressed in tumor cells to enzymatically cleave the amide bonds of the linker to release cytotoxins (29).\n\nThe mode of antibody-payload coupling significantly impacts the biological activity, tolerance, and drug stability of ADCs.There are two types of coupling methods: targeted and non-targeted coupling.Early ADCs mainly by the amino group (-NH2) of lysine and the sulfhydryl group (-SH) of cysteine.The non-specific coupling relies on lysines, and typically, there are more than 80 lysines on the antibody, but only 20 or so sites suitable for coupling, resulting in a randomized reaction and, therefore, a lack of homogeneity in the product.",

A linker must be stable enough in systemic circulation and be able to rapidly and efficiently release the cytotoxic agent upon internalization of the ADC within cancer cells [50].

            "text": "Linkers that connect payloads to antibodies are another critical feature of ADCs [6,15,17,18,31]. They must be stable in circulation and able to release the drugs in active form in the targeted location. The intrinsic features of the linkers and the payloads determine the physicochemical properties of ADC metabolites in nearby cells. As a result, the linkers induce a \"bystander effect\" to kill neighboring cells [6,15,17,18,31]. They can be classified into non-cleavable (like the one in trastuzumab emtansine) and cleavable (like the one in brentuximab vedotin). Non-cleavable linkers remain attached to the drugs after proteolytic degradation of the antibody in lysosome, which with linkers and an amino acid or short peptide are released into the cytosol to exert their activities [162]. The most common example of a non-cleavable linker is the thioether linker. For cleavable linkers, they exploit the differences between bloodstream and cytoplasm of targeted tissues. They can be cleaved by certain specific proteases found in lysosomes, or by low pH (acidic environment), or by a reducing environment (high glutathione concentrations in cytoplasm) to release free drugs [163]. Peptide linkers, hydrazone, and disulfide are a typical type of cleavable linkers. \n\nConjugation strategy is another important aspect for ADCs. Linker-payload moieties are typically conjugated to antibodies via lysine or cysteine residues. Ideally, the conjugation process should maintain the integrity of antibodies and the activity of drugs, as well as produce homogeneous batches that remain stable during the storage and lyophilization process [17]. Because the IgG scaffold has over 80 lysine residues, about 20 of which are highly solvent-accessible [164], the conjugation process results in highly heterogenous mixtures.",

Preventing deconjugation in the circulation reduces off-target toxicity and increases delivery of the drug to the tumor. Both cleavable and noncleavable linkers have been explored, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. ADCs with linkers that are cleavable, via lysosomal proteases, acidic pH, or breakdown of disulfide bridges, run a higher risk of off-target toxicity, but may still be active for targets with poor internalization, whereas ADCs with noncleavable linkers must be internalized, so that the mAb can then undergo proteolytic degradation to release the warhead for action. 25 nother important consideration is the position of the linker on the mAb; control over the linker position enables site-specific conjugation of the warhead, allowing",

On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation to release the cytotoxic payload after an ADC has been internalized by the cell [21]. In the lysosomal compartment, the process of intracellular proteolytic degradation reduces the ADC to the level of amino acids. For this type of linker to be effective, the cytotoxic agent must maintain its activity, despite still being attached to part of the linker [22]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are considered to have improved therapeutic index because of their greater plasma stability, although new designs of cleavable linkers have significantly improved stability [23]. \n\nIt is clear that the disposition of a mAb is dependent upon several factors (Figure 1), and not just the therapeutic entity conjugated to it, in the case of an ADC. While mAbs trigger an effector function on their own, ADCs act more like prodrugs, and may or may not exert an anti-cancer effect until the SM drug is released from the mAb carrier. Thus, the pharmacology of mAbs and ADCs are complex. As a result, analytical and PK studies must be performed to assess the disposition of not just conjugated and released forms of ADCs, but also the effects of modifications on the mAbs after administration.",

Apart from the improved linker stabilities, more potent microtubule-targeting agents (such as auristatin and maytansinoids derivatives) were used as the cytotoxic payload to improve the general potency of ADC [1]. \n\nNonetheless, the second-generation ADC still utilizes non-specific site conjugation for the incorporation of antibodies, which generally produces ADC as heterogeneous mixtures with the drug to antibody ratio (DAR) varying from zero to eight. Furthermore, lower potency could be one of the problems due to competition from those unconjugated antibodies available in the product [90]. Additionally, off-target toxicity is still prevalent due to the non-differentiated triggers present in healthy tissue; for instance, the Val-Cit linker becomes unstable in the presence of carboxylesterase 1C (Ces 1C) enzyme, as reported in recent research on mouse models [7]. Similar to second generation ADC, the third generation ADC predominantly uses enzyme cleavable linker, albeit applying it in sidespecific conjugation to the antibody to improve the pharmacokinetics as well as its DAR [94]. \n\nAlthough with continuous and extensive efforts, the conventional ADC with internal trigger-linker is still plagued with relatively poor therapeutic index, which has limited the implementations in the pharmaceutical industry, where there were 23 out of 55 conventional ADCs that were terminated due to this very same reason [95].",

They are the most modifiable part of an ADC and influence its biophysical and functional properties such as stability, potency, efficacy, and toxicity. The two main purposes of linkers are to prevent the premature release of the cytotoxic drug in the blood circulation and to ensure its efficient release at the target site (Lu et al., 2016;Bargh et al., 2019). Depending on the release mechanisms of the payloads, linkers can be broadly classified into two classes: cleavable and noncleavable. Recent advances in linker chemistry, including formulations not currently used in clinical ADCs, such as biorthogonal, photo-responsive and Fe(II)-cleavable linkers, are discussed in Su et al., 2021.",

We and others (7) have hypothesized that uncleavable linker ADCs would be safer than ADCs with cleavable linkers. We tested this in a general way by using a rat model system in which the antibody was not targeted to any rat antigen, and found that, indeed, the uncleavable linker ADCs showed reduced toxicity compared with their cleavable counterparts. The faster decrease in the amount of cleavable linker ADC compared with the total antibody suggests that this is due to the release of free drug or linker-drug metabolite(s). In the context of safety, it is also important to note that there are differences in the metabolites that arise from cleavable and uncleavable linkers. For example, the reported metabolite of Ab-MCC-DM1 is lysine-MCC-DM1, a charged molecule that is relatively impermeant to cells (8). If released into the circulation, this molecule would presumably permeate normal tissues to a lesser extent than free DM1, for example. Thus, the increased safety of uncleavable linkers observed in this study could be a combination of both reduced drug release as well as differing properties of the metabolites.\n\nAlthough cleavable SPP-DM1 resulted in efficacy in vivo when conjugated to antibodies to all seven NHL targets, uncleavable linker MCC-DM1 ADCs were only effective when targeted to two of them, CD22 and CD79b. These data suggest that ADCs targeted to CD22 and CD79b would be effective with a wide range of linker-drugs. However, it remains possible that the other antigens we tested could also be effective targets for uncleavable linker ADCs because different antibodies to the same target can sometimes",

Another interesting observation was different metabolite profiles for different linker types, with the cleavable linkers releasing cytotoxic drug, and the non-cleavable linkers releasing the drug attached to an amino acid: e.g., maytansinoid ADCs with the non-cleavable linker MCC-DM1 produced only lysine-MCC-DM1 whereas ADCs with cleavable linkers SPP-DM1 and SPDB-DM4 produced multiple metabolites including lysine-SPP-DM1, DM1, S-methyl-DM1, S-methyl-DM1-sulfoxide and S-methyl-DM1-sulfone (for mAb-SPP-DM1), and lysine-SPDB-DM4, DM4, S-methyl-DM4, S-methyl-DM4-  sulfoxide and S-methyl-DM4-sulfone (for mAB-SPDB-DM4) (35). Some these metabolites could also enhance anti-tumor activity via bystander killing mechanisms where the cytotoxic agent released in one cell diffuses to neighboring cells and exerts its effect (34,35). As highlighted in these examples, during optimization of an ADC, the linker type needs to be carefully evaluated with regard to its stability, impact on catabolism, and how that affects its pharmacokinetics.",

Cleavable linkers release the drug from MAb by hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage where as non-cleavable linkers release drug by MAb degradation after internalization. Cleavable linkers are sub characterized into peptide (amide) linkers, hydrazone linkers, and disulphide linkers. Peptide linkers are usually accommodated with protease cleavage sites and are sensitive to proteases in the host cells. A valine-citrullinepeptide linker with protease cathepsin D cleavage site is one successful example used in clinically approved brentuximab vedotin ADC for treatment of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) [20]. \n\nHydrazone linkers are susceptible to acidic pH conditions in endosomes and lysosomes, and release the drug by hydrolysis. Disulphide linkers are susceptible to reductive environment in the tumor cells due to high levels of glutathione produced in tumor cells [21]. Non-cleavable linkers release drug after ADC complex degradation post internalization. The antibody portion of ADC gets degraded in lysosomal and endosomal compartments releasing a linker bound drug molecules [22]. It is considered that non-cleavable linkers contribute to high stability in blood stream, longer half-life, and reduced toxicity to ADCs [23,24].

Optimal linkers are stable in the circulation, which prevents premature payload release and systemic toxicities, but then rapidly cleaved once internalised in malignant cells, promoting efficient cell death [19,20]. There are two types of linkers, classified based on the payload release mechanism: cleavable and noncleavable [21]. Cleavable linkers are designed to be degraded intracellularly, in response to a change from the extracellular environment to the intracellular environment [20]. There are a variety of triggers for the degradation of cleavable linkers, including specific lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B (which cleaves Val-Cit and Val-Ala linkers coupled with PABC), acidic pH (which cleaves hydrazone), and glutathione (which cleaves disulfide bonds) [20]. The majority of currently approved ADCs use cleavable linkers, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and inotuzumab ozogamicin [6,21]. The advantages of cleavable linkers are the intracellular release of the payload and stability in the circulation, while disadvantages include potential premature cleavage in the peripheral circulation [20,[22][23][24]. \n\nIn contrast, non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds that are resistant to proteolysis [21]. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers rely on the near complete degradation of the antibody component by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases, which leaves the payload attached to the linker and an amino acid residue derived from the antibody [21].",

            "text": "Cancer remains the 2nd leading cause of death globally (reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/data/types.htm). Metastatic disease is the most common cause of cancerrelated mortality and remains a therapeutic challenge. For the past two decades, engineered monoclonal antibodies have provided a clinical approach to specifically target cancer cells, and are often combined with chemotherapy. The clinical advantage of these therapeutic antibodies comes from the fact that they target surface antigens that are expressed at equivalent or higher levels with higher or equivalent expression levels on tumor as compared to normal cells, but side effects associated with elimination of the normal cell population is clinically manageable. Anti-tumor efficacy can be achieved through downstream signaling events such as growth and proliferation inhibition initiating apoptosis [1] or by activating the patient's immune system, resulting in complement or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) [2]. \n\nSeveral therapeutic antibodies have been redeployed as the antibody component of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). While these antibodies primarily function as carriers of the drug to the cancer cells, some of them, like Trastuzumab in T-DM1 also act through ADCC. ADCs are composed of a humanized or chimeric antibody chemically linked to a cytotoxic drug (Fig. 1a) allowing the delivery of cytotoxic drug specifically to antigen-positive malignant cells [3]. The antibody's specificity and the local release of cytotoxic drug are the main parameters that provide increased anti-tumor efficacy and decreased systemic toxicity. Therefore, ADCs have a wider therapeutic window compared to traditional chemotherapy [4,5]. A chemical linker is used to attach the cytotoxic drug to the antibody, and the physicochemical properties of the linker largely determine the pharmacokinetics of an ADC [6,7]. Linkers are usually classified as \"cleavable\" and \"non-cleavable\". They are designed to be highly stable in the circulation to limit systemic toxicity and to be readily cleavable once the ADC reaches its intracellular destination to deliver the payload [8].",

            "text": "Yet, they still face the challenge of non-selective payload deconjugation in circulation due to the susceptibility of the linkers to plasma proteases for peptide-based linkers, to plasma reactive thiols for disulfide-based and maleimide-based linkers, or to serum esterases for alkyl carbamate linkers [27][28][29][30]. \n\nIn contrast to cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma but require the complete intracellular proteolytic catabolism of the ADCs to yield cytotoxic metabolites. These metabolites typically consist of the intact linker-payload attached to the conjugating amino acid residue from the antibodies, such as lysine-SMCC-DM1 for trastuzumab emtansine or cysteine-MC-MMAF for belantamab mafodotin [25]. These metabolites are often charged and exhibit low permeability through cell membranes [31]. Although ADCs employing non-cleavable linkers generally show a more favorable tolerability, potentially due to reduced off-target toxicity relating to free payload exposure, ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate a superior efficacy [32]. This enhanced efficacy is partially attributed to the bystander effect, which refers to the ability of the free payload to diffuse from intracellular sites of ADC catabolism and payload release to neighboring cells within the local tumor environment [33]. ADCs with lipophilic payloads and cleavable linkers, which make up more than 80% of the currently approved ADCs, are the preferred choice for the treatment of cancers associated with heterogeneous antigen expression or slow rates of antigen/ADC internalization [32]. Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues.",

            "text": "Non-cleavable linkers, including thioether and maleimidocaproyl (MC) types, offer significant advantages due to their stable chemical bonds, which prevent proteolytic cleavage and contribute to reduced off-target toxicity. These linkers enhance plasma stability, rendering them less susceptible to the chemical or enzymatic environment in vivo following the internalization of ADCs by target cells [144,145]. Once internalized, the antibody component of the ADCs is degraded within lysosomes, resulting in a complex of amino acids, linker, and cytotoxic agent. This mechanism ensures precise drug delivery to tumor cells, minimizing nonspecific drug release and reducing off-target effects [146]. Trastuzumab emtansine, the first ADC to utilize a non-cleavable linker, employs N-succinimidyl-4-(maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid (SMCC), a flexible dualreactive (amine/thiol) linker, to conjugate the cytotoxic agent DM1 (emtansine) to trastuzumab [147]. This ADC targets HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (HER2 + mBC) cells, and upon lysosomal degradation, releases lysine-MCC-DM1, leading to direct tumor cell killing [148]. Similarly, belantamab mafodotin, an approved ADC for R/R MM, utilizes the MC linker to attach cytotoxic agents to mAbs [149]. Furthermore, oxime-type and triazole-type linkers are now also employed in the design of non-cleavable linkers, such as in FS-1502, currently in phase III, which utilizes geranyl ketone pyrophosphate oxime to conjugate cytotoxins for HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2 + BC) [150]. Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy.",

Key advantages of non-cleavable linkers over their cleavable competitors are that non-cleavable linkers grant ADCs longer plasma half-lives, reduced off-target toxicity and-frequently-wider therapeutic windows [39]. Common types of non-cleavable linkers used in ADCs are those based on a maleimide-type structure such as the maleimidocaproyl (MC, found in AbbVie's depatuxizumab mafodotin [49]) and 4-maleimidomethyl cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (MCC, found in Kadcyla \u00ae [49]) linkers (Figure 3) [42]. The MC linker in particular has seen varied use, employed both alone as part of a non-cleavable ADC (e.g., AbbVie's depatuxizumab mafodotin [49]) or as a spacer unit separating a mAb and cleavable dipeptide linker sequence (e.g., Adcetris \u00ae [49]), and all marketed ADCs containing monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) or monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) warheads use this linker [42].",

            "text": "The primary advantages of ADCs are that they can act as prodrugs during systemic circulation and finally release the free drugs at the target tumor cells. The operation mechanism of successful ADCs is depicted as below (Figure 3). Relying on highly targeted tumor antigen recognition and effective internalization, ADCs recognize and bind to a specific tumor antigen on the cell surface, then internalization of ADCs is conducted through endocytosis. Once entering the tumor cells, the ADCs are transferred to the endosome or lysosome which digest the potential linkers or antibodies and actively release cytotoxic drugs. Therefore, linkers play a crucial role in releasing the potent drug at target tumor cells. Linkers are classified according to different categories in terms of the mechanism of drug release and their stability in circulation, including cleavable linkers and non-cleavable linkers [32,42]. Cleavable linkers rely on the physiological environment, such as there being high glutathione concentrations, low pH, and special protease, which could assist the linkers in enabling chemical or biochemical reactions by way of hydrolyzation or proteolysis [3,43]. Non-cleavable linkers despond on the monoclonal antibody degradation after ADCs' internalization within the lysosomes and endosomes to generate the metabolites containing the active cytotoxic drugs with or without a portion of the linkers. On account of different mechanism strategies, differences between the potential ADC metabolisms and the varying characteristics of cytotoxic drugs should be taken into consideration [44]. \n\nEach release strategy must account for many factors: the various activities of cytotoxic drugs, the characteristics of monoclonal antibodies, and the particular disease. The optimal linkers designed to conjugate the cytotoxic drugs to monoclonal antibodies must meet the particular requirements imposed by the factors described above.",

When the drug loading increased, both clearance and volume of distribution increased, but the exposure (AUC) of ADC decreased, reflecting the significant attribute of DAR to PK properties of ADC. \n\nThe systemic stability of the antibody\u2212drug linker is also crucial for delivery of an intact ADC to targetexpressing tumors. Linkers stable in circulation but readily processed in the target cell are necessary for both safety and potency of the delivered conjugate [48]. In general, linker should be stable enough in systemic circulation to deliver drug into tumor cells, but labile to release this fully active payload drug inside the tumor cells. Otherwise, the toxic drug could be released in the bloodstream, causing systemic toxicity. Polson et al. demonstrated that non-cleavable linker (e.g.  is more stable than cleavable linker (e.g. T-DM1) [49]. The non-cleavable linker may have slower deconjugation or lower clearance than cleavable linker and reduced systemic toxicity of ADC in rats presumably due to the reduced release of free drug or other toxic metabolites into the circulation [49]. This is because the cleavable linkers may release drug by lysosomal proteases without the degradation of the mAb component whereas non-cleavable linkers require catabolism of the mAb backbones to release the drug [9 and ref. therein]. In addition, the selection of attachment site can affect stability of cleavable antibody-drug conjugates, as demonstrated in the design of systemically stable cleavable auristatin-based conjugates, offering the means to overcome inherent linker instability by optimal attachment site [48]. \n\nInterestingly, Junutula et al. [50] recently reported a site-specific conjugation method called THIOMAB technology enabling near-uniform, low-level conjugation of cytotoxins (DAR=2) to antitumor antibodies, which displayed an increased tolerability or improved therapeutic index without compromising efficacy.",

She presented data on weight loss in mice administered an antibody conjugated to DM4 through either a cleavable or non-cleavable linker. The difference in the highest non-toxic dose was nearly 3-fold, suggesting that the non-cleavable linker could increase the safety margin for an ADC. However, she also presented data on antitumor activity that suggested the cleavable linker may be active against a broader array of tumor types compared to the non-cleavable linker. Taken together, the data for the two types of linkers suggests that a compromise between safety and activity may be required.\n\nThe impact of the cytotoxic element on the safety and efficacy of ADCs was Dr. Blanc's final topic. She discussed clinical data for ADCs that included either a DNA-binding drug or a maytansinoid. These ADCs had differences in the maximum tolerated dose of 20-to 80-fold. She noted that no conclusions can be drawn from the data on adverse events. Dr. Blanc emphasized that achieving a sufficient pharmacological index was critical to ADC development, and that ADCs that included both types of drug have had issues with toxicity or efficacy, e.g., gemtuzumab ozogamicin, AVE9633. In the case of AVE9633, there were no dose limiting toxicities at 260 mg/m 2 , but the ADC was not effective despite the fact that all the sites on tumor cells were saturated. Dr. Blanc reiterated the point also made by Dr. Lutz that diversity of mechanism of action is desirable because not all tumors respond to the same drug. Dr. Blanc concluded by noting that the challenge of ADC development is to find the right targets, especially regarding the safety profile and capacity to internalize the drug; select the right cytotoxic agent based on the indication; select the best antibody, likely based on an empirical approach; and find a linker that is adapted to the type of tumor and provides the desired safety profile.\n\nCalicheamicin antibodies and beyond were discussed by Hans-Peter Gerber (Pfizer BioTherapeutics).

            "text": "The structure of an ADC involves three major components, the mAb, the cytotoxic drug (payload) and a linker molecule [13,14]. The antibody binds to a specific antigen on the surface of cancer cells, followed by internalization of the conjugate by endocytosis and release of its cytotoxic payload after lysosomal degradation [13,14]. To ensure appropriate delivery of the drug to the target, it is important to ensure that the target is specific, thus expressed at high levels in tumor tissues and sparing as much as possible normal cells. High binding affinity and ability of the antigen-antibody complex to internalize after binding are also crucial steps, otherwise risk of toxicity from release to neighboring non-target cells increases [13,14]. Homogenous expression of the antigen within tumors as well as accessibility of the antigen from the bloodstream are important to maximize the availability of ADC to the target [13,14]. Immunogenicity of the antibody has been a limitation before due to mouse-derived antibodies; however development of humanized and fully human antibodies has minimized this concern [13]. \n\nCertain characteristics of the linker are also critical for the success of ADC-based therapy. Stability of the linker in the bloodstream enables the drug to be released only after binding to the target and avoid systemic toxicities. Depending on their intracellular stability and way of degradation, linkers are divided into cleavable and non-cleavable [13]. Cleavable linkers become unstable under the low pH, protease-enriched environment of lysosomes or high intracellular level of glutathione. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers are stable and solely depend on lysosomal degradation to release their payload [13,23]. \n\nThe payload is the cytotoxic drug which is responsible for the antitumor effect and reaches high concentrations in the tumor.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are therapeutic modalities composed of a target-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) connected via a chemical linker to a small molecule drug (payload) that has cell-killing (cytotoxic) activity. 1 The production of these therapeutic modalities relies on the chemical conjugation of a linker-payload (LP) to a specific natural or unnatural amino acid on the antibody. 2 Depending on the conjugation chemistry and site of LP attachment, the molecular structure of the ADC could be very complex and heterogeneous. 3 urthermore, the linker chemistry can be \"cleavable\" or \"noncleavable\". ADCs with cleavable linkers rely on protease cleavage, 4 acid hydrolysis 5 or other mechanisms to release the unmodified payload as active species, whereas ADCs with noncleavable linkers 6 rely on the degradation of antibody to release the active species. Both the cleavability as well as the sites of conjugation have a substantial effect on the analytical strategy for ADC characterization. \n\nConventional conjugation chemistries typically involve cysteine or lysine residues. Cysteine conjugation is well established, [7][8] and usually the hinge-region cysteines that are used for the formation of interchain disulfide bonds are targeted for conjugation. There are four interchain disulfide bonds in the IgG1 molecule and, after partial reduction, conjugation can occur randomly at any of these cysteine residue pairs ranging from zero LP additions to a maximum drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. Typically, these hinge-region cysteine-conjugated ADCs have an even-number distribution of LP moieties with an average DAR of approximately 4. Even with missing interchain disulfide bonds, the molecule is held together by noncovalent bonds.",

            "text": "The linker, tethering the cytotoxic payload to the mAb, is another crucial factor influencing ADCs therapeutic index and PK, as it determines plasma stability and release profile of the payload [2,4,25,32]. Generally, most ADC drugs incorporate two types of covalent linkers, cleavable and non-cleavable, which differ in their intracellular processing and systemic stability. While both have been shown to be safe in preclinical and clinical settings, cleavable linkers currently dominate the ADC landscape. For a comprehensive overview of the topic, the readers are advised to refer to [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nCleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the cancer TME over healthy tissues or systemic circulation [2,25,32,43,44]. They can be either chemically or enzymatically labile. Chemical linkers include hydrazone-or disulfide-bond-based linkers. The first type, used in commercially available Mylotarg \u00ae and Besponsa \u00ae , is sensitive to low pH and can be hydrolyzed within acidic early endosomes post-uptake. The second one can undergo reduction via intracellular thiols such as glutathione (GSH), whose levels are generally elevated in cancer cells (1-10 mmol/L) than in blood (5 \u00b5mol/L) [45]. These linker types generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload able to promote bystander killing [1,2,32]. Notably, acid-sensitive linkers are insufficiently stable and can occasionally be hydrolyzed in the plasma, leading to premature drug release and off-target toxicity. This liability is one of the causes leading to the voluntary Mylotarg \u00ae withdrawal by Pfizer from the US market in 2000, following the severe liver toxicity seen in patients [46][47][48]. The subsequent linker redesign and dosing schedule optimization have led to ADC reapproval in 2017 [46,49,50].",

For instance, cleavable pyrophosphate-diester linkers in site-specific, glucocorticoid-bearing ADCs outside of oncological setting [51]; \u03b2-galactosidase-cleavable linkers for trastuzumab-MMAE conjugates [52] and dual enzyme-cleavable linkers (e.g., 3-O-sulfo-\u03b2-galactose linker), subjects of sequential cleavage by distinct lysosomal enzymes (e.g., arylsulfatase A and \u03b2-galactosidase) have demonstrated encouraging findings [53]. In the construction of dual-drug ADCs, flexible linkers contribute in the successful co-delivery of payloads with synergistic cytotoxic mechanisms [54]. Recently, Spangler et al. described a novel linker format, named as Fe(II)-reactive 1,2,4-trioxolane (TRX), which reacts with labile ferrous iron in cancerous tissue to induce a more tumor-selective drug release [55]. This TRX-linker limits the on-target-off-tumor toxicity upon uptake by adjacent healthy cells. A first-inclass platinum (II)-based metal-organic linker (Lx) was designed to surpass conventional linkage pitfalls, such as premature release. In preclinical studies, Lx-based ADCs have shown favorable safety profile and potency [56]. At the end, additional linkers including non-covalent DNA linkers (e.g., based on complementary oligonucleotide hybridization and base-pairing) [57] as well as photo-cleavable linkers on UV light-controlled ADCs [58], are also under clinical testing. \n\nConjugation affects the ADC stoichiometry and homogeneity, crosslinking the cytotoxic drug-linker moiety to the antibody vehicle.",

In comparison with cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers were found to have improved stability in the bloodstream allowing ADCs with such linkers to have longer half-lives and pose a reduced risk from side effects while retaining the activity of the cytotoxic drug [127]. This knowledge was reflected in the clinical development of T-DM1, originally designed to have a valine-citrulline dipeptide linker but was instead produced with a non-cleavable thioether linker [128]. Despite the successful use of non-cleavable linkers, it is important to note that their dependence on lysosomal degradation means they can only be used in ADCs targeting antigens that undergo efficient intracellular internalization.\n\nOnce an optimal linker for a particular ADC is chosen, it is important to determine the ideal number of drugs to be conjugated to a mAb [i.e., the drug-antibody ratio (DAR)]. Because of potential linker instability and poor ADC internalization, several drugs are required to be linked to each mAb to achieve adequate cytotoxicity. On the other hand, excessive drug conjugation might result in increased clearance and/or immunogenicity as the ADC is more likely to aggregate and be recognized as a damaged, malformed or foreign protein [129]. In a study conducted by Hamblett et al. [130], the in vivo efficacy of ADCs containing four drugs per antibody was found to be equivalent to that of ADCs with eight drugs per mAb. Heavily modified ADCs (i.e., those with eight conjugated drugs) were associated with increased . . toxicity and underwent faster clearance from the circulation. Additionally, it was found that ADCs containing only two drugs per mAb had a much wider therapeutic window and therefore a higher maximum tolerated dose. The study consequently concluded that ADCs loaded with 2-4 drugs per mAb achieved the best balance between slow clearance and maximal potency [130].\n\nA critical aspect of linker function is the presence or absence of a phenomenon known as the by",

            "text": "In the design of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs), linkers play a pivotal role. They not only ensure the stable binding between the antibody and the active payload, preventing premature release of the payload, but also significantly influence the pharmacokinetics (PK), therapeutic index, and safety of the drug (Jain et al., 2015). Based on their structure and functionality, linkers can be categorized into cleavable and non-cleavable types. Cleavable linkers are sensitive to the intracellular environment and can be cleaved under specific conditions, such as the action of proteases or in low pH environments, leading to the release of cytotoxic molecules. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers require proteolytic degradation of the ADC's antibody portion to release the active payload (von Arx et al., 2023). \n\nT-DM1 is composed of the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab, a non-cleavable thioether linker N-maleimidomethyl cyclohexane-1carboxylate (MCC), and a potent microtubule-depolymerizing maytansinoid derivative, DM1 (55). Its drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) is 3.5 (56). \n\nT-Dxd is constructed by conjugating trastuzumab with a cleavable tetrapeptide linker maleimide glycine-glycinephenylalanine-glycine (GGFG) and the Topo I inhibitor exatecan (Yu et al., 2022). The enhanced therapeutic efficacy of T-Dxd may be attributed to its higher drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR: 7-8), the unique cleavable GGFG peptide linker, and the superior membrane permeability of the Dxd payload. These attributes confer DS-8201a with a stronger bystander effect against nontargeted cancer cells (Xu et al., 2019). The structure and mechanism regarding T-DM1, T-DXd are summarized in Figure 1.",

            "text": "These therapeutic effects have most recently been achieved, largely due to new ADC linker chemistries that stabilize the ADC in the bloodstream and maximize the tumorspecific delivery of the cytotoxic payload [11]. Linkers can be broadly classified as cleavable or non-cleavable, each with their own distinct mechanism of action [14]. Cleavable linkers, such as hydrazone, disulphide and peptide linkers, allow selective cleavage of the ADC within the tumor cell by exploiting environmental differences between healthy and malignant tissues, such as pH or the presence of specific enzymes [15]. Once the ADC is internalized by binding to its tumor-associated antigen, the linker can be cleaved to release the cytotoxic drug directly within the cancer cell. Depending on the payload drug chemistry, the drug can be cell-impermeant resulting in killing of only the targeted cell, or cell-permeant which enables killing of the surrounding, antigen-negative cells in a process called bystander killing. Similarly, a cleavable linker can be cleaved within the tumor microenvironment before cell internalization of the ADC, releasing the drug and also producing bystander killing [16]. Although bystander killing is undesirable for healthy cells, the process could allow eradication of antigennegative tumor cells that would otherwise not have been targeted by the ADC [17,18] and could also facilitate the maturation and activation of intratumoral immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), which are known to be activated by certain ADC payloads such as maytansines, aurostatins, and pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers [19][20][21]. Non-cleavable linkers such as thioether and maleimidocaproyl (MMC) linkers, are not susceptible to environmental or enzymatic cleavage and instead are only broken down to release the cytotoxic payload after tumor cell internalization and subsequent antibody degradation in the endosomes and lysosomes [14].",

Of note, the majority of these ADCs employ a cleavable linker to attach an antibody to a tubulin-targeted payload. Cleavable linkers are associated with a Bbystander effect,^whereby cleavage of the linker results in the release of a membrane-permeable, active toxin, which mediates killing of target-positive cells, but also induction of Bbystander^death in neighboring, nonantigen-expressing cells. PF-06263507 was selected to comprise a 5T4 antibody linked to MMAF via a noncleavable mc linker, as this particular construct showed an improved therapeutic potential compared with several other conjugates that used cleavable auristatins or other payloads [2,29]. A further reduction in off-target toxicity may be achieved with antibody-drug conjugates generated by drug conjugation to genetically encoded antibody sites (site-specific conjugation), which minimizes heterogeneity, increases stability, and enhances PK properties and overall efficacy of the immunoconjugates [30]. \n\nIn conclusion, the 5T4 ADC PF-06263507 was generally well tolerated at the estimated MTD of 4.34 mg/kg on a once-every-3-week schedule. At higher doses, ocular toxicities were dose-limiting. The RP2D for future studies of PF-06263507 in patients selected for 5T4 tumor expression is 4.34 mg/kg.",

            "text": "The linker is a crucial component in ADC design, facilitating the connection between the antibody and the cytotoxic payload through covalent coupling. While primarily serving to link the antibody and effector molecule, the linker plays a multifaceted role beyond mere connection. 51 Various properties of the linker, such as conjugation chemistry, length, and steric hindrance, directly impact the toxicity, specificity, stability, and efficacy of ADCs. 52 An optimal linker should exhibit stability in circulation (with a half-life approximately 10 times longer than that of the ADC) and efficiently release the cytotoxic payload within the tumor post-internalization. 53,54 Additionally, the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of the linker can influence payload coupling and reduce immunogenicity. \n\nResearchers have explored different types of linkers, which can be broadly classified into two categories: cleavable and noncleavable linkers. 51,55,56 Cleavable linkers have the ability to release a metabolite of the effector molecules from the ADC, allowing it to enter cells, either at the tumor site or within endosomes and lysosomes. These cleavable linkers are further divided into chemically cleavable linkers and enzymatically cleavable linkers, such as peptide-based linkers, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers, and phosphate-based linkers. 51 Notably, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers consist of \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers and \u03b2-galactosidase-sensitive linkers. Premature cleavage of these linkers can lead to the effector molecules harming normal cells. 57 On the other hand, noncleavable linkers, such as thioether linkers and maleimido caproyl linkers, require internalization of the ADC into cells and subsequent breakdown by lysosomes to release the effector molecules. ADCs with noncleavable linkers depend on complete lysosomal enzymatic degradation of the antibody for payload release, resulting in simultaneous dissociation of the linker. 58",

            "text": "Abs exhibit specific binding to epitopes as antigens. Thus, Abs can demonstrate a highly selective distribution to the cancer cells based on cancer antigens. Drug delivery into the brain across the membrane can be carried out via RMT using anti-receptor mAbs with cargos [57]. Similarly, mAbs, as vectors, particularly ADCs, can deliver payloads into cancer cells across the membrane. Structurally, canonical ADCs consist of mAbs and payloads through suitable linkers that are non-cleavable or cleavable (Figure 1). Several classes of cleavable linkers for ADCs have been developed [58]: (i) pH-sensitive cleavable linkers such as hydrazones, (ii) reductively cleavable linkers, (iii) enzymatically cleavable linkers such as cathepsin B-labile Val-citrulline (Cit) dipeptide, (iv) self-immolative linkers such as p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) (Figure 3) [59], and (v) other mechanistically cleavable linkers. Moreover, intriguingly, although the maleimidomethylcyclohexane-1carboxyl (MCC) linker is a non-cleavable linker, lysine-MCC-DM1 (MW1089.69) (Figure 4) was isolated by lysosomal enzymes and transferred from lysosomes to the cytoplasm via carrier-mediated transport using the lysosomal transporter SLC46A3 [23]. The steric hindrance of mAbs inhibits the activity expression of linked payloads. Thus, ADCs do not show cytotoxic activity under normal conditions. So far, 12 ADCs have been clinically approved by the FDA (Figure 5) (Table 1) [60]. All of them are developed for cancer therapy. Their payloads, such as microtubule inhibitors, mechanically show their anti-cancer activity in cancer cells. Thus, they must enter cancer cells across the membrane.",

            "text": "The use of EVCit or similar peptide linkers (e.g., EVA, DVCit, DVA) could serve as a simple but powerful solution to salvage many types of ADCs previously abandoned due to linker instability in mouse models. The high polarity of the EVCit linker could also help mitigate the aggregation and fast clearance issues associated with hydrophobic high-DAR ADCs 38 . In addition, EVCit linkers may be preferentially chosen over non-cleavable linkers in the future design of various ADCs. Non-cleavable linkers are designed to withstand proteolytic degradation in circulation. They have been successfully used for constructing potent ADCs along with MMAF 39 , monomethyl auristatin D (MMAD) 40 , and emtansine (DM1) 7,8 . However, the use of non-cleavable linkers reportedly attenuates or nullifies ADC potency of some payload molecules including doxorubicin 39 , monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) 34,39 , a hydrophilic auristatin derivative 41 , and a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer (PBD) 34 . Attenuation of ADC potency arises because non-cleavable linkers lack a defined cleavage mechanism; after intracellular protein degradation, final active metabolites retain the linker component. It has been demonstrated that this drawback can be circumvented in some cases by fine-tuning the chemical structures of the linker and payload 42,43 . However, the success of such efforts depends on the choice of the linker installation sites, conjugation modality, and payload. Indeed, as we have demonstrated in this and previous reports 29 , our branched linker technology requires both adequate spacers and cleavable mechanisms within the linker scaffold for maximal ADC potency. These components are critical to alleviate the structural congestion and to ensure rapid payload release in an active form from each linker arm. \n\nIn summary, our findings support the conclusion that the EVCit linker technology is a significant contribution to efforts for developing next-generation ADCs and other drug conjugates.",

Two crucial characteristics must be present for the Linker to be functional. Firstly, the linker must ensure the antibody and cytotoxic agent remain firmly bound, particularly in the plasma during circulation. An unstable linker may lead to premature delivery of the cytotoxic agent into the systemic circulation leading to unwanted toxicity and reduced therapeutic efficacy [32]. Secondly, the linker must be able to deliver the drug once at the tumour site [33].\n\nThere are two main sub-classes of linkers; cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers rely on factors in the tumour microenvironment to stimulate the breakdown and release of the ADC cytotoxic agent [34]. Mechanisms of linker cleavage are diverse; one such mechanism is driven by glutathione (highly represented in the cytoplasm compared to the extracellular space), which leads to the release of the cytotoxic agent via breakage of disulphide bonds [35,36]. A second type of mechanism involves linkers that cleave in environments with an acidic pH, such as hydrazone. This type of linker exploits the acidic pH found in endosomes and lysosomes. However, premature cleavage of these linkers into the circulation may lead to hepatotoxicity such as that described in gemtuzumab ozogamicin [32,37]. A third type of linker is those that are protease-dependent and are degraded by lysosomal proteases after recognition of a specific peptide sequence. These linkers allow the ADC to be remarkably stable within the plasma and thus avoid a premature release of the cytotoxic agent. Examples of this type of linker include enfortumab vedotin, ADC directed against nectin-4, and sacituzumab govitecan (SG) directed against the human trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) [38].\n\nCleavable linkers are less stable than non-cleavable linkers.

            "text": "Non-cleavable linkers have also proven to be very potent. The release mechanism is believed to occur via internalization of the ADC, followed by the degradation in the lysosome, resulting in the release of the drug while still attached to the linker. As such, when the payloads could maintain the antitumor effects even if being chemically modified, the non-cleavable linker is a good choice. \n\nEarly studies that described non-cleavable linkers were aimed at amine-to-thiol coupling. One advantage of these linkers is their greater stability in the circulation compared with cleavable linkers, which can potentially improve the therapeutic index because it may be better tolerated. Senter found that MMAF, conjugated to a MAb via a non-cleavable maleimidocaproyl linker (cAC10-L4-MMAF), was approximately as potent as when conjugated via a cleavable peptidic linker (cAC10-L1-MMAF) against a large panel of cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, cAC10-L4-MMAF was tolerated at a dose more than three times higher than the MTD of cAC10-L1-MMAF. The half-lives of such non-cleavable linkers in circulation are much longer than those of earlier-generation cleavable linkers (Figure 8). Nearly all animals that received single ADC injections at 2 mg antibody component/kg body weight were cured. When lowering the dose to 1 mg/kg, there were two of six and three of six animals cured by cAC10-L1-MMAF4 and cAC10-L4-MMAF4 ADCs, respectively [81,82]. \n\nThe structural formulas of cAC10-L1-MMAF and cAC10-L4-MMAF.

Choosing the preferred crosslinker is crucial not only to provide stability for the ADC but also to assure optimal release of the payload at the desired location [33]. Both the type of crosslinker and the location of conjugation can affect the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and clinical tolerance of the ADC. The mechanism for drug release is also dependent on the type of linker, be it cleavable or non-cleavable (Figure 4). Examples of cleavable crosslinkers include: acid-sensitive linkers, glutathione-sensitive linkers, lysosomal protease-sensitive linkers, and \u03b2-glucuronide linkers [46]. \n\nA non-cleavable crosslinker is said to offer greater plasma stability because of its nonreducible amino acid linker and thioether bond, which reduces non-specific drug release compared to ADCs with cleavable linkers [47]. With a non-cleavable ADC, the drug is dissociated from the antibody after internalization and lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody [33,48]. The first generation of FDA-approved ADCs employed an acidcleavable hydrazone linker, which makes use of the lower pH of endosomal and lysosomal compartments. The linker is stable in blood at neutral pH; once the ADC is internalized into acidic endosomes and lysosomes (pH = 4-6), the linker is cleaved. The release of the drug after 24 h at 37 \u2022 C is 97% at pH = 4.5, whereas only 6% was freed at pH = 7.4 [49]. The pHsensitive linkers include hydrazone linkers, disulfide linkers, and the CL2A linker. Disulfide linkers are cleavable by both pH and glutathione [50].",

            "text": "Specific site conjugation has significantly enhanced ADC development by allowing for precise control over drug linkage sites, thus improving product uniformity and therapeutic profile. While cysteine conjugation currently dominates among clinically approved ADCs, emerging strategies like AJICAP and AJICAP-M hold promise to further enhance the quality and versatility of ADCs [37]. The AJICAP and AJICAP-M technologies are prominent examples of advanced conjugation techniques. AJICAP utilizes maleimidebased chemistry to conjugate drugs to specific cysteine residues on antibodies. AJICAP-M expands this technology to accommodate a broader range of drugs and antibodies with varying specificities and affinities [38]. These conjugation methods offer significant advantages, including the enhanced reproducibility and uniformity of conjugates, reduced drug quantities required for conjugation with process optimization, improved purification, and a minimized risk of free drug in the final product [38,39]. AJICAP-M enables the conjugation of a wider array of drugs using the same technique, thereby facilitating payload diversification without significant procedural changes [38][39][40]. \n\nLinkers must maintain the ADC's stability in the bloodstream to ensure it reaches the cancer cell intact, but they must also be able to be easily cleaved upon internalization (cleavable linkers) to release the payload. Alternatively, non-cleavable linkers should form an innocuous element after releasing the payload, allowing it to still exert its therapeutic effect [6,22,23,[25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. Cleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the tumor microenvironment over healthy tissues or systemic circulation. They can be released from the antibody by changes in pH or by enzymes present in the intercellular and intracellular space. These types of linkers generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload capable of promoting bystander killing [31,[41][42][43][44][45].",

            "text": "Linker technology is an area in ADC drug development that has progressed rapidly in recent years. There are four main types of linkers currently in use ( 27): \n\n1. Acid labile-hydrazone linkers that are degraded in the acidic environment of lysosomes (pH ~5) (Unstable, acid-cleavable). 2. Disulfide-based linkers that are selectively cleaved in the intracellular milieu of the cytosol (Unstable, acid-cleavable). 3. Peptide linkers such as citrulline-valine that are highly stable in circulation and are degraded by lysosome proteases in the target cells. They are generally more stable than disulfides or hydrazones. 4. Non-cleavable thioether linkers that release the active cytotoxic drug after degradation of the antibody in the lysosomes. \n\nStable linkers such as peptide linkers have the advantage of extending the half-lives of cytotoxic drugs from hours to several days. Unstable linkers can reduce the half-lives of monoclonal antibodies, resulting in free antibody, which will competitively bind to the target antigen thereby reducing the efficacy of the ADC (29). Intermediate linker stability results in the most effective ADCs, since highly stable linkers result in decreased cytotoxic drug release following internalization of the ADC-antigen compound. For example, a serum-stable but intracellularly cleavable linker used to join epratuzumab to SN-38 used in B cell malignancies was shown to be 40-to 55-fold less potent than the more labile CL2A linker in in vitro studies (30). \n\nAntibody-drug conjugates linked by a disulfide linker (but not thioether bond) are capable of exerting a bystander effect on cells that express none or low levels of the target antigen. Hence ADCs can be engineered to exert a bystander effect by being linked by a disulfide bond or exert more precise killing of cells expressing the target antigen and sparing nearby normal cells by being linked by a thioether bond.",

            "text": "First, Dr. Zacholski introduced the landscape of ADCs in the United States and the pharmacology of ADCs. Currently, there are 13 FDAapproved ADCs: six ADCs are approved for solid tumor cancers, and seven are approved for hematologic malignancies (Table 2). ADCs have been on the US market for over a decade with the first antibody-drug conjugate, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, receiving FDA approval for acute myeloid leukemia in 2000; however, the majority of ADCs have been approved within the last five years. ADCs are comprised of three components (Fig. 1) which are integral to the overall efficacy and safety of the drug. The first component is a monoclonal antibody that is highly selective for a tumor-associated antigen that has low to no expression on other tissues. The second component is the drug conjugate also known as the payload, which is typically a conventional chemotherapy agent that causes cell death after cell internalization and payload release. Commonly used drug conjugates include anti-microtubule inhibitors, topoisomerase inhibitors, and DNA intercalating agents. These are extremely potent compounds that cannot be safely given outside of the ADC system. The last component is the linker, which attaches the monoclonal antibody and the drug conjugate together. The linker maintains the stability of the drug conjugate to the monoclonal antibody in the systemic circulation but it can efficiently release the payload within the target cell. Off-target, off-tumor effects or toxicities may occur as a result of linker degradation or instability in systemic circulation. Linkers can be cleavable or non-cleavable, which relates to the release mechanism. Cleavable linkers release their conjugate in a physiologically optimal environment such as low pH or high glutathione concentrations. Non-cleavable linkers form bonds with amino acid residues on monoclonal antibodies, and as a result, are more stable in the bloodstream. Non-cleavable linkers depend on lysosomal degradation of the monoclonal antibody in lysosomes.",

However, low levels of glutathione is also present within the circulation (2.8\u02d80.9 \u00b5M) [23]. Increasing levels of disulphide steric hindrance through the insertion of methyl groups has proportionally reduced their untimely release within the circulation [24]. Lorvotuzumab mertansine (IMGN901) is the most clinically advanced ADC employing a hindered disulphide linker. This anti-CD56 targeting ADC with a maytanisinoid (DM1) payload has shown efficacy against Merkel cell carcinoma in early phase trials and has been granted orphan status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [25].\n\nThe second class of ADC linking strategies involves the use of non-cleavable thioether linkers that require the post-internalisation degradation of the ADC complex within the lysosomal and endosomal compartments. This disintegration results in the release of a cytotoxic agent still attached with the linker and an amino acid from the original antibody attachment site [26]. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) has successfully used a non-cleavable linker to combine a maytansinoids toxic to the anti-HER2 trastuzumab antibody [27]. Non-cleavable linkers have improved stability in the bloodstream, longer half-lives, and hence reduced risk of off-target toxicity [28]. T-DM1, for example, has a serum stability of more than three days [29]. The success of each linking strategy is context-dependent, with advantages and disadvantages for each. The conjugation method used to combine the linker to exposed residues on the surface of antibody is another pivotal step in the manufacture of a successful ADC.",

Since it maintains the https://doi.org/10.4143/crt.2024.714 pISSN 1598-2998, eISSN 2005-9256 Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are a novel class of therapeutics that structurally are composed by an antibody directed to a tumor epitope connected via a linker to a cytotoxic payload, and that have shown significant antitumor activity across a range of malignancies including lung cancer. In this article we review the pharmacology and design of ADCs, as well as we describe the results of different studies evaluating ADCs in lung cancer directed to several targets including HER2, HER3, TROP2, MET, CEACAM5 and DLL3. \n\nADCs stability within the bloodstream, in plays a double role in both the toxicity and the activity profile of ADCs. Linker instability in this setting can lead to inappropriate or premature release of the cytotoxic payload and, in consequence, considerable toxicity. Conversely, an effective linker must also successfully release the cytotoxic payload once the ADC is internalized by the targeted cell; instead, the clinical activity of the ADC can be rather diminished [10]. \n\nLinkers are categorized into cleavable or non-cleavable according to their mechanism of payload release [11]: cleavable linkers degrade and release the cytotoxic payload on the basis of certain intracellular factors, such as acidity, glutathione reduction or the presence of lysosomal proteases leading to peptide cleavage [12,13]; on the other side, noncleavable linkers are formed by non-reducible bonds with the antibody amino-acid residues, leading to higher stability within the systemic circulation, and they release the payload through lysosomal-dependent degradation of the entire antibody-linker complex [14].",

In contrast, the ADCs with uncleavable linkers, MCC-DM1 and MC-MMAF, caused no significant hematologic effects compared with the control group, suggesting that they are much better tolerated than ADCs with cleavable linkers. All other clinical pathology variables (see Materials and Methods) in the ADC-dosed groups were no different from the vehicle-dosed control group.\n\nPharmacokinetics of cleavable and uncleavable linker ADCs. We hypothesized that the ADCs with uncleavable linkers, anti-CD22-MCC-DM1 and anti-CD22-MC-MMAF, were better tolerated because they released smaller amounts of free drug or small molecule metabolites. Another possible reason is that the uncleavable linker ADCs were cleared faster resulting in less exposure to the ADC and metabolites. To test these ideas, we performed pharmacokinetic assays on the four ADCs, measuring total antibody (which includes both the ADC and the unconjugated antibody) and drug-conjugated antibody. We found that the total antibody clearance was similar for both cleavable and uncleavable conjugates, suggesting that the type of linker has a minimal effect on the metabolism of the antibody (Fig. 5C and D). However, whereas the (drug-loaded) uncleavable linker conjugates cleared with similar kinetics as the total antibody, the cleavable linker conjugates lost drug more quickly, particularly SPP-DM1. This suggests that the cleavable linker ADCs release more free cytotoxic drug (",

Furthermore, it outlines the integral features of current and newly developed linkers. Linkers fall into one of two categories: cleavable or non-cleavable. They have an important role in maintaining the stability of the ADC to avoid premature release of the highly cytotoxic drug cargo in the circulation which leads to an array of systemic toxicities. The cytotoxic drug cargo has a pivotal role in exerting cell death and apoptosis upon reaching the tumor site. They are classed depending on their ability to damage DNA or inhibit tubulin polymerization. The features and application of the payloads used in ADC conjugation are delineated in this review.\n\nAmidst the success and excitement in the progress of ADC development lies other complexities and limitations, including rapid ADC clearance and drug resistance mechanisms that hinder these target specific missiles from exerting their optimal effects. Outlined in this review are some proposed strategies to overcome these limitations. Protein aggregation is one of the major hurdles in ADC development; management and control of aggregation can be challenging for ADCs. The review illustrates the common causes of aggregation and characterization techniques that can assist in detecting the presence of aggregates. Further investigation regarding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles of the proposed strategies as well as other mechanisms of resistance that tumor cells use to evade treatment is required.",

            "text": "The conjugating linkers in ADCs are generally classified into cleavable and non-cleavable ones, which behave quite differently in a biological system, and produce distinct in vivo forms of released toxin. Specifically, cleavable linkers (e.g., valine-citrulline dipeptide, hydrazine, and disulfide bridge) could be sensitive to cancer cell-specific intracellular properties, such as expression of certain protease, pH, and glutathione, and thus carrying the potential to achieve selective release of payloads [3]. By comparison, non-cleavable linkers contain no specific release mechanism and rely on intracellular proteolytic degradation following ADC internalization [3]. From an analytical perspective, while ADCs with cleavable linkers release free payload in a biological system, those with non-cleavable linkers usually release active payload-linker-amino acid moieties that are produced after the complete degradation of ADCs [3]; consequently, different analytes should be targeted. \n\nDue to the high complexity of ADCs, analysis of these compounds is uniquely challenging, especially in a biological system. For instance, both the small-molecule payloads and the protein portion need to be analyzed. In addition, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) is an important parameter describing the number of payloads conjugated to the antibody since the DAR species could dynamically change in vivo, which brings additional challenges for bioanalysis. Compared to other traditional methods, liquid chromatographyemass spectrometry (LC-MS) has the unique capability in ADC analysis, since it can broadly analyze small molecules, intact proteins, digested proteins, as well as specific domain of proteins with the molecule-level resolution. Therefore, LC-MS represents a highly versatile and valuable tool and has played an indispensable role in ADC characterization, both quantitatively and qualitatively. \n\nIn the initial development stage, especially for linker and payload discovery, LC-MS is highly valuable in providing structureactivity relationship information [4]. LC-MS has also been widely employed in characterization of the physicochemical properties of ADCs, which have profound effects on the safety and efficacy profile [5].",

            "text": "Diverse ADC properties are also impacted by linker chemistry, including specificity, stability, potency, and toxicity [21]. Depending on the methods of releasing the payload in cells, there are two types of linkers, including cleavable and non-cleavable [22]. The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity [23]. Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level [24]. The enzyme sensitive linkers are sensitive to the lysosomal protease that is generally overexpressed in cancer cells, enabling an accurate drug release in the cells after internalization [25]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability [26,27], and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]. For instance, Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has a cleavable enzymatic linker as opposed to trastuzuma",

Progressive linker technology led to the advancement of more efficacious and safer treatments. It offers neoteric as well as encouraging therapeutic strategies for treating cancer. ADCs selectively administer a medication by targeting antigens which are abundantly articulated on the membrane surface of tumor cells. Tumor-specific antigens are differently expressed in breast and ovarian cancers and can be utilized to direct ADCs. Compared to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, this approach enables optimal tumor targeting while minimizing systemic damage. A cleavable linker improves the ADCs because it allows the toxic payload to be distributed to nearby cells that do not express the target protein, operating on assorted tumors with dissimilar cell aggregation. Presently fifteen ADCs are being studied in breast and ovarian carcinoma preclinically, and assortment of few have already undergone promising early-phase clinical trial testing. Furthermore, Phase I and II studies are investigating a wide variety of ADCs, and preliminary findings are encouraging. An expanding sum of ADCs will probably become feasible therapeutic choices as solo agents or in conjunction with chemotherapeutic agents. This review accentuates the most recent preclinical findings, pharmacodynamics, and upcoming applications of ADCs in breast and ovarian carcinoma.",

ADCs have been used in many patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies. To date, twelve ADCs have received FDA approval, with numerous others in different clinical research stages [101,102]. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies (payloads) that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linkers have a key role in ADC outcomes because their characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and noncleavable, and both have been proven to be safe in preclinical and clinical trials. Cleavable linkers have been used in many ADCs, such as hydrazone linkers in gemtuzumab ozogamicin targeting CD33 for patients with AML, dipeptide (VC) MMAE linkers in brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) targeting CD30 for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, and SMCC linkers in trastuzumab emtansine targeting HER2 for HER2-positive breast cancers [101,102].\n\nThe cytotoxic drugs used as payloads are highly potent agents used to kill cancer cells. The microtubule inhibitors auristatins and maytansinoids are the drugs most frequently used for ADC development, in addition to the DNA synthesis inhibitors calicheamicin, doxorubicin and duocarmycins [101,103].\n\nAs the most important component of ADCs, the antibody can specifically identify and bind to a well-characterized tumor antigen receptor and deliver the payload to the tumor cell in the process. Currently, Nectin4, CD79b, CD22, CD33, HER2, CD30, FOLR1, and TROP2 are the antigens most often targeted by ADCs. In addition, over 70 other antigens are in different stages of clinical development [101,[103][104][105][106].",

For example, valine-citrulline (Val-Cit) and phenylalanine-lysine (Phe-Lys), which confer excellent stability and PK/PD profile to ADCs, have been used in many ADCs for preclinical and clinical evaluations. In addition, the ADCs with disulfide linkers take advantage of reduced glutathione with high intracellular concentrations to release free drug inside the cell. ADCs with reducible disulfide linkers generate uncharged metabolites that can diffuse into neighboring cells and elicit bystander killing, which is essential for killing heterogeneous tumors [51,53]. \n\nADCs with cleavable linkers have broader efficacy and faster rates of activating and releasing cytotoxic drugs for most cell lines. In contrast, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers can possibly provide increased plasma stability, greater therapeutic window, and reduced off-target toxicity. To reduce aggregation and improve the solubility of some ADCs, hydrophilic linkers such as \u03b2-glucuronide linker, Sulfo-SPDB, and Mal-PEG4-NHS were investigated [54,55]. In short, each type of linker has advantages and disadvantages, and each can be modified to achieve a fine balance between target efficacies and undesired toxicities [54].",

Among the advantages of using a linker are preventing premature drug release, improving the liberation of the active drug at the target, and facilitating stability in the production process. The most important aspect of the linker is its physicochemical properties, which allows defining two main different kinds of linker: \n\nCleavable linker: It is characteristic of breaking one of its chemical bonds that binds the two molecular entities. This kind of linker has been successful in elaborating ADCs due to its stability in the synthesis process and the blood circulation of the conjugate for a long time. It allows the releasing of the drug under some conditions at the surrounding of the target cell or tissue-like overexpression of enzyme or acidic environment (Lu et al., 2016;Ramos Tomillero, 2016;Kostova et al., 2021). \n\nNon-cleavable linker: Its principal function is to maintain links between biomolecule and drug. This feature represents a more significant advantage over cleavable linkers because it has more excellent stability in the plasma, thus increasing the specificity. The drug will not be released outside the target cells because the mAb degradation is carried out within the lysosome (McCombs and Owen, 2015;Ramos Tomillero, 2016;Kostova et al., 2021).",

Additionally, there is ongoing development of target antigens like c-Met (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor), a hepatocyte growth factor receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 3 (HER3), chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4), which plays a role in stabilizing early melanoma cells, and CD30, a tumor necrosis factor receptor and tumor marker, for various ADCS applications [125][126][127]. \n\nRegarding linkers, the current research and development landscape primarily focuses on 64 cleavable linkers and 11 non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers encompass various types, including acid cleavable, GSH cleavable, Fe(II) cleavable, cathepsin cleavable, glycosidase cleavable, phosphatase cleavable, and sulfatase cleavable. Non-cleavable linkers include SMCC linker and MD linker. Recently, photo-responsive cleavable and bioorthogonal cleavable linkers have emerged alongside non-cleavable Mal-PAB linkers. \n\nAmong the studied payloads, auristatin-based and mertansine-based payloads dominate the field. Auristatin-based payloads, including MMAE and MMAF, are extensively employed. Auristatin, derived from Dolastatin 10 isolated in Dolabella auricularia, exhibits potent proliferation inhibition across various cancer types. It induces apoptosis by disrupting tubulin assembly and inducing cell cycle arrest. Mertansine-based payloads like DM1 and DM4 possess remarkable cytostatic activity at specific concentrations. However, they have associated toxic side effects on the gastrointestinal tract and nerve cells due to a lack of target specificity. Research efforts are underway to enhance target specificity through ADC conjugation to mitigate these side effects [118,120].",

Its design is essential for achieving targeted delivery and maximizing therapeutic efficacy. An ideal linker should remain stable in systemic circulation to ensure that ADCs maintain a stable connection between the antibody and payload during systemic circulation, thereby minimizing premature drug release and reducing off-target toxicity. Upon entry into tumor cells, the linker should facilitate efficient and timely release of the payload, ensuring that cytotoxic effects are confined to the tumor microenvironment. Linkers with appropriate hydrophilic/lipophilic properties can bind to the characteristics of effective payloads and mitigate immune responses. Hydrophobic linkers coupled with hydrophobic payloads often promote the aggregation of ADC molecules. Aggregated ADCs may act as immunogenic substances, potentially triggering undesired immune responses during circulation in the bloodstream [119]. Additionally, the linker must not induce ADC aggregation, as this could impair antibody functionality, decrease stability, and affect pharmacokinetics [120].

There are currently more than 50 ADCs in active clinical development, and a further \u223c20 that have been discontinued. For this review, the reported toxicities of ADCs were analysed, and the mechanisms for their effects are explored in detail. Methods to reduce toxicities, including dosing strategies and drug design, are discussed. The toxicities reported for active and discontinued drugs are important to drive the rational design and improve the therapeutic index of ADCs of the future.",

            "text": "Endocytosis and trafficking of ADCs by tumor cells are typically sorted by endosomal/lysosomal pathways. Many studies reported the active release of drugs in lysosome either by cleavage of the linker or by antibody backbone degradation. This release of drugs largely depends on linker design and its chemistry. Generally, linkers must have high stability in circulation and the ability to release a drug in the targeted regions of tumor cells. Currently four different types of linkers in use are broadly divided into cleavable and noncleavable linkers. 54 Acid-labile hydrazine linkers, peptide linkers, and disulfide linkers are included in cleavable linkers. Acid-labile hydrazine linkers are cleaved in the lysosome compartment as a result of low pH. Unfortunately, acid labile hydrazine linkers have established off-target release in clinical examination. 55,56 Peptide linkers conceivably selective for cleavage in lysosome by activity of cathepsin B. 57 Unlike the hydrazine linker, peptide linkers show high serum stability and improved antitumor effects of ADC. Phe-Lys and Val-Cit are physiological stable peptide linkers but hydrolyze rapidly in the presence of enzymes. 58 The longer half-life of peptide linkers was recorded as compared to other cleavable linkers. 59 Disulfide linkers also raise questions of non-specific cytotoxicity and instability and off-target release of drugs. \n\nRecent advancement in linker technology has been covered by non-cleavable linkers. The chemical bond of non-cleavable linkers is highly stable in circulation and inside the cell. The release of an active potent drug inside a tumor cell is realized by degradation of antibodies in the lysosome. 57 More importantly, the recently approved ADC, trastuzumab-DM1 (Kadcycla), also utilized non-cleavable linkers to treat metastatic breast cancer. More effective studies were also reported in vivo analysis by using non-cleavable linkers compared to their disulfide counterpart. 60,61 he linker is one of the most vital components of ADCs that anchor cytotoxic drugs to an antibody.",

Most of the ADCs developed so far are for treating cancer, but there is enormous potential for using ADCs to treat other diseases. Currently, ten ADCs have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and more than 90 ADCs are under worldwide clinical development. Monoclonal antibodies have evolved from research tools to powerful therapeutics in the past 30 years. Tremendous strides have been made in antibody discovery, protein bioengineering, formulation, and delivery devices. This manuscript provides an overview of the biology, chemistry, and biophysical properties of each component of ADC design. This review summarizes the advances and challenges in the field to date, with an emphasis on antibody conjugation, linker-payload chemistry, novel payload classes, drug-antibody ratio (DAR), and product development. The review emphasizes the lessons learned in the development of oncology antibody conjugates and look towards future innovations enabling other therapeutic indications. The review discusses resistance mechanisms to ADCs, and give an opinion on future perspectives.",

This approach incorporates the antibody specificity and cell killing activity of chemically conjugated cytotoxic agents. Antibody in ADC structure acts as a targeting agent and a nanoscale carrier to deliver a therapeutic dose of cytotoxic cargo into desired tumor cells. Early ADCs encountered major obstacles including, low blood residency time, low penetration capacity to tumor microenvironment, low payload potency, immunogenicity, unusual off-target toxicity, drug resistance, and the lack of stable linkage in blood circulation. Although extensive studies have been conducted to overcome these issues, the ADCs based therapies are still far from having high-efficient clinical outcomes.

These two components are joined by a covalent linker, whose nature is critical to the efficacy and safety of the ADC. Enzyme-cleavable dipeptidic linkers have emerged as a particularly effective ADC linker type due to their ability to selectively release the payload in the lysosomes of target cells. However, these linkers have a number of drawbacks, including instability in rodent plasma and their inherently high hydrophobicity. Here we show that arylsulfate-containing ADC linkers are cleaved by lysosomal sulfatase enzymes to tracelessly release their payload, while circumventing the instability problems associated with dipeptide-linkers. When incorporated with trastuzumab and the highly potent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload, the arylsulfate-containing ADC 2 and ADC 3 were more cytotoxic than the non-cleavable ADC 4 against HER2-positive cells, while maintaining selectivity over HER2-negative cells. We propose that the stability, solubility and synthetic tractability of our arylsulfate linkers make them an attractive new motif for cleavable ADC linkers, with clear benefits over the widely used dipeptidic linkers.",

            "text": "Due to their resistance to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, these linkers enjoy the advantages of increased plasma stability, longer half-lives, and lower off-target toxicity than the cleavable counterpart, rendering them potentially superior for targeting homogenously expressed Ag [2,25,32,43,44]. Nonetheless, as most tumors display heterogenous Ag expression, constructs incorporating cleavable linkers with membranepermeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects, unlike the non-cleavable linker type [2,25,32,43,44]. \n\nAs the ADC field evolves dynamically and the payload arsenal rapidly expands, linker optimization has become crucial to maximizing the therapeutic index while improving biodistribution and PK profiles [1,6,25,32,43]. The currently explored strategies include (1) increasing the linker hydrophilicity (e.g., by incorporating negatively charged groups, like sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), phosphate, or pyrophosphate groups) to enhance systemic stability by reducing payload hydrophobicity-driven ADC aggregation and clearance [43,44]; (2) polyvalent or branched hydrophilic linkers, such as Fleximer TM linkers or PEG chain additions, that enable high DAR without compromising the ADC physicochemical properties and PK [6]; and (3) tandem or dual-cleavage linkers requiring successive cleavage by lysosomal enzymes, which ensure tumor specificity while increasing both stability and tolerability [6,25,32]. Other recently emerged cleavable linker classes with higher plasma stability include lysosomal protease-cleavable linkers such as sulfatase-and legumain-cleavable linkers [53,54], while more innovative, albeit still exploratory, linker technologies include photo-sensitive and biorthogonal cleavable linkers, which widen up the opportunity for nonendocytic ADCs [32,43].",

This new antibody-based molecular platform enables selective delivery of a potent cytotoxic payload to target cancer cells, resulting in improved efficacy, reduced systemic toxicity, and preferable pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) and biodistribution compared to traditional chemotherapy. Boosted by the successes of FDA-approved Adcetris\u00ae and Kadcyla\u00ae, this drug class has been rapidly growing along with about 60 ADCs currently in clinical trials. In this article, we briefly review molecular aspects of each component (the antibody, payload, and linker) of ADCs, and then mainly discuss traditional and new technologies of the conjugation and linker chemistries for successful construction of clinically effective ADCs. Current efforts in the conjugation and linker chemistries will provide greater insights into molecular design and strategies for clinically effective ADCs from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints. The development of site-specific conjugation methodologies for constructing homogeneous ADCs is an especially promising path to improving ADC design, which will open the way for novel cancer therapeutics.",

            "text": "tissues, yielding minimal off-target toxicity. 7While ADCs usually are directed toward antigens on the cancer cells, some ADCs target stromal components: the stroma-directed ADCs appear to confer long-lasting anticancer responses, as the tumor microenvironment is capable of evolution through mutations under selective pressure in a less efficient way. 8Most of the mAbs at the backbone of ADCs belong to the immunoglobulin G (IgG) class.Among these, IgG1 has been favored, due to its longer serum half-life, stronger complement fixation, and Fc\u03b3 receptors binding, resulting in better anticancer activity. 9,10hile broadly used, the use of large mAbs as backbone structures has recently been questioned due to their limited ability to penetrate tumor cells.Smaller format drug conjugates may offer a potential solution to yield better intra-tumor penetration, having better access to hidden epitopes otherwise inaccessible to larger antibodies.2][13] The linker molecule binds the mAb to the cytotoxic drug, having a key role in the definition of the stability of the drug.There are two main types of linkers in use: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers.Chemical or enzymatic triggers are employed by cleavable linkers to facilitate the targeted release of the cytotoxic payload at specific tumor sites.The stability of newly designed cleavable linkers in the bloodstream has been demonstrated. 4,14,15Non-cleavable linkers may also have plasma stability and therefore less off-target toxicity.Off-target toxicity can be observed when the payload is released in the plasma prior to delivery to the cancer cells. 16,17Linker molecules have been engineered nowadays through drug delivery optimization strategies as they are regulated by oxygen tension, pH, cancer-specific proteases, and lysosomal/vacuolar proteins that may be unique to the cancer cells and less likely to be expressed in non-cancer tissues.Moreover, ADCs having payloads with relatively high hydrophilicity could improve their pharmacokinetic parameters, and significantly decrease the nonspecific uptake and off-target toxicity.",

ADCs consist of three integral components: (1) an antibody targeting cancer cell-specific antigen, (2) a cytotoxic payload, and (3) a chemical linker that connects the drug and the antibody. Following the binding to cancer cell-surface antigen, ADC is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the payload is released by the degradation of the linker or the antibody in the endolysosomal compartment. In developing ADCs, therefore, factors such as target antigen biology, specificity of the antibody, cytotoxicity and mechanism of action of the payload drug, the stability and cleavage of the linker, and the sites of linker attachment all need to be carefully considered.",

The linker facilitates ADC stability in circulation until the ADC reaches the target cell and the payload is released. 143 There are two classes of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. 144 Cleavable linkers can be cleaved in response to certain environment factors to release the free drug into the cytosol. 145 This includes hydrazine linkers that are cleaved in response to the acidic environment of the endosome and lysosome, exhibited in gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Cleavable linkers can also be cleaved in the presence of proteases or reducing agents, such as cathepsin B or high levels of glutathione. 145 For non-internalizing ADCs, drug release relies on extracellular cleavage by glutathione and proteases that have been shed as a result of tumor cell death. 146 Noncleavable linkers are resistant to proteolytic degradation and rely on the full degradation of the antibody to release the attached linker-payload complex. This requires the payload to remain active, while linker bound. 144 Because of this, noncleavable linkers have been proposed as a strategy to overcome drug resistance as the linker-payload complex is no longer a substrate for MDR1. 147 Therefore, the proposed MOA of the ADC can be a determinant for linker choice. \n\nFor some ADCs, the chemical linker may also serve to balance the hydrophobicity between the mAb and payload, therefore reducing potential aggregation. In this regard, analyzing the bioanalytical significance of all components of an ADC is important for evaluating the safety and efficacy of the drug. ][150] In addition to selectively choosing a chemical linker, the method by which the payloads are conjugated to the antibody is essential in modulating the homogeneity and potency of the ADC. 151 Until recently, conventional methods relied upon lysine and interchain cysteines to conjugate cytotoxic molecules to the antibody.",

            "text": "ADCs are comprised of three primary components: a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to specific antigens on cancer cells, a linker that connects the antibody to a cytotoxic payload, and the payload itself. The monoclonal antibody enables selective targeting, which is crucial for minimizing off-target effects. The linker, which can be either cleavable or non-cleavable, ensures that the cytotoxic payload remains intact until the ADC reaches the targeted cancer cell. This stability prevents premature drug release, thereby reducing systemic toxicity. Upon reaching the cancer cell, the linker is cleaved to release the cytotoxic agent directly within the cell, maximizing the therapeutic impact of the payload [22,24,31,32] . \n\nThe mechanism of action of ADCs begins with the binding of the mAb to specific antigens expressed on the surface of cancer cells. This binding facilitates the internalization of the ADC through endocytosis, a process that is critical for subsequent drug release. Once inside the cell, the linker is cleaved -often by lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin B -releasing the cytotoxic payload directly into the intracellular environment [33,34] . The released drug can then disrupt vital cellular processes, such as microtubule dynamics or DNA replication, ultimately leading to apoptosis of the targeted cancer cell [35,36] . This mechanism is particularly advantageous over conventional chemotherapy, which lacks the specificity afforded by the targeting capabilities of ADCs [31] . The stability of the linker in ADCs is crucial for ensuring the payload is only released upon reaching the target cell, with cleavable linkers responding to specific intracellular conditions, such as pH changes or enzyme presence, and non-cleavable linkers requiring complete ADC degradation for drug release [5,33] . Additionally, the bystander effect enhances ADC efficacy by allowing the cytotoxic payload to impact neighboring tumor cells, which is particularly beneficial in heterogeneous tumors [29,36] .",

The first generation principally encompasses conventional chemotherapeutic agents, mouse-derived antibodies, and non-cleavable linkers, which are plagued by numerous limitations including unstable linkers, antibody aggregation, and heterogeneous agents. The second-generation ADCs leverage IgG1 isotype monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), cytotoxic payloads with increased potency, and optimized linkers, collectively enhancing the therapeutic index of these conjugates. The third generation features precisely characterized drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) of either 2 or 4 and deploys fully humanized antibodies to minimize immunogenicity [73]. Collectively, advancements in ADCs are highly contingent upon the iterative optimization of these components. However, due to the large molecular weight of ADC compared with other cytotoxic drugs, the efficiency of drug penetration remains a limitation [73]. Current research foci include the identification of novel targets, introduction of polyclonal antibodies, and the design of payloads with greater tumor-specific toxicity and enhanced stability. As for linkers, the emphasis is on developing ones that degrade selectively within neoplastic tissues, sparing normal cells.",

Non-cleavable linkers, e.g., the one in trastuzumab emtansine (Figure 3a), remain attached to the cytotoxic drug after proteolytic degradation of the antibody in the lysosome. The drug, with an attached linker and an amino acid or short proteolytic peptide to which the linker is conjugated, is released to the cytosol and exerts its cytotoxic activity [129,130]. Cleavable linkers, on the other hand, are cleaved by lysosomal enzymes, or by low pH or a reducing environment inside endosomes; the drug-attached fragment after cleavage is typically removed by self-immolative reaction, releasing the free cytotoxic payload [131]. Brentuximab vedotin, for example, has a cathepsin-cleavable linker (valine-citrulline linker), and MMAE is released by the self-immolative reaction of the remaining linker fragment [101]. \n\nRegardless of the type, the linker for ADC has to be highly stable in blood in order to minimize the release of highly cytotoxic free drugs into circulation and to maintain maximum amount of intact ADC molecules targeting cancer cells. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg\u2122) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa\u2122), for example, both have an acid-labile hydrazone linker, which is relatively stable at pH 7.4 but hydrolyzed with high efficiency in the acidic environment of lysosome [74]. However, the acid-labile hydrazone linker can be considerably less stable than some of the other types of cleavable linkers, which may contribute to the narrow therapeutic window and high toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin [132].",

            "text": "ADCs are composed of three integral components: a monoclonal antibody that selectively targets tumor antigens, a cytotoxic payload designed to disrupt DNA or tubulin within the targeted cancer cells, and a linker that covalently attaches the antibody to the payload. The efficacy of ADCs depends on the specificity and affinity of the antibody, the potency of the payload, and the stability of the linker in circulation, as well as its rapid release within the targeted cells (Figure 1). \n\nOver the years, various conjugation modalities and linker chemistries have been investigated to optimise ADC development. Early ADCs primarily relied on lysine-based or cysteine-based chemical conjugation methods, which resulted in heterogeneous products with variable drug-antibody ratios (DARs) (24,25). This heterogeneity often negatively impacted ADC efficacy and therapeutic windows, leading to failures in clinical trials. To overcome these issues, researchers have turned to alternative strategies, such as engineered cysteines, non-natural amino acids, and enzymatic conjugation using sortase or transglutaminase (26)(27)(28). These techniques enable the production of homogeneous ADCs with con trolled DARs that exhibit improve d pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes. Linker properties play a vital role in ADC stability, cytotoxicity, and pharmacokinetics. Traditionally, cleavable linkers have been used, which are designed to release payloads intracellularly in response to pH changes or the action of specific enzymes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers necessitate complete antibody degradation for payload release. Current research is focused on developing novel linkers that offer optimal stability, solubility, and release profiles, as well as site-specific conjugation methods (24,25). \n\nIn addition to linker design, the selection of appropriate target antigens and payloads is crucial to the potency of ADCs. An ideal target antigen is highly and uniformly expressed on tumor cells, but minimally expressed on healthy cells. However, antigen density does not always correlate well with ADC potency due to differences in internalisation rates.",

            "text": "Although peptide motifs represent the majority of cleavable linkers used in clinical-stage antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), the sequences are often sensitive to cleavage by extracellular enzymes, such as elastase, leading to systemic release of the cytotoxic payload. This action reduces the therapeutic index by causing off-target toxicities that can be dose-limiting. For example, a common side-effect of ADCs made using peptide-cleavable linkers is myelosuppression, including neutropenia. Only a few reports describe methods for optimizing peptide linkers to maintain efficient and potent tumor payload delivery while enhancing circulating stability. Herein, we address these critical limitations through the development of a tandem-cleavage linker strategy, where two sequential enzymatic cleavage events mediate payload release. We prepared dipeptides that are protected from degradation in the circulation by a sterically-encumbering glucuronide moiety. Upon ADC internalization and lysosomal degradation, the monosaccharide is removed and the exposed dipeptide is degraded, liberating the attached payload inside the target cell. We used CD79b-targeted monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugates as our model system, and compared the stability, efficacy, and tolerability of ADCs made with tandem-cleavage linkers to ADCs made using standard technology with the vedotin linker. The results\u2014where rat studies showed dramatically improved tolerability in the hematopoietic compartment\u2014highlight the role that linker stability plays in efficacy and tolerability, and offer a means of improving an ADC\u2019s therapeutic index for improved patient outcomes.",

            "text": "To attach a cytotoxic payload to a mAb, the use of a chemical linker is required. Linkers are comprised of functional groups, such as disulfides, hydrazones, and thioethers, to connect the mAb and SM drug, and control the release, distribution, and delivery of the cytotoxic agent to the target cell [6,19]. If a drug in released from the mAb carrier prior to delivery to the tumor, it can cause severe off-target toxicities by killing healthy cells. Because these linkers play an essential role in determining the PK and therapeutic index of an ADC, they should ideally be stable enough to allow the ADC to release the drug efficiently, but only at the targeted cells. Hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers, used as a single chain or arrangement, are particularly attractive as a conjugation linker to improve ADC solubility or reduce ADC aggregation [6,20]. Typically, linkers used in ADC formulations are classified as being either \"cleavable\" or \"non-cleavable\". Cleavable linkers respond to physiological stimuli, such as low pH or proteolytic cleavage, to release the cytotoxic drug from its ADC carrier [21]. In theory, these linkers are catalyzed in a tumor cells, due to the presence, or increased presence, of their catalyst, to allow for selective release of the cytotoxic agent [5,21]. An example of a cleavable linker is seen in brentuximab vedotin, where the monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) cytotoxic payload is released by protease activity (Adcetris, Settle Genetics, Seattle, WA, USA). On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation to release the cytotoxic payload after an ADC has been internalized by the cell [21]. In the lysosomal compartment, the process of intracellular proteolytic degradation reduces the ADC to the level of amino acids.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), monoclonal antibodies conjugated with highly potent drugs (payloads) through chemical linkers, are an emerging class of therapeutic agents for cancer chemotherapy. Their clinical success has been demonstrated by the 4 ADCs already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and more than 60 promising ADCs now in clinical trials. Further advancement of this novel molecular platform could potentially revolutionize current strategies and regimens for treating cancers. The linker structure and antibody-linker conjugation modality critically contribute to ADC homogeneity, circulation stability, pharmacokinetic profiles, tolerability, and overall treatment efficacy. Despite extensive efforts to improve these parameters, most ADC linkers used to date possess linear structures, and therefore accommodate only single payloads. The clinical potential of branched ADC linkers, enabling the installation of two payload molecules, remains unexplored because of the lack of efficient conjugation methods. In addition, according to a recent report, the stability of enzymatically cleavable linkers in mouse circulation is another crucial factor for the successful evaluation of ADCs in preclinical studies. In this review, I present my research group's effort to develop both branched linkers and efficient conjugation methods for constructing dual-loading ADCs with high homogeneity and enhanced potency.

All ADC's currently approved for therapy target tumor associated antigens not tumor specific antigens thus resulting in undesired toxicity that limits its therapeutic application. New generation ADC's should focus on disease-specific targets and will most likely require payload that do not interact with cells unless conjugated to an antibody. The major challengers in developing ADC's are identifying appropriate targets, designing chemically stable linkers and choosing an appropriately cytotoxic drug (Lin et al., 2018). All of these factors require extensive optimization to fully improve the efficacy and tolerability of ADC's thus understanding each of these components is key to developing new generation ADCs.",

            "text": "We examined seven potential ADC targets for the treatment of NHL, and in all cases, the cleavable-linker ADC SPP-DM1 was  effective in xenograft models. Our observation that SPP-DM1 ADCs have activity even when the antibodies to the targets are poorly internalized seems to be a general characteristic of cleavable-linker ADCs with membrane-permeable drugs. For example, CD21 is poorly internalized (Supplemental Fig. S1; Fig. 3), yet anti-CD21-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE was effective in our model. Similarly, others have shown an anti-CD20-AcBut-calicheamicin, which also recognizes a poorly internalized target (Fig. 3) and uses an acidcleavable linker, is effective in a xenograft model, whereas anti-CD20-amide-calicheamicin with an uncleavable linker is not (27). A likely mechanism that would explain why cleavable linkers are broadly effective and less sensitive to the biology, particularly the trafficking, of the target, is that following antibody binding, the linker is cleaved in the extracellular space and free drug subsequently permeates the cell to reach it's target. One line of evidence for this mechanism is shown in Supplemental Fig. S1; anti-CD21-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE is efficacious, but substitution of MMAF for MMAE on this conjugate results in an inactive ADC. MMAF is a more potent drug than MMAE, but is charged and relatively membrane-impermeable (7); thus, the efficacy of the MMAE conjugate in this experiment must be due to extracellular cleavage of the linker followed by cell permeation of the liberated drug. Although the data presented suggest that cleavable linkers are broadly active, our data also show that the cleavable linkers are a double-edged sword; such ADCs are more toxic in an acute setting. Still, cleavable-linker ADCs are likely to be the format of choice for many targets, particularly those with less internalization, lower copy number, or heterogeneous tumor expression (5).",

            "text": "The first step in linker design is choosing two functionalities that will allow for covalent bond formation between the antibody on one end and the payload on the other. Thus, the chemistry of the linker must be compatible with whichever conjugation site and drug are selected.\n\nAn important property of these two reactive ends is the extent to which their conjugated products are cleavable by lysosomal proteases, acidic pH, and reducing conditions. Ideally, both antibody-linker-payload linkages would be completely stable in the blood, and only efficiently cleaved after delivery to the target cell. One strategy to release the warhead within the cell is to use dipeptide linkers such as valine-citrulline, which are C-terminally cleaved by cathepsin B in the lysosome. 230,231 Brentuximab vedotin is an ADC in clinical use with such a linker. A second strategy is to incorporate pH-sensitive linkages that allow for drug release specifically in the lysosome; for example, the hydrazone group which was mentioned previously for its acid lability. 230 Although ADCs like gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin have shown efficacy using such a linker, it is now appreciated that hydrazone groups may release the payload prematurely to increase off-target toxicity. 61,230 Thirdly, disulfide linkers are cleaved much more efficiently in the reducing environment within cells, and therefore also allow for targeted drug release. Sterically masking the disulfide bond may help to decrease reduction by low concentrations of reductant in the serum. 232 In contrast to cleavable linkers, linkers containing thioethers and other noncleavable groups may be used to decrease the chances of unintended systemic drug exposure. 230 For trastuzumab emtansine, drug release from the antibody does not occur until the antibody has been proteolytically degraded. Because the metabolic product contains the payload linked to an antibody-derived amino acid, it is vital that the payload retain activity even with the added bulk and charge. In one comparison of linker types, it was found that ADCs containing a non-cleavable linker",

These linkers (i.e., MCC and MC, conjugates the payload to the antibody via thioether linkage) require complete degradation of the antibody within the lysosome to release the payload. Its stability in plasma is superior to cleavable linkers [4,76,77]. Hence, cytotoxic agents are not released at off target sites, and this reduces the likelihood of harm exhibited towards healthy cells. The lack of cell permeability of non-cleavable linkers minimizes its ability to exert the bystander effect [77]. The cytotoxic drug as a result accumulates within the tumor cell and does not escape by diffusion through the cell membrane. These linkers are employed for hematological tumors and cancers with high antigen expression. An example of an ADC conjugated to a non-cleavable linker is the trastuzumab-SMCC-DM1 structure. Succinimidyl-4-[N-maleimidomethyl] cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) (SMCC) is a reducible thioether linker and DM1 is the cytotoxic payload [1,59].\n\nThe impact of the bystander effect and the mechanism of action of an ADC is illustrated in Figure 2.  (3), it is then cleaved in the lysosome (4) and the payload is released (5).\n\nDepending on the class of payload (pink), it can either inhibit microtubules (5) or damage DNA (5). This free drug is designed to directly kill the antigen positive target cell, it can in some cases diffuse out of the target cell and subsequently kill the surrounding antigen negative cells causing a bystander effect.",

            "text": "Notably, the linker molecule is an essential factor related to ADC's specificity, stability, safety, and overall therapeutic index. Its ultimate role is to bridge the Ab with the cytotoxic drug with characteristics to avoid ADC's aggregation and early release of cytotoxic payloads in plasma, ensuring its release specifically at the targeted site [78]. They are developed to enhance their stability in the circulatory system for an extended period and effectively deliver the cytotoxic payload to the desired site. The linkers are generally divided into two categories named cleavable linkers that can release the cytotoxic payloads into the target cell's cytosol in the presence of specific environmental factors such as hydrazine linkers used in Gemtuzumab and ozogamicin release the cytotoxic drug in reaction to the acidic endosomes and lysosomes [79]. They can also be cleaved when reducing agents, and proteases are present, for example, the presence of cathepsin B presence or glutathione release in considerable amounts. Non-cleavable linkers rely on the breakdown of mAbs with the help of enzymatic hydrolysis activity of proteases to deliver the linker-payload complex component of ADC as they are invulnerable to proteolytic degradation. They are more often preferred than cleavable linkers due to the improved stability and additionally, they perform considerably better in vivo, with early payload release, according to studies and hence less likely to result in systemic toxicity because cleavage of both the mAb and the linker primarily takes place in the lysosome after internalization [80,81]. In RA-affected tissues, macrophages and neutrophils are present extensively leading to high protease activity. That means cleavable linkers specifically those sensitive to proteases (Valine-Citrulline peptide linker) or acidic environment (hydrazone) can be utilized for ADC synthesis.",

            "text": "Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cancer in women worldwide in terms of both incidence and mortality [1]. BC is a heterogeneous disease and can be classified based on hormone receptor (HR) expression and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression and/or gene amplification [2]. Although treatment advances have improved prognosis, the metastatic disease remains incurable. Consequently, selecting the optimal treatment sequence represents one of the most compelling challenges for medical oncologists, especially after the introduction of novel drugs into our therapeutic armamentarium. This approach enables the sequencing (across progressive lines of therapy) of several agents belonging to the same pharmacological class but with a different mechanism of action (MoA), providing the opportunity to prevent cross-resistance. Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) combine three components: an antigen-specific antibody (Ab) backbone (binding a tumor-associated antigen), a cytotoxic payload and a molecular linker combining Ab and cytotoxic elements [1]. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) incorporated in ADCs are commonly based on the IgG1 isotype due to a higher immunogenic property. Linkers determine the ADCs' pharmacokinetic (PK) activity and they are classified as either cleavable or non-cleavable. A non-cleavable linker exhibits more stability, and the activation of these ADCs is solely dependent on proteolytic degradation [3]. Conversely, a cleavable linker Biomedicines 2024, 12, 500 2 of 14 releases the payload in reaction to tumor-associated factors such as acid-pH, reductionoxidation conditions, and proteolytic enzymes activities. This enables the diffusion of the payload through neighbouring cells that do not express the target, resulting in the so-called bystander effect [4].",

            "text": "A typical ADC is composed of a mAb, a toxic payload, and a linker. A specific mAb forms the backbone of the ADC. It determines the specificity of the treatment and the location where the payload will be delivered. As such, an ideal antigenic target of a mAb needs to be (1) highly or uniquely expressed in cancer but not normal cells; \n\n(2) located on the surface of the cancer cells, which can be easily targeted by the circulating mAb; and (3) such antibody-antigen interaction can trigger endocytosis of the ADC [207]. Cell membrane proteins such as CD-33, CD-22, CD-30, CD-79b, and HER-2 with high preferential expression in malignant cells are commonly used in ADC development [211]. \n\nLinkers are another important component of ADCs, including both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers are designed to remove the payload from mAb through enzymatic deconjugation or the tumor microenvironment, such as in hypoxia or acidic conditions [216]. Specifically, hypoxia increases the expression of nitroreductase by several magnitudes in comparison to that in normoxic cells [217]. Taking advantage of this feature, Wang et al. recently developed the first hypoxia-sensitive ADC using a nitroimidazole-based linker, achieving a 27-fold cytotoxicity enhancement in hypoxic cancer cells [218]. Enzymes such as lysosomal protease, \u03b2-glucuronidase, sulfatase, and glutathione are broadly used for target-specific payload release. In contrast to cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers form stable bonds bridging mAb to payloads; such bonds are usually resistant to enzymatic degradation, and the payload was eventually released postdegradation of the mAb in the lysosomes of tumor cells [219]. One example of this class is the FDA-approved trastuzumab Emtansine (Kadcyla \u00ae ) used for HER2-positive breast cancer.",

This combination enables targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents to tumor site through recognizing target antigens by antibody while minimizing off-target effects on healthy tissues. Clinically, ADCs overcome the limitations of traditional chemotherapy, which lacks target specificity, and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies, providing higher efficacy and fewer toxicity anti-tumor biopharmaceuticals. ADCs have ushered in a new era of targeted cancer therapy, with 15 drugs currently approved for clinical use. Additionally, ADCs are being investigated as potential therapeutic candidates for autoimmune diseases, persistent bacterial infections, and other challenging indications. Despite their therapeutic benefits, the development and application of ADCs face significant challenges, including antibody immunogenicity, linker instability, and inadequate control over the release of cytotoxic agent. How can ADCs be designed to be safer and more efficient? What is the future development direction of ADCs? This review provides a comprehensive overview of ADCs, summarizing the structural and functional characteristics of the three core components, antibody, linker, and payload. Furthermore, we systematically assess the advancements and challenges associated with the 15 approved ADCs in cancer therapy, while also exploring the future directions and ongoing challenges. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of next-generation ADCs for wider clinical applications.",

            "text": "Antibody drug conjugates (ADC), as a further modification of monoclonal antibodies, deliver cytotoxic payload to targeted cells. It is a linker connecting a drug with an antibody. As an explosively expanding therapeutic field, ADCs have attracted huge attention among scientists and achieved significant progress during the recent decades. This is because antibody drug conjugates appeared to improve the specificity to target tumors while reducing the toxic side effects. Therefore, the advantages ADCs provided are appealing to both the academic and industrial field. Twelve ADC drugs have recently received FDA approval, while many more remain in the clinical development stage. This review article briefly summarizes the current applications of ADCs in cancer treatment, as well as the existing resistance mechanisms and potential future improvement to them in regard to its components. By providing more information in this field, this article is important in helping people understand antibody drug conjugates.",

            "text": "has been proteolytically degraded. Because the metabolic product contains the payload linked to an antibody-derived amino acid, it is vital that the payload retain activity even with the added bulk and charge. In one comparison of linker types, it was found that ADCs containing a non-cleavable linker had similar potency, but a higher therapeutic window, than the corresponding ADCs containing a protease-cleavable linker. 233 In addition to chemical reactivity, the physicochemical properties of the linker as a whole should also be considered. Since ADCs contain more hydrophobic surface area than naked antibodies, they are generally more prone to aggregation. 230 Additionally, hydrophobic drugs are more likely to be substrates for the transporter MDR1. 61 Therefore, polar linkers that contain solubilizing groups like sulfonate and PEG not only reduce ADC aggregation propensity, but also potentiate elimination of MDR1-expressing cells (assuming the polar functionality is retained in the final warhead). 234,235 As a result, properties like potency, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic index can all be improved by using charged or polar linkers. 236 Presence of charge in the final drug moiety also largely determines its ability to elicit the bystander effect, as only uncharged molecules efficiently cross lipid membranes to reach neighboring cells. Whereas S-methyl metabolites originating from disulfide linkers are uncharged and therefore enable bystander killing, amino acid-conjugated payloads with noncleavable linkers are charged and less likely to elicit these effects. 237,238 It should be noted that toxicity to neighboring cells can be favorable (in the case of targeting tumors with heterogenous antigen expression) or unfavorable (when the primary casualties are healthy cells).",

            "text": "The linker is pivotal in ensuring that the antibody and payload are bound whilst in the bloodstream, subsequently releasing the cytotoxic payload into the target cancer cells. Therefore, it is the component that determines the stability of an ADC, its pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Linkers can either be cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers can be degraded in certain environments, for example, based on pH levels, enzymatic activity (proteolysis), or glutathione levels [40]. This can be via endosomes or lysosomes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers require complete lysosomal degradation for the payload to be released. They have shown superior safety profile than ADCs with cleavable linkers, owing to their increased stability in the circulation and a longer half-life [40,41]. \n\nThe payload represents the final key component of the ADC by delivering the chemotherapeutic agent to the tumour cell following internalisation. These payloads include tubulin inhibitors, immunomodulators, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damaging agents [36,40,41]. ADCs primarily target positive or neutral charges on the tumour cells for selective cytotoxicity. Specific charges on the payload and linker are carefully engineered to influence targeting, delivery, and solubility [42]. Positively charged payloads tend to interact more effectively with the negatively charged phospholipid membranes of cancer cells, aiding in cellular uptake and internalisation. One example is the use of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a commonly used payload that is positively charged at physiological pH and has demonstrated strong cytotoxic activity in targeted cancer cells [36,43]. However, balancing the charge is vital, as highly charged molecules can result in off-target toxicity or rapid systemic clearance. Neutral or hydrophilic payloads are often favoured as they reduce off-target toxicity by limiting nonspecific interactions with other cells or proteins in the bloodstream. They can reduce aggregation of the ADC in the circulation and prevent rapid clearance or immune system activation [44].",

            "text": "An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is a novel class of pharmacological compounds that take advantage of the specificity of an mAb to focus the toxicity of the anti-cancer drug at the tumor site [98]. The pioneer of ADC was the scientist Paul Ehrlich, who almost 100 years ago suggested the possibility of creating an antibody-toxin complex to improve toxin specificity [99]. In 1983, the first article regarding the use of ADC for patients with advanced ovarian and colorectal cancer was published [100]. The recent approvals in the clinical management of several cancers prompted the discovery of a novel structure of ADC [101][102][103][104][105][106][107]. It has been highlighted that the linkers play an essential role in the control of the off-target toxicity [99]. Linkers must have the capability to maintain the cytotoxic molecule attached to the mAb until the achievement of the final target [99]. Linkers can be classified as noncleavable and cleavable. Noncleavable linkers provide the release of the cytotoxic payload after the degradation of the mAb by lysosomal enzymes. Cleavable linkers are the most employed; the cleavage of the linker can occur by a pH change, a redox potential, or by a specific lysosomal enzyme [99]. The cytotoxic payload may have a cytotoxicity action even at low concentrations and a high stability in lysosomes and in blood circulation. In addition, long half-life, low molecular weight, low immunogenicity, and the chemical structure are aspects to be considered during the design of a novel ADC [99]. The two major families of cytotoxic payloads are the microtubule-disrupting agents (auristatin and maytansinoids) and the DNA-damaging agents (calicheamicin, duocarmycin, and doxorubicin) [99]. Another fundamental decision is the choice of the TAA to be targeted, and hence the mAb to use.",

            "text": "The linker plays a major role in ADC design since it strongly impacts on the safety, potency and activity of the ADC. Most importantly, the linker is expected to remain stable in circulation to avoid premature detachment of the drug while allowing its release within the targeted cell. Two categories of linkers have been developed and can be distinguished based on their cleavability. Cleavable linkers are either sensitive to pH for hydrazone linkers, to glutathione or disulfide isomerase for disulfide linkers and to proteases such as cathepsin B for dipeptide bonds. Non-cleavable linkers rely on lysosomal degradation of the antibody moiety, thereby conserving at least one amino acid, most commonly lysine or cysteine, attached to the payload-linker complex. This approach improves the linkage stability since antibody digestion is required for payload release. While it is emphasized that the more stable the linker is, the less off-target toxicity it triggers, these technologies were often found to be too stringent to support anti-tumoral activity. Safety of ADCs remains a major challenge in their design and ontarget in addition to off-target toxicity is not only driven by the instability of the linker-payload. On-target toxicity is rather always driven by the mAb and its affinity/avidity to the target, together with the payloads' mechanism of action, again illustrating how important the match between tumor type, target antigen and ADC construction is recent interest in linker design improvement has led to the development of hydrophilic linkers to balance payload hydrophobicity [26][27][28][29]. Sulfonate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polysarcosine (PSAR) or more recently DNA-based linkers have significantly improved ADC stability and pharmacokinetics, leading to less toxic and more active ADCs [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37].",

            "text": "There are two types of linkers, cleavable and noncleavable. An appropriate linker is not only required to prevent degradation during systemic circulation but also to facilitate the quick and efficient release of the drug inside the tumor cells [35]. Non-cleavable linkers release their conjugated drug only after antibody degradation. For example, for Kadcyla which has a non-cleavable thioether linker, lysosomal membrane proteins are required to first transport the drug catabolite out of the lysosomal compartment & then exert a therapeutic effect [36]. Barok et al. [37] established that non-cleavable linkers are more susceptible to ADC resistance in tumor cells because any faulty linker degradation will not lead to functional drug release. \n\nBV is composed of protease-cleavable valine-citrulline peptide, where the MMAE does not depend on the degradation of the antibody backbone. Thus, it leads to much faster payload release after ADC internalization compared to a non-cleavable linker [38]. However, a faulty linker cleaving or non-cleaving can lead to an ineffective payload discharge. As per a study conducted by Caculitan et al. [39], valine-citrulline (Val-Cit) linker showed broad-spectrum specificity to different types of cathepsins, including cathepsin B, cathepsin L, cathepsin K, etc. [39]. Since only cathepsin B is postulated to be highly expressed in HL cells, and normal cells have other kinds of cathepsins, this phenomenon could be very deleterious as it would induce toxic side effects on other normal cells [40]. \n\nA defective linker thereby affects the cytotoxic drug delivery in many ways from the drug not reaching the target, to off-target toxicity and the drug not being able to dissociate from the mAb and the linker, thereby overall promoting resistance.

            "text": "The chemical linker in ADC conjoins cytotoxic payload to the antibody, stabilising the circulating ADC in the bloodstream upon administration. The functional group of linkers and the conjugation site determine the performance of ADCs in terms of circulating half-life, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profiles, and therapeutic window [14]. Disulfide, thioether, and hydrazone functional groups combine antibodies to the cytotoxic agent through intermolecular interactions. Currently, available linkers based on mechanisms of payload release are classified as cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers depend on the physiological environment in the systemic circulation, such as pH or proteases available to release cytotoxic payload from the carrier. For example, the acid-labile linker in Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin is cleaved under low pH conditions. In contrast, protease cleavable linker in Brentuximab Vedotin is cleaved by proteases such as Cathepsin-B and plasmin. The cleavage of disulfide linkers in mirvetuximab soravtansine depends on high glutathione concentrations [15]. Non-cleavable linkers form non-reducible covalent bonds with amino acids on the antibodies. Unlike cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are not affected by the physiological environment and are more stable in blood circulation [16]. In addition, these linkers depend on complete lysosomal degradation of the mAb for payload release, which necessitates an efficient internalisation process and optimal trafficking to lysosomes-for instance, thioether linker in T-DM1 [2]. This may be an advantage since it could lead to a lower risk of systemic toxicity.

As might be expected, the drug plays a major role in ADC activity and characteristics. What might be less intuitive is that the linker between the antibody and drug also is very important. An ideal linker should be stable in circulating blood, but allow rapid release of active free drug inside tumor cells. If a linker is not stable in blood, drug will be lost and ADC activity will be decreased. 15,26 Current linker formats that are being evaluated can be broadly categorized into two groups: cleavable linkers (acidlabile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers. Acid-labile linkers are designed to be stable at pH levels encountered in the blood, but become unstable and degrade when the low pH environment in lysosomes is encountered (e.g., gemtuzumab ozogamicin). Protease-cleavable linkers are also designed to be stable in blood/plasma, but rapidly release free drug inside lysosomes in cancer cells upon cleavage by lysosomal enzymes. They take advantage of the high levels of protease activity inside lysosomes and include a peptide sequence that is recognized and cleaved by these proteases, as occurs with a dipeptide Val-Cit linkage that is rapidly hydrolyzed by cathepsins (e.g., brentuximab vedotin).\n\nA third type of linker under consideration contains a disulfide linkage.

As exemplified in the successes of the FDA approved Adcetris \u00ae and Kadcyla \u00ae , this new therapeutic modality has huge potential for anti-cancer therapy and has attracted a great deal of attention from researchers and clinicians. Indeed, significant advances have been made in ADC technologies, with about 60 ADCs currently in clinical trials. This emerging molecular platform is expected to become mainstream in anti-cancer therapeutics in the near future. Despite its potential, further understanding biochemical, immunological, pharmacological, and molecular aspects of ADCs must be pursued to better design and develop effective ADCs. While choice of target antigens and payloads is important, antibody-payload conjugation methods and linker chemistry are also crucial elements for producing successful ADCs. In particular, instability of the linker and heterogeneity of the product (i.e., broad distribution of DARs) often negatively impacts ADC efficacy and therapeutic window, which often leads to difficulty or limitation in the optimization for clinical application and eventual failure in clinical trials. To overcome these problems, current efforts are directed toward developing novel stable linkers (with or without a payload release mechanism) and site-specific conjugation methods enabling construction of homogeneous ADCs. Further investigations along this line will provide greater insights and sophisticated strategies from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints, leading to innovative cancer therapeutics in the future.",

            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a powerful class of anticancer therapeutic agents that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. ADCs have been used in many patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies. To date, twelve ADCs have received FDA approval, with numerous others in different clinical research stages [101,102]. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies (payloads) that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linkers have a key role in ADC outcomes because their characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and noncleavable, and both have been proven to be safe in preclinical and clinical trials. Cleavable linkers have been used in many ADCs, such as hydrazone linkers in gemtuzumab ozogamicin targeting CD33 for patients with AML, dipeptide (VC) MMAE linkers in brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) targeting CD30 for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, and SMCC linkers in trastuzumab emtansine targeting HER2 for HER2-positive breast cancers [101,102]. \n\nThe cytotoxic drugs used as payloads are highly potent agents used to kill cancer cells. The microtubule inhibitors auristatins and maytansinoids are the drugs most frequently used for ADC development, in addition to the DNA synthesis inhibitors calicheamicin, doxorubicin and duocarmycins [101,103]. \n\nAs the most important component of ADCs, the antibody can specifically identify and bind to a well-characterized tumor antigen receptor and deliver the payload to the tumor cell in the process. Currently, Nectin4, CD79b, CD22, CD33, HER2, CD30, FOLR1, and TROP2 are the antigens most often targeted by ADCs.",

The nature of the linker and spacer determines important features of ADCs, such as hydrophobic or lipophilic properties of payload, nontarget payload delivery, systemic toxicity, and most importantly, bystander killing [44]. The success of second-generation ADCs, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-Dxd) is largely attributed to cleavable linker technology. However, there is no consensus on which linkers are more promising. Selection of a linker depends on a variety of factors, including the target indication, payload size and toxicity, and the desired pharmacokinetics of the ADC. There are two large categories of linkers currently in use, including cleavable and non-cleavable ones. Cleavable linkers are further subdivided into three categories: peptide linkers (lysosomal enzyme sensitive), such as valine-citrulline linker (or vc linker), disulfide linkers (sensitive to reducing agents like glutathione), and hydrazone linkers (acid-sensitive). \n\nCleavable linkers have two major advantages compared to the non-cleavable moiety; increased site-specific activation and bystander killing effect. The first FDA-approved ADC, Mylotarg \u00ae , used a hydrazine-based acid-cleavable linker. One of the most recently approved agents, Trodelvy \u00ae (sacituzumab govitecan), is using polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer technology.",

            "text": "he linker is one of the most vital components of ADCs that anchor cytotoxic drugs to an antibody. It must be stable in circulation and potent in effective drug release inside the cell to acquire maximal therapeutic windows. 62 Once internalization was confirmed, it should be cleavable by enzymatic action or acidic change in lysosomes. Four different types of linkers were reported including disulfide and peptide base and acid cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Three common strategies have been reported for a release of efficient drugs, ie, pH sensitivity, protease sensitivity, and glutathione sensitivity. The protease of lysosome recognizes a specific peptide sequence in the linker. 58 Lower pH of the endosome (5.0-6.0) and lysosome (4.8), as compared to cytosolic pH (7.4), elicits hydrolysis of a linker acid-labile group as in hydrazone. The third strategy of drug release exploits the higher ratio of intracellular glutathione as compared to plasma. 16 arly development of ADC was conducted by utilization of the hydrazine linker, but a major downfall in its productivity, it undergoes spontaneous cleavage compared to disulfide and peptide linkers, was reported. 63 These linkers are enzymatic in hydrolysis and can be selected for preferential expression, minimizing the spontaneous release of drugs in circulation. 56,64 Peptide linkers exhibit improved antitumor activity and stability, demonstrating bystander cytotoxicity. 65 ytotoxic drugs endure modification by disulfide reduction to methylation and have access to neighboring cells, resulting in lyses. 66 This mechanism is very fruitful to eradicate the tumor cells that do not express the targeted antigen within the tumor cell. 67,68 fficacy of antibody and linker technology can be elevated by making changes in binding sites to confer consistency of ADC. 69,70 Lyon et al 71 introduce a novel concept of maleimide linkers that catalyze their own thiosuccinimide ring hydrolysis, prevent drug loss, and develop a high stable ADC.",

Developments in linker technology have greatly increased the ability of ADCs to selectively deliver their payload to target cells while limiting their systemic effects [86]. Linkers generally fall into one of two categories: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers rely on differences in the blood microenvironment and intracellular tumor environment to induce linker degradation. These take three forms: hydrazone, disulfide and peptide linkers, each of which is cleaved or degraded through a different mechanism [86]. Hydrazone linkers are pH-sensitive and undergo acidic hydrolysis in the lysosomal microenvironment [86]. Disulfide linkers are degraded by thiols, which commonly accumulate in tumor cells, where they act as antioxidants [86,94]. Peptide linkers are degraded by pH-dependent proteases, which are only active in the lysosome [86]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers rely on the near-complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody to release the cytotoxic agent. This makes them entirely dependent on being endocytosed to release their drug product. However, this tradeoff provides enhanced stability while the ADC is in circulation, as well as improvements in the ADC half-life [86].",

            "text": "Highlighted in orange in Table 1, eleven antibody-based cancer therapies feature the delivery of a cytotoxic payload as their MOA. Serving as a carrier of cytotoxic payloads effectively bestows antibodies with the ability to deliver chemotherapy or radiotherapy selectively to cancer cells while sparing healthy cells and tissues. Among the FDA-approved cytotoxic payloads are a radioisotope, various small molecules, and a bacterial toxin. Attached to an antibody carrier, the ensuing hybrid molecules are referred to as radioimmunoconjugates, ADCs, and immunotoxins, respectively.\n\nWith only one radioimmunoconjugate and one immunotoxin currently available to cancer patients, the nine FDA-approved ADCs (Figure 3) clearly dominate this category and will continue to do so based on a rich clinical and preclinical pipeline [23]. This includes seven ADCs in pivotal clinical trials, six of which are investigated for the therapy of solid malignancies. Among these, tusamitamab ravtansine (NSCLC), mirvetuximab soravtansine (ovarian cancer), and tisotumab vedotin (cervical cancer) target new indications not covered by the nine FDA-approved ADCs [2]. All ADCs are composed of an antibody, a linker, and a small molecule payload, i.e. the drug. Although the antibody of first-generation ADCs is exclusively based on an IgG1 or IgG4 format, they differ widely with respect to the composition of linker and drug ( Figure 3). Linkers can be categorized as cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers permit release of the drug in endosomes and lysosomes following receptor-mediated endocytosis of the ADC. Release is triggered by acidic or reducing conditions or enzymatically. Non-cleavable linkers stay attached to the drug and to at least one amino acid of the antibody following its proteolysis in lysosomes. For example, the active drug of ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla \u00ae ) is the lysine-linker-drug",

The recent clinical data from both Adcetris (SGN-35) [76] and Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) [27] conclusively demonstrate that improvements in both clinical activity and patient safety can be achieved with antibody directed drug delivery. There are ongoing efforts to increase ADC selectivity and efficacy by further optimizing linkers, sites of MAb attachment and cytotoxic payloads [77][78][79]. The selection of suitable ADC targets remains a critical challenge to ADC design. Characteristics of the ADC target such as copy number, heterogeneity and specificity of expression, internalization rate, and intracellular trafficking can be used to guide the selection of linker (cleavable or non-cleavable) and the potency and characteristics of the drug released (cell permeable or impermeable). However, further insight into the optimal design characteristics of effective ADCs will be best gained as additional clinical data become available. There are currently over 25 ADCs in clinical development and evolving clinical data from these trials will provide critical insight into the design of next generation ADCs.",

Several types of cleavable (labile) or non-cleavable (stable) linkers, for example, disulfide linkers and acid-and peptidase-labile linkers, have been developed [31] . The conjugation technologies have advanced to a point where both the site and stoichiometry of drug attachment to the carrier antibody can be controlled. In the near future, the research focus of the area will be to identify even more potent payloads and to develop better conjugation strategies including further improvement in linker design and conjugation chemistry and efficiency.

            "text": "Synthesis of ApDCs depends on several vital research areas including the choice of an appropriate antigen target, discovery of novel, highly potent cytotoxic drugs and conjugation technology [87,88]. Importantly, the major approach for the synthesis of ApDCs is to utilize appropriate chemical linkers as a bridge to connect the aptamers and cytotoxic payloads through covalent bonds, which are key components for ApDCs to control the release of payloads to blood cancer cells, expressing the target antigen rather than to healthy cells, as shown in Figure 1B [89]. In brief, linkers require high stability in the circulation so that the payload stays connected to the aptamers when it is distributed to the tissue. Once ApDCs are precisely internalized and transported into cellular organelles of cancer cells, the linkers release the attached cytotoxic drug through the dissociation properties. Upon release, the cytotoxic drug can interfere with various cellular mechanisms, eventually leading to cell death. \n\nSince the development of ADC drug construction, different types of linkers have been well established for the conjugation of biomacromolecules and chemical compounds. Additionally, given their dissociation properties, linkers can be divided into two categories, cleavable linkers and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers are designed to be easily cleaved enzymatically (e.g., cathepsin B, etc.) or chemically (e.g., acid-sensitive linkers and reduction-sensitive linkers), leading to the release of their payload in targeted cells [90]. Among them, cathepsin B cleavable linkers/peptide linkers are commonly used in ADCs for various payloads, including MMAE, MMAF, pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBD) and doxorubicins (DOX) [91,92].",

To exert a maximum therapeutic effect on cancerous cells, we have conjugated two different payloads to different amino acids, cysteines (cys) and lysines (lys), on trastuzumab, which is a humanised anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody. First, trastuzumab was conjugated with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), an antimitotic agent, through a cleavable linker (Val-Cit) to prepare ADC (Tmab-VcMMAE). Then, the ADC (Tmab-VcMMAE) was conjugated with a second antimitotic agent, Mertansine (DM1), via a non-cleavable linker Succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) to form a dual conjugate (Tmab-VcMMAE-SMCC-DM1). Our results indicated that the dual-payload conjugate, Tmab-VcMMAE-SMCC-DM1, had a synergistic and superior cytotoxic effect compared to trastuzumab alone. Ultimately employing a dual conjugation approach has the potential to overcome treatment-resistance and tumour recurrences and could pave the way to employ other payloads to construct dual (or multiple) payload complexes.",

            "text": "Notably, the TTL has a broad substrate tolerance and thus allows the incorporation of a variety of bioorthogonal handles [111] for subsequent site-specific toxin-conjugation. \n\nApart from these well-established methods several more site-specific conjugation concepts, like pi-clamp [112] or CD38 domain-tag [113], and conjugation to native lysines by using affinity peptides, e.g., as guides [114,115] have been published in the context of ADC generation and are comprehensively covered elsewhere [60,116]. Furthermore, very recently a strategy combining two site-specific conjugation methods was described for the attachment of two distinct cytotoxic drugs [117]. \n\nNot only the conjugation method but also the linker itself is an integral and customizable element of ADCs. Apart from physically linking drug and antibody it also has the potential to contribute to characteristics like linkage stability, drug release and aggregation behavior [118]. Currently approved ADCs utilize either non-cleavable, chemically cleavable or cathepsin-cleavable linkers for intracellular liberation of cytotoxins. Non-cleavable linkers liberate the attached drug upon proteasomal degradation of the internalized antibody [119]. In this case the drug remains attached to the conjugated amino acid which can affect its bio-distribution and potency [120]. Cleavable linkers on the contrary allow triggered release. Currently approved ADCs are designed to exploit the distinct environment in lysosomes to trigger drug release. For example, pH sensitive or thiol-containing reduction-labile linker elements, found in gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg [121]) and inotuzmab ozogamicin (Besponsa [122]), exploit the acidic and reductive milieu in lysosomes.",

            "text": "Targeted therapy using ADCs is currently being developed based on the principle to increase tumor drug delivery simultaneously reducing off-target toxicities. ADCs are generally comprised of a cancertargeting mAb linked to a cytotoxic payload to elicit an antitumor effect (60)(61). In the context of stromal targeting ADCs, the antibody must be specific for the target cell surface antigen that is selectively expressed in the TME. The linkers are designed to be either cleavable or noncleavable depending on the chemical design. Following antigen binding and internalization noncleavable linkers require lysosomal trafficking and subsequent degradation for the payload to be released and permeate into the cell where it can then perform its cytotoxic function (62). The drug-antibody ratio (DAR) needs cautious consideration during the development of ADCs, as a higher cytotoxic payload per unit of the antibody may lead to greater antitumor efficacy but may also increase adverse toxicity. Attaching large linker-drugs can make the ADC unstable with different pharmacokinetic properties, attenuated half-life, increased plasma clearance and systemic toxicity. The rapid clearance of high DAR species will also result in fewer ADC molecules reaching the target of interest and reduce the efficacy. The payload should be highly cytotoxic to be able to kill tumor cells at the intracellular concentrations attainable following tissue distribution. Usually an average of 3 to 4 payloads per antibody molecule is achievable without compromising the biophysical and pharmacokinetic properties (60). mAbs have proven activity in cancer treatment, with recently approved drugs like trastuzumab deruxtecan, sacituzumab govitecan, and enfortumab vedotin targeting HER2, Trop2, and Nectin4 respectively, providing meaningful clinical benefit in different cancer indications. Current advancements implement numerous ADCs into preclinical and clinical studies in both solid tumor and in hematologic cancers (63,64).",

            "text": "ADCs are composed of an antibody targeting an antigen associated with malignancy, combined through a linker with a cytotoxic moiety, allowing for a more specific delivery of chemotherapy. The ADC binds a receptor on the target cell and is then internalized into the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the antibody and cytotoxic agent are separated in the lysosome, where the linker is cleaved, releasing the payload. Targeting cells via antibodies aims at specifically delivering the payload while minimizing toxicity, enabling the use of chemotherapy as much as 100 to 1000 times more concentrated than standard cytotoxic chemotherapy [1]. \n\nThe antibody selected for use in ADCs is often immunoglobulin G (IgG), most often the IgG1 subclass. Antigen targets are ideally ubiquitous in malignant cells but are rarely found in normal cells, to limit off-target toxicity [2]. Antibodies are connected to payloads through novel linkers that vary in properties, in ways that can be manipulated for therapeutic use. Linkers can be non-cleavable, requiring additional processing to release their payload, or cleavable, in the event of tumor-specific factors such as a change in pH or enzyme. Cleavable linkers provide the advantage of a more efficient delivery of the chemotherapy payload and may be more likely to impact neighboring antigen-negative cells, which may or may not be desirable. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers may deliver their payload with more specificity but may also need additional processing such as lysosomal degradation, which can impact the payload [3]. The chemotherapy agents used are typically more potent than can be tolerated in a conventional delivery. Agents of choice include auristatins, calicheamicins, maytansinoids, and camptothecin analogues [2]. \n\nADCs can also be categorized by their drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), a measure of the number of chemotherapy moieties conjugated to each antibody. In theory, ADCs with a higher DAR would be expected to be more potent, although in some situations drugs with higher DARs were found to have an increased hepatic clearance that may limit their efficacy [4,5].",

            "text": "Antibodyedrug conjugates (ADCs) consist of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) conjugated with cytotoxic drugs through linkers. The mAbs carry ADCs to target cells by affinity binding to antigens expressed on cell surface, and subsequently become internalized, undergo degradation followed by the release of toxic payloads within target cells. This design confers increased specificity and reduced toxicity compared to conventional pharmaceutics such as genotoxic drugs 1e3 .\n\nAs a novel class of therapeutics, ADCs are embracing everevolving technologies in linker and payload chemistry. Specifically, linkers can be classified as cleavable chemical spacers involving hydrozone, disulfide and di/tri/tetra-peptide bonds and noncleavable spacers such as thioether and pyrophosphate diester 4 . The differences in chemical stability conferred by linkers lead to varied catabolic profiles and hence ADC therapeutic efficacies in target cells or organelles. Moreover, highly potent cytotoxic agents with defined mechanisms of action such as maytansinoid and auristatin with microtubule inhibitory functions or DNA double-strand breakers, cross-linkers and alkylators are often selected as payloads 5 . In addition, the site of conjugation, lysine or cysteine residues, also affects ADC catabolic and pharmacokinetic liabilities 6 . Collectively, the plethora of choices offered by conjugation site, linkers and payloads confers versatile combinations, leading to currently over 100 ADCs in clinical trials and numerous ADCs as preclinical candidates 7,8 . Therefore, the concomitant task of druggability screening and quality assessment for ADC candidates becomes challenging, necessitating an approach that efficiently and comprehensively evaluates ADC attributes before proceeding to expensive and time-consuming in vivo experiments 8,9 . Nevertheless, conventional in vitro assaying techniques such as cytotoxicity assay merely provides a final functional readout while lacking a comprehensive evaluation of how each step ranging from antigen binding, internalization, trafficking to lysosomal proteolysismediated payload release functions and affects payload release and the ensuing cell killing effect 4 .

The ideal linker should maintain stability in the bloodstream since the ADC should not release the cytotoxic drug before reaching its target and thereby cause off-target toxicity. In addition, the linker should readily release the drug after internalization [27]. From the viewpoint of intracellular stability and manner of degradation, linkers are divided as non-cleavable and cleavable [23]. Non-cleavable linkers are generally very stable in body fluids and solely depend on lysosomal degradation to release their payload. In contrast, cleavable linkers have instability under the low pH, protease-enriched environment of lysosomes, or high level of intracellular glutathione [15]. For this reason, cytotoxic substances affect nearby cells regardless of target antigen expression [18].",

There is probably no universal conjugate-linkage strategy optimal for all antibody-drug conjugates. It is necessary that each pair of antibody/drug be optimized to obtain the best therapeutic outcome. New linkers can be designed to improve water solubility (e.g. PEGylation) and tumor selectivity (e.g. enzymatic-cleavable, photocleavable, proton cleavable) [72]. This will substantially reduce the heterogeneity of ADCs and toxicity. Based on current development of the ADCs using DNA-damaging agents, we summarize that the ideal properties for a linker are as follows: (1) stable during circulation and (2) cleavable after binding to the target or internalization.",

            "text": "The linker is a very essential part of protein conjugation, especially for ADCs. Linker chemistry can be tuned to impart adequate stability for protein drugs [150]. As mentioned above, PEGylation is an example of using hydrophilic PEG linkers to improve drug efficacy [151]. There are many factors to consider when choosing linkers for ADCs. Nevertheless, one of the most important of them is the stability of the linker throughout its presence in the plasma, while it must break down as soon as it enters the target cell (in the form of a conjugate with ADCs) and leads to the activation of the released anti-cancer drugs [152]. There are cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. The cleavable linkers are cleaved by chemical or biochemical changes in the environment such as acidic changes for hydrozone linkers and glutathione or high pH values for disulfide linkers. Some other cleavable linkers contain enzymatic digestion sites and are sensitive to the enzymes inside the vesicle such as valine-citrulline di-peptides for cathepsin B enzyme. On the other hand, the non-cleavable linkers depend on the complete digestion of the antibody after entering the vesicle [153]. \n\nAmong the important reasons that led to the removal of Mylotarg from the marketing list in 2010 were items such as the instability of the hydrazine linker and its payload release [154,155]. More recently, Trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) 1 with a non-cleavable linker is the first generation of ADCs approved for the treatment of HER2 (human epider-mal growth factor receptor 2)-positive breast cancer. Second-generation ADCs targeting HER2, trastuzumab duocarmazine (SYD985), was characterized to supersede T-DM1 by overcoming all resistance using a cleavable linker and a more potent payload, duocarmycin (DUBA) via different conjugation chemistry.",

ADC development is a rapidly expanding field of research, with over 80 ADCs currently in clinical development and eleven ADCs (nine containing small-molecule payloads and two with biological toxins) approved for use by the FDA. Compared to traditional small-molecule approaches, ADCs offer enhanced targeting of cancer cells along with reduced toxic side effects, making them an attractive prospect in the field of oncology. To this end, this tutorial review aims to serve as a reference material for ADCs and give readers a comprehensive understanding of ADCs; it explores and explains each ADC component (monoclonal antibody, linker moiety and cytotoxic payload) individually, highlights several EMA- and FDA-approved ADCs by way of case studies and offers a brief future perspective on the field of ADC research.",

            "text": "ADCs are a rapidly expanding class of anti-cancer therapeutics with 13 currently FDA-approved, including six for solid tumors and seven for hematological malignancies, and over 100 more in clinical trials [6]. ADCs consist of a mAb backbone conjugated to potent cytotoxins via a cleavable or non-cleavable linker. Cleavable linkers are more common among approved and preclinical ADCs and are cleaved by a variety of different mechanisms including lysosomal protease activity (e.g., cathepsin B), tumor-associated acidic/reducing conditions, or other enzymatic cleavage (i.e., beta-glucuronidase, sulfatases, phosphatases) [62]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers, rather, require lysosomal degradation of the entire ADC for payload release. ADCs target surface-expressed, tumorenriched antigens, enabling specific delivery of payloads to cancer cells and sparing normal tissue. The therapeutic index (TI) of ADC payloads is, in theory, enhanced compared with traditional chemotherapies by restricting their action to cancer cells. Among approved ADCs, traditional payload classes include DNA-damaging agents (i.e., calicheamicins and pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs)); microtubule-disrupting auristatins and maytansanoids (i.e., monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), DM1, and DM4); and topoisomerase I inhibitors (i.e., SN38 and DXd) [63]. While topoisomerase I inhibitors are the most predominant payload class in clinical trials, there is an increasing amount of alternative payloads being examined including topoisomerase II and RNA polymerase II inhibitors, immune agonists, proteolysis-targeting activating chimeras (PRO-TACs), and TKIs [64].",

            "text": "Many cleavable linkers are currently utilized in ADCs, such as acid-labile hydrazones, reducible disulfides and enzyme-cleavable linkers (e.g., valine-citrulline). Several FDA-approved breast cancer ADCs, including sacituzumab govitecan, and trastuzumab deruxtecan, have cleavable linkers (Figure 3). Most of the cleavable linkers are susceptible to intracellular cleavage. However, chemical and enzymatic cleavage triggers may exist extracellularly [18,19]. Further, expiring tumor cells may release high concentrations of intracellular species (including glutathione and protease) into the TME, which facilitate the development of non-internalizing ADCs. Non-internalizing ADC mechanisms may involve targeting membrane proteins, the TME and the tumor stroma or vasculature. As a result, non-internalizing ADCs provide a wider choice of antigen targets, avoid insufficient internalization and trafficking to the lysosome, improve the bystander effect, and enhance tumor penetration to deeper cancer cells (Figure 4B). Internalizing ADCs' tumor cells can acquire resistance mechanisms. However, non-internalizing ADCs may reduce the drug resistance. \n\nInternalization is key to the effectiveness of ADCs with cleavable linkers. However, increasingly, several indications suggest a contrary mechanism. The dying tumors may release the intracellular linker triggers into the extracellular TME, facilitating the noninternalizing mechanisms of ADC. These linkers may be incorporated into non-internalizing ADCs. Therefore, the concept that the linker must persist in circulation before internalization and detachment within the cancer cells may need to be modified for non-internalizing ADCs. The linkers comprising ester or carbonate groups with modest stability in circulation have been utilized in integration with antibodies targeting the stromal constituents in the TME, permitting a persistent local drug release into tumors. Carbonate linkers already have been proven in a clinical setup (Sacituzumab govitecan). This linker type may be utilized only with moderately cytotoxic payloads.",

In some cases, these released metabolite(s) are membrane permeable, allowing them to diffuse into and kill neighboring cells in a tumor, an effect known as bystander killing. 3 ADCs have been investigated for more than two decades; however, ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla), for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, is currently the only conjugate approved for a solid tumor indication. 4 It is a maytansinoid bearing ADC that has a noncleavable linker and releases a charged metabolite that does not induce bystander killing. 1 The high stability of noncleavably linked ADCs is expected to maximize delivery of cytotoxic molecules to tumors while reducing payload release in healthy tissues. 2 However, the linker may not be ideal as many other conjugates using the same linker and payload as ado-trastuzumab emtansine were not successful in the clinic. 5 Also, based on mouse xenograft studies, cleavably linked conjugates that induce bystander killing are typically more efficacious than noncleavably linked ADCs. 6,7 e have previously developed two types of maytansinoid ADCs that induce bystander killing, each have strengths but also potential for improvement. In the first type, the payload is linked to a lysine residue of an antibody via a disulfide bond, ADCs (1a\u22121d) are shown as examples, Figure 1A. 8 After internalization by cells, the antibody of the ADC is catabolized to give 2 and most is reduced to give the thiol-containing maytansinoid (3a), some of which can then be S-methylated to 3b.",

A linker is the required covalent connection between the cytotoxic compound and the antibody. The linker influences the stability and drug to antibody ratio (DAR) of the therapeutic agent. These parameters are critical for the overall success of an ADC-based design. With the high potency of the payloads chosen, linkers must be stable within the bloodstream to limit early payload release and allow tumour site targeting to occur. However, this stability must be context-dependent: once inside the cell, these linkers must be efficient in releasing the payload to induced the cytotoxic effect [13].\n\nConventional ADC conjugation involves methods of alkylation of reduced interchain disulphides and alkylation or acylation of lysine residues [9]. These conjugation methods generate heterogeneous mixtures of ADCs with variable drug per antibody ratios (DARs). This varies between zero and eight conjugated payloads per antibody [14]. T-DM1, for example, has on average a DAR of 3.5 [15]. The position and number of payloads bound to the antibody can have profound effects on the binding to the antigen, the aggregation of the ADC, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the antibody construct, and even the safety profile of the ADC [16].\n\nImproving the antibody site for linker conjugation has been greatly enhanced through advancements in protein engineering. Antibody site-specific alterations enhance linker conjugation and result in homogeneous ADCs. These alterations can be mediated through enzymatic conjugation or insertion of reactive cysteine or chemoselective functional groups of unnatural amino acid residues into the antibody protein sequence [17]. The covalent connection between drug and antibody has been traditionally mediated through the thiol group of cysteine or the epsilon amino group of lysine residues [18].\n\nThe majority of ADCs in clinical trials attach the linker to a cysteine of the antibody.

            "text": "The goal in the development of antibody drug conjugates (ADC) is to achieve increased cytotoxicity in the target cells while reducing chemotherapy off-target adverse events.ADCs are monoclonal antibodies covalently bound to a cytotoxic agent (called drug payload or warheads) by a synthetic linker.Thus, ADC's combine the effector functions of antibodies in binding a specific target with the cytotoxic potency of a chemotherapeutic drug [24].Important factors that define the success of ADCs are the selection of the payload and the characteristics of the linker conjugation, because they affect the stability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, homogeneity and biophysical integrity of the conjugates.An ideal ADC payload is a highly potent small molecule with lack of specificity [25].ADCs affect not only cancer cells expressing the antigen but also surrounding cells, a so-called bystander killing effect.This ADC approach is feasible by using cleavable linkers, which after (1) ADCs binding, (2) internalization by endocytosis and (3) transport to the lysosome, are cleaved releasing the cytotoxic payload.The free payload can then bind to its target within the cancer cell or diffuse into the intercellular space, due to their high membrane permeability, thus inducing cell death in neighbouring cells.Alternatively, the ADC-payload conjugate with a diffusible drug can be cleaved by extracellular enzymes prior to internalization of a diffusible drug (Fig. 2a) [26].\n\nBesides monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments can also be used as vehicles for ADCs.Antibody fragments such as minibodies, diabodies, single chain fragments of variable regions (scFvs) and nanobodies are parts of antibodies, modified through genetic engineering.They usually contain only the basic targeting and binding domain of antibodies.Due to their relatively small molecular weight (7-100 kDa) and low complexity, the antibody fragments exhibit better pharmacokinetics for non-invasive targeted imaging.",

Instead, cleavable linkers release the payload in response to tumor-associated factors, such as acid pH (acid-labile linkers), reduction-oxidation conditions (disulfide-linkers), abundance of proteolytic enzymes (protease-cleavable linkers), allowing the diffusion of the payload through neighbouring cells not expressing the target (bystander effect) [10]. \n\nLastly, payloads derive from DNA-damaging agents (duocarmazine), antimicrotubule compounds (mertansine, vedotin, amberstatin) or topoisomerase inhibitors (deruxtecan, govitecan), and are characterized by an extremely unfavourable therapeutic index, if administered systemically as free drugs [8]. \n\nTrastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was the first ADC approved in solid tumors in 2013 [11], in particular, in patients with HER2-positive mBC [12], according to the OS benefit demonstrated in a clinical trial enrolling patients progressing on trastuzumab and chemotherapy; it is an ADC targeting HER2, conjugated through a non-cleavable linker to an anti-microtubule compound (mertansine or DM1), with a DAR of 3.5 and it is characterized by a multiple mechanism of action, from the selective deliver of the payload to HER2 signalling inhibition and antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by trastuzumab [13,14].",

            "text": "Linker chemistry is an important determinant of the safety and efficacy of ADCs. Linkers, which are generally divided into cleavable and non-cleavable types, are designed to be stable in the bloodstream while allowing efficient release of the small molecule cytotoxin after internalization in the target cell [58]. The stability of antibody-drug linkers in systemic circulation has been a key focus in safety evaluations, since premature loss of the small molecule prior to ADC target cell internalization can result in off-target toxicity from non-specific drug release [59]. Strategies to develop ADCs with more stable linkers and lower levels of unconjugated mAbs have been viewed as critical to the effort to improve ADC pharmacokinetic properties, therapeutic indexes, and safety profiles [13,60]. \n\nAn insufficiently stable linker was thought to represent a possible liability for Mylotarg, although subsequent ADCs utilizing similar acid-labile hydrazone linkers, e.g., inotuzumab ozogamicin and milatuzumab-doxorubicin, have shown good stability in human plasma and serum [14]. However, a comparison of ADCs containing hydrazone linkers with those using protease-sensitive dipeptide linkers showed that the peptide-linked conjugates were much more stable in buffers and plasma than the corresponding hydrazone conjugates, and as a result exhibited more specific delivery and lower systemic toxicity [61]. These results illustrated the importance of conjugation and linker chemistry in achieving a favorable therapeutic index. \n\nSpecies differences in drug-linker stability can lead to difficulties in evaluating the therapeutic index of an ADC based on nonclinical studies.",

This strategy yielded the earliest clinical success with Mylotarg and was later employed in Besponsa 2,10 . However, the insufficient stability of acid-cleavable linkers severely limits their application in ADCs, and a phenylketone-derived hydrazone linker was hydrolyzed with a t 1/2 Z 2 days in human and mouse plasma. The serum stability of the Sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy), which contains acidcleavable carbonate linkers, was also unsatisfactory with a t 1/2 Z 36 h 27 . Accordingly, acid-cleavable ADCs require more stable linkers or must employ only moderately cytotoxic payloads. \n\nIn 2019, our group developed a novel silyl ether-based acidcleavable ADC carrying highly cytotoxic monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE, Fig. 3) 28 . This design greatly improved the stability of the acid-cleavable linker and should be sufficient to support acidcleavable ADCs containing highly cytotoxic payloads. Compared with the traditional hydrazine linker (t 1/2 Z 2 days) and carbonate linker (t 1/2 Z 36 h), the t 1/2 of the novel silyl ether linker-MMAE conjugate was more than 7 days in human plasma.

By leveraging antibodies\u2019 targeting properties, ADCs deliver cytotoxic drugs into tumor cells via endocytosis after identifying the tumor antigen. This precise method aims to kill tumor cells selectively while minimizing harm to normal cells, offering safe and effective therapeutic benefits. Recent years have seen significant progress in antitumor treatment with ADC development, providing patients with new and potent treatment options. With over 300 ADCs explored for various tumor indications and some already approved for clinical use, challenges such as resistance due to factors like antigen expression, ADC processing, and payload have emerged. This review aims to outline the history of ADC development, their structure, mechanism of action, recent composition advancements, target selection, completed and ongoing clinical trials, resistance mechanisms, and intervention strategies. Additionally, it will delve into the potential of ADCs with novel markers, linkers, payloads, and innovative action mechanisms to enhance cancer treatment options. The evolution of ADCs has also led to the emergence of combination therapy as a new therapeutic approach to improve drug efficacy.",

We show that these ADCs are synthesised almost exclusively as DAR 4 species (by HIC and mass spec), have stability in blood serum and are selective and potent against HER-2 expressing tumour cells. Moreover, we demonstrate for the \ue103rst time that both NGM-and PD-based ADC potency and selectivity translate well into therapeutic efficacy in an in vivo mouse model. Both ADC formats showed excellent tumour regression. \n\nBoth NGM and PD based ADCs are prepared by a common and simple method (Scheme 1). The four solvent accessible disul\ue103de bonds in an IgG1 are reduced using tris-2carboxyethylphosphine (TCEP), followed by functional rebridging with either a NGM or a PD molecule. Conjugation with NGM is followed by hydrolysis to stabilise the conjugate, whereas PD conjugates themselves are stable. \n\nWe chose trastuzumab as our antibody platform to demonstrate disul\ue103de modi\ue103cation with PDs. Trastuzumab (Herceptin\u2122) is a monoclonal IgG1 antibody targeting HER2 and is used for breast cancer therapy both as antibody alone 39 and as the antibody component of ADC Kadcyla\u2122. 40 We chose anti-cancer drug MMAE as a suitable payload for ADC design. 9,38,41 Lastly, we chose to  compare cleavable and non-cleavable linker designs. The cleavable linker design is the widely used cathepsin B labile valine-citruline linker. 8,9,38,42,43 t has been suggested that MMAE requires release as a free drug from the antibody linker conjugate to reach anywhere near its full potency inside the target cell. 44 However, our previously reported NGM-MMAE ADC 1 showed high potency in vitro despite using a non-cleavable linker. 26",

            "text": "Linkers play a crucial role in the pharmacokinetics, drug efficacy, and safety of ADCs. It is imperative for the stability of linkers within the circulatory system to prevent the premature release of cytotoxic drugs from ADCs, as this may result in off-target toxicity. However, these linkers must be designed to be unstable under specific conditions to facilitate the delivery of the drug payload into tumor cells. There are two main types of linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers undergo hydrolysis, protease cleavage, or disulfide bond cleavage within early endosomes or secondary endosomes, allowing the release of potent cytotoxic drugs. A commonly utilized mechanism involves the action of glutathione, where cleavable linkers are designed to be sensitive to glutathione. This sensitivity leads to linker cleavage, subsequently releasing the therapeutic payload into the intracellular environment. This mechanism capitalizes on the reducing properties of glutathione, facilitating controlled drug release specifically within the intracellular space (Baah et al., 2021). Examples of ADCs utilizing this cleavable linker mechanism include brentuximab vedotin, enfortumab vedotin, and polatuzumab vedotin, which employ a pH-sensitive hydrazone linker (Sonawane et al., 2017). On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are resistant to cleavage and remain intact after being fused to the lysosome. The acidic environment generated by the lysosomal proton pump promotes protein degradation through cathepsin B or plasmin-mediated pathways. Studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linkers exhibit greater stability in blood compared to cleavable linkers (Jain et al., 2015). Furthermore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers present a reduced risk of systemic toxicity caused by premature payload release when the drug payload is released within the lysosome. The FDA has approved T-DM1 and mafodotin belantamab as examples of ADCs utilizing non-cleavable linkers (Tong et al., 2021).",

Only approximately 0.1% of the drug dose is delivered to the targeted diseased cell population after ADC drugs enter the human body, and the vast majority of the drug is distributed in the circulation or to normal cells, leading to unwanted toxicity. 64 A meta-analysis of adverse reactions in clinical trials of ADC drugs revealed that the incidence of all SG-related adverse events was as high as 97.1% (95% CI, 96.0-98.2%), and the incidence of \u2265 grade 3 treatment-related adverse events was 61.1% (95% CI, 57.6-64.6%). 65 To better exploit the therapeutic value of TROP-2 ADC drugs, exploring the mechanism of ADC drug adverse events and thus optimizing the management strategy of adverse events is one of the future research directions for TROP-2 ADC drugs. \n\nInstability of the coupling between the ADC linker and the cytotoxic drug can lead to off-target toxicity due to the premature release of the payload before reaching targeted tumor cells. There are two main types of ADC drug linkers: cleavable and non-cleavable. However, in practice, cleavable linkers can be affected by poor plasma stability in circulation, and peptide-chain structure-based linkers with high sensitivity to proteases in serum or spontaneous decoupling can lead to the premature release of the payload before reaching the target tissues and the bystander effect, causing toxicity to normal cells owing to the increased ability of the drug to permeate cells. 66 Non-cleavable linkers can maintain high stability in the bloodstream, and internalization, lysosomal delivery and degradation of the ADC complex are necessary to release the active drug. The use of non-cleavable linkers reduces the probability of drug release from the extracellular space, but in contrast to cleavable linkers, they are unable to kill neighboring tumor cells through the bystander effect. In addition, the coupling site of ADC drugs may also modulate the stability and pharmacokinetics of ADCs.",

            "text": "ADCs consist of three primary elements: tumor-specific mAbs, cytotoxic small molecules forming the active payload, and a bespoke chemical linker that attaches the mAb to the payload [19]. In an ideal scenario, the mAb-targeted antigens are predominantly expressed in tumors, scarcely or not at all in normal tissues, and exhibit robust internalization and uptake, enabling the rapid and specific delivery of cytotoxic drugs into tumor cells. ADCs commonly target MM cell surface antigens such as BCMA, CD38, CD138, and FcRH5. The payloads in ADCs are usually traditional cytotoxic drugs, divided into two classes: microtubule inhibitors and DNA damaging agents [17]. Despite the notable efficacy of frontline treatments like BTZ, lenalidomide, and daratumumab, their application in ADCs remains limited. Chemical linkers in ADCs are mainly composed of cleavable (acid-labile, protease-cleavable, and disulfide bond linkers) and non-cleavable types. The cleavable linkers are designed to break down under specific cellular conditions, whereas the non-cleavable linkers are more robust, relying on lysosomal degradation of the mAb framework to release the active payload [20][21][22]. These linkers are engineered to attach to designated amino acid residues on the monoclonal antibody, while the opposite end forms a chemical bond with the small molecule drug, ensuring stability during circulation and effective release upon target cell entry. In the systemic administration of ADCs for relapsed or refractory MM patients, the monoclonal antibody initially targets and binds to antigens on the MM cell surface, facilitating ADC internalization. Subsequently, the linker undergoes cleavage in the unique cellular milieu, liberating the cytotoxic drug that induces cellular damage and apoptosis (Figure 2).",

At present, cleavable and noncleavable linkers are two major classes widely applied in the clinical setting.

Three main types of cleavable linkers respond to physiological stimuli,  Post-ASCT consolidation for HL Median PFS 42.9 months, 5-year PFS 59% \n\nphase III [52] Post-ASCT consolidation for HL 18-month PFS 95%, 18-month OS 98% \n\nphase II [53] Salvage therapy for R/R HL 2-year OS 95%, 2-year PFS 74% phase II [54] Salvage therapy for R/R HL ORR 84%, CR 79% phase II [55] Salvage therapy for R/R HL ORR 85%, CR 67%, 2-year PFS 78% \n\nphase I/II [56] Untreated HL ORR 86%, CR 73%, 5-year PFS 82% \n\nphase III [58] Untreated HL ORR 61%, CR 48% Nonetheless, sufficient extracellular proteolytic cleavage of the Val-Cit linker is also observed, indicating that endocytosis of ADC is not required under certain conditions and that developing non-internalizing antibodies may be a potential option for increasing antitumor activity [36]. \n\nConcerning the pursuit of increased plasma stability, non-cleavable linkers appear to be a better option for ADCs. Non-cleavable linkers mainly depend on sufficient processing of mAbs within the lysosome after ADC internalization to release the toxin due to the lack of cell permeability. These linkers are accompanied by limited bystander effect and have lower membrane permeability. \n\nThe attachment between mAb and linker is a crucial parameter of ADCs as it determines the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and consequently the stability, efficacy, and homogeneity of the ADCs. Site-specific methods are proposed to optimize the DAR and maintain favorable pharmacokinetics while maximizing payloads in the development of ADCs.",

After 30 years of intensive research and development activities, only seven ADCs have been approved for clinical use; two have received fast-track designation and two breakthrough therapy designation from the Food and Drug Administration. There is continued interest in the field, as documented by the growing number of candidates in clinical development. This review aims to summarize the most recent innovations that have been applied to the design of ADCs undergoing early- and late-stage clinical trials. Discovery and rational optimization of new payloads, chemical linkers, and antibody formats have improved the therapeutic index of next-generation ADCs, ultimately resulting in improved clinical benefit for the patients.",

            "text": "The linker plays an essential role in releasing the potent cytotoxic drug into the cancer cells [30]. To prepare selective and potent ADCs, the linker should possess the following characteristics: (1) it needs to be stable enough in circulating blood for a prolonged period to avoid the premature release of the cytotoxic drug and avoid off-target effects, but at the same time it has to allow for the effective release of the payload into the target cancer cell; (2) the linker has to ensure that the ADC is soluble, therefore high water solubility is required for bioconjugation; (3) the antibody must retain its function; thus, the attachment of the linker to the antibody should not interfere with its binding specificity. \n\nThere are two different parts to the linkers: the antibody-and the payload-attachment sites. The site of conjugation and choice of the linker is critical for the stability and pharmacokinetic properties of the ADCs. The stoichiometry of the linker-payloads on the antibody (drug-to-antibody ratio, DAR) determines the homogeneity and stability of the ADC [31]. The bonding between the linker and the payload is also critical and has been proven to be a key requirement for safe and efficacious ADCs [32]. \n\nThe linkers can be classified into two groups based on the release mechanism and their stability in circulation: (1) cleavable and (2) noncleavable.",

            "text": "First generation oncology ADCs in the 1990s were based on murine or chimeric antibodies which were plagued with immunogenicity issues [16] and linker instability [17]. Immunogenicity of protein therapeutics has a critical impact on the pharmacokinetics and drug disposition and ultimately clinical success [18,19]. These molecules were designed to deliver a variety of protein toxins [20] and microtubule binding drugs [21] as the cytotoxic payloads. Limited antigen density on tumors, low potency of the payloads, and the low average drug-antibody-ratio (DAR ~3-4) prevented efficacious quantity of drug delivered, which was proposed to be one of the reasons for initial ADC failures, while higher DAR conjugates suffered from toxicity and low therapeutic index. Second generation ADCs from the last 10+ years approved by the FDA were armed humanized antibodies coupled to stabilized linkers and more potent payloads, such as auristatins, calicheamicins, and maytansinoids (Table 1). \n\nIn an ideal situation, ADC payloads should be inactive in circulation when conjugated to an antibody via a linker and remain stably conjugated until the conjugate reaches the target of interest. Upon internalization of the conjugate-target complex, active payload is released inside target cells after lysosomal degradation of the linker or the antibody itself. In addition to reducing target-independent uptake, conjugate stability remains crucial for specific delivery and distribution of payload to the target tissue from systemic circulation. Conjugation sites, chemistries and linker designs coupled with DAR load greatly affect plasma stability, biophysical properties, and consequently pharmacokinetics of the conjugate. Next generation ADCs will likely incorporate fully human antibodies with site-specific conjugation and novel linkers to reduce immunogenicity and optimize biodistribution and payload delivery. These topics will be discussed in this review.",

            "text": "Compared to pBTs, metastatic lesions typically show a more consistent disruption of the BBB and, generally, no infiltrative growth, which facilitates diagnostic imaging and, when feasible, surgical resection. The suboptimal and highly variable drug accumulation in brain tumors mainly depends on the BTB's heterogeneous permeability for small and large molecules as well as on the heterogeneous perfusion. \n\nThe new wave of anticancer agents developed over the last two decades, such as TKIs targeting tumor driver genetic alterations and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), which have revolutionized the treatment paradigm of most cancers recently, has exhibited an unprecedented level of activity in the CNS. Currently the effectiveness of these compounds challenges, at least in some clinical scenarios, the old paradigm of BM treatment management based on local interventions. \n\nADCs represent an innovative class of antineoplastic drugs that allow the selective delivery of cytotoxics into tumor cells [16], and they are quickly emerging as part of a major breakthrough in cancer therapy in recent years. \n\nAs of now, there are only seven ADCs that have received FDA approval for the treatment of solid tumors (Table 1). \n\nAn ADC consists of three main components: the antibody, the linker, and the payload. Linkers can be distinguished into cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. In the case of cleavable linkers, the antibody binds to a target molecule on the tumor cell's surface, at which point the linker is degraded by conditions in the tumor microenvironment, leading to internalization of the drug. Non-cleavable linkers, in contrast, require endocytosis and degradation of the entire ADC structure to release the payload inside the cell. The resulting cell death enables the payload to affect nearby tumor cells, even those not expressing the target, through a mechanism called the bystander effect (Figure 1) [17]. \n\nNon-cleavable linkers are more stable in the bloodstream, but due to their lower cell permeability, they limit the bystander effect, which is crucial when dealing with the heterogeneous expression of the targeted antigen within the tumor [18].",

            "text": "ADCs are a novel class for cancer treatments that aid the delivery of highly potent cytotoxic anticancer drugs to be released at the therapeutic target [78]. They are composed of three main components, a monoclonal antibody (mAb), linker, and the payload [78]. \n\nMonoclonal antibodies have been proven to play a central role in cancer therapy. They are produced either by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell line (Chinese Hamster Ovary) or murine hybridoma technology. The selection of the linker to anchor the payload to the mAb is of utmost importance. It is imperative for the linker to be stable in the blood stream and be able to undergo a programmed metabolism to release the payload at the therapeutic target [79,80]. A valine-citrulline (Val-Cit)-cleavable linker is an optimal choice for this purpose. In contrast to other tetrapeptidyl linkers like GFLF and ALAL, Val-Cit has not exhibited any aggregation problems during the conjugation process [79][80][81]. It is worth highlighting that other known linkers do not fulfil the aforementioned prerequisite for an ideal linker. For example, hydrazone-based linkers have demonstrated premature payload release, attributed to instability at different pH values, while disulfide-based linkers have exhibited susceptibility to exchanging with other thiols. Two maleimide-based non-cleavable linkers, namely (i) maleimidocaproyl and (ii) maleimidomethyl cyclohexane1-carboxylate, are commonly utilized. However, despite their widespread use, this linker is susceptible to a retro-Michael reaction, leading to the premature detachment of the drug linker from the ADC [82]. Furthermore, the succinimidyl thioether moiety undergoes irreversible hydrolysis, a reaction that frequently takes place in ADCs, often at rates that surpass their intended in vivo lifetime [83][84][85]. Various strategies are employed to address these issues.",

            "text": "ADCs are a rapidly expanding class of anti-cancer therapeutics with 13 currently FDA-approved, including six for solid tumors and seven for hematological malignancies, and over 100 more in clinical trials [6]. ADCs consist of a mAb backbone conjugated to potent cytotoxins via a cleavable or non-cleavable linker. Cleavable linkers are more common among approved and preclinical ADCs and are cleaved by a variety of different mechanisms including lysosomal protease activity (e.g., cathepsin B), tumor-associated acidic/reducing conditions, or other enzymatic cleavage (i.e., beta-glucuronidase, sulfatases, phosphatases) [62]. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers, rather, require lysosomal degradation of the entire ADC for payload release. ADCs target surface-expressed, tumorenriched antigens, enabling specific delivery of payloads to cancer cells and sparing normal tissue. The therapeutic index (TI) of ADC payloads is, in theory, enhanced compared with traditional chemotherapies by restricting their action to cancer cells. Among approved ADCs, traditional payload classes include DNA-damaging agents (i.e., calicheamicins and pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs)); microtubule-disrupting auristatins and maytansanoids (i.e., monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), DM1, and DM4); and topoisomerase I inhibitors (i.e., SN38 and DXd) [63]. While topoisomerase I inhibitors are the most predominant payload class in clinical trials, there is an increasing amount of alternative payloads being examined including topoisomerase II and RNA polymerase II inhibitors, immune agonists, proteolysis-targeting activating chimeras (PROTACs), and TKIs [64]. ADC payload is the most significant determinant of clinical toxicity profiles because of non-specific, normal tissue uptake [65].",

            "text": "ADCs consist of three primary elements: tumor-specific mAbs, cytotoxic small molecules forming the active payload, and a bespoke chemical linker that aKaches the mAb to the payload [19]. In an ideal scenario, the mAb-targeted antigens are predominantly expressed in tumors, scarcely or not at all in normal tissues, and exhibit robust internalization and uptake, enabling the rapid and specific delivery of cytotoxic drugs into tumor cells. ADCs commonly target MM cell surface antigens such as BCMA, CD38, CD138, and FcRH5. The payloads in ADCs are usually traditional cytotoxic drugs, divided into two classes: microtubule inhibitors and DNA damaging agents [17]. Despite the notable efficacy of frontline treatments like BTZ, lenalidomide, and daratumumab, their application in ADCs remains limited. Chemical linkers in ADCs are mainly composed of cleavable (acid-labile, protease-cleavable, and disulfide bond linkers) and non-cleavable types. The cleavable linkers are designed to break down under specific cellular conditions, whereas the non-cleavable linkers are more robust, relying on lysosomal degradation of the mAb framework to release the active payload [20][21][22]. These linkers are engineered to aKach to designated amino acid residues on the monoclonal antibody, while the opposite end forms a chemical bond with the small molecule drug, ensuring stability during circulation and effective release upon target cell entry. In the systemic administration of ADCs for relapsed or refractory MM patients, the monoclonal antibody initially targets and binds to antigens on the MM cell surface, facilitating ADC internalization. Subsequently, the linker undergoes cleavage in the unique cellular milieu, liberating the cytotoxic drug that induces cellular damage and apoptosis (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Antibodies are expected to work as the vehicle to drive tumor uptake of intravenously administered ADCs and selectively deliver cytotoxic payloads to the tumor site via targetmediated binding following internalization. Target-mediated internalization is considered essential for ADCs carrying non-cleavable linkers; because they do not have drug release mechanisms other than antibody catabolism, they must be catabolized in lysosomes to release their active payloads [3]. Antibodies targeting internalizing antigens are preferred as well for ADCs carrying protease-cleavable linkers or acid-labile linkers, which use intracellular enzymes or acidic compartments, such as endosomes and lysosomes, respectively, for active release of the payload. However, non-internalizing ADCs can exert significant antitumor efficacy in some cases [6]. While carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) and B cell antigens such as CD20, CD21, and CD72 are known to internalize poorly, improved efficacy has been demonstrated with ADCs that carry cleavable linkers [7][8][9][10]. \n\nWhen selecting the backbone antibody for ADC construction, the antitumor activity of the antibody itself, such as direct inhibition of cellular signaling and receptor multimerization, is not considered critical, unlike in traditional unmodified antibody treatment, because the main driver of the therapeutic effectiveness of ADCs is direct cell killing by cytotoxic payloads. Nevertheless, antibodies in certain ADCs retain mechanisms of action of the unmodified original antibody, and direct antitumor activity of the antibody contributes to the overall antitumor efficacy of the ADCs.",

A duocarmycin-based B7-H3-targeted DNA-alkylating ADC, vobramitamab duocarmazine (vobra duo), has shown encouraging clinical activity in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Given the broad spectrum of tumor indications addressable by targeting B7-H3, we developed MGC026, an ADC incorporating a B7-H3-targeting antibody and a novel glycan-linked topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TOP1i). With distinct mechanisms of action, vobra duo and MGC026 can address different cancers, tumor stages, or be used in combination with alternate agents to enhance their clinical utility.\n Methods: MGC026 is comprised of the cleavable linker-payload, bicyclononyne carbamoyl sulfamide Val-Ala-PABC exatecan (SYNtecan E\u2122) site-specifically conjugated at asparagine 297 of the heavy chain through enzymatic glycan remodeling and metal-free click chemistry, using Synaffix\u2019s GlycoConnect\u2122 technology. In vivo efficacy studies were conducted in immunodeficient mice with human tumor cell-line or patient-derived xenografts to identify the spectrum of MGC026-sensitive tumors and the relationship between exposure and antitumor activity. A toxicology study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys in which MGC026 was administered by 15-minute IV infusion once every three weeks. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and detailed toxicology evaluation was performed.\n Results: MGC026 demonstrated specific, dose-dependent in vivo antitumor activity toward B7-H3-positive tumor xenografts representing lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Additionally, MGC026 demonstrated antitumor activity toward B7-H3-positive patient-derived xenograft models of lung and prostate cancer, with additional indications under investigation. MGC026, administered to cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels of 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg every 3 weeks for a total of 3 doses, exhibited approximate dose-proportional PK and high stability in circulation. MGC026 was well tolerated, with no lung toxicity observed, and the highest dose level tested (50 mg/kg) was declared as the highest non-severely toxic dose.\n Conclusions: MGC026 exhibited a favorable preclinical profile, with potent in vivo activity toward B7-H3-expressing tumor xenografts representing a range of cancer indications. MGC026 was tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys, a relevant toxicology model, at exposure levels exceeding those required for antitumor activity.

Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) provide a novel approach to traditional chemotherapy by targeting tumor-specific antigens to deliver cytotoxic payloads while sparing normal tissue and enhancing the therapeutic index. Herein, we describe the preclinical characterization of AZD0516, a first-in-class ADC directed against six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate-2 (STEAP2), a novel tumor associated antigen that is highly and homogenously expressed across all stages of prostate cancer. The anti-STEAP2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) is conjugated via interchain cysteines to a maleimide-reactive, \u03b2-glucuronidase-cleavable linker bearing the topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TOP1i) payload, exatecan. The STEAP2 antibody binds specifically to the extracellular domains of human, cynomolgus monkey, mouse, and rat STEAP2, but exhibits no detectable binding to other STEAP family members. The fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of the antibody binder portion carries three amino acid point mutations designed to reduce Fc-mediated immune effector functions. In vitro characterization of the STEAP2 mAb in prostate cancer cells demonstrated specific binding, rapid internalization, and efficient lysosomal trafficking. In vitro cytotoxicity assays with AZD0516 revealed IC50 values in the low nM range and the ADC induced both single- and double-strand DNA breaks, characteristic of the proposed primary mechanism of action (MoA) of the TOP1i payload, namely, DNA damage and apoptotic cell death. Exatecan-driven bystander cell killing from intracellular release of payload was demonstrated in co-culture systems involving STEAP2-positive and negative cell lines. Murine plasma pharmacokinetic data suggest minimal impact of linker-payload conjugation on antibody clearance, while maintaining high plasma stability. The mechanistic and pharmacodynamic effects of AZD0516 were observed in a prostate cancer cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) model via a dose-dependent increase in positive staining for \u03b3H2AX foci, indicative of DNA damage. AZD0516 monotherapy administration in prostate cancer CDX and patient-derived xenograft models led to sustained tumor responses. AZD0516 was well-tolerated in both rats and cynomolgus monkeys with no unexpected toxicities observed. Safety findings included hematological and gastrointestinal effects, consistent with the MoA and known effects of TOP1i payloads. Together, these data support exploring AZD0516 clinically for patients with mCRPC.\n \n \n Darlene Monlish, Vanessa Muniz-Medina, Mel Ehudin, Dewald van Dyk, Claire Myers, Rachel Lawrence, Liang Zhang, Linda Irons, Chara Stavraka, Wardha Qureshi, Ruoyan Chen, Asurayya Worrede, Nicolas Giraldo, Miljenka Vuko, Melody Handali, Ali Saleh, Balakumar Vijayakrishnan, Maximillian Lee, Jeong Min Han, Crystal Cheung, Ariel Endlich-Frazier, Amber Lee, Mark Hutchinson, Andrew Dippel, Gilad Kaplan, Keith Rickert, Shraddha Kale, Ryan Fleming, Clare Hoover, Benedicte Recolin, Jan Zaucha, Sreedevi Kesavan, John` Meekin, Aida Mariani, Christian Eisen, John Bullen, Eric Gangl, Jay Harper, Andreas Maderna, Edward Rosfjord, Frank Comer, Elaine Hurt, Neil Gibson, Puja Sapra.

It is highly expressed in ovarian cancer (OC), non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and papillary thyroid cancer, with limited expression in normal tissue, making it a promising target for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) [2,3]. LM-317 is a novel NaPi2b targeted humanized monoclonal antibody LM-117 conjugated to the next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor LDX2 via a cleavable linker, with antibody-drug ratio of 8. Here, we present the preclinical in vivo and in vitro results of LM-317.\n Results: LM-317 is highly specific cross-reactive with rhesus monkeys, cynomolgus monkeys, mouse, and rat NaPi2b. Concentration-dependent cell binding and internalization effects of LM-317 were observed in human NaPi2b-expressing cells, and OC and NSCLC cells expressing NaPi2b, with EC-50 of 0.92 - 9.7 nM and 1.51 - 4.76 nM, respectively. The cytotoxicity effect of LM-317 in NaPi2b -positive tumor cells was superior to LM-117-DXD, with IC-50 of 0.002 - 0.52nM. The in vivo studies showed that 1 mg/kg of LM-317 almost completely eradicated tumors in the OVCAR-3 xenograft mice model of OC, and similar antitumor activity was observed in the NCI-H175-xenograft mice model of NSCLC at the dose of 3 mg/kg. Single dose of 6 mg/kg of LM-317 showed sustained tumor eradication in the NSCLC xenograft -mouse model. LM-317 also exhibited potent tumor regression in the PDX model of OC and NSCLC. The tumor growth inhibition (TGI) value was 80%-100% in OC and NSCLC PDX models with different expression degree of NaPi2b after treatment with LM-317. The antitumor activity of LM-317 in cell line- and PDX models of OC and NSLCL was comparable to those of LM-117-DXD.\n Conclusion: The novel ADC LM-317 targeting NaPi2b showed robust antitumor activity in vitro, and in the OC and NSCLC cell line derived models and PDX models. LM-317 could potentially provide therapeutic benefit to treat NaPi2b-positive tumors including OC and NSCLC in the future.\n Reference: 1.S. Banerjee et al.

The specificity profile of the anti-EphA5 antibody was characterized using a membrane proteome array.

Expression of EphA5 in archival human tissue sections was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a commercial antibody. Efficacy studies used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of both lung and head and neck, and breast cancer.\n Results: IHC demonstrated selective EphA5 membrane expression in 78% (18/23) of triple negative and 88% (23/26) of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer tumors tested. EphA5 membrane expression was also detected in 85% (29/34), 73% (16/22), 70% (7/10), 70% (15/22), and 50% (6/12) of lung squamous cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, gastric, colorectal, and pancreatic patient tumors tested, respectively. EphA5 expression was not detected in adjacent, non-malignant tissue in any of the tumors examined. The anti-EphA5 antibody bound exclusively to EphA5 and did not cross-react with other members of the Eph receptor/ephrin ligand family. Binding of the anti-EphA5 antibody on the cell surface triggered rapid internalization and processing through the endosomal-lysosomal system. MBRC-101 was cytotoxic to EphA5-expressing cells and its activity was concentration-dependent and commensurate to levels of EphA5 on the cell surface. In PDX models, once weekly administrations of intravenous MBRC-101 showed dose-dependent, robust, and reproducible anti-tumor activity. Partial tumor responses were observed at doses of 2.5 mg/Kg and complete tumor responses starting at 5 mg/Kg. Toxicologic findings in Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys were attributed to the MMAE payload and not target-related. Based on an HNSTD of 10 mg/kg in monkeys, the starting human dose was 0.5 mg/kg with ~15-fold safety margin.\n Conclusions: EphA5 is a new and promising molecular target for the development of ADC-based therapies against many human cancers.

The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) EphA5 possesses the classical receptor kinase topology with an extracellular-binding domain, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain. We have previously shown that EphA5 is highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer and contributes to DNA-damage repair and radiation therapy resistance. Others have reported EphA5 expression in gastric, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. Here, we investigated the expression of EphA5 in breast cancer (BC) and assessed EphA5 as a potential cancer-specific target using a novel ADC designated MBRC-101. Methods: MBRC-101 is composed of a humanized anti-EphA5 IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody conjugated to the small molecule microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease cleavable valine-citrulline (vc) ThioBridge linker (ThioBridge\u2122-Glu-[Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE] PEG [24u]). MBRC-101 averages a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR)=4. The specificity profile of the anti-EphA5 monoclonal antibody was characterized using a Membrane Proteome Array (MPA). Receptor-mediated antibody internalization was determined by real-time live-cell analysis; cell killing assays used both live-cell analysis of cell confluence and the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae luminescent cell viability assay. Expression of EphA5 in archival human breast tumor tissue sections was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a commercial polyclonal antibody against human EphA5. In vivo efficacy studies used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of BC. Results: IHC demonstrated robust and selective EphA5 expression in 87% (20 of 23) of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and 88% (23 of 26) of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) patient tumors tested. EphA5 expression was not detected in adjacent, non-malignant breast tissue. Antibody-specificity profile testing showed that the anti-EphA5 antibody bound exclusively to EphA5 and did not cross-react with other members of the Eph receptor/ephrin ligand family. Binding of the anti-EphA5 antibody to EphA5 on the cell surface triggered rapid internalization and processing of the EphA5/antibody complex through the endosomal-lysosomal system. Consistently, MBRC-101 was cytotoxic to EphA5-expressing cells and its activity was concentration-dependent and commensurate to the levels of EphA5 on the cell surface. In PDX murine models of TNBC, once weekly administrations of intravenous (IV) MBRC-101 showed dose-dependent, robust, and reproducible anti-tumor activity in vivo. Partial tumor responses were observed at doses of 2.5 mg/Kg IV and complete and nearly complete tumor responses starting at 5 mg/Kg IV. Doses up to 10 mg/Kg IV were well-tolerated in tumor-bearing mice with no observable weight loss. Pre-clinical safety confirmed MBRC-101 is also well tolerated in rats and in cynomolgus monkeys. Conclusions: These results support EphA5 as a new and promising membrane-associated molecular target for the design and development of ADC-based therapies against hormone-positive breast cancer and TNBC and support the conduct of a Phase 1/1b study of MBRC-101 in patients with breast cancer.\n Citation Format: Fernanda Staquicini, Fenny Tang, Vanessa de Oliveira, Daniela Staquicini, Yongjian Wu, Kirstin Barnhart, J Kellogg Parsons, Wadih Arap, Isan Chen, Renata Pasqualini.

            "text": "\n Objectives: ADCs have emerged as a major advance in contemporary medical oncology. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) EphA5 possesses the classical receptor kinase topology with an extracellular-binding domain, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain. We have previously shown that EphA5 is highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer and contributes to DNA-damage repair and radiation therapy resistance. Others have reported EphA5 expression in gastric, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. Here, we investigated the expression of EphA5 in breast cancer (BC) and assessed EphA5 as a potential cancer-specific target using a novel ADC designated MBRC-101. Methods: MBRC-101 is composed of a humanized anti-EphA5 IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody conjugated to the small molecule microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease cleavable valine-citrulline (vc) ThioBridge linker (ThioBridge\u2122-Glu-[Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE] PEG [24u]). MBRC-101 averages a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR)=4. The specificity profile of the anti-EphA5 monoclonal antibody was characterized using a Membrane Proteome Array (MPA). Receptor-mediated antibody internalization was determined by real-time live-cell analysis; cell killing assays used both live-cell analysis of cell confluence and the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae luminescent cell viability assay. Expression of EphA5 in archival human breast tumor tissue sections was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a commercial polyclonal antibody against human EphA5. In vivo efficacy studies used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of BC. Results: IHC demonstrated robust and selective EphA5 expression in 87% (20 of 23) of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and 88% (23 of 26) of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) patient tumors tested.

            "abstract": "\n Introduction\n ADCs afford high efficacy though often have shortcomings in their safety profile. Most ADC payloads are cytotoxic agents that can inhibit general processes of cellular homeostasis, including microtubule polymerization or DNA damage repair. While these are good targets for cytotoxicity, they have the drawback of being nonselective for dividing cancer cells. Here, we report the potent, on-target activity and selectivity of our novel CD123-targeting ADC VIP943, which uses a kinesin spindle protein (KSP; also known as KIF11 or Eg5) inhibitor as the payload (VIP716). The kinesin superfamily (KIF) is comprised of motor-proteins involved in various cellular mechanisms, including formation of the bipolar mitotic spindle during cell division. Targeting KSP selectively inhibits dividing cells, while sparing nondividing, differentiated cells thereby increasing the therapeutic index of VIP943.\n Methods\n VIP716 selectivity and potency: The motor domain of the human KSP and the other KIF family members were incubated with stabilized microtubules in a biochemical assay. The freshly prepared mixture was then incubated VIP716 and ispinesib, a clinical stage KSPi. ATPase activity was directly analyzed by measuring the formed inorganic phosphate.\n VIP943 selectivity: The binding of VIP943 to 6,019 human plasma membrane proteins expressed on HEK cells was evaluated (Retrogenix cell microarray).\n Cell cycle/death analysis: The effect of VIP943 on the 3 phases of the cell cycle (G0/G1- S- G2/M) was measured with DNA staining and flow cytometry in MOLM-13 and MV-4-11 cell lines. In addition, cell death was measured by flow cytometry after a 4 h incubation with VIP943 in MOLM-13 cells. Isotype ADC was used as a control.\n In vitro cytotoxicity: 56 hematologic cell lines were treated in vitro with VIP331 (cell permeable analog of VIP716). IC 50 results were matched with the DNA/RNA profile of relevant oncogenes to determine correlations.\n Nonhuman primate safety and toxicokinetics: VIP943 was intravenously administered to Cynomolgus monkeys at 1, 3, or 9 mg/kg once weekly for 4 weeks in a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology study. Serial plasma samples were collected on Day 1 and Day 22. Total antibody from VIP943 (as a surrogate for VIP943) and VIP716 concentrations were measured by LC/MS/MS. Toxicokinetics (TK) were assessed using noncompartmental methods.\n Results\n In a biochemical assay, VIP716 (payload), achieved comparable potency to ispinesib with IC 50 values of 1.4 and 1.6 nM, respectively, for KSP. VIP716 did not inhibit any of the 11 other KIF family members up to 10 \u00b5M. In the Retrogenix assay, VIP943 (ADC) had no interaction with any of the analyzed human cell surface proteins except for CD123. Cell cycle analysis in AML cells showed a dose- and time-dependent increase in G2/M arrest with VIP943 treatment, but not with isotype control. An increase in cell death with VIP943 treatment was also observed after a 4-hour incubation. In a broad hematologic cell line panel, the median cytotoxicity IC 50 for VIP331 (cell permeable KSPi) was 2.49 nM. Of note, no genomic alterations correlated with sensitivity, suggesting VIP943 may be effective even in hard-to-treat hematologic malignancies. VIP943 was well tolerated in the GLP monkey toxicology study. No mortality occurred in any monkeys. No neutropenia, thrombocytopenia or anemia were observed. VIP943 and VIP716 exposures increased with increasing dose in a dose-proportional or greater than dose-proportional manner. No consistent differences in TK were observed with sex. Based on area under the concentration curve (AUC), no accumulation was observed. Payload to parent ratios were consistent with a low level of non-specific release of VIP716 from VIP943.\n Conclusion\n High on-target activity of VIP716, the payload of our new CD123-targeting ADC, VIP943, was demonstrated in a biochemical assay and selectivity against other KIF family members was confirmed. This activity translated into cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and subsequent cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, toxicology in non-human primates and in vivo TK studies confirm safety, favorable drug exposures, and little non-specific release of the payload. Based on these data, evaluation of VIP943 in human clinical trials is warranted.",

Luveltamab tazevibulin (luvelta) is an anti\u2013FR\u03b1-targeting antibody-drug conjugate with a stable cleavable linker and a 3-aminophenyl hemiasterlin warhead (DAR = 4), which induces cytotoxic and immunologic cell death. Since 2021, luvelta was used alone or in combination with AML therapy to treat children with\n CBF/GLIS2\n AML in the context of a compassionate use program. Data from the first 25 children were reported in December 2023\n Blood\n 142 (Supplement 1): 4295. These children represent a heterogenic group with varying prior treatments and disease burden. They included 17 children who started luvelta with \u22655% bone marrow (BM) blasts and 8 children who had < 5% BM blast with persistent MRD positivity. Luvelta was mostly given at doses of 4.3 or 5.2 mg/kg every 2-4 weeks (4 received fractionated doses on days 1, 3, 5 per cycle). Out of 25 children, 21 received \u2265 1 dose of monotherapy initially, while 4 received combination with AML chemotherapy. All participants were followed for long-term survival. Objectives: Determine long-term overall survival (OS) in the first 25 children who received luvelta for\n CBF/GLIS2\n AML.\n Methods:\n All clinical data was reported by compassionate use Investigators. OS was calculated from the date of the first dose of luvelta.\n Results:\n As of July 15, 2024, 7 of 25 children were alive, with a median OS of 8.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3 -20.4). Among the 7 surviving children, 2 received luvelta as monotherapy while 5 received luvelta in combo either from the beginning of treatment or after failing monotherapy. Most of the deaths occurred in children who did not respond (N = 11) or recurred after luvelta (N = 5); two occurred post-transplant, 1 from progression and 1 from infection. Median OS was 9.7 months (95% CI 5.7-29.8) in the 21 children who received non-fractionated doses every 2 to 4 weeks. Overall, MRD negativity was achieved in 10 of the 25 children: the median OS was 29.8 months (95% CI 6.2-Not Reached [NR]) in those who became MRD negative and 5.3 months (95% CI 1.5-8.6) in those who did not. Nine children received hematopoietic stem cell transplants after morphologic and/or molecular response to luvelta. Post transplant median OS was 22.1 months (95% CI 1.8-NR). Five children received post-transplant maintenance.\n Conclusions:\n Luvelta alone or in combination with AML chemotherapy could achieve MRD negativity in more than one third of\n CBF/GLIS2\n AML patients, allowing transplant and resulting survival of more than 2 years. Additional children have received luvelta through compassionate use since 2023 and the pivotal phase 1/2 trial for these patients is now open and enrolling (clinicaltrials.gov NCT06679582).\n",

YL205 is built on the TMALIN platform, which is comprised of an anti-NaPi2b humanized monoclonal antibody and conjugated in a site-specific manner to yield a uniform DAR 8 product. NaPi2b, encoded by the SLC34A2 gene, is a cell surface sodium-dependent phosphate transporter that is highly expressed in certain cancers, including ovarian, lung, thyroid, and breast cancers, with limited expression in normal tissues. This study evaluated the drug properties, efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of YL205 in nonclinical studies. YL205 achieved a high drug-to-antibody ratio through homogeneous conjugation with hydrophilic TMALIN linker-payload, which showed limited impact on the hydrophilicity of the antibody, prolonged the retention time in vivo and eventually enhanced the in vivo potency of ADC. Additionally, YL205 exhibited strong potency, high internalization, potent cytotoxicity and bystander-mediated cell killing toward tumor cells. Significant dose-dependent antitumor activities, including complete tumor regressions with no observable toxicity, were noted in NaPi2b low to high expression ovarian and NSCLC tumor xenograft mouse models. YL205 showed a favorable PK profile evidenced by the overlapping ADC and TAb curves in SD rat and cynomolgus monkey studies. Despite high levels of expression in normal lungs of non-human primates, YL205 exhibited a good safety profile with toxic findings unrelated to normal tissue target expression. Toxicity studies using cynomolgus monkeys showed that YL205 is well tolerated with calculated therapeutic index (TI, HNSTD versus MED) of \ufe6580 for repeat dosing. No drug-related adverse findings were found in the lungs, liver or kidneys when tested in all doses. The highly stable nature of TMALIN linker, together with the high potency of the payload, likely mitigates the potential liability of this normal tissue expression.

However, some of MM patients exhibit primary or acquired resistance to Dara therapy. A CD38 targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) HMA800067 is developed, in which Dara was conjugated with cytotoxic payload via a novel linker, aiming to have superior anti-tumor efficacy to Dara, even in the subjects with resistance to Dara treatment.\n Methods: HMA800067 was characterized by ELISA-based binding assay, cell internalization assay, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) assays. The in vitro anti-tumor potency was assessed against a panel of 24 MM and B cell lymphoma cell lines with various CD38 expressions. Bystander effect of HMA800067 was evaluated in co-culture of CD38\u2212 SU-DHL-2 cells with CD38+ Ramos cells. In vivo anti-tumor efficacy was investigated in the multiple MM and Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) subcutaneous xenograft models, including some non-responsive to Dara.\n Results: HMA800067 displayed comparable binding affinity and internalization capability to Dara in CD38+ Ramos cells. And HMA800067 maintained the ability of Dara to induce the death of CD38+ Daudi cells by ADCC and ADCP, which indicated that conjugation did not change the property of Dara in the ADC upon antigen binding. HMA800067 exhibited a CD38-dependent cytotoxic activity with median IC50 of 0.46 nM against a panel of tumor cell lines, with a trend that the higher CD38 expression, the stronger potency could be seen. Bystander killing effect of HMA800067 was observed in CD38\u2212 cells when co-cultured with CD38+ cells in vitro. Furthermore, with the low release of payload in plasma and sustainable high exposure of payload in the tumor, HMA800067 demonstrated dose-dependent and superior anti-tumor efficacy to Dara in all tested models, and 10 mg/kg induced complete tumor regression in MM RPMI-8226, DLBCL SU-DHL-6 and SU-DHL-10 models. For example, in SU-DHL-6 xenograft model, the treatment of intravenous injection of HMA800067 at 10 mg/kg single dose induced complete tumor regression in all the animals within 10 days of administration, which was maintained until the end of study (day 49), while 10 mg/kg Dara twice a week for 2 weeks inhibited tumor growth within 20%-40% without any tumor regression during a four-week observation post initial dosing.\n Conclusion: HMA800067 demonstrated potent anti-tumor activities in vitro and in vivo in multiple B-cell malignant tumor lines, including those with poor response to Dara. These results supported further development of HMA800067, as a superior therapeutic option for treatment of patients with CD38+ B cell malignancies.\n Citation Format: Yan Xu, Junqing Liang, Shuwen Jiang, Haibin Yang, Hui Zhang, Fangfang Mao, Jiahuan Zhu, Jianlin He, Na Yang, Jian Wang, WeiHan Zhang, Yongxin Ren, Weiguo Su.

MesoC2 is constructed from a recombinant human IgG1 anti-MSLN monoclonal antibody conjugated to a cleavable tripeptide linker that carries a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TOP1) payload. The average number of TOP1 molecules per antibody is 8. Following high-affinity binding to MSLN on the cell surface, MesoC2 is internalized, the linker is cleaved, and the released payload inhibits DNA religation during amplification, leading to cell cycle arrest and cell death. MesoC2 has shown potent antitumor efficacy in in vitro assays and xenograft models and an acceptable safety profile in cynomolgus monkeys. The aim of this first-in-human study is to explore the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of MesoC2 in patients with certain advanced solid tumors.\n Methods:\n In this phase 1, open-label study, up to 365 patients with mesothelioma, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), NSCLC, EC, or CRC will receive intravenous infusion of MesoC2 in dose escalation (n=45), dose and schedule optimization (n=40), and disease-specific dose expansion cohorts (n=280; includes a biology cohort to evaluate exploratory biomarkers). Key inclusion criteria are histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or locally advanced mesothelioma, PROC, PDAC, NSCLC, EC, or CRC who have relapsed or progressed following standard therapies; aged \u226518 years; ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1; and available archival tumor tissue (a fresh biopsy is required if unavailable). Key exclusion criteria include prior or current treatment with systemic anticancer therapy or focal radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to first dose of MesoC2, prior anti-MSLN therapies, and any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than G1 at the time of starting study treatment, except alopecia. Primary endpoints include type, incidence, and severity of adverse events (AEs), frequency of dose modifications due to AEs, incidence of dose-limiting toxicities, cumulative safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity. Key additional endpoints include objective and best response rates per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, MSLN expression in blood and tissue, and changes in tumor-specific biomarkers.

Recent studies have demonstrated that HLA-G is enriched in various malignant cells, providing evidence that HLA-G is strongly associated with tumor immune escape. HLA-G, a tumor-specific antigen, mediates immune suppression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages, by engaging inhibitory receptors such as Ig-like transcript 2 (ILT2) and 4 (ILT4). Therefore, the development of an HLA-G-targeting ADC can be a novel therapeutic strategy not only to induce direct tumor cell killing through payload delivery upon binding to HLA-G, but also to take advantage of the fact that HLA-G is minimally expressed on normal cells and predominantly restricted to tumor cells. This selective expression pattern makes HLA-G a promising target compared to other cancer antigens, in which off-target effects on normal tissues are expected to be minimal. Moreover, by disrupting the interaction between HLA-G and inhibitory receptors such as ILT2, this approach enhances anti-tumor immunity, followed by boosting immune activation and improving therapeutic outcomes. We developed an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting HLA-G (IMB-201) to selectively deliver cytotoxic drugs to HLA-G-expressing tumor cells, thereby overcoming immune suppression and promoting tumor regression. We generated a monoclonal antibody specific to HLA-G and conjugated it with a potent cytotoxic drug via a stable linker. The IMB-201 demonstrated high binding affinity and selectivity for HLA-G-positive tumor cells. In vitro serum and preliminary stability assays confirmed that the stability of IMB-201 is comparable to that of other developed ADCs. In vitro studies revealed significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity when treated to HLA-G-expressing cell lines, with minimal off-target effects on HLA-G-negative cells. In vivo studies employing mouse models demonstrated significant tumor regression and prolonged survival. Collectively, the IMB-201 could be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of HLA-G-positive solid tumors, such as gastric and pancreatic cancers.

The novel linker-payload and site-specific conjugation of YL211 results in a homogeneous product with a DAR (Drug-to-Antibody Ratio) of 8.

The cytotoxic features drive cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, elevation of PARP/caspase 7 expression, as well as cell death and bystander effect. These findings translated in vivo where YL211 showed superior efficacy in causing tumor regressions and good tolerability in both cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (CDX and PDX) mouse models with both low to high cMET expression levels (H358, CR5088, ect.). The in vivo pharmacokinetics in monkeys showed that YL211 is highly stable with less than 0.1% (molar ratio) payload released in circulation. GLP safety evaluations demonstrated good safety profiles and no off-target toxicity in monkeys. These non-clinical data suggest the stability of the linker in circulation as well as efficient release of the payload in tumors with improved therapeutic window.

Here, we report the initial results of a phase I clinical trial of BL-M11D1 in relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML patients.\n Methods:\n This study enrolled patients with R/R AML aged 18-75 years. For dose escalation (D-ESC i3+3), BL-M11D1 was administrated intravenously in dose cohorts from 0.6mg/kg up to 4.4mg/kg once a week (QW) in 28-day cycles for induction treatment, followed by administration every two weeks (Q2W) at the same initial dose for consolidation treatment in pts whose bone marrow (BM) blast \uff1c5%. A subset of pts were enrolled in dose-expansion (D-EXP) at 1.65, 2.2 mg/kg doses.\n Results:\n As of July 25, 2024, 39 patients were enrolled at doses ranging from 0.6 mg/kg to 2.75 mg/kg, with a median age of 53.9 years (range: 19-75 years), including 2 patients with secondary AML. Among them, 10 patients had primary refractory AML, 24 had refractory AML, and 5 had relapsed AML. The median number of prior treatment lines was 4 (range 1-9), including 2 patients who had a previous autologous stem cell transplant. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed at the time of the cutoff date. The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) in \u226520% of pts were white blood cell count decreased (56.4%), anemia (51.3%), hypokalemia (51.3%), platelet count decreased (51.3%), neutrophil count decreased (46.2%), hypoalbuminemia (43.6%), hyponatremia (35.9%), nausea (35.9%), ALT increase (33.3%), pyrexia (28.2%), lymphocyte count decreased (25.6%), vomiting (25.6%), abdominal distension (23.1%), diarrhea (23.1%), and hypoproteinemia (20.5%). Grade \u22653 non-hematologic TRAEs were hypokalemia (25.6%), pneumonia (15.4%), infection (12.8%), pyrexia (5.1%), nausea (5.1%), febrile infection (5.1%), bilirubin increased (5.1%), GGT increase (5.1%), ALP increase (5.1%), ALT increase (2.6%), diarrhea (2.6%), AST increase (2.6%). One patient discontinued treatment. There was no dose reduction necessitated by TRAEs. Two pts died due to infection, which might be associated with BL-M11D1 by investigators' evaluation. No grade 3 or higher organ injury has been seen to date, and no veno-occlusive disease (VOD) observed in any patient.\n Responses have been seen starting at the 1.65 mg/kg dose, with a complete response (CR) of 6+ months duration observed. At doses of 1.65 mg/kg, 2.2 mg/kg and 2.75 mg/kg, 7 pts, 14 pts and 4 pts respectively have been evaluable for efficacy (at least 1 post-treatment assessment). The overall response rate (ORR)* at these doses are 14.3% (1/7), 42.9% (6/14) and 50% (2/4), respectively.\n Note:\n *ORR including CR, CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), and morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS).\n Conclusion:\n The preliminary results of this phase I study have demonstrated BL-M11D1 monotherapy with an acceptable safety profile and encouraging anti-cancer activity, including in refractory patients who had not previously achieved remission from prior therapy. The dose escalation of BL-M11D1 is ongoing, to better define the safety profile, anti-cancer activity and the RP2D for future development.\n",

Based on preclinical characterization, AMB302/GQ1011 exhibits impressive anti-tumor activities against bladder cancer (BC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and glioblastoma (GBM) with either FGFR3 overexpression or FGFR3 alterations including gene fusions, demonstrating potential as a first-in-class FGFR3 ADC against FGFR3 relevant solid tumor indications.\n Methods: For biomarker analysis, patient tissue microarrays and tissue blocks were subjected to IHC staining for FGFR3 to assess its real-world intensity. To characterize AMB302/GQ1011, in vitro assays and ex vivo plasma stability were evaluated to confirm the anti-tumor effect and linker stability. In vivo anti-tumor effects of AMB302/GQ1011 were assessed on various CDX and PDX models with FGFR3 overexpression or alterations.

In IHC analysis, we detected high and widespread FGFR3 expression in various tumors. In in vitro cytotoxicity assay, AMB302/GQ1011 showed excellent antitumor activity against FGFR3-expressing cells. In various CDX and PDX models with FGFR3 expression or alterations, AMB302/GQ1011 demonstrated superior efficacy compared with benchmark ADCs and FGFR pan-inhibitors. AMB302/GQ1011 dramatically prolonged survival in GBM orthotopic PDX models with F3-T3 fusion by >150% in combination with TMZ. Particularly, in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), AMB302/GQ1011 exhibited an excellent synergistic antitumor effect. In a monkey toxicity study, AMB302/GQ1011 demonstrated a high tolerability up to 60 mg/kg dosing, without severe adverse effects.\n Conclusion: AMB302/GQ1011 demonstrated a potent antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo models with FGFR3 overexpression and alterations across various solid tumors.

In this study, the efficacy of SN-38 conjugates prepared with epratuzumab (rapidly internalizing) and veltuzumab (slowly internalizing), humanized anti-CD22 and anti-CD20 IgG, respectively, was examined for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. Both antibody\u2013drug conjugates had similar nanomolar activity against a variety of human lymphoma/leukemia cell lines, but slow release of SN-38 compromised potency discrimination in vitro even against an irrelevant conjugate. When SN-38 was stably linked to the anti-CD22 conjugate, its potency was reduced 40- to 55-fold. Therefore, further studies were conducted only with the less stable, slowly dissociating linker. In vivo, similar antitumor activity was found between CD22 and CD20 antibody\u2013drug conjugate in mice-bearing Ramos xenografts, even though Ramos expressed 15-fold more CD20 than CD22, suggesting that the internalization of the epratuzumab\u2013SN-38 conjugate (Emab\u2013SN-38) enhanced its activity. Emab\u2013SN-38 was more efficacious than a nonbinding, irrelevant IgG\u2013SN-38 conjugate in vivo, eliminating a majority of well-established Ramos xenografts at nontoxic doses. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that Emab\u2013SN-38 could be combined with unconjugated veltuzumab for a more effective treatment. Thus, Emab\u2013SN-38 is active in lymphoma and leukemia at doses well below toxic levels and therefore represents a new promising agent with therapeutic potential alone or combined with anti-CD20 antibody therapy.

DOX release from model substrate Z-Phe-Lys-PABC-DOX 49 was 30-fold faster than from Z-Val-Cit-PABC-DOX 42 with the cysteine protease cathepsin B alone, but rates were identical in a rat liver lysosomal preparation suggesting the participation of more than one enzyme. Conjugates 72 and 73 showed rapid and near quantitative drug release with cathepsin B and in a lysosomal preparation, while demonstrating excellent stability in human plasma.

Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug (Monteiro et al., 2015). Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells (Doronina et al., 2006)(Erickson et al., 2006). In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability. \n\nYelena et al. synthesized the huC242-SMCC-DM1 conjugate binding DM1 to the humanized monoclonal antibody (huC242) via an N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 -carboxylate (SMCC) for non-cleavable thioether linker and tested the cytotoxicity of conjugate on COLO 205 cells and Namalwa cells. Compared with the cantuzumab mertansine (huC242-DM1) containing a cleavable disulfide linker, the huC242-SMCC-DM1 is efficacious only against tumors in which all proliferating cells express the target antigen, and displayed significantly lower in vivo activity in multiple xenograft tumor models (Figure 4) (Kovtun et al., 2006).",

Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates.",

However, resistance to these therapies has been a constant, leading to treatment-failure and new tumor progression. Recently, the kinase-impaired HER3 emerged as a pivotal player in oncogenic signaling, with an important role in both non-treated progression and treatment response. HER2/HER3 dimerization is required for full signaling potential and constitutes the key oncogenic unit. Also, when inhibiting PI3K/AKT pathway (as with anti-HER2 drugs) feedback mechanisms lead to a rebound in HER3 activity, which is one of the main roads to resistance. As current strategies to treat HER2-positive breast cancer are unable to inhibit this feedback response, two great promises emerged: the combination of targeted-therapies and drugs targeting HER3. In this article HER2 and HER3-targeted drugs and possible combinations between them, as well as the biomarkers to predict and monitor these drugs effect, are reviewed.",

MMAF is a new antimitotic auristatin derivative with a charged C-terminal phenylalanine residue that attenuates its cytotoxic activity compared to its uncharged counterpart, MMAE, most likely due to impaired intracellular access. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated that mAb-maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl-MMAF (mAb-L1-MMAF) conjugates were >2200-fold more potent than free MMAF on a large panel of CD30 positive hematologic cell lines. As with cAC10-L1-MMAE, the corresponding MMAF ADC induced cures and regressions of established xenograft tumors at well tolerated doses. To further optimize the ADC, several new linkers were generated in which various components within the L1 linker were either altered or deleted. One of the most promising linkers contained a noncleavable maleimidocaproyl (L4) spacer between the drug and the mAb. cAC10-L4-MMAF was approximately as potent in vitro as cAC10-L1-MMAF against a large panel of cell lines and was equally potent in vivo. Importantly, cAC10-L4-MMAF was tolerated at >3 times the MTD of cAC10-L1-MMAF. LCMS studies indicated that drug released from cAC10-L4-MMAF was the cysteine-L4-MMAF adduct, which likely arises from mAb degradation within the lysosomes of target cells. This new linker technology appears to be ideally suited for drugs that are both relatively cell-impermeable and tolerant of substitution with amino acids. Thus, alterations of the linker have pronounced impacts on toxicity and lead to new ADCs with greatly improved therapeutic indices.",

We found that in culture, conjugates of either drug killed not only the target antigen-positive cells but also the neighboring antigen-negative cells. Furthermore, we showed that, in vivo, these conjugates were effective in eradicating tumors containing both antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells. The presence of antigen-positive cells was required for this killing of bystander cells. This target cell-activated killing of bystander cells was dependent on the nature of the linker between the antibody and the drug. Conjugates linked via a reducible disulfide bond were capable of exerting the bystander effect whereas equally potent conjugates linked via a nonreducible thioether bond were not. Our data offer a rationale for developing optimally constructed antibody-drug conjugates for treating tumors that express the target antigen either in a homogeneous or heterogeneous manner."

Non-cleavable linkers, e.g., the one in trastuzumab emtansine (Figure 3a), remain attached to the cytotoxic drug after proteolytic degradation of the antibody in the lysosome. The drug, with an attached linker and an amino acid or short proteolytic peptide to which the linker is conjugated, is released to the cytosol and exerts its cytotoxic activity (Erickson et al., 2006)[130]. Cleavable linkers, on the other hand, are cleaved by lysosomal enzymes, or by low pH or a reducing environment inside endosomes; the drug-attached fragment after cleavage is typically removed by self-immolative reaction, releasing the free cytotoxic payload (Bargh et al., 2019). Brentuximab vedotin, for example, has a cathepsin-cleavable linker (valine-citrulline linker), and MMAE is released by the self-immolative reaction of the remaining linker fragment (Doronina et al., 2003). \n\nRegardless of the type, the linker for ADC has to be highly stable in blood in order to minimize the release of highly cytotoxic free drugs into circulation and to maintain maximum amount of intact ADC molecules targeting cancer cells. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg\u2122) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa\u2122), for example, both have an acid-labile hydrazone linker, which is relatively stable at pH 7.4 but hydrolyzed with high efficiency in the acidic environment of lysosome [74]. However, the acid-labile hydrazone linker can be considerably less stable than some of the other types of cleavable linkers, which may contribute to the narrow therapeutic window and high toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin [132].",

Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates.",

Non-cleavable linkers, e.g., the one in trastuzumab emtansine (Figure 3a), remain attached to the cytotoxic drug after proteolytic degradation of the antibody in the lysosome. The drug, with an attached linker and an amino acid or short proteolytic peptide to which the linker is conjugated, is released to the cytosol and exerts its cytotoxic activity (Erickson et al., 2006)[130]. Cleavable linkers, on the other hand, are cleaved by lysosomal enzymes, or by low pH or a reducing environment inside endosomes; the drug-attached fragment after cleavage is typically removed by self-immolative reaction, releasing the free cytotoxic payload (Bargh et al., 2019). Brentuximab vedotin, for example, has a cathepsin-cleavable linker (valine-citrulline linker), and MMAE is released by the self-immolative reaction of the remaining linker fragment (Doronina et al., 2003). \n\nRegardless of the type, the linker for ADC has to be highly stable in blood in order to minimize the release of highly cytotoxic free drugs into circulation and to maintain maximum amount of intact ADC molecules targeting cancer cells. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg\u2122) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa\u2122), for example, both have an acid-labile hydrazone linker, which is relatively stable at pH 7.4 but hydrolyzed with high efficiency in the acidic environment of lysosome [74]. However, the acid-labile hydrazone linker can be considerably less stable than some of the other types of cleavable linkers, which may contribute to the narrow therapeutic window and high toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin [132]."

The former can be used either in the design of either an internalizing or not internalizing ADC, because the release of the payload is required to take place in either the extracellular tumor environment, or within the lysosome or cytosol. This is possible because the extracellular environment of the tumor is highly reducing due to the presence of glutathione, which allows the release of payloads linked to the antibody via thiolic bonds. It also allows payload release via the degradation of peptide bonds in the presence of proteases such as Cathepsin B, whose overexpression in cancer drives its normal lysosomal localization towards extracellular secretion (Mohamed et al., 2006). A cleavable linker, therefore, exploits differential conditions of reducing power or enzymatic degradation that can be present either outside or inside the target cell. Due to the chemical reactions needed to release the payload, the site of conjugation on the antibody is crucial to induce both stability in the plasma and availability to reduction or degradation on/into the target cell (Phillips et al., 2008)(Dorywalska et al., 2015). Non-cleavable linker-based ADC must, however, be internalizing, because to release their cytotoxic payload, the antibody component needs to be degraded by lysosomal or cytoplasmic proteases (Lu et al., 2016). Furthermore, drugs linked to such linkers usually cannot exert a by-stander effect because upon degradation of the antibody by cellular proteases, they are released as fragments of antibody peptides that have a poor ability to permeate the cells.",

Two drugs are currently approved for HER2-positive breast cancer: trastuzumab (Herceptin), introduced in 1998, and lapatinib (Tykerb), in 2007. Despite these advances, some patients progress through therapy and succumb to their disease. A variation on antibody-targeted therapy is utilization of antibodies to deliver cytotoxic agents specifically to antigen-expressing tumors. We determined in vitro and in vivo efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of trastuzumab-maytansinoid (microtubule-depolymerizing agents) conjugates using disulfide and thioether linkers. Antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab-maytansinoid conjugates were evaluated on cultured normal and tumor cells. In vivo activity was determined in mouse breast cancer models, and toxicity was assessed in rats as measured by body weight loss. Surprisingly, trastuzumab linked to DM1 through a nonreducible thioether linkage (SMCC), displayed superior activity compared with unconjugated trastuzumab or trastuzumab linked to other maytansinoids through disulfide linkers. Serum concentrations of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 remained elevated compared with other conjugates, and toxicity in rats was negligible compared with free DM1 or trastuzumab linked to DM1 through a reducible linker. Potent activity was observed on all HER2-overexpressing tumor cells, whereas nontransformed cells and tumor cell lines with normal HER2 expression were unaffected. In addition, trastuzumab-DM1 was active on HER2-overexpressing, trastuzumab-refractory tumors. In summary, trastuzumab-DM1 shows greater activity compared with nonconjugated trastuzumab while maintaining selectivity for HER2-overexpressing tumor cells. Because trastuzumab linked to DM1 through a nonreducible linker offers improved efficacy and pharmacokinetics and reduced toxicity over the reducible disulfide linkers evaluated, trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 was selected for clinical development.",

Linkers stable in circulation but readily processed in the target cell are necessary for both safety and potency of the delivered conjugate. Here, we report a range of stabilities for an auristatin-based payload site-specifically attached through a cleavable valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzylcarbamate (VC-PABC) linker across various sites on an antibody. We demonstrate that the conjugation site plays an important role in determining VC-PABC linker stability in mouse plasma, and that the stability of the linker positively correlates with ADC cytotoxic potency both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the VC-PABC cleavage in mouse plasma is not mediated by Cathepsin B, the protease thought to be primarily responsible for linker processing in the lysosomal degradation pathway. Although the VC-PABC cleavage is not detected in primate plasma in vitro, linker stabilization in the mouse is an essential prerequisite for designing successful efficacy and safety studies in rodents during preclinical stages of ADC programs. The divergence of linker metabolism in mouse plasma and its intracellular cleavage offers an opportunity for linker optimization in the circulation without compromising its efficient payload release in the target cell."

All aspects of ADC pharmacology can be influenced by the specific design of the linker, as drug stability into circulation, tumor cell permeability, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR, i.e. the number of payload moleculas carried by each antibody), and extent of the bystander effect (Beck et al., 2017)(Shen et al., 2012).",

Effective linkers have to guarantee ADC stability in the bloodstream as well as to allow an efficient cleavage upon internalization into tumor cells. Linkers can be classified into cleavable and non-cleavable according to their chemical properties (Beck et al., 2017)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016). Non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds resistant to proteolytic degradation, so that cleavage occurs only after lysosome internalization and complete degradation of the antibody. These linkers have higher stability than cleavable ones, but can suffer from lower membrane permeability. Conversely, cleavage of cleavable linkers can depend on external pH (acid-labile linkers), specific lysosomal proteases (protease-cleavable linkers) or glutathione reduction (disulphide linkers) (Beck et al., 2017)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016)(Shen et al., 2012)(Bargh et al., 2019). All aspects of ADC pharmacology can be influenced by the specific design of the linker, as drug stability into circulation, tumor cell permeability, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR, i.e. the number of payload moleculas carried by each antibody), and extent of the bystander effect (Beck et al., 2017)(Shen et al., 2012)."

Upon binding to HER2, the conjugate is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and an active derivative of DM1 is subsequently released by proteolytic degradation of the antibody moiety within the lysosome. Initial clinical evaluation led to a phase III trial in advanced HER2-positive breast cancer patients who had relapsed after prior treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, which showed that T-DM1 significantly prolonged progression-free and overall survival with less toxicity than lapatinib plus capecitabine.

A conjugate of a calicheamicin hydrazide derivative attached via hydrazone formation to the oxidized carbohydrates of the anti-CD33 murine antibody P67.6 had been chosen for use in AML prior to humanization of this antibody. However, the CDR-grafted humanized P67.6 could not be used to make the carbohydrate conjugate because of the unexpected sensitivity of this antibody to periodate oxidation. Exploration of a series of bifunctional linkers resulted in a new class of calicheamicin conjugates, termed the hybrid conjugates, that allows for the attachment of the calicheamicin to lysines but incorporates the site of hydrolytic release, a hydrazone, previously shown to be required for activity. The optimized conjugate chosen for clinical trials, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (\"gem-ozo\", Mylotarg, formerly designated CMA-676), was significantly more potent and selective than the carbohydrate conjugate it replaced. It was selectively cytotoxic to HL-60 leukemia cells in tissue culture with an IC(50) in the low to sub-pg cal/mL range (cal = calicheamicin equivalents). Doses of gem-ozo as low as 50 microg cal/kg given three times to mice bearing HL-60 xenografts routinely resulted in long-term, tumor-free survivors, while a nonbinding control conjugate was relatively inactive. Gem-ozo at a concentration of 2 to 10 ng cal/mL selectively inhibited leukemia colony formation by marrow cells from a significant proportion of AML patients. Gem-ozo has also shown significant activity against AML in Phase II trials and is the first antibody-targeted chemotherapeutic agent approved by the FDA."

The ADCs prepared by non-cleavable linkers rely on the complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody after internalization to release the cytotoxic small molecule drug. The ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are dependent on the biology of the target cell compared to cleavable linkers and have an improved therapeutic index due to their greater plasma stability. Since non-cleavable linkers can provide greater stability and tolerance than cleavable linkers, in the circulation, these linkers reduce off-target toxicity and also provide a larger therapeutic window (Tsuchikama et al., 2017)(Walles et al., 2018)(Thorpe et al., 1987).",

Current efforts in the conjugation and linker chemistries will provide greater insights into molecular design and strategies for clinically effective ADCs from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints.

Non-cleavable linkers do not have a designated weak point in their structure that can lead to cleavage by proteases, hydrolases or chemically by pH changes. Consequently, when designing a conjugate, the choice of a non-cleavable over a cleavable linker is usually a consequence of pursuing a certain mode of action where the stability of the complex is more important than a fast liberation of the active moiety. Linkers of various length, polarity, stability and flexibility are used for different types of conjugates and the linker design is mostly driven by the particular purpose and desired mode of action.

Non-cleavable linkers are a new generation of linkers with improved plasma stability compared to cleavable linkers. The ADCs prepared by non-cleavable linkers rely on the complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody after internalization to release the cytotoxic small molecule drug. The ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are dependent on the biology of the target cell compared to cleavable linkers and have an improved therapeutic index due to their greater plasma stability. Since non-cleavable linkers can provide greater stability and tolerance than cleavable linkers, in the circulation, these linkers reduce off-target toxicity and also provide a larger therapeutic window (Tsuchikama et al., 2017)(Walles et al., 2018)(Thorpe et al., 1987)."

Developments in linker technology have greatly increased the ability of ADCs to selectively deliver their payload to target cells while limiting their systemic effects (Peters et al., 2015). Linkers generally fall into one of two categories: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers rely on differences in the blood microenvironment and intracellular tumor environment to induce linker degradation. These take three forms: hydrazone, disulfide and peptide linkers, each of which is cleaved or degraded through a different mechanism (Peters et al., 2015). Hydrazone linkers are pH-sensitive and undergo acidic hydrolysis in the lysosomal microenvironment (Peters et al., 2015). Disulfide linkers are degraded by thiols, which commonly accumulate in tumor cells, where they act as antioxidants (Peters et al., 2015)(Harris et al., 2015). Peptide linkers are degraded by pH-dependent proteases, which are only active in the lysosome (Peters et al., 2015). ADCs with non-cleavable linkers rely on the near-complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody to release the cytotoxic agent. This makes them entirely dependent on being endocytosed to release their drug product.

Non-cleavable linkers do not have a designated weak point in their structure that can lead to cleavage by proteases, hydrolases or chemically by pH changes. Consequently, when designing a conjugate, the choice of a non-cleavable over a cleavable linker is usually a consequence of pursuing a certain mode of action where the stability of the complex is more important than a fast liberation of the active moiety. Linkers of various length, polarity, stability and flexibility are used for different types of conjugates and the linker design is mostly driven by the particular purpose and desired mode of action.

                "snippets": "In contrast to cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma but require the complete intracellular proteolytic catabolism of the ADCs to yield cytotoxic metabolites. These metabolites typically consist of the intact linker-payload attached to the conjugating amino acid residue from the antibodies, such as lysine-SMCC-DM1 for trastuzumab emtansine or cysteine-MC-MMAF for belantamab mafodotin (Lu et al., 2016). These metabolites are often charged and exhibit low permeability through cell membranes (Mccombs et al., 2015). Although ADCs employing non-cleavable linkers generally show a more favorable tolerability, potentially due to reduced off-target toxicity relating to free payload exposure, ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate a superior efficacy (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). This enhanced efficacy is partially attributed to the bystander effect, which refers to the ability of the free payload to diffuse from intracellular sites of ADC catabolism and payload release to neighboring cells within the local tumor environment (Singh et al., 2016). ADCs with lipophilic payloads and cleavable linkers, which make up more than 80% of the currently approved ADCs, are the preferred choice for the treatment of cancers associated with heterogeneous antigen expression or slow rates of antigen/ADC internalization (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues.",

These metabolites typically consist of the intact linker-payload attached to the conjugating amino acid residue from the antibodies, such as lysine-SMCC-DM1 for trastuzumab emtansine or cysteine-MC-MMAF for belantamab mafodotin (Lu et al., 2016). These metabolites are often charged and exhibit low permeability through cell membranes (Mccombs et al., 2015). Although ADCs employing non-cleavable linkers generally show a more favorable tolerability, potentially due to reduced off-target toxicity relating to free payload exposure, ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate a superior efficacy (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). This enhanced efficacy is partially attributed to the bystander effect, which refers to the ability of the free payload to diffuse from intracellular sites of ADC catabolism and payload release to neighboring cells within the local tumor environment (Singh et al., 2016). ADCs with lipophilic payloads and cleavable linkers, which make up more than 80% of the currently approved ADCs, are the preferred choice for the treatment of cancers associated with heterogeneous antigen expression or slow rates of antigen/ADC internalization (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues."

Optimal linkers are stable in the circulation, which prevents premature payload release and systemic toxicities, but then rapidly cleaved once internalised in malignant cells, promoting efficient cell death (Su et al., 2021)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016). There are two types of linkers, classified based on the payload release mechanism: cleavable and noncleavable (Su et al., 2021). Cleavable linkers are designed to be degraded intracellularly, in response to a change from the extracellular environment to the intracellular environment (Tsuchikama et al., 2016). There are a variety of triggers for the degradation of cleavable linkers, including specific lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B (which cleaves Val-Cit and Val-Ala linkers coupled with PABC), acidic pH (which cleaves hydrazone), and glutathione (which cleaves disulfide bonds) (Tsuchikama et al., 2016). The majority of currently approved ADCs use cleavable linkers, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (Fu et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021). The advantages of cleavable linkers are the intracellular release of the payload and stability in the circulation, while disadvantages include potential premature cleavage in the peripheral circulation (Tsuchikama et al., 2016)(Gondi et al., 2013)(Doronina et al., 2008)(Baah et al., 2021). \n\nIn contrast, non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds that are resistant to proteolysis (Su et al., 2021). ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers rely on the near complete degradation of the antibody component by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases, which leaves the payload attached to the linker and an amino acid residue derived from the antibody [21].",

Compared to traditional small-molecule approaches, ADCs offer enhanced targeting of cancer cells along with reduced toxic side effects, making them an attractive prospect in the field of oncology. To this end, this tutorial review aims to serve as a reference material for ADCs and give readers a comprehensive understanding of ADCs; it explores and explains each ADC component (monoclonal antibody, linker moiety and cytotoxic payload) individually, highlights several EMA- and FDA-approved ADCs by way of case studies and offers a brief future perspective on the field of ADC research.",

Our lead agent, SGN-35, consists of the cAC10 antibody linked to the N-terminal amino acid of monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) via a valine-citrulline p-aminobenzylcarbamate (val-cit-PABC) linker that is cleaved by intracellular proteases such as cathepsin B. More recently, we developed an auristatin F (AF) derivative monomethylauristatin F (MMAF), which unlike MMAE contains the amino acid phenylalanine at the C-terminal position. Because of the negatively charged C-terminal residue, the potency of AF and MMAF is impaired. However, their ability to kill target cells is greatly enhanced through facilitated cellular uptake by internalizing mAbs. Here, we explore the effects of linker technology on AF-based ADC potency, activity, and tolerability by generating a diverse set of dipeptide linkers between the C-terminal residue and the mAb carrier. The resulting ADCs differed widely in activity, with some having significantly improved therapeutic indices compared to the original mAb-Val-Cit-PABC-MMAF conjugate. The therapeutic index was increased yet further by generating dipeptide-based ADCs utilizing new auristatins with methionine or tryptophan as the C-terminal drug residue. These results demonstrate that manipulation of the C-terminal peptide sequence used to attach auristatins to the mAb carrier can lead to highly potent and specific conjugates with greatly improved therapeutic windows.",

There are a variety of triggers for the degradation of cleavable linkers, including specific lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B (which cleaves Val-Cit and Val-Ala linkers coupled with PABC), acidic pH (which cleaves hydrazone), and glutathione (which cleaves disulfide bonds) (Tsuchikama et al., 2016). The majority of currently approved ADCs use cleavable linkers, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (Fu et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021). The advantages of cleavable linkers are the intracellular release of the payload and stability in the circulation, while disadvantages include potential premature cleavage in the peripheral circulation (Tsuchikama et al., 2016)(Gondi et al., 2013)(Doronina et al., 2008)(Baah et al., 2021). \n\nIn contrast, non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds that are resistant to proteolysis (Su et al., 2021). ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers rely on the near complete degradation of the antibody component by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases, which leaves the payload attached to the linker and an amino acid residue derived from the antibody [21]."

                "snippets": "Depending on the methods of releasing the payload in cells, there are two types of linkers, including cleavable and non-cleavable [22]. The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity (Nolting, 2013). Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level (Zhang et al., 2019). The enzyme sensitive linkers are sensitive to the lysosomal protease that is generally overexpressed in cancer cells, enabling an accurate drug release in the cells after internalization (Gondi et al., 2013). ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Kovtun et al., 2006), and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28].",

However, detailed enzymatic catalytic mechanism relating cleavage of disulfide bonds in xenobiotics is not well understood. This study reports an enzymatic mechanism of cleavage of disulfide bonds in xenobiotic small molecules and antibody conjugate (ADC) linkers. The chemically stable disulfide bonds in substituted disulfide-containing pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD, pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine) monomer prodrugs in presence of glutathione or cysteine were found to be unstable in incubations in whole blood of humans and rats. It was shown the enzymes involved were thioredoxin (TRX) and glutaredoxin (GRX). For a diverse set of drug-linker conjugates, we determined that TRX in the presence of TRX-reductase and NADPH generated the cleaved products that are consistent with catalytic disulfide cleavage and linker immolation. GRX was less rigorously studied; in the set of compounds studied, its role in the catalytic cleavage was also confirmed. Collectively, these in vitro experiments demonstrate that TRX as well as GRX can catalyze the cleavage of disulfide bonds in both small molecules and linkers of ADCs.",

Humanized 1F6 (h1F6) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD70, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family that is expressed on hematologic malignancies and carcinomas. Here, we tested h1F6\u2013maleimidocaproyl (mc) MMAF conjugates, consisting of an uncleavable mc linker, for their ability to interfere with the growth of CD70-positive carcinomas. Experimental Design: To evaluate the optimal drug per antibody ratio, we conjugated either four or eight MMAF molecules to the cysteines that comprise the interchain disulfides of h1F6 and determined antitumor activities in vitro and in xenografted mice. The tumor types tested included glioblastoma, patient-derived renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell isolates, and standard RCC tumor cell lines. Results: All h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates potently interfered with the growth of all carcinomas in vitro and resulted in complete responses of RCC tumors implanted orthotopically or s.c. in mice. In vitro, h1F6-mcMMAF(8) was generally more potent than h1F6-mcMMAF(4). However, h1F6-mcMMAF(4) displayed equal or better efficacy than h1F6-mcMMAF(8) when administered to tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions: We showed that h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates inhibited the growth of human carcinomas and that increased drug loading, while improving potency in vitro, did not substantially affect the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. Based on these findings, h1F6-mcMMAF(4), designated SGN-75, has been identified as a potential antibody-drug conjugate for clinical development.",

We found that in culture, conjugates of either drug killed not only the target antigen-positive cells but also the neighboring antigen-negative cells. Furthermore, we showed that, in vivo, these conjugates were effective in eradicating tumors containing both antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells. The presence of antigen-positive cells was required for this killing of bystander cells. This target cell-activated killing of bystander cells was dependent on the nature of the linker between the antibody and the drug. Conjugates linked via a reducible disulfide bond were capable of exerting the bystander effect whereas equally potent conjugates linked via a nonreducible thioether bond were not. Our data offer a rationale for developing optimally constructed antibody-drug conjugates for treating tumors that express the target antigen either in a homogeneous or heterogeneous manner."

Despite recent successes, many ADCs fail during clinical development due to excessive toxicities and unfavorable risk-benefit profiles. Even for those ADCs that have been approved for clinical use, a substantial fraction of treated patients require dose reduction, treatment delays, or treatment discontinuation due to intolerable ADC-associated toxicity. In this report, we review the mechanisms contributing to the clinical toxicity of ADCs, and we discuss strategies to improve ADC tolerability. Abstract Anti-cancer antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) aim to expand the therapeutic index of traditional chemotherapy by employing the targeting specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to increase the efficiency of the delivery of potent cytotoxic agents to malignant cells. In the past three years, the number of ADCs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tripled. Although several ADCs have demonstrated sufficient efficacy and safety to warrant FDA approval, the clinical use of all ADCs leads to substantial toxicity in treated patients, and many ADCs have failed during clinical development due to their unacceptable toxicity profiles. Analysis of the clinical data has demonstrated that dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are often shared by different ADCs that deliver the same cytotoxic payload, independent of the antigen that is targeted and/or the type of cancer that is treated. DLTs are commonly associated with cells and tissues that do not express the targeted antigen (i.e., off-target toxicity), and often limit ADC dosage to levels below those required for optimal anti-cancer effects. In this manuscript, we review the fundamental mechanisms contributing to ADC toxicity, we summarize common ADC treatment-related adverse events, and we discuss several approaches to mitigating ADC toxicity.",

Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives.",

All patients received Mylotarg as a 2-hour intravenous infusion, at a dose of 9 mg/m(2), at 2-week intervals for two doses. Patients were evaluated for remission, survival, and treatment-emergent adverse events.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty percent of patients treated with Mylotarg obtained remission as characterized by 5% or less blasts in the marrow, recovery of neutrophils to at least 1,500/microL, and RBC and platelet transfusion independence. Although patients treated with Mylotarg had relatively high incidences of myelosuppression, grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia (23%), and elevated hepatic transaminase levels (17%), the incidences of grade 3 or 4 mucositis (4%) and infections (28%) were relatively low. There was a low incidence of severe nausea and vomiting (11%) and no treatment-related cardiotoxicity, cerebellar toxicity, or alopecia. Many patients received Mylotarg on an outpatient basis (38% and 41% of patients for the first and second doses, respectively). Among the 142 patients, the median total duration of hospitalization was 24 days; 16% of patients required 7 days of hospitalization or less.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAdministration of the antibody-targeted chemotherapy agent Mylotarg to patients with CD33-positive AML in first relapse induces complete remissions with what appears to be a favorable safety profile."

An ideal linker should possess high water solubility, preventing both aggregation of the ADC and premature payload release in systemic circulation (39). Regarding intracellular stability and degradation patterns, linkers are classified into two distinct categories: cleavable and non-cleavable (Tsuchikama et al., 2016). Cleavable linkers exhibit sensitivity to intracellular environmental conditions and could be cleaved by acid, protease, a reducing substance, and so on (Tsuchikama et al., 2016). Typically, these linkers, including hydrazone bonds, disulfide bonds, and polypeptides, are cleaved within endosomes or lysosomes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers undergo cleavage only within lysosomes, leading to the degradation of their associated payloads into amino acids (Lu et al., 2016). Significantly, non-cleavable linkers offer the benefits of an enhanced therapeutic index and reduced off-target toxicity (Mccombs et al., 2015). While each strategy presents its own advantages and drawbacks, the optimal linker and conjugation chemistry must be precisely tailored to align with the specific properties of the antibody, the drug molecule, and the disease profile being targeted.",

Conversely, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasm, so that they release payload only after complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody and limit premature release of payload. Whereas these features of non-cleavable linkers offer less toxicity, bystander effect is not expected because of the extremely low cell membrane permeability."

Consequently, this therapeutic strategy offers a small therapeutic window with potentially high toxicity and thus limited efficacy of doses that can be tolerated by patients. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of anti-cancer therapeutic drugs that can deliver highly cytotoxic molecules directly to cancer cells. To date, twelve ADCs have received market approval, with several others in clinical stages. ADCs have become a powerful class of therapeutic agents in oncology and hematology. ADCs consist of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are covalently bound to cytotoxic chemicals via synthetic linkers. The linker has a key role in ADC outcomes because its characteristics substantially impact the therapeutic index efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs. Stable linkers and ADCs can maintain antibody concentration in blood circulation, and they do not release the cytotoxic drug before it reaches its target, thus resulting in minimum off-target effects. The linkers used in ADC development can be classified as cleavable and non-cleavable. The former, in turn, can be grouped into three types: hydrazone, disulfide, or peptide linkers. In this review, we highlight the various linkers used in ADC development and their design strategy, release mechanisms, and future perspectives."

The complex interaction of ADCs with the tumor and its microenvironment appear to be reliant on the efficacy of a certain ADC, all of which have significant therapeutic consequences. Several clinical trials in various tumor types are now underway to examine the potential ADC therapy, based on encouraging preclinical results. This review tackles the potential use of ADCs in cancer therapy, emphasizing the essential processes underlying their positive therapeutic impacts on solid and hematological malignancies. Additionally, opportunities are explored to understand the mechanisms of ADCs action, the mechanism of resistance against ADCs, and how to overcome potential resistance following ADCs administration. Recent clinical findings have aroused interest, leading to a large increase in the number of ADCs in clinical trials. The rationale behind ADCs, as well as their primary features and recent research breakthroughs, will be discussed. We then offer an approach for maximizing the potential value that ADCs can bring to cancer patients by highlighting key ideas and distinct strategies."

Cleavable linkers are versatile and widely employed in ADC development. These linkers chemically release the payload through reduction, proteolysis, or hydrolysis based on specific tumor cell-associated processes, such as acidification, glutathione reduction, or lysosomal protease activity (Bargh et al., 2019)(Nolting, 2013). Non-cleavable linkers consist of chemical structures that are not fragmented by enzymatic degradation. They resist conventional biochemical processes and require complete lysosomal degradation for payload release. This increases the likelihood of payload release within the target cells while minimizing cytotoxic effects on healthy cells (Oflazoglu et al., 2008). Non-cleavable linkers generally result in less toxicity and have a longer half-life when compared to cleavable linkers (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021). One major disadvantage of non-cleavable linkers, however, is the lack of antitumor activity against adjacent neoplastic cells that may not express the target antigen of the ADC (i.e., bystander killing) (Ogitani et al., 2016).",

In this study, the bystander killing effect of DS\u20108201a was evaluated and compared with that of T\u2010DM1. We confirmed that the payload of DS\u20108201a, DXd (1), was highly membrane\u2010permeable whereas that of T\u2010DM1, Lys\u2010SMCC\u2010DM1, had a low level of permeability.

Humanized 1F6 (h1F6) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD70, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family that is expressed on hematologic malignancies and carcinomas. Here, we tested h1F6\u2013maleimidocaproyl (mc) MMAF conjugates, consisting of an uncleavable mc linker, for their ability to interfere with the growth of CD70-positive carcinomas. Experimental Design: To evaluate the optimal drug per antibody ratio, we conjugated either four or eight MMAF molecules to the cysteines that comprise the interchain disulfides of h1F6 and determined antitumor activities in vitro and in xenografted mice. The tumor types tested included glioblastoma, patient-derived renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell isolates, and standard RCC tumor cell lines. Results: All h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates potently interfered with the growth of all carcinomas in vitro and resulted in complete responses of RCC tumors implanted orthotopically or s.c. in mice. In vitro, h1F6-mcMMAF(8) was generally more potent than h1F6-mcMMAF(4). However, h1F6-mcMMAF(4) displayed equal or better efficacy than h1F6-mcMMAF(8) when administered to tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions: We showed that h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates inhibited the growth of human carcinomas and that increased drug loading, while improving potency in vitro, did not substantially affect the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. Based on these findings, h1F6-mcMMAF(4), designated SGN-75, has been identified as a potential antibody-drug conjugate for clinical development.",

Current efforts in the conjugation and linker chemistries will provide greater insights into molecular design and strategies for clinically effective ADCs from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints.

Despite recent successes, many ADCs fail during clinical development due to excessive toxicities and unfavorable risk-benefit profiles. Even for those ADCs that have been approved for clinical use, a substantial fraction of treated patients require dose reduction, treatment delays, or treatment discontinuation due to intolerable ADC-associated toxicity. In this report, we review the mechanisms contributing to the clinical toxicity of ADCs, and we discuss strategies to improve ADC tolerability. Abstract Anti-cancer antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) aim to expand the therapeutic index of traditional chemotherapy by employing the targeting specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to increase the efficiency of the delivery of potent cytotoxic agents to malignant cells. In the past three years, the number of ADCs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tripled. Although several ADCs have demonstrated sufficient efficacy and safety to warrant FDA approval, the clinical use of all ADCs leads to substantial toxicity in treated patients, and many ADCs have failed during clinical development due to their unacceptable toxicity profiles. Analysis of the clinical data has demonstrated that dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are often shared by different ADCs that deliver the same cytotoxic payload, independent of the antigen that is targeted and/or the type of cancer that is treated. DLTs are commonly associated with cells and tissues that do not express the targeted antigen (i.e., off-target toxicity), and often limit ADC dosage to levels below those required for optimal anti-cancer effects. In this manuscript, we review the fundamental mechanisms contributing to ADC toxicity, we summarize common ADC treatment-related adverse events, and we discuss several approaches to mitigating ADC toxicity."

These linkers enhance plasma stability, rendering them less susceptible to the chemical or enzymatic environment in vivo following the internalization of ADCs by target cells (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Su et al., 2021). Once internalized, the antibody component of the ADCs is degraded within lysosomes, resulting in a complex of amino acids, linker, and cytotoxic agent. This mechanism ensures precise drug delivery to tumor cells, minimizing nonspecific drug release and reducing off-target effects (Kostova et al., 2021)...Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy. These linkers also tend to inhibit bystander effects, because the released catabolites have poor cellular permeability. Consequently, identifying alternatives to improve drug release and enhance therapeutic outcomes has become a major focus of ongoing research.",

Humanized 1F6 (h1F6) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD70, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family that is expressed on hematologic malignancies and carcinomas. Here, we tested h1F6\u2013maleimidocaproyl (mc) MMAF conjugates, consisting of an uncleavable mc linker, for their ability to interfere with the growth of CD70-positive carcinomas. Experimental Design: To evaluate the optimal drug per antibody ratio, we conjugated either four or eight MMAF molecules to the cysteines that comprise the interchain disulfides of h1F6 and determined antitumor activities in vitro and in xenografted mice. The tumor types tested included glioblastoma, patient-derived renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell isolates, and standard RCC tumor cell lines. Results: All h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates potently interfered with the growth of all carcinomas in vitro and resulted in complete responses of RCC tumors implanted orthotopically or s.c. in mice. In vitro, h1F6-mcMMAF(8) was generally more potent than h1F6-mcMMAF(4). However, h1F6-mcMMAF(4) displayed equal or better efficacy than h1F6-mcMMAF(8) when administered to tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions: We showed that h1F6-mcMMAF conjugates inhibited the growth of human carcinomas and that increased drug loading, while improving potency in vitro, did not substantially affect the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. Based on these findings, h1F6-mcMMAF(4), designated SGN-75, has been identified as a potential antibody-drug conjugate for clinical development.",

Previously, we have investigated key linker parameters such as conjugation chemistry (e.g., maleimide vs. disulfide), linker length and linker steric hindrance and their impacts on PK and efficacy profiles. Herein, we discuss our perspectives on development of integrated strategies for linker design to achieve a balance between ADC stability and payload release efficiency for desired efficacy in antigen-expressing xenograft models. The strategies have been successfully applied to the design of site-specific THIOMABTM antibody-drug conjugates (TDCs) with different payloads.

Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates.",

The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, proteasecleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers. Acid-cleavable linkers such as hydrazine linkers are designed to be stable at a neutral pH of circulation but can be hydrolyzed in lysosomes with a low pH environment...ADCs with disulfide linkers take advantage of reduced glutathione with high intracellular concentrations to release free drug inside the cell. ADCs with reducible disulfide linkers generate uncharged metabolites that can diffuse into neighboring cells and elicit bystander killing, which is essential for killing heterogeneous tumors (Mccombs et al., 2015)(Chari et al., 2014). \n\nADCs with cleavable linkers have broader efficacy and faster rates of activating and releasing cytotoxic drugs for most cell lines. In contrast, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers can possibly provide increased plasma stability, greater therapeutic window, and reduced off-target toxicity. To reduce aggregation and improve the solubility of some ADCs, hydrophilic linkers such as \u03b2-glucuronide linker, Sulfo-SPDB, and Mal-PEG4-NHS were investigated (Lu et al., 2016)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016). In short, each type of linker has advantages and disadvantages, and each can be modified to achieve a fine balance between target efficacies and undesired toxicities (Lu et al., 2016).",

ADCs with reducible disulfide linkers generate uncharged metabolites that can diffuse into neighboring cells and elicit bystander killing, which is essential for killing heterogeneous tumors (Mccombs et al., 2015)(Chari et al., 2014). \n\nADCs with cleavable linkers have broader efficacy and faster rates of activating and releasing cytotoxic drugs for most cell lines. In contrast, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers can possibly provide increased plasma stability, greater therapeutic window, and reduced off-target toxicity. To reduce aggregation and improve the solubility of some ADCs, hydrophilic linkers such as \u03b2-glucuronide linker, Sulfo-SPDB, and Mal-PEG4-NHS were investigated (Lu et al., 2016)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016). In short, each type of linker has advantages and disadvantages, and each can be modified to achieve a fine balance between target efficacies and undesired toxicities (Lu et al., 2016)."

Cleavable linkers are designed to release their payload upon encountering specific conditions within the tumor microenvironment or cellular compartments, such as acidic pH (acid-labile linkers), reducing environments (disulfide linkers), or the presence of specific enzymes (enzyme-cleavable linkers like cathepsin B-sensitive peptide linkers). In contrast, non-cleavable linkers remain intact even after internalization, requiring complete degradation of the antibody within lysosomes to release the active drug, typically with an amino acid residue still attached to the payload. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe choice between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers significantly impacts multiple aspects of ADC performance, including plasma stability, mechanism of payload release, bystander killing effect, and ultimately the therapeutic window for specific cancer indications.

Cleavable linkers are designed to respond to specific conditions within the target cells or tumor microenvironment to release their payloads. These conditions include acidic pH (acid-labile hydrazone linkers), reducing environments (disulfide linkers), or the presence of specific enzymes (enzyme-cleavable linkers such as cathepsin B-sensitive peptide linkers) <Paper corpusId=\"211564536\" paperTitle=\"(Shim, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This results in the release of the cytotoxic payload with an amino acid residue or short peptide fragment still attached to the linker-drug complex <Paper corpusId=\"211564536\" paperTitle=\"(Shim, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"10886659\" paperTitle=\"(Erickson et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) exemplifies this approach, where complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody is required to release the active drug-linker-lysine complex <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"22190744\" paperTitle=\"(Lambert et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe requirement for antibody internalization differs between these linker types. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers must be internalized to release their payloads, as they depend entirely on intracellular proteolytic degradation of the antibody <Paper corpusId=\"220976686\" paperTitle=\"(Ponziani et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. While most cleavable linker ADCs also rely on internalization for optimal efficacy, some can potentially release their payloads in the extracellular tumor environment, particularly those employing disulfide or certain enzyme-sensitive linkers <Paper corpusId=\"220976686\" paperTitle=\"(Ponziani et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe different mechanisms of payload release also affect the chemical nature of the released cytotoxic agent. Cleavable linkers typically employ a self-immolative reaction after cleavage to release the free cytotoxic payload without additional moieties <Paper corpusId=\"211564536\" paperTitle=\"(Shim, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"195879565\" paperTitle=\"(Bargh et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. In contrast, the active metabolites from non-cleavable linker ADCs retain the linker attached to an amino acid residue from the antibody, resulting in charged metabolites with reduced membrane permeability <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese mechanistic differences have significant implications for ADC design, including the selection of appropriate payloads and target antigens. While non-cleavable linkers offer enhanced stability, they typically require payloads that remain active despite modifications <Paper corpusId=\"240195185\" paperTitle=\"(Pettinato, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "Linkers for ADCs can be classified into cleavable and non-cleavable ones. Non-cleavable linkers, e.g., the one in trastuzumab emtansine (Figure 3a), remain attached to the cytotoxic drug after proteolytic degradation of the antibody in the lysosome. The drug, with an attached linker and an amino acid or short proteolytic peptide to which the linker is conjugated, is released to the cytosol and exerts its cytotoxic activity (Erickson et al., 2006)[130]. Cleavable linkers, on the other hand, are cleaved by lysosomal enzymes, or by low pH or a reducing environment inside endosomes; the drug-attached fragment after cleavage is typically removed by self-immolative reaction, releasing the free cytotoxic payload (Bargh et al., 2019). Brentuximab vedotin, for example, has a cathepsin-cleavable linker (valine-citrulline linker), and MMAE is released by the self-immolative reaction of the remaining linker fragment (Doronina et al., 2003). \n\nRegardless of the type, the linker for ADC has to be highly stable in blood in order to minimize the release of highly cytotoxic free drugs into circulation and to maintain maximum amount of intact ADC molecules targeting cancer cells. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg\u2122) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa\u2122), for example, both have an acid-labile hydrazone linker, which is relatively stable at pH 7.4 but hydrolyzed with high efficiency in the acidic environment of lysosome [74]. However, the acid-labile hydrazone linker can be considerably less stable than some of the other types of cleavable linkers, which may contribute to the narrow therapeutic window and high toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin [132]."

                            "The linker connects the antibody and the cytotoxic payload and is a key component in the function of ADCs. The linker imparts the following characteristics to ADCs: (1) high stability in the circulation, and (2) specific release of payload in the target tissue. These seemingly contradictory requirements of stability and release lead to the major challenge in the development of linkers. To achieve the above requirement, various linkers have been developed and can be divided into two types according to their cleavage method. The first type is the cleavable linker, which has a chemical trigger in its structure that can be efficiently cleaved to release the cytotoxic payload in the tumor. More than 80% of the clinically approved ADCs employ cleavable linkers (Lyon, 2018) , such as inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa) and brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris) (Hamann et al., 2002)(Perini et al., 2013) . The other type of linker is noncleavable. In contrast to the cleavable linker, there are no chemical triggers in this structure, and the linker is part of the payload. This type of linker has been employed only in adotrastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla, T-DM1) among the approved ADCs (Lambert et al., 2014) ."

                            "Antibody-drug conjugates are targeted anticancer agents consisting of a cytotoxic drug covalently linked to a monoclonal antibody for tumor antigen-specific activity. Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates."

                            "In contrast to cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma but require the complete intracellular proteolytic catabolism of the ADCs to yield cytotoxic metabolites. These metabolites typically consist of the intact linker-payload attached to the conjugating amino acid residue from the antibodies, such as lysine-SMCC-DM1 for trastuzumab emtansine or cysteine-MC-MMAF for belantamab mafodotin (Lu et al., 2016). These metabolites are often charged and exhibit low permeability through cell membranes (Mccombs et al., 2015). Although ADCs employing non-cleavable linkers generally show a more favorable tolerability, potentially due to reduced off-target toxicity relating to free payload exposure, ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate a superior efficacy (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). This enhanced efficacy is partially attributed to the bystander effect, which refers to the ability of the free payload to diffuse from intracellular sites of ADC catabolism and payload release to neighboring cells within the local tumor environment (Singh et al., 2016). ADCs with lipophilic payloads and cleavable linkers, which make up more than 80% of the currently approved ADCs, are the preferred choice for the treatment of cancers associated with heterogeneous antigen expression or slow rates of antigen/ADC internalization (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues."

Upon binding to HER2, the conjugate is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and an active derivative of DM1 is subsequently released by proteolytic degradation of the antibody moiety within the lysosome. Initial clinical evaluation led to a phase III trial in advanced HER2-positive breast cancer patients who had relapsed after prior treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, which showed that T-DM1 significantly prolonged progression-free and overall survival with less toxicity than lapatinib plus capecitabine.

                            "There are two types of linkers available: cleavable and non-cleavable (Figure 3). The former can be used either in the design of either an internalizing or not internalizing ADC, because the release of the payload is required to take place in either the extracellular tumor environment, or within the lysosome or cytosol. This is possible because the extracellular environment of the tumor is highly reducing due to the presence of glutathione, which allows the release of payloads linked to the antibody via thiolic bonds. It also allows payload release via the degradation of peptide bonds in the presence of proteases such as Cathepsin B, whose overexpression in cancer drives its normal lysosomal localization towards extracellular secretion (Mohamed et al., 2006). A cleavable linker, therefore, exploits differential conditions of reducing power or enzymatic degradation that can be present either outside or inside the target cell. Due to the chemical reactions needed to release the payload, the site of conjugation on the antibody is crucial to induce both stability in the plasma and availability to reduction or degradation on/into the target cell (Phillips et al., 2008)(Dorywalska et al., 2015). Non-cleavable linker-based ADC must, however, be internalizing, because to release their cytotoxic payload, the antibody component needs to be degraded by lysosomal or cytoplasmic proteases (Lu et al., 2016). Furthermore, drugs linked to such linkers usually cannot exert a by-stander effect because upon degradation of the antibody by cellular proteases, they are released as fragments of antibody peptides that have a poor ability to permeate the cells."

                            "The greatest advantage of non-cleavable linkers compared to cleavable linkers is their increased plasma stability. Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug (Monteiro et al., 2015). Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells (Doronina et al., 2006)(Erickson et al., 2006). In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability. \n\nYelena et al. synthesized the huC242-SMCC-DM1 conjugate binding DM1 to the humanized monoclonal antibody (huC242) via an N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 -carboxylate (SMCC) for non-cleavable thioether linker and tested the cytotoxicity of conjugate on COLO 205 cells and Namalwa cells. Compared with the cantuzumab mertansine (huC242-DM1) containing a cleavable disulfide linker, the huC242-SMCC-DM1 is efficacious only against tumors in which all proliferating cells express the target antigen, and displayed significantly lower in vivo activity in multiple xenograft tumor models (Figure 4) (Kovtun et al., 2006)."

The properties of the linker between the antibody and the payload are proven to be critical to the success of an ADC. Although ADC linkers can be 'non-cleavable', the vast majority of ADCs in clinical development have specific release mechanisms to allow controlled linker cleavage at the target site and are thus termed 'cleavable'. In recent years, the development of new methods of drug release from ADCs has continued in parallel to the deepening understanding of the biological processes underlying the mechanisms of action of pre-existing technologies. This review summarises the advances in the field of cleavable linker technologies for ADCs."

                            "Non-cleavable linkers are a significant building block of antibody-drug conjugates. They disengage their cytotoxic payload during the lysosomal degradation of the antibodydrug conjugate inside the tumor environment, bypassing the non-specific dispersion of the toxic preparation [37].\n\nNon-cleavable linkers are an innovational array of first-generation linkers with more advanced plasma stability than many cleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers do not seem to contain a definable payload dispersion mode, and ADCs developed with this mechanism depend on the lysosomal proteolytic decomposition of the antibody after ingestion to deliver the cytotoxic medicine. Via this strategy, the non-cleavable linker transporting the medication is attached to the conjugation amino acid within the antibody. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers are more contingent on the membrane biology of the neoplasm than cleavable linkers. ADCs designed with non-cleavable linkers have amplified plasma stability via an enhanced therapeutic index [37]. Due to the bystander sequence, this opposition to extracellular cleavage improves the specificity of payload delivery. Numerous clinical data and in vivo studies prove ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers surpass the efficacy of those with cleavable linkers [38].\n\nAnother advantage of non-cleavable linkers is heightened plasma stability. In vivo research studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linked ADCs outperform cleavable equivalents. mAb degradation contained in the lysosome after ADC ingestion is necessary for non-cleavable linkers to liberate their medical preparation. The payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs destroys the target cells, and non-cleavable linkers may theoretically offer a superior medicinal opportunity versus cleavable linkers. With a reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable ADCs, non-cleavable ADCs may offer improved stability and tolerability [39]."

                            "Linkers play a critical role in ensuring ADC stability and in optimising the delivery of the cytotoxic payload to tumour cells. Optimal linkers are stable in the circulation, which prevents premature payload release and systemic toxicities, but then rapidly cleaved once internalised in malignant cells, promoting efficient cell death (Su et al., 2021)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016). There are two types of linkers, classified based on the payload release mechanism: cleavable and noncleavable (Su et al., 2021). Cleavable linkers are designed to be degraded intracellularly, in response to a change from the extracellular environment to the intracellular environment (Tsuchikama et al., 2016). There are a variety of triggers for the degradation of cleavable linkers, including specific lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B (which cleaves Val-Cit and Val-Ala linkers coupled with PABC), acidic pH (which cleaves hydrazone), and glutathione (which cleaves disulfide bonds) (Tsuchikama et al., 2016). The majority of currently approved ADCs use cleavable linkers, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (Fu et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021). The advantages of cleavable linkers are the intracellular release of the payload and stability in the circulation, while disadvantages include potential premature cleavage in the peripheral circulation (Tsuchikama et al., 2016)(Gondi et al., 2013)(Doronina et al., 2008)(Baah et al., 2021). \n\nIn contrast, non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds that are resistant to proteolysis (Su et al., 2021). ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers rely on the near complete degradation of the antibody component by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases, which leaves the payload attached to the linker and an amino acid residue derived from the antibody [21]."

                            "The greatest advantage of non-cleavable linkers compared to cleavable linkers is their increased plasma stability. Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug (Monteiro et al., 2015). Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells (Doronina et al., 2006)(Erickson et al., 2006). In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability. \n\nYelena et al. synthesized the huC242-SMCC-DM1 conjugate binding DM1 to the humanized monoclonal antibody (huC242) via an N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 -carboxylate (SMCC) for non-cleavable thioether linker and tested the cytotoxicity of conjugate on COLO 205 cells and Namalwa cells. Compared with the cantuzumab mertansine (huC242-DM1) containing a cleavable disulfide linker, the huC242-SMCC-DM1 is efficacious only against tumors in which all proliferating cells express the target antigen, and displayed significantly lower in vivo activity in multiple xenograft tumor models (Figure 4) (Kovtun et al., 2006)."

Non-cleavable linkers are a new generation of linkers with improved plasma stability compared to cleavable linkers. The ADCs prepared by non-cleavable linkers rely on the complete lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the antibody after internalization to release the cytotoxic small molecule drug. The ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are dependent on the biology of the target cell compared to cleavable linkers and have an improved therapeutic index due to their greater plasma stability. Since non-cleavable linkers can provide greater stability and tolerance than cleavable linkers, in the circulation, these linkers reduce off-target toxicity and also provide a larger therapeutic window (Tsuchikama et al., 2017)(Walles et al., 2018)(Thorpe et al., 1987)."

They can be either chemically or enzymatically labile. Chemical linkers include hydrazone-or disulfide-bond-based linkers. The first type, used in commercially available Mylotarg \u00ae and Besponsa \u00ae , is sensitive to low pH and can be hydrolyzed within acidic early endosomes post-uptake. The second one can undergo reduction via intracellular thiols such as glutathione (GSH), whose levels are generally elevated in cancer cells (1-10 mmol/L) than in blood (5 \u00b5mol/L) (Ding et al., 2021). These linker types generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload able to promote bystander killing (Joubert et al., 2020)(Fu et al., 2022)(Sheyi et al., 2022). Notably, acid-sensitive linkers are insufficiently stable and can occasionally be hydrolyzed in the plasma, leading to premature drug release and off-target toxicity. This liability is one of the causes leading to the voluntary Mylotarg \u00ae withdrawal by Pfizer from the US market in 2000, following the severe liver toxicity seen in patients (Nguyen et al., 2023)(Sievers et al., 2001)(Petersdorf et al., 2013)",

Nonetheless, as most tumors display heterogenous Ag expression, constructs incorporating cleavable linkers with membranepermeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects, unlike the non-cleavable linker type (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021)."

                            "Cleavable linkers. Acid-labile hydrazine linkers, peptide linkers, and disulfide linkers are included in cleavable linkers. Acid-labile hydrazine linkers are cleaved in the lysosome compartment as a result of low pH. Unfortunately, acid labile hydrazine linkers have established off-target release in clinical examination. 55,56 Peptide linkers conceivably selective for cleavage in lysosome by activity of cathepsin B. 57 Unlike the hydrazine linker, peptide linkers show high serum stability and improved antitumor effects of ADC. Phe-Lys and Val-Cit are physiological stable peptide linkers but hydrolyze rapidly in the presence of enzymes. 58 The longer half-life of peptide linkers was recorded as compared to other cleavable linkers. 59 Disulfide linkers also raise questions of non-specific cytotoxicity and instability and off-target release of drugs.\n\nRecent advancement in linker technology has been covered by non-cleavable linkers. The chemical bond of non-cleavable linkers is highly stable in circulation and inside the cell. The release of an active potent drug inside a tumor cell is realized by degradation of antibodies in the lysosome. 57 More importantly, the recently approved ADC, trastuzumab-DM1 (Kadcycla), also utilized non-cleavable linkers to treat metastatic breast cancer. More effective studies were also reported in vivo analysis by using non-cleavable linkers compared to their disulfide counterpart. 60,61"

                            "According to the drug release mechanism, linkers for ADCs are generally categorized into cleavable linkers (acid-labile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers (Table 1) [51]. The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, proteasecleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers. Acid-cleavable linkers such as hydrazine linkers are designed to be stable at a neutral pH of circulation but can be hydrolyzed in lysosomes with a low pH environment",
                            "ADCs with disulfide linkers take advantage of reduced glutathione with high intracellular concentrations to release free drug inside the cell. ADCs with reducible disulfide linkers generate uncharged metabolites that can diffuse into neighboring cells and elicit bystander killing, which is essential for killing heterogeneous tumors (Mccombs et al., 2015)(Chari et al., 2014). \n\nADCs with cleavable linkers have broader efficacy and faster rates of activating and releasing cytotoxic drugs for most cell lines. In contrast, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers can possibly provide increased plasma stability, greater therapeutic window, and reduced off-target toxicity. To reduce aggregation and improve the solubility of some ADCs, hydrophilic linkers such as \u03b2-glucuronide linker, Sulfo-SPDB, and Mal-PEG4-NHS were investigated (Lu et al., 2016)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016). In short, each type of linker has advantages and disadvantages, and each can be modified to achieve a fine balance between target efficacies and undesired toxicities (Lu et al., 2016)."

A self-immolative p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) spacer between the dipeptides and the DOX was required for rapid and quantitative generation of free drug. DOX release from model substrate Z-Phe-Lys-PABC-DOX 49 was 30-fold faster than from Z-Val-Cit-PABC-DOX 42 with the cysteine protease cathepsin B alone, but rates were identical in a rat liver lysosomal preparation suggesting the participation of more than one enzyme. Conjugates 72 and 73 showed rapid and near quantitative drug release with cathepsin B and in a lysosomal preparation, while demonstrating excellent stability in human plasma. Against tumor cell lines with varying levels of BR96 expression, both conjugates showed potent, antigen-specific cytotoxic activity, suggesting that they will be effective in delivering DOX selectively to antigen-expressing carcinomas."

All patients received Mylotarg as a 2-hour intravenous infusion, at a dose of 9 mg/m(2), at 2-week intervals for two doses. Patients were evaluated for remission, survival, and treatment-emergent adverse events.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty percent of patients treated with Mylotarg obtained remission as characterized by 5% or less blasts in the marrow, recovery of neutrophils to at least 1,500/microL, and RBC and platelet transfusion independence. Although patients treated with Mylotarg had relatively high incidences of myelosuppression, grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia (23%), and elevated hepatic transaminase levels (17%), the incidences of grade 3 or 4 mucositis (4%) and infections (28%) were relatively low. There was a low incidence of severe nausea and vomiting (11%) and no treatment-related cardiotoxicity, cerebellar toxicity, or alopecia. Many patients received Mylotarg on an outpatient basis (38% and 41% of patients for the first and second doses, respectively). Among the 142 patients, the median total duration of hospitalization was 24 days; 16% of patients required 7 days of hospitalization or less.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAdministration of the antibody-targeted chemotherapy agent Mylotarg to patients with CD33-positive AML in first relapse induces complete remissions with what appears to be a favorable safety profile."

Patients were randomly assigned to receive daunorubicin (45 mg/m(2) per day on days 1, 2, and 3), cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) per day by continuous infusion on days 1-7), and GO (6 mg/m(2) on day 4; DA+GO) vs standard induction therapy with daunorubicin (60 mg/m(2) per day on days 1, 2, and 3) and cytarabine alone (DA). Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) received 3 courses of high-dose cytarabine. Those remaining in CR after consolidation were randomly assigned to receive either no additional therapy or 3 doses of GO (5 mg/m(2) every 28 days). From August 2004 until August 2009, 637 patients were registered for induction. The CR rate was 69% for DA+GO and 70% for DA (P = .59). Among those who achieved a CR, the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 43% in the DA+GO group and 42% in the DA group (P = .40). The 5-year overall survival rate was 46% in the DA+GO group and 50% in the DA group (P = .85). One hundred seventy-four patients in CR after consolidation underwent the postconsolidation randomization. Disease-free survival was not improved with postconsolidation GO (HR, 1.48; P = .97). In this study, the addition of GO to induction or postconsolidation therapy failed to show improvement in CR rate, disease-free survival, or overall survival."

This knowledge was reflected in the clinical development of T-DM1, originally designed to have a valine-citrulline dipeptide linker but was instead produced with a non-cleavable thioether linker (Dosio et al., 2011). Despite the successful use of non-cleavable linkers, it is important to note that their dependence on lysosomal degradation means they can only be used in ADCs targeting antigens that undergo efficient intracellular internalization."

Such compounds are potentially therapeutic against diseases including cancer, and several clinical trials have shown encouraging results. Although the targeted elimination of malignant cells is an elegant concept, there are numerous practical challenges that limit conjugates\u2019 therapeutic use, including inefficient cellular uptake, low cytotoxicity, and off-target effects. During the preparation of immunoconjugates by chemical synthesis, the choice of the hinge component joining the two building blocks is of paramount importance: the conjugate must remain stable in vivo but must afford efficient release of the toxic moiety when the target is reached. Vast efforts have been made, and the present article reviews strategies employed in developing immunoconjugates, focusing on the evolution of chemical linkers."

                            "Linkers are a critical component of the ADC and are key to the design of a safe, potent, and selective ADC (Peters et al., 2015). Developments in linker technology have greatly increased the ability of ADCs to selectively deliver their payload to target cells while limiting their systemic effects (Peters et al., 2015). Linkers generally fall into one of two categories: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers rely on differences in the blood microenvironment and intracellular tumor environment to induce linker degradation. These take three forms: hydrazone, disulfide and peptide linkers, each of which is cleaved or degraded through a different mechanism (Peters et al., 2015). Hydrazone linkers are pH-sensitive and undergo acidic hydrolysis in the lysosomal microenvironment (Peters et al., 2015). Disulfide linkers are degraded by thiols, which commonly accumulate in tumor cells, where they act as antioxidants (Peters et al., 2015)(Harris et al., 2015). Peptide linkers are degraded by pH-dependent proteases, which are only active in the lysosome (Peters et al., 2015). ADCs with non-cleavable linkers rely on the near-complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody to release the cytotoxic agent. This makes them entirely dependent on being endocytosed to release their drug product. However, this tradeoff provides enhanced stability while the ADC is in circulation, as well as improvements in the ADC half-life (Peters et al., 2015)."

                            "Non-cleavable linkers are a significant building block of antibody-drug conjugates. They disengage their cytotoxic payload during the lysosomal degradation of the antibodydrug conjugate inside the tumor environment, bypassing the non-specific dispersion of the toxic preparation [37].\n\nNon-cleavable linkers are an innovational array of first-generation linkers with more advanced plasma stability than many cleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers do not seem to contain a definable payload dispersion mode, and ADCs developed with this mechanism depend on the lysosomal proteolytic decomposition of the antibody after ingestion to deliver the cytotoxic medicine. Via this strategy, the non-cleavable linker transporting the medication is attached to the conjugation amino acid within the antibody. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers are more contingent on the membrane biology of the neoplasm than cleavable linkers. ADCs designed with non-cleavable linkers have amplified plasma stability via an enhanced therapeutic index [37]. Due to the bystander sequence, this opposition to extracellular cleavage improves the specificity of payload delivery. Numerous clinical data and in vivo studies prove ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers surpass the efficacy of those with cleavable linkers [38].\n\nAnother advantage of non-cleavable linkers is heightened plasma stability. In vivo research studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linked ADCs outperform cleavable equivalents. mAb degradation contained in the lysosome after ADC ingestion is necessary for non-cleavable linkers to liberate their medical preparation. The payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs destroys the target cells, and non-cleavable linkers may theoretically offer a superior medicinal opportunity versus cleavable linkers. With a reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable ADCs, non-cleavable ADCs may offer improved stability and tolerability [39]."

Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Non-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability (Lu et al., 2016). T-DM1 with mafodotin belantamab is one of two FDA-approved ADCs with non-cleavable linkers (Drago et al., 2021)."

These linkers enhance plasma stability, rendering them less susceptible to the chemical or enzymatic environment in vivo following the internalization of ADCs by target cells (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Su et al., 2021). Once internalized, the antibody component of the ADCs is degraded within lysosomes, resulting in a complex of amino acids, linker, and cytotoxic agent.

The previously described bystander effect, which impacts normal cells in the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells with no or low target expression, is more likely to occur with ADCs that utilize cleavable linkers [58](Pillow et al., 2016). Non-cleavable linkers, as opposed to cleavable linkers, have better plasma stability, less off-target toxicity, and resistance to proteolytic degradation, as they have non-reducible bonds with the amino acid residues of the antibody. Generally, non-cleavable linkers are formed by thioether or Maleimidocaproyl groups. Non-cleavable linkers that are attached to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody must have the antibody moiety completely broken down by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases to release the payload following ADC internalization (Tsuchikama et al., 2016)(Su et al., 2021)."

(15 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe efficacy of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) is directly influenced by the mechanism and efficiency of payload release, which varies significantly between cleavable and non-cleavable linker designs. Cleavable linkers generally demonstrate superior payload release efficiency compared to non-cleavable alternatives, translating to enhanced cytotoxic effects. Studies have shown that ADCs with cleavable linkers can be significantly more potent than their non-cleavable counterparts against various tumor cell lines <Paper corpusId=\"212949379\" paperTitle=\"(Bargh et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This potency difference is particularly evident in comparative studies, where cleavable linker ADCs have outperformed non-cleavable versions in multiple in vitro and in vivo models <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe release mechanism significantly impacts efficacy profiles. Cleavable linkers respond to specific tumor microenvironment conditions or intracellular triggers, releasing free drug molecules that can readily diffuse across cell membranes <Paper corpusId=\"220976686\" paperTitle=\"(Ponziani et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"231724417\" paperTitle=\"(Criscitiello et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers require complete antibody degradation within lysosomes, resulting in the release of drug-linker-amino acid complexes <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. These complexes typically have reduced membrane permeability compared to free drugs, limiting their ability to diffuse into neighboring cells <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"269098426\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA critical difference in efficacy between these linker types relates to the bystander killing effect. Cleavable linkers can release free, membrane-permeable cytotoxic agents capable of diffusing into and killing adjacent tumor cells that may not express the target antigen <Paper corpusId=\"12383157\" paperTitle=\"(Vedi et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This property is particularly valuable for treating heterogeneous tumors with variable antigen expression. In contrast, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers generally lack significant bystander effects due to the charged nature and poor membrane permeability of their released metabolites <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"274892504\" paperTitle=\"(Tang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThis efficacy distinction is illustrated in studies comparing various ADC designs. For example, when the humanized monoclonal antibody huC242 was conjugated with DM1 using either a disulfide (cleavable) or thioether (non-cleavable) linker, the conjugate with the cleavable linker demonstrated superior efficacy in mixed cell populations and heterogeneous tumors due to its bystander effect <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"26250545\" paperTitle=\"(Kovtun et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, enzyme-sensitive cleavable linkers have shown improved delivery efficiency through specific cleavage by enzymes overexpressed in tumors <Paper corpusId=\"278325060\" paperTitle=\"(Lv et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"195879565\" paperTitle=\"(Bargh et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nLinker stability also plays a crucial role in determining release efficiency and overall efficacy. Intermediate linker stability often yields the most effective ADCs, as highly stable linkers can result in decreased cytotoxic drug release following internalization <Paper corpusId=\"12383157\" paperTitle=\"(Vedi et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. For example, a study found that epratuzumab conjugated to SN-38 with a more labile CL2A linker was 40-55 fold more potent than the same antibody with a more stable linker <Paper corpusId=\"12383157\" paperTitle=\"(Vedi et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"24971827\" paperTitle=\"(Sharkey et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe choice between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers ultimately depends on the specific therapeutic context. ADCs with cleavable linkers, which constitute more than 80% of currently approved ADCs, are generally preferred for treating cancers with heterogeneous antigen expression or slow rates of antigen/ADC internalization <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"261070840\" paperTitle=\"(Kondrashov et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Non-cleavable linkers, while offering reduced efficacy, may provide advantages in tumors with homogeneous antigen expression where enhanced stability and reduced off-target effects are prioritized <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"278236118\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "The greatest advantage of non-cleavable linkers compared to cleavable linkers is their increased plasma stability. Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug (Monteiro et al., 2015). Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells (Doronina et al., 2006)(Erickson et al., 2006). In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability. \n\nYelena et al. synthesized the huC242-SMCC-DM1 conjugate binding DM1 to the humanized monoclonal antibody (huC242) via an N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 -carboxylate (SMCC) for non-cleavable thioether linker and tested the cytotoxicity of conjugate on COLO 205 cells and Namalwa cells. Compared with the cantuzumab mertansine (huC242-DM1) containing a cleavable disulfide linker, the huC242-SMCC-DM1 is efficacious only against tumors in which all proliferating cells express the target antigen, and displayed significantly lower in vivo activity in multiple xenograft tumor models (Figure 4) (Kovtun et al., 2006)."

                            "There are two types of linkers available: cleavable and non-cleavable (Figure 3). The former can be used either in the design of either an internalizing or not internalizing ADC, because the release of the payload is required to take place in either the extracellular tumor environment, or within the lysosome or cytosol. This is possible because the extracellular environment of the tumor is highly reducing due to the presence of glutathione, which allows the release of payloads linked to the antibody via thiolic bonds. It also allows payload release via the degradation of peptide bonds in the presence of proteases such as Cathepsin B, whose overexpression in cancer drives its normal lysosomal localization towards extracellular secretion (Mohamed et al., 2006). A cleavable linker, therefore, exploits differential conditions of reducing power or enzymatic degradation that can be present either outside or inside the target cell. Due to the chemical reactions needed to release the payload, the site of conjugation on the antibody is crucial to induce both stability in the plasma and availability to reduction or degradation on/into the target cell (Phillips et al., 2008)(Dorywalska et al., 2015). Non-cleavable linker-based ADC must, however, be internalizing, because to release their cytotoxic payload, the antibody component needs to be degraded by lysosomal or cytoplasmic proteases (Lu et al., 2016). Furthermore, drugs linked to such linkers usually cannot exert a by-stander effect because upon degradation of the antibody by cellular proteases, they are released as fragments of antibody peptides that have a poor ability to permeate the cells."

                            "Linkers are biochemical compounds connecting the antibody to the payload. Effective linkers have to guarantee ADC stability in the bloodstream as well as to allow an efficient cleavage upon internalization into tumor cells. Linkers can be classified into cleavable and non-cleavable according to their chemical properties (Beck et al., 2017)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016). Non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds resistant to proteolytic degradation, so that cleavage occurs only after lysosome internalization and complete degradation of the antibody. These linkers have higher stability than cleavable ones, but can suffer from lower membrane permeability. Conversely, cleavage of cleavable linkers can depend on external pH (acid-labile linkers), specific lysosomal proteases (protease-cleavable linkers) or glutathione reduction (disulphide linkers) (Beck et al., 2017)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016)(Shen et al., 2012)(Bargh et al., 2019). All aspects of ADC pharmacology can be influenced by the specific design of the linker, as drug stability into circulation, tumor cell permeability, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR, i.e. the number of payload moleculas carried by each antibody), and extent of the bystander effect (Beck et al., 2017)(Shen et al., 2012)."

                            "In contrast to cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma but require the complete intracellular proteolytic catabolism of the ADCs to yield cytotoxic metabolites. These metabolites typically consist of the intact linker-payload attached to the conjugating amino acid residue from the antibodies, such as lysine-SMCC-DM1 for trastuzumab emtansine or cysteine-MC-MMAF for belantamab mafodotin (Lu et al., 2016). These metabolites are often charged and exhibit low permeability through cell membranes (Mccombs et al., 2015). Although ADCs employing non-cleavable linkers generally show a more favorable tolerability, potentially due to reduced off-target toxicity relating to free payload exposure, ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate a superior efficacy (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). This enhanced efficacy is partially attributed to the bystander effect, which refers to the ability of the free payload to diffuse from intracellular sites of ADC catabolism and payload release to neighboring cells within the local tumor environment (Singh et al., 2016). ADCs with lipophilic payloads and cleavable linkers, which make up more than 80% of the currently approved ADCs, are the preferred choice for the treatment of cancers associated with heterogeneous antigen expression or slow rates of antigen/ADC internalization (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues."

                            "The linker in ADCs functions as a vital bridge between the payload and the antibody, playing a key role in their stability and efficacy. An ideal linker should possess high water solubility, preventing both aggregation of the ADC and premature payload release in systemic circulation (39). Regarding intracellular stability and degradation patterns, linkers are classified into two distinct categories: cleavable and non-cleavable (Tsuchikama et al., 2016). Cleavable linkers exhibit sensitivity to intracellular environmental conditions and could be cleaved by acid, protease, a reducing substance, and so on (Tsuchikama et al., 2016). Typically, these linkers, including hydrazone bonds, disulfide bonds, and polypeptides, are cleaved within endosomes or lysosomes. In contrast, non-cleavable linkers undergo cleavage only within lysosomes, leading to the degradation of their associated payloads into amino acids (Lu et al., 2016). Significantly, non-cleavable linkers offer the benefits of an enhanced therapeutic index and reduced off-target toxicity (Mccombs et al., 2015). While each strategy presents its own advantages and drawbacks, the optimal linker and conjugation chemistry must be precisely tailored to align with the specific properties of the antibody, the drug molecule, and the disease profile being targeted."

For example, a serum-stable but intracellularly cleavable linker used to join epratuzumab to SN-38 used in B cell malignancies was shown to be 40-to 55-fold less potent than the more labile CL2A linker in in vitro studies (30).\n\nAntibody-drug conjugates linked by a disulfide linker (but not thioether bond) are capable of exerting a bystander effect on cells that express none or low levels of the target antigen. Hence ADCs can be engineered to exert a bystander effect by being linked by a disulfide bond or exert more precise killing of cells expressing the target antigen and sparing nearby normal cells by being linked by a thioether bond."

                            "Depending on the methods of releasing the payload in cells, there are two types of linkers, including cleavable and non-cleavable [22]. The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity (Nolting, 2013). Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level (Zhang et al., 2019). The enzyme sensitive linkers are sensitive to the lysosomal protease that is generally overexpressed in cancer cells, enabling an accurate drug release in the cells after internalization (Gondi et al., 2013). ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Kovtun et al., 2006), and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]."

Because these conditions can occur independently of antigen internalization, cleavable linkers are often less stable in the blood, resulting in various off-target effects (Polakis, 2016). In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as the thioether or maleimidocaproyl linkers, require internalization by the target cell, so that the antibody, rather than the linker, can be degraded by the lysosome before the drug is released. This latter mechanism does not produce efficient bystander killing and thus results in lower toxicity profiles (Staudacher et al., 2017)."

We found that in culture, conjugates of either drug killed not only the target antigen-positive cells but also the neighboring antigen-negative cells. Furthermore, we showed that, in vivo, these conjugates were effective in eradicating tumors containing both antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells. The presence of antigen-positive cells was required for this killing of bystander cells. This target cell-activated killing of bystander cells was dependent on the nature of the linker between the antibody and the drug. Conjugates linked via a reducible disulfide bond were capable of exerting the bystander effect whereas equally potent conjugates linked via a nonreducible thioether bond were not. Our data offer a rationale for developing optimally constructed antibody-drug conjugates for treating tumors that express the target antigen either in a homogeneous or heterogeneous manner."

                            "Two main types of linkers exist: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers, while cleavable linkers include chemically unstable and enzyme-sensitive linkers. Among them, chemically unstable linkers can undergo cleavage in the acidic environment of tumors to release drugs efficiently, but their stability in the blood circulation is relatively poor, which usually leads to premature drug delivery (Tsuchikama et al., 2024)(Kostova et al., 2021)(Senter, 2009). The emergence of enzyme-sensitive linkers has solved this problem by improving stability and delivery efficiency through specific cleavage using specific enzymes overexpressed in tumors (Bargh et al., 2019)(Gondi et al., 2013). Non-cleavable linkers release the drug by enzymatic complete degradation within the lysosome, which has the advantage of high stability and low off-target toxicity, but their low release efficiency and inability to produce a bystander effect need to be optimized by optimizing the payload structure to improve the efficacy [85]."

The properties of the linker between the antibody and the payload are proven to be critical to the success of an ADC. Although ADC linkers can be 'non-cleavable', the vast majority of ADCs in clinical development have specific release mechanisms to allow controlled linker cleavage at the target site and are thus termed 'cleavable'. In recent years, the development of new methods of drug release from ADCs has continued in parallel to the deepening understanding of the biological processes underlying the mechanisms of action of pre-existing technologies. This review summarises the advances in the field of cleavable linker technologies for ADCs."

                            "We previously found that slowly internalizing antibodies conjugated with SN-38 could be used successfully when prepared with a linker that allows approximately 50% of the IgG-bound SN-38 to dissociate in serum every 24 hours. In this study, the efficacy of SN-38 conjugates prepared with epratuzumab (rapidly internalizing) and veltuzumab (slowly internalizing), humanized anti-CD22 and anti-CD20 IgG, respectively, was examined for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. Both antibody\u2013drug conjugates had similar nanomolar activity against a variety of human lymphoma/leukemia cell lines, but slow release of SN-38 compromised potency discrimination in vitro even against an irrelevant conjugate. When SN-38 was stably linked to the anti-CD22 conjugate, its potency was reduced 40- to 55-fold. Therefore, further studies were conducted only with the less stable, slowly dissociating linker. In vivo, similar antitumor activity was found between CD22 and CD20 antibody\u2013drug conjugate in mice-bearing Ramos xenografts, even though Ramos expressed 15-fold more CD20 than CD22, suggesting that the internalization of the epratuzumab\u2013SN-38 conjugate (Emab\u2013SN-38) enhanced its activity. Emab\u2013SN-38 was more efficacious than a nonbinding, irrelevant IgG\u2013SN-38 conjugate in vivo, eliminating a majority of well-established Ramos xenografts at nontoxic doses. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that Emab\u2013SN-38 could be combined with unconjugated veltuzumab for a more effective treatment. Thus, Emab\u2013SN-38 is active in lymphoma and leukemia at doses well below toxic levels and therefore represents a new promising agent with therapeutic potential alone or combined with anti-CD20 antibody therapy.

The nature of the linker and spacer determines important features of ADCs, such as hydrophobic or lipophilic properties of payload, nontarget payload delivery, systemic toxicity, and most importantly, bystander killing [44]. The success of second-generation ADCs, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-Dxd) is largely attributed to cleavable linker technology. However, there is no consensus on which linkers are more promising. Selection of a linker depends on a variety of factors, including the target indication, payload size and toxicity, and the desired pharmacokinetics of the ADC. There are two large categories of linkers currently in use, including cleavable and non-cleavable ones. Cleavable linkers are further subdivided into three categories: peptide linkers (lysosomal enzyme sensitive), such as valine-citrulline linker (or vc linker), disulfide linkers (sensitive to reducing agents like glutathione), and hydrazone linkers (acid-sensitive).\n\nCleavable linkers have two major advantages compared to the non-cleavable moiety; increased site-specific activation and bystander killing effect."

These linkers enhance plasma stability, rendering them less susceptible to the chemical or enzymatic environment in vivo following the internalization of ADCs by target cells (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Su et al., 2021). Once internalized, the antibody component of the ADCs is degraded within lysosomes, resulting in a complex of amino acids, linker, and cytotoxic agent. This mechanism ensures precise drug delivery to tumor cells, minimizing nonspecific drug release and reducing off-target effects (Kostova et al., 2021)",
                            "Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy. These linkers also tend to inhibit bystander effects, because the released catabolites have poor cellular permeability. Consequently, identifying alternatives to improve drug release and enhance therapeutic outcomes has become a major focus of ongoing research."

                "text": "\nThe bystander effect represents a critical mechanism by which antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) can kill not only target antigen-expressing cells but also neighboring tumor cells with low or negative antigen expression. This capability is largely determined by linker chemistry, with cleavable and non-cleavable linkers exhibiting fundamentally different bystander killing potentials.\n\nCleavable linkers, particularly disulfide-based linkers, are capable of generating a significant bystander effect by releasing free, membrane-permeable cytotoxic payloads that can diffuse into adjacent cells <Paper corpusId=\"12383157\" paperTitle=\"(Vedi et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. These uncharged metabolites can effectively kill neighboring tumor cells regardless of their antigen expression, making cleavable linkers especially valuable for treating heterogeneous tumors <Paper corpusId=\"4592961\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. The mechanism typically involves the release of the free drug through chemical reactions (such as reduction in glutathione-rich environments) or enzymatic cleavage (by cathepsins or other tumor-associated enzymes), producing membrane-permeable cytotoxic agents <Paper corpusId=\"267191025\" paperTitle=\"(Metrangolo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn contrast, non-cleavable linkers generally lack significant bystander killing capability. This limitation stems from the nature of their released metabolites, which consist of the drug-linker-amino acid complexes resulting from complete antibody degradation within lysosomes <Paper corpusId=\"220976686\" paperTitle=\"(Ponziani et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. These metabolites typically have poor membrane permeability due to their charged nature, confining their cytotoxic effects to the antigen-expressing cells that internalized the ADC <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"273542597\" paperTitle=\"(Bian et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. As one study noted, \"drugs linked to such linkers usually cannot exert a by-stander effect because upon degradation of the antibody by cellular proteases, they are released as fragments of antibody peptides that have a poor ability to permeate the cells\" <Paper corpusId=\"220976686\" paperTitle=\"(Ponziani et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe importance of the bystander effect has been demonstrated in comparative studies. For example, when the humanized monoclonal antibody huC242 was conjugated with DM1 using either a disulfide (cleavable) or thioether (non-cleavable) linker, the conjugate with the cleavable linker demonstrated superior efficacy in heterogeneous tumors due to its bystander effect <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"26250545\" paperTitle=\"(Kovtun et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, a study comparing HER2-targeting ADCs showed that those with membrane-permeable payloads could suppress both HER2-positive and HER2-negative cell populations in mixed tumor models, while ADCs with non-cleavable linkers affected only the HER2-positive cells <Paper corpusId=\"14925141\" paperTitle=\"(Ogitani et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThis bystander killing capability represents a double-edged sword in ADC design. While it enhances efficacy against heterogeneous tumors, it can also potentially increase systemic toxicity by affecting normal tissues if the payload is prematurely released in circulation <Paper corpusId=\"269587315\" paperTitle=\"(Takakura et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This risk-benefit balance has led to the predominance of cleavable linkers in clinical development, with more than 80% of approved ADCs utilizing cleavable linkers <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"271530455\" paperTitle=\"(He et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe therapeutic context ultimately determines the optimal linker choice. For tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression, cleavable linkers with their bystander effect capability are generally preferred, while non-cleavable linkers may be more suitable for homogeneous tumors where reduced off-target toxicity is prioritized <Paper corpusId=\"274892504\" paperTitle=\"(Tang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"267191025\" paperTitle=\"(Metrangolo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This has important implications for ADC design, particularly for treating solid tumors which typically display significant antigen heterogeneity <Paper corpusId=\"231724417\" paperTitle=\"(Criscitiello et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"276588757\" paperTitle=\"(Yamanaka et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

For example, a serum-stable but intracellularly cleavable linker used to join epratuzumab to SN-38 used in B cell malignancies was shown to be 40-to 55-fold less potent than the more labile CL2A linker in in vitro studies (30).\n\nAntibody-drug conjugates linked by a disulfide linker (but not thioether bond) are capable of exerting a bystander effect on cells that express none or low levels of the target antigen. Hence ADCs can be engineered to exert a bystander effect by being linked by a disulfide bond or exert more precise killing of cells expressing the target antigen and sparing nearby normal cells by being linked by a thioether bond."

The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, proteasecleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers. Acid-cleavable linkers such as hydrazine linkers are designed to be stable at a neutral pH of circulation but can be hydrolyzed in lysosomes with a low pH environment",
                            "ADCs with disulfide linkers take advantage of reduced glutathione with high intracellular concentrations to release free drug inside the cell. ADCs with reducible disulfide linkers generate uncharged metabolites that can diffuse into neighboring cells and elicit bystander killing, which is essential for killing heterogeneous tumors (Mccombs et al., 2015)(Chari et al., 2014). \n\nADCs with cleavable linkers have broader efficacy and faster rates of activating and releasing cytotoxic drugs for most cell lines. In contrast, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers can possibly provide increased plasma stability, greater therapeutic window, and reduced off-target toxicity. To reduce aggregation and improve the solubility of some ADCs, hydrophilic linkers such as \u03b2-glucuronide linker, Sulfo-SPDB, and Mal-PEG4-NHS were investigated (Lu et al., 2016)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016). In short, each type of linker has advantages and disadvantages, and each can be modified to achieve a fine balance between target efficacies and undesired toxicities (Lu et al., 2016)."

                            "Depending on the methods of releasing the payload in cells, there are two types of linkers, including cleavable and non-cleavable [22]. The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity (Nolting, 2013). Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level (Zhang et al., 2019). The enzyme sensitive linkers are sensitive to the lysosomal protease that is generally overexpressed in cancer cells, enabling an accurate drug release in the cells after internalization (Gondi et al., 2013). ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Kovtun et al., 2006), and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]."

                            "Cleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the cancer TME over healthy tissues or systemic circulation (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021). They can be either chemically or enzymatically labile. Chemical linkers include hydrazone-or disulfide-bond-based linkers. The first type, used in commercially available Mylotarg \u00ae and Besponsa \u00ae , is sensitive to low pH and can be hydrolyzed within acidic early endosomes post-uptake. The second one can undergo reduction via intracellular thiols such as glutathione (GSH), whose levels are generally elevated in cancer cells (1-10 mmol/L) than in blood (5 \u00b5mol/L) (Ding et al., 2021). These linker types generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload able to promote bystander killing (Joubert et al., 2020)(Fu et al., 2022)(Sheyi et al., 2022). Notably, acid-sensitive linkers are insufficiently stable and can occasionally be hydrolyzed in the plasma, leading to premature drug release and off-target toxicity. This liability is one of the causes leading to the voluntary Mylotarg \u00ae withdrawal by Pfizer from the US market in 2000, following the severe liver toxicity seen in patients (Nguyen et al., 2023)(Sievers et al., 2001)(Petersdorf et al., 2013)",
                            "Due to their resistance to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, these linkers enjoy the advantages of increased plasma stability, longer half-lives, and lower off-target toxicity than the cleavable counterpart, rendering them potentially superior for targeting homogenously expressed Ag (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021). Nonetheless, as most tumors display heterogenous Ag expression, constructs incorporating cleavable linkers with membranepermeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects, unlike the non-cleavable linker type (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021)."

                            "In contrast to cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma but require the complete intracellular proteolytic catabolism of the ADCs to yield cytotoxic metabolites. These metabolites typically consist of the intact linker-payload attached to the conjugating amino acid residue from the antibodies, such as lysine-SMCC-DM1 for trastuzumab emtansine or cysteine-MC-MMAF for belantamab mafodotin (Lu et al., 2016). These metabolites are often charged and exhibit low permeability through cell membranes (Mccombs et al., 2015). Although ADCs employing non-cleavable linkers generally show a more favorable tolerability, potentially due to reduced off-target toxicity relating to free payload exposure, ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate a superior efficacy (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). This enhanced efficacy is partially attributed to the bystander effect, which refers to the ability of the free payload to diffuse from intracellular sites of ADC catabolism and payload release to neighboring cells within the local tumor environment (Singh et al., 2016). ADCs with lipophilic payloads and cleavable linkers, which make up more than 80% of the currently approved ADCs, are the preferred choice for the treatment of cancers associated with heterogeneous antigen expression or slow rates of antigen/ADC internalization (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues."

                            "There are two types of linkers available: cleavable and non-cleavable (Figure 3). The former can be used either in the design of either an internalizing or not internalizing ADC, because the release of the payload is required to take place in either the extracellular tumor environment, or within the lysosome or cytosol. This is possible because the extracellular environment of the tumor is highly reducing due to the presence of glutathione, which allows the release of payloads linked to the antibody via thiolic bonds. It also allows payload release via the degradation of peptide bonds in the presence of proteases such as Cathepsin B, whose overexpression in cancer drives its normal lysosomal localization towards extracellular secretion (Mohamed et al., 2006). A cleavable linker, therefore, exploits differential conditions of reducing power or enzymatic degradation that can be present either outside or inside the target cell. Due to the chemical reactions needed to release the payload, the site of conjugation on the antibody is crucial to induce both stability in the plasma and availability to reduction or degradation on/into the target cell (Phillips et al., 2008)(Dorywalska et al., 2015). Non-cleavable linker-based ADC must, however, be internalizing, because to release their cytotoxic payload, the antibody component needs to be degraded by lysosomal or cytoplasmic proteases (Lu et al., 2016). Furthermore, drugs linked to such linkers usually cannot exert a by-stander effect because upon degradation of the antibody by cellular proteases, they are released as fragments of antibody peptides that have a poor ability to permeate the cells."

                            "Linkers can be broadly categorized into either cleavable or non-cleavable variants depending on the release mechanisms of their cytotoxic payloads (Tsuchikama et al., 2016). Cleavable linkers are versatile and widely employed in ADC development. These linkers chemically release the payload through reduction, proteolysis, or hydrolysis based on specific tumor cell-associated processes, such as acidification, glutathione reduction, or lysosomal protease activity (Bargh et al., 2019)(Nolting, 2013). Non-cleavable linkers consist of chemical structures that are not fragmented by enzymatic degradation. They resist conventional biochemical processes and require complete lysosomal degradation for payload release. This increases the likelihood of payload release within the target cells while minimizing cytotoxic effects on healthy cells (Oflazoglu et al., 2008). Non-cleavable linkers generally result in less toxicity and have a longer half-life when compared to cleavable linkers (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021). One major disadvantage of non-cleavable linkers, however, is the lack of antitumor activity against adjacent neoplastic cells that may not express the target antigen of the ADC (i.e., bystander killing) (Ogitani et al., 2016)."

We found that in culture, conjugates of either drug killed not only the target antigen-positive cells but also the neighboring antigen-negative cells. Furthermore, we showed that, in vivo, these conjugates were effective in eradicating tumors containing both antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells. The presence of antigen-positive cells was required for this killing of bystander cells. This target cell-activated killing of bystander cells was dependent on the nature of the linker between the antibody and the drug. Conjugates linked via a reducible disulfide bond were capable of exerting the bystander effect whereas equally potent conjugates linked via a nonreducible thioether bond were not. Our data offer a rationale for developing optimally constructed antibody-drug conjugates for treating tumors that express the target antigen either in a homogeneous or heterogeneous manner."

                            "Antibody\u2013drug conjugates deliver anticancer agents selectively and efficiently to tumor tissue and have significant antitumor efficacy with a wide therapeutic window. DS\u20108201a is a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)\u2010targeting antibody\u2013drug conjugate prepared using a novel linker\u2010payload system with a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor, exatecan derivative (DX\u20108951 derivative, DXd). It was effective against trastuzumab emtansine (T\u2010DM1)\u2010insensitive patient\u2010derived xenograft models with both high and low HER2 expression. In this study, the bystander killing effect of DS\u20108201a was evaluated and compared with that of T\u2010DM1. We confirmed that the payload of DS\u20108201a, DXd (1), was highly membrane\u2010permeable whereas that of T\u2010DM1, Lys\u2010SMCC\u2010DM1, had a low level of permeability. Under a coculture condition of HER2\u2010positive KPL\u20104 cells and negative MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 cells in vitro, DS\u20108201a killed both cells, whereas T\u2010DM1 and an antibody\u2013drug conjugate with a low permeable payload, anti\u2010HER2\u2010DXd (2), did not. In vivo evaluation was carried out using mice inoculated with a mixture of HER2\u2010positive NCI\u2010N87 cells and HER2\u2010negative MDA\u2010MB\u2010468\u2010Luc cells by using an in vivo imaging system. In vivo, DS\u20108201a reduced the luciferase signal of the mice, indicating suppression of the MDA\u2010MB\u2010468\u2010Luc population; however, T\u2010DM1 and anti\u2010HER2\u2010DXd (2) did not. Furthermore, it was confirmed that DS\u20108201a was not effective against MDA\u2010MB\u2010468\u2010Luc tumors inoculated at the opposite side of the NCI\u2010N87 tumor, suggesting that the bystander killing effect of DS\u20108201a is observed only in cells neighboring HER2\u2010positive cells, indicating low concern in terms of systemic toxicity. These results indicated that DS\u20108201a has a potent bystander effect due to a highly membrane\u2010permeable payload and is beneficial in treating tumors with HER2 heterogeneity that are unresponsive to T\u2010DM1."

                            "Researchers have explored different types of linkers, which can be broadly classified into two categories: cleavable and noncleavable linkers. (Sheyi et al., 2022)55,56 Cleavable linkers have the ability to release a metabolite of the effector molecules from the ADC, allowing it to enter cells, either at the tumor site or within endosomes and lysosomes. These cleavable linkers are further divided into chemically cleavable linkers and enzymatically cleavable linkers, such as peptide-based linkers, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers, and phosphate-based linkers. (Sheyi et al., 2022) Notably, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers consist of \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers and \u03b2-galactosidase-sensitive linkers. Premature cleavage of these linkers can lead to the effector molecules harming normal cells. (Beck et al., 2017) On the other hand, noncleavable linkers, such as thioether linkers and maleimido caproyl linkers, require internalization of the ADC into cells and subsequent breakdown by lysosomes to release the effector molecules. ADCs with noncleavable linkers depend on complete lysosomal enzymatic degradation of the antibody for payload release, resulting in simultaneous dissociation of the linker. 58",
                            "Therefore, the use of noncleavable linkers must ensure that the linker-drug complex retains the ability to kill tumor cells. Considering the cytotoxicity of the payload and bystander effect, cleavable linkers are prioritized in ADC development, despite a few approved noncleavable effective linkers."

Because these conditions can occur independently of antigen internalization, cleavable linkers are often less stable in the blood, resulting in various off-target effects (Polakis, 2016). In contrast, non-cleavable linkers, such as the thioether or maleimidocaproyl linkers, require internalization by the target cell, so that the antibody, rather than the linker, can be degraded by the lysosome before the drug is released. This latter mechanism does not produce efficient bystander killing and thus results in lower toxicity profiles (Staudacher et al., 2017)."

                            "Linkers are biochemical compounds connecting the antibody to the payload. Effective linkers have to guarantee ADC stability in the bloodstream as well as to allow an efficient cleavage upon internalization into tumor cells. Linkers can be classified into cleavable and non-cleavable according to their chemical properties (Beck et al., 2017)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016). Non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds resistant to proteolytic degradation, so that cleavage occurs only after lysosome internalization and complete degradation of the antibody. These linkers have higher stability than cleavable ones, but can suffer from lower membrane permeability. Conversely, cleavage of cleavable linkers can depend on external pH (acid-labile linkers), specific lysosomal proteases (protease-cleavable linkers) or glutathione reduction (disulphide linkers) (Beck et al., 2017)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016)(Shen et al., 2012)(Bargh et al., 2019). All aspects of ADC pharmacology can be influenced by the specific design of the linker, as drug stability into circulation, tumor cell permeability, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR, i.e. the number of payload moleculas carried by each antibody), and extent of the bystander effect (Beck et al., 2017)(Shen et al., 2012)."

Ideal linkers should maintain the ADC's stability in plasma while ensuring payload release, specifically at the tumor site. This targeted release is essential for effectively delivering the cytotoxic payload to cancer cells, as premature release can result in systemic off-target toxicity (Sheyi et al., 2022). Linkers can be classified into two types: cleavable and non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers release their payloads in response to specific conditions, such as the pH of cancer cells, reducing agents, and enzymes. Cleavable linkers may increase the efficiency of payload release, causing a bystander effect, but they also have a higher risk of increasing toxicity in normal tissues. On the other hand, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma, so they only release the drug after the antibody has been completely degraded in the lysosome. ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are not expected to induce a bystander effect. Currently, most ADCs use cleavable linkers."

                            "Linkers can be broadly classified as either cleavable (the payload is able to separate from the mAb at the tumour site) or non-cleavable (payload and mAb remain bound together, mAb is degraded following internalisation), and this, in turn, effects the modes of action of individual ADCs [39].\n\nWhile cleavable linkers undergo hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage, non-cleavable linkers do not fragment and, following antigen-specific internalisation, only release the cytotoxic payload after complete lysosomal degradation of the mAb [6]. Key advantages of non-cleavable linkers over their cleavable competitors are that non-cleavable linkers grant ADCs longer plasma half-lives, reduced off-target toxicity and-frequently-wider therapeutic windows [39]."

                            "Non-cleavable linkers are a significant building block of antibody-drug conjugates. They disengage their cytotoxic payload during the lysosomal degradation of the antibodydrug conjugate inside the tumor environment, bypassing the non-specific dispersion of the toxic preparation [37].\n\nNon-cleavable linkers are an innovational array of first-generation linkers with more advanced plasma stability than many cleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers do not seem to contain a definable payload dispersion mode, and ADCs developed with this mechanism depend on the lysosomal proteolytic decomposition of the antibody after ingestion to deliver the cytotoxic medicine. Via this strategy, the non-cleavable linker transporting the medication is attached to the conjugation amino acid within the antibody. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers are more contingent on the membrane biology of the neoplasm than cleavable linkers. ADCs designed with non-cleavable linkers have amplified plasma stability via an enhanced therapeutic index [37]. Due to the bystander sequence, this opposition to extracellular cleavage improves the specificity of payload delivery. Numerous clinical data and in vivo studies prove ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers surpass the efficacy of those with cleavable linkers [38].\n\nAnother advantage of non-cleavable linkers is heightened plasma stability. In vivo research studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linked ADCs outperform cleavable equivalents. mAb degradation contained in the lysosome after ADC ingestion is necessary for non-cleavable linkers to liberate their medical preparation. The payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs destroys the target cells, and non-cleavable linkers may theoretically offer a superior medicinal opportunity versus cleavable linkers. With a reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable ADCs, non-cleavable ADCs may offer improved stability and tolerability [39]."

Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Non-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability (Lu et al., 2016).

The chemical bond of non-cleavable linkers is highly stable in circulation and inside the cell. The release of an active potent drug inside a tumor cell is realized by degradation of antibodies in the lysosome. 57 More importantly, the recently approved ADC, trastuzumab-DM1 (Kadcycla), also utilized non-cleavable linkers to treat metastatic breast cancer.

                            "Linkers for ADCs can be classified into cleavable and non-cleavable ones. Non-cleavable linkers, e.g., the one in trastuzumab emtansine (Figure 3a), remain attached to the cytotoxic drug after proteolytic degradation of the antibody in the lysosome. The drug, with an attached linker and an amino acid or short proteolytic peptide to which the linker is conjugated, is released to the cytosol and exerts its cytotoxic activity (Erickson et al., 2006)[130]. Cleavable linkers, on the other hand, are cleaved by lysosomal enzymes, or by low pH or a reducing environment inside endosomes; the drug-attached fragment after cleavage is typically removed by self-immolative reaction, releasing the free cytotoxic payload (Bargh et al., 2019). Brentuximab vedotin, for example, has a cathepsin-cleavable linker (valine-citrulline linker), and MMAE is released by the self-immolative reaction of the remaining linker fragment (Doronina et al., 2003). \n\nRegardless of the type, the linker for ADC has to be highly stable in blood in order to minimize the release of highly cytotoxic free drugs into circulation and to maintain maximum amount of intact ADC molecules targeting cancer cells. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg\u2122) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa\u2122), for example, both have an acid-labile hydrazone linker, which is relatively stable at pH 7.4 but hydrolyzed with high efficiency in the acidic environment of lysosome [74]. However, the acid-labile hydrazone linker can be considerably less stable than some of the other types of cleavable linkers, which may contribute to the narrow therapeutic window and high toxicity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin [132]."

                            "Cleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the cancer TME over healthy tissues or systemic circulation (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021). They can be either chemically or enzymatically labile. Chemical linkers include hydrazone-or disulfide-bond-based linkers. The first type, used in commercially available Mylotarg \u00ae and Besponsa \u00ae , is sensitive to low pH and can be hydrolyzed within acidic early endosomes post-uptake. The second one can undergo reduction via intracellular thiols such as glutathione (GSH), whose levels are generally elevated in cancer cells (1-10 mmol/L) than in blood (5 \u00b5mol/L) (Ding et al., 2021). These linker types generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload able to promote bystander killing (Joubert et al., 2020)(Fu et al., 2022)(Sheyi et al., 2022). Notably, acid-sensitive linkers are insufficiently stable and can occasionally be hydrolyzed in the plasma, leading to premature drug release and off-target toxicity. This liability is one of the causes leading to the voluntary Mylotarg \u00ae withdrawal by Pfizer from the US market in 2000, following the severe liver toxicity seen in patients (Nguyen et al., 2023)(Sievers et al., 2001)(Petersdorf et al., 2013)",
                            "Due to their resistance to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, these linkers enjoy the advantages of increased plasma stability, longer half-lives, and lower off-target toxicity than the cleavable counterpart, rendering them potentially superior for targeting homogenously expressed Ag (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021). Nonetheless, as most tumors display heterogenous Ag expression, constructs incorporating cleavable linkers with membranepermeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects, unlike the non-cleavable linker type (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021)."

                            "PURPOSE\nThree open-label, multicenter trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single-agent Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin; CMA-676; Wyeth Laboratories, Philadelphia, PA), an antibody-targeted chemotherapy agent, in patients with CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in untreated first relapse.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThe study population comprised 142 patients with AML in first relapse with no history of an antecedent hematologic disorder and a median age of 61 years. All patients received Mylotarg as a 2-hour intravenous infusion, at a dose of 9 mg/m(2), at 2-week intervals for two doses. Patients were evaluated for remission, survival, and treatment-emergent adverse events.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty percent of patients treated with Mylotarg obtained remission as characterized by 5% or less blasts in the marrow, recovery of neutrophils to at least 1,500/microL, and RBC and platelet transfusion independence. Although patients treated with Mylotarg had relatively high incidences of myelosuppression, grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia (23%), and elevated hepatic transaminase levels (17%), the incidences of grade 3 or 4 mucositis (4%) and infections (28%) were relatively low. There was a low incidence of severe nausea and vomiting (11%) and no treatment-related cardiotoxicity, cerebellar toxicity, or alopecia. Many patients received Mylotarg on an outpatient basis (38% and 41% of patients for the first and second doses, respectively). Among the 142 patients, the median total duration of hospitalization was 24 days; 16% of patients required 7 days of hospitalization or less.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAdministration of the antibody-targeted chemotherapy agent Mylotarg to patients with CD33-positive AML in first relapse induces complete remissions with what appears to be a favorable safety profile."

Patients were randomly assigned to receive daunorubicin (45 mg/m(2) per day on days 1, 2, and 3), cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) per day by continuous infusion on days 1-7), and GO (6 mg/m(2) on day 4; DA+GO) vs standard induction therapy with daunorubicin (60 mg/m(2) per day on days 1, 2, and 3) and cytarabine alone (DA). Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) received 3 courses of high-dose cytarabine. Those remaining in CR after consolidation were randomly assigned to receive either no additional therapy or 3 doses of GO (5 mg/m(2) every 28 days). From August 2004 until August 2009, 637 patients were registered for induction. The CR rate was 69% for DA+GO and 70% for DA (P = .59). Among those who achieved a CR, the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 43% in the DA+GO group and 42% in the DA group (P = .40). The 5-year overall survival rate was 46% in the DA+GO group and 50% in the DA group (P = .85). One hundred seventy-four patients in CR after consolidation underwent the postconsolidation randomization. Disease-free survival was not improved with postconsolidation GO (HR, 1.48; P = .97). In this study, the addition of GO to induction or postconsolidation therapy failed to show improvement in CR rate, disease-free survival, or overall survival."

                            "According to the drug release mechanism, linkers for ADCs are generally categorized into cleavable linkers (acid-labile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers (Table 1) [51]. The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, proteasecleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers. Acid-cleavable linkers such as hydrazine linkers are designed to be stable at a neutral pH of circulation but can be hydrolyzed in lysosomes with a low pH environment",
                            "ADCs with disulfide linkers take advantage of reduced glutathione with high intracellular concentrations to release free drug inside the cell. ADCs with reducible disulfide linkers generate uncharged metabolites that can diffuse into neighboring cells and elicit bystander killing, which is essential for killing heterogeneous tumors (Mccombs et al., 2015)(Chari et al., 2014). \n\nADCs with cleavable linkers have broader efficacy and faster rates of activating and releasing cytotoxic drugs for most cell lines. In contrast, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers can possibly provide increased plasma stability, greater therapeutic window, and reduced off-target toxicity. To reduce aggregation and improve the solubility of some ADCs, hydrophilic linkers such as \u03b2-glucuronide linker, Sulfo-SPDB, and Mal-PEG4-NHS were investigated (Lu et al., 2016)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016). In short, each type of linker has advantages and disadvantages, and each can be modified to achieve a fine balance between target efficacies and undesired toxicities (Lu et al., 2016)."

A self-immolative p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) spacer between the dipeptides and the DOX was required for rapid and quantitative generation of free drug. DOX release from model substrate Z-Phe-Lys-PABC-DOX 49 was 30-fold faster than from Z-Val-Cit-PABC-DOX 42 with the cysteine protease cathepsin B alone, but rates were identical in a rat liver lysosomal preparation suggesting the participation of more than one enzyme. Conjugates 72 and 73 showed rapid and near quantitative drug release with cathepsin B and in a lysosomal preparation, while demonstrating excellent stability in human plasma. Against tumor cell lines with varying levels of BR96 expression, both conjugates showed potent, antigen-specific cytotoxic activity, suggesting that they will be effective in delivering DOX selectively to antigen-expressing carcinomas."

These linkers enhance plasma stability, rendering them less susceptible to the chemical or enzymatic environment in vivo following the internalization of ADCs by target cells (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Su et al., 2021). Once internalized, the antibody component of the ADCs is degraded within lysosomes, resulting in a complex of amino acids, linker, and cytotoxic agent. This mechanism ensures precise drug delivery to tumor cells, minimizing nonspecific drug release and reducing off-target effects (Kostova et al., 2021)",
                            "Despite their benefits, noncleavable linkers result in lower ADC payload release efficiency, potentially impacting therapeutic efficacy. These linkers also tend to inhibit bystander effects, because the released catabolites have poor cellular permeability. Consequently, identifying alternatives to improve drug release and enhance therapeutic outcomes has become a major focus of ongoing research."

Besides a number of approved drugs already on the market, there is a formidable follow-up of ADC candidates in clinical development. While selection of the appropriate antibody (A) and drug payload (D) is dictated by the pharmacology of the targeted disease, one has a broader choice of the conjugating linker (C). In the present paper, we review the chemistry of ADCs with a particular emphasis on the medicinal chemistry perspective, focusing on the chemical methods that enable the efficient assembly of the ADC from its three components and the controlled release of the drug payload."

Thus, the resultant release of the cytotoxic drugs is linked to the antibody's linker and an amino acid residue, which specifically kills tumor cells and doesn't release at non-target locations to cause any damage to healthy cells. Additionally, the non-cleavable linkers have provision to modify the chemical characteristics of small molecules to enhance the affinity of the transporter and increase its effectiveness. Although they have lesser membrane permeability, these linkers are more stable than cleavable ones and increase the therapeutic window by minimizing the off-target toxicities. Examples of non-cleavable linkers include thioether linkers (used in T-DM1) and maleimidebased linkers (used in belantamab mafodotin) (61)."

                            "In contrast to cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma but require the complete intracellular proteolytic catabolism of the ADCs to yield cytotoxic metabolites. These metabolites typically consist of the intact linker-payload attached to the conjugating amino acid residue from the antibodies, such as lysine-SMCC-DM1 for trastuzumab emtansine or cysteine-MC-MMAF for belantamab mafodotin (Lu et al., 2016). These metabolites are often charged and exhibit low permeability through cell membranes (Mccombs et al., 2015). Although ADCs employing non-cleavable linkers generally show a more favorable tolerability, potentially due to reduced off-target toxicity relating to free payload exposure, ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate a superior efficacy (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). This enhanced efficacy is partially attributed to the bystander effect, which refers to the ability of the free payload to diffuse from intracellular sites of ADC catabolism and payload release to neighboring cells within the local tumor environment (Singh et al., 2016). ADCs with lipophilic payloads and cleavable linkers, which make up more than 80% of the currently approved ADCs, are the preferred choice for the treatment of cancers associated with heterogeneous antigen expression or slow rates of antigen/ADC internalization (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues."

The previously described bystander effect, which impacts normal cells in the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells with no or low target expression, is more likely to occur with ADCs that utilize cleavable linkers [58](Pillow et al., 2016). Non-cleavable linkers, as opposed to cleavable linkers, have better plasma stability, less off-target toxicity, and resistance to proteolytic degradation, as they have non-reducible bonds with the amino acid residues of the antibody. Generally, non-cleavable linkers are formed by thioether or Maleimidocaproyl groups. Non-cleavable linkers that are attached to an amino acid residue derived from the degraded antibody must have the antibody moiety completely broken down by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases to release the payload following ADC internalization (Tsuchikama et al., 2016)(Su et al., 2021)."

They disengage their cytotoxic payload during the lysosomal degradation of the antibodydrug conjugate inside the tumor environment, bypassing the non-specific dispersion of the toxic preparation [37].\n\nNon-cleavable linkers are an innovational array of first-generation linkers with more advanced plasma stability than many cleavable linkers. Non-cleavable linkers do not seem to contain a definable payload dispersion mode, and ADCs developed with this mechanism depend on the lysosomal proteolytic decomposition of the antibody after ingestion to deliver the cytotoxic medicine. Via this strategy, the non-cleavable linker transporting the medication is attached to the conjugation amino acid within the antibody. ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers are more contingent on the membrane biology of the neoplasm than cleavable linkers. ADCs designed with non-cleavable linkers have amplified plasma stability via an enhanced therapeutic index [37]. Due to the bystander sequence, this opposition to extracellular cleavage improves the specificity of payload delivery. Numerous clinical data and in vivo studies prove ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers surpass the efficacy of those with cleavable linkers [38].\n\nAnother advantage of non-cleavable linkers is heightened plasma stability. In vivo research studies have demonstrated that non-cleavable linked ADCs outperform cleavable equivalents. mAb degradation contained in the lysosome after ADC ingestion is necessary for non-cleavable linkers to liberate their medical preparation. The payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs destroys the target cells, and non-cleavable linkers may theoretically offer a superior medicinal opportunity versus cleavable linkers. With a reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable ADCs, non-cleavable ADCs may offer improved stability and tolerability [39]."

The nature of the linker and spacer determines important features of ADCs, such as hydrophobic or lipophilic properties of payload, nontarget payload delivery, systemic toxicity, and most importantly, bystander killing [44]. The success of second-generation ADCs, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-Dxd) is largely attributed to cleavable linker technology. However, there is no consensus on which linkers are more promising. Selection of a linker depends on a variety of factors, including the target indication, payload size and toxicity, and the desired pharmacokinetics of the ADC. There are two large categories of linkers currently in use, including cleavable and non-cleavable ones. Cleavable linkers are further subdivided into three categories: peptide linkers (lysosomal enzyme sensitive), such as valine-citrulline linker (or vc linker), disulfide linkers (sensitive to reducing agents like glutathione), and hydrazone linkers (acid-sensitive).\n\nCleavable linkers have two major advantages compared to the non-cleavable moiety; increased site-specific activation and bystander killing effect."

                            "According to the drug release mechanism, linkers for ADCs are generally categorized into cleavable linkers (acid-labile linkers, protease cleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers) and non-cleavable linkers (Table 1) [51]. The ADC with non-cleavable linker requires lysosomal degradation of the antibody for releasing the cytotoxic agent, while that with cleavable linker involves hydrolysis, enzymatic reaction, or reduction to selectively release the cytotoxic drug based on the physiological environment to which the ADC is exposed [50]. Three major types of cleavable linkers are often used in ADCs: acid-cleavable linkers, proteasecleavable linkers, and disulfide linkers. Acid-cleavable linkers such as hydrazine linkers are designed to be stable at a neutral pH of circulation but can be hydrolyzed in lysosomes with a low pH environment",
                            "ADCs with disulfide linkers take advantage of reduced glutathione with high intracellular concentrations to release free drug inside the cell. ADCs with reducible disulfide linkers generate uncharged metabolites that can diffuse into neighboring cells and elicit bystander killing, which is essential for killing heterogeneous tumors (Mccombs et al., 2015)(Chari et al., 2014). \n\nADCs with cleavable linkers have broader efficacy and faster rates of activating and releasing cytotoxic drugs for most cell lines. In contrast, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers can possibly provide increased plasma stability, greater therapeutic window, and reduced off-target toxicity. To reduce aggregation and improve the solubility of some ADCs, hydrophilic linkers such as \u03b2-glucuronide linker, Sulfo-SPDB, and Mal-PEG4-NHS were investigated (Lu et al., 2016)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016). In short, each type of linker has advantages and disadvantages, and each can be modified to achieve a fine balance between target efficacies and undesired toxicities (Lu et al., 2016)."

We found that in culture, conjugates of either drug killed not only the target antigen-positive cells but also the neighboring antigen-negative cells. Furthermore, we showed that, in vivo, these conjugates were effective in eradicating tumors containing both antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells. The presence of antigen-positive cells was required for this killing of bystander cells. This target cell-activated killing of bystander cells was dependent on the nature of the linker between the antibody and the drug. Conjugates linked via a reducible disulfide bond were capable of exerting the bystander effect whereas equally potent conjugates linked via a nonreducible thioether bond were not. Our data offer a rationale for developing optimally constructed antibody-drug conjugates for treating tumors that express the target antigen either in a homogeneous or heterogeneous manner."

                            "We have previously shown that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) consisting of cAC10 (anti-CD30) linked to the antimitotic agent monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) lead to potent in vitro and in vivo activities against antigen positive tumor models. MMAF is a new antimitotic auristatin derivative with a charged C-terminal phenylalanine residue that attenuates its cytotoxic activity compared to its uncharged counterpart, MMAE, most likely due to impaired intracellular access. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated that mAb-maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl-MMAF (mAb-L1-MMAF) conjugates were >2200-fold more potent than free MMAF on a large panel of CD30 positive hematologic cell lines. As with cAC10-L1-MMAE, the corresponding MMAF ADC induced cures and regressions of established xenograft tumors at well tolerated doses. To further optimize the ADC, several new linkers were generated in which various components within the L1 linker were either altered or deleted. One of the most promising linkers contained a noncleavable maleimidocaproyl (L4) spacer between the drug and the mAb. cAC10-L4-MMAF was approximately as potent in vitro as cAC10-L1-MMAF against a large panel of cell lines and was equally potent in vivo. Importantly, cAC10-L4-MMAF was tolerated at >3 times the MTD of cAC10-L1-MMAF. LCMS studies indicated that drug released from cAC10-L4-MMAF was the cysteine-L4-MMAF adduct, which likely arises from mAb degradation within the lysosomes of target cells. This new linker technology appears to be ideally suited for drugs that are both relatively cell-impermeable and tolerant of substitution with amino acids. Thus, alterations of the linker have pronounced impacts on toxicity and lead to new ADCs with greatly improved therapeutic indices."

                            "Linkers are a critical component of the ADC and are key to the design of a safe, potent, and selective ADC (Peters et al., 2015). Developments in linker technology have greatly increased the ability of ADCs to selectively deliver their payload to target cells while limiting their systemic effects (Peters et al., 2015). Linkers generally fall into one of two categories: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Cleavable linkers rely on differences in the blood microenvironment and intracellular tumor environment to induce linker degradation. These take three forms: hydrazone, disulfide and peptide linkers, each of which is cleaved or degraded through a different mechanism (Peters et al., 2015). Hydrazone linkers are pH-sensitive and undergo acidic hydrolysis in the lysosomal microenvironment (Peters et al., 2015). Disulfide linkers are degraded by thiols, which commonly accumulate in tumor cells, where they act as antioxidants (Peters et al., 2015)(Harris et al., 2015). Peptide linkers are degraded by pH-dependent proteases, which are only active in the lysosome (Peters et al., 2015). ADCs with non-cleavable linkers rely on the near-complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody to release the cytotoxic agent. This makes them entirely dependent on being endocytosed to release their drug product. However, this tradeoff provides enhanced stability while the ADC is in circulation, as well as improvements in the ADC half-life (Peters et al., 2015)."

The most commonly used type of non-cleavable linkers in ADCs is thioether linkers, currently used in T-DM1 (Junttila et al., 2011). Cleavable linkers depend on the physiological conditions of the cell and can be subdivided into two types: pH-sensitive and protease-cleavable linkers (Polakis, 2016)(Bardia, 2017). pH-sensitive linkers utilize the lower pH in the endosomes and lysosomes of target tumor cells to trigger hydrolysis of acid labile groups within a linker, while protease-cleavable linkers utilize common proteases, found in lysosomes of target tumor cells, for specific peptide sequence recognition and cleavage in the linker (Polakis, 2016)(Bardia, 2017)[124]. It is important to note, however, that cleavable linkers display nonspecific release of the cytotoxic drug (Polakis, 2016)(Bardia, 2017)."

                            "HER2-targeted therapies have radically changed the prognosis of HER2-positive breast cancer over the last few years. However, resistance to these therapies has been a constant, leading to treatment-failure and new tumor progression. Recently, the kinase-impaired HER3 emerged as a pivotal player in oncogenic signaling, with an important role in both non-treated progression and treatment response. HER2/HER3 dimerization is required for full signaling potential and constitutes the key oncogenic unit. Also, when inhibiting PI3K/AKT pathway (as with anti-HER2 drugs) feedback mechanisms lead to a rebound in HER3 activity, which is one of the main roads to resistance. As current strategies to treat HER2-positive breast cancer are unable to inhibit this feedback response, two great promises emerged: the combination of targeted-therapies and drugs targeting HER3. In this article HER2 and HER3-targeted drugs and possible combinations between them, as well as the biomarkers to predict and monitor these drugs effect, are reviewed."

                            "Antibody-drug conjugates are targeted anticancer agents consisting of a cytotoxic drug covalently linked to a monoclonal antibody for tumor antigen-specific activity. Once bound to the target cell-surface antigen, the conjugate must be processed to release an active form of the drug, which can reach its intracellular target. Here, we used both biological and biochemical methods to better define this process for antibody-maytansinoid conjugates. In particular, we examined the metabolic fate in cells of huC242-maytansinoid conjugates containing either a disulfide linker (huC242-SPDB-DM4) or a thioether linker (huC242-SMCC-DM1). Using cell cycle analysis combined with lysosomal inhibitors, we showed that lysosomal processing is required for the activity of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, irrespective of the linker. We also identified and characterized the released maytansinoid molecules from these conjugates, and measured their rate of release compared with the kinetics of cell cycle arrest. Both conjugates are efficiently degraded in lysosomes to yield metabolites consisting of the intact maytansinoid drug and linker attached to lysine. The lysine adduct is the sole metabolite from the thioether-linked conjugate. However, the lysine metabolite generated from the disulfide-linked conjugate is reduced and S-methylated to yield the lipophilic and potently cytotoxic metabolite, S-methyl-DM4. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of antibody-maytansinoid conjugates in general, and more specifically, identify a biochemical mechanism that may account for the significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy observed with disulfide-linked conjugates."

These linkers can be non-cleavable, in which case they require more processing to release the payload, or cleavable, in which case they are related to tumor-specific factors, such lysosomal enzymes or changes in pH (low pH). It was demonstrated that cleavable linkers have the advantage of releasing the cytotoxic payload more efficiently. However, non-cleavable linkers may release their chemotherapy payloads with more specificity, but the antibody needs to be completely degraded in the lysosomes that might affect the payload.

                            "Linkers play a critical role in ensuring ADC stability and in optimising the delivery of the cytotoxic payload to tumour cells. Optimal linkers are stable in the circulation, which prevents premature payload release and systemic toxicities, but then rapidly cleaved once internalised in malignant cells, promoting efficient cell death (Su et al., 2021)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016). There are two types of linkers, classified based on the payload release mechanism: cleavable and noncleavable (Su et al., 2021). Cleavable linkers are designed to be degraded intracellularly, in response to a change from the extracellular environment to the intracellular environment (Tsuchikama et al., 2016). There are a variety of triggers for the degradation of cleavable linkers, including specific lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B (which cleaves Val-Cit and Val-Ala linkers coupled with PABC), acidic pH (which cleaves hydrazone), and glutathione (which cleaves disulfide bonds) (Tsuchikama et al., 2016). The majority of currently approved ADCs use cleavable linkers, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (Fu et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021). The advantages of cleavable linkers are the intracellular release of the payload and stability in the circulation, while disadvantages include potential premature cleavage in the peripheral circulation (Tsuchikama et al., 2016)(Gondi et al., 2013)(Doronina et al., 2008)(Baah et al., 2021). \n\nIn contrast, non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds that are resistant to proteolysis (Su et al., 2021). ADCs containing non-cleavable linkers rely on the near complete degradation of the antibody component by cytosolic and lysosomal proteases, which leaves the payload attached to the linker and an amino acid residue derived from the antibody [21]."

Following exposure to acidic or reducing environments or proteolytic enzymes, cleavable linkers are cut and release the ADC's cytotoxic payload (for example, Non-cleavable linkers are becoming more appealing than cleavable linkers due to the advantage of greater plasma stability. Furthermore, studies show that noncleavable linkers perform far better in vivo, with payload release occurring primarily in the lysosome following ADC internalisation and destruction of both the antibody and the linker (Fig. 2). As a result, the danger of systemic toxicity from premature payload release is reduced. As a result, non-cleavable linkers may offer a wider therapeutic window, as well as increased stability and tolerability (Lu et al., 2016). T-DM1 with mafodotin belantamab is one of two FDA-approved ADCs with non-cleavable linkers (Drago et al., 2021)."

This new antibody-based molecular platform enables selective delivery of a potent cytotoxic payload to target cancer cells, resulting in improved efficacy, reduced systemic toxicity, and preferable pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) and biodistribution compared to traditional chemotherapy. Boosted by the successes of FDA-approved Adcetris\u00ae and Kadcyla\u00ae, this drug class has been rapidly growing along with about 60 ADCs currently in clinical trials. In this article, we briefly review molecular aspects of each component (the antibody, payload, and linker) of ADCs, and then mainly discuss traditional and new technologies of the conjugation and linker chemistries for successful construction of clinically effective ADCs. Current efforts in the conjugation and linker chemistries will provide greater insights into molecular design and strategies for clinically effective ADCs from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology standpoints. The development of site-specific conjugation methodologies for constructing homogeneous ADCs is an especially promising path to improving ADC design, which will open the way for novel cancer therapeutics."

In particular, linker design plays a critical role in modulating ADC stability in the systemic circulation and payload release efficiency in the tumors, which thus affects ADC pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy and toxicity profiles. Previously, we have investigated key linker parameters such as conjugation chemistry (e.g., maleimide vs. disulfide), linker length and linker steric hindrance and their impacts on PK and efficacy profiles. Herein, we discuss our perspectives on development of integrated strategies for linker design to achieve a balance between ADC stability and payload release efficiency for desired efficacy in antigen-expressing xenograft models. The strategies have been successfully applied to the design of site-specific THIOMABTM antibody-drug conjugates (TDCs) with different payloads. We also propose to conduct dose fractionation studies to gain guidance for optimal dosing regimens of ADCs in pre-clinical models."

                "text": "\nTumor heterogeneity, characterized by variable antigen expression within and across tumor cells, represents a critical challenge in antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) efficacy and directly influences linker selection. Cleavable linkers offer significant advantages for treating heterogeneous tumors due to their ability to release free, membrane-permeable cytotoxic agents that can diffuse into and kill neighboring tumor cells regardless of their antigen expression <Paper corpusId=\"26250545\" paperTitle=\"(Kovtun et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>. This bystander killing effect is particularly valuable in solid tumors, which typically display significant antigen heterogeneity <Paper corpusId=\"267191025\" paperTitle=\"(Metrangolo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nComparative studies have demonstrated the importance of linker selection in addressing tumor heterogeneity. When the humanized monoclonal antibody huC242 was conjugated with DM1 using either a disulfide (cleavable) or thioether (non-cleavable) linker, the conjugate with the cleavable linker demonstrated superior efficacy in mixed cell populations and heterogeneous tumors due to its bystander effect <Paper corpusId=\"26250545\" paperTitle=\"(Kovtun et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, studies of HER2-targeting ADCs showed that those with membrane-permeable payloads could suppress both HER2-positive and HER2-negative cell populations in mixed tumor models, while ADCs with non-cleavable linkers affected only the HER2-positive cells <Paper corpusId=\"14925141\" paperTitle=\"(Ogitani et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nNon-cleavable linkers, while offering enhanced stability and reduced off-target toxicity, face significant limitations in treating heterogeneous tumors due to their inability to generate significant bystander effects <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. The charged drug-linker-amino acid complexes released from non-cleavable linkers typically have poor membrane permeability, confining their cytotoxic effects to antigen-expressing cells that have internalized the ADC <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This limitation makes ADCs with non-cleavable linkers potentially less effective against tumors with variable antigen expression <Paper corpusId=\"18023696\" paperTitle=\"(Lu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe therapeutic implications of these differences are significant. For tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression, which constitute the majority of solid tumors, cleavable linkers are generally preferred due to their bystander killing capabilities <Paper corpusId=\"267191025\" paperTitle=\"(Metrangolo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"247585469\" paperTitle=\"(Fu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. More than 80% of currently approved ADCs utilize cleavable linkers, reflecting their versatility and broader applicability across different cancer types <Paper corpusId=\"256296397\" paperTitle=\"(Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Conversely, non-cleavable linkers may be more suitable for treating tumors with homogeneous antigen expression where enhanced stability and reduced off-target effects are prioritized <Paper corpusId=\"260408796\" paperTitle=\"(Gogia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"267191025\" paperTitle=\"(Metrangolo et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent developments in ADC design have increasingly focused on optimizing linker properties to address tumor heterogeneity challenges. These approaches include developing ADCs with cleavable linkers that release lipophilic payloads capable of efficient diffusion through cell membranes, enhancing bystander killing potential while maintaining acceptable safety profiles <Paper corpusId=\"273542597\" paperTitle=\"(Bian et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, innovative approaches to enhance the permeability of payloads released from non-cleavable linkers are being explored to combine the stability advantages of non-cleavable linkers with improved efficacy against heterogeneous tumors <Paper corpusId=\"271530455\" paperTitle=\"(He et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe choice between cleavable and non-cleavable linkers ultimately requires careful consideration of tumor characteristics, with particular attention to antigen expression patterns and heterogeneity levels <Paper corpusId=\"231724417\" paperTitle=\"(Criscitiello et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This optimization remains a critical aspect of ADC development, directly influencing both efficacy and safety profiles across diverse cancer indications <Paper corpusId=\"195879565\" paperTitle=\"(Bargh et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

We found that in culture, conjugates of either drug killed not only the target antigen-positive cells but also the neighboring antigen-negative cells. Furthermore, we showed that, in vivo, these conjugates were effective in eradicating tumors containing both antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells. The presence of antigen-positive cells was required for this killing of bystander cells. This target cell-activated killing of bystander cells was dependent on the nature of the linker between the antibody and the drug. Conjugates linked via a reducible disulfide bond were capable of exerting the bystander effect whereas equally potent conjugates linked via a nonreducible thioether bond were not. Our data offer a rationale for developing optimally constructed antibody-drug conjugates for treating tumors that express the target antigen either in a homogeneous or heterogeneous manner."

                            "Cleavable linkers are designed to be processed at the tumor site, taking advantage of the unique properties of the cancer TME over healthy tissues or systemic circulation (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021). They can be either chemically or enzymatically labile. Chemical linkers include hydrazone-or disulfide-bond-based linkers. The first type, used in commercially available Mylotarg \u00ae and Besponsa \u00ae , is sensitive to low pH and can be hydrolyzed within acidic early endosomes post-uptake. The second one can undergo reduction via intracellular thiols such as glutathione (GSH), whose levels are generally elevated in cancer cells (1-10 mmol/L) than in blood (5 \u00b5mol/L) (Ding et al., 2021). These linker types generate a membrane-permeable neutral payload able to promote bystander killing (Joubert et al., 2020)(Fu et al., 2022)(Sheyi et al., 2022). Notably, acid-sensitive linkers are insufficiently stable and can occasionally be hydrolyzed in the plasma, leading to premature drug release and off-target toxicity. This liability is one of the causes leading to the voluntary Mylotarg \u00ae withdrawal by Pfizer from the US market in 2000, following the severe liver toxicity seen in patients (Nguyen et al., 2023)(Sievers et al., 2001)(Petersdorf et al., 2013)",
                            "Due to their resistance to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, these linkers enjoy the advantages of increased plasma stability, longer half-lives, and lower off-target toxicity than the cleavable counterpart, rendering them potentially superior for targeting homogenously expressed Ag (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021). Nonetheless, as most tumors display heterogenous Ag expression, constructs incorporating cleavable linkers with membranepermeant payloads are generally preferred due to their ability to induce bystander effects, unlike the non-cleavable linker type (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021)(Sheyi et al., 2022)(Su et al., 2021)(Kostova et al., 2021)."

                            "Antibody\u2013drug conjugates deliver anticancer agents selectively and efficiently to tumor tissue and have significant antitumor efficacy with a wide therapeutic window. DS\u20108201a is a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)\u2010targeting antibody\u2013drug conjugate prepared using a novel linker\u2010payload system with a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor, exatecan derivative (DX\u20108951 derivative, DXd). It was effective against trastuzumab emtansine (T\u2010DM1)\u2010insensitive patient\u2010derived xenograft models with both high and low HER2 expression. In this study, the bystander killing effect of DS\u20108201a was evaluated and compared with that of T\u2010DM1. We confirmed that the payload of DS\u20108201a, DXd (1), was highly membrane\u2010permeable whereas that of T\u2010DM1, Lys\u2010SMCC\u2010DM1, had a low level of permeability. Under a coculture condition of HER2\u2010positive KPL\u20104 cells and negative MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 cells in vitro, DS\u20108201a killed both cells, whereas T\u2010DM1 and an antibody\u2013drug conjugate with a low permeable payload, anti\u2010HER2\u2010DXd (2), did not. In vivo evaluation was carried out using mice inoculated with a mixture of HER2\u2010positive NCI\u2010N87 cells and HER2\u2010negative MDA\u2010MB\u2010468\u2010Luc cells by using an in vivo imaging system. In vivo, DS\u20108201a reduced the luciferase signal of the mice, indicating suppression of the MDA\u2010MB\u2010468\u2010Luc population; however, T\u2010DM1 and anti\u2010HER2\u2010DXd (2) did not. Furthermore, it was confirmed that DS\u20108201a was not effective against MDA\u2010MB\u2010468\u2010Luc tumors inoculated at the opposite side of the NCI\u2010N87 tumor, suggesting that the bystander killing effect of DS\u20108201a is observed only in cells neighboring HER2\u2010positive cells, indicating low concern in terms of systemic toxicity. These results indicated that DS\u20108201a has a potent bystander effect due to a highly membrane\u2010permeable payload and is beneficial in treating tumors with HER2 heterogeneity that are unresponsive to T\u2010DM1."

                            "Depending on the methods of releasing the payload in cells, there are two types of linkers, including cleavable and non-cleavable [22]. The cleavable linkers are either chemically labile (hydrazone bond and disulfide bond) or enzymatically labile. Hydrazone linkers are generally stable in alkaline environments and are hydrolyzed in low pH environments, such as that in the lysosome and endosome. Hence, the cleavage of ADCs with hydrazone linkers occurs predominantly in the lysosome and endosome upon internalization, with occasional hydrolysis in the plasma, resulting in off-target, systemic toxicity (Nolting, 2013). Similarly, a disulfide bond linker can be stable in the plasma while specifically releasing the active payloads in the cancer cells with an elevated reductive glutathione level (Zhang et al., 2019). The enzyme sensitive linkers are sensitive to the lysosomal protease that is generally overexpressed in cancer cells, enabling an accurate drug release in the cells after internalization (Gondi et al., 2013). ADCs with non-cleavable linkers are resistant to chemical or enzymatic digestion in the plasma and will require complete degradation of the antibody within the late endosomes and lysosome to release the payload. Therefore, ADCs with non-cleavable linkers may have the lowest off-target systemic toxicity due to increased plasma stability (Oflazoglu et al., 2008)(Kovtun et al., 2006), and thus they are most suitable in the treatment of tumors with homogenous antigen expression. Some of the ADCs have been engineered to have desirable \"off-target effect\" for \"by-stander killing\", extending the cytotoxic effect to the low or negative antigen-expressing cells in the tumor proximity. For this mechanism to work, several characteristics of the ADC molecules are crucial: namely, a cleavable linker and a non-polar, freely membrane-permeable payload [28]."

                            "In contrast to cleavable linkers, non-cleavable linkers are more stable in plasma but require the complete intracellular proteolytic catabolism of the ADCs to yield cytotoxic metabolites. These metabolites typically consist of the intact linker-payload attached to the conjugating amino acid residue from the antibodies, such as lysine-SMCC-DM1 for trastuzumab emtansine or cysteine-MC-MMAF for belantamab mafodotin (Lu et al., 2016). These metabolites are often charged and exhibit low permeability through cell membranes (Mccombs et al., 2015). Although ADCs employing non-cleavable linkers generally show a more favorable tolerability, potentially due to reduced off-target toxicity relating to free payload exposure, ADCs with cleavable linkers typically demonstrate a superior efficacy (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). This enhanced efficacy is partially attributed to the bystander effect, which refers to the ability of the free payload to diffuse from intracellular sites of ADC catabolism and payload release to neighboring cells within the local tumor environment (Singh et al., 2016). ADCs with lipophilic payloads and cleavable linkers, which make up more than 80% of the currently approved ADCs, are the preferred choice for the treatment of cancers associated with heterogeneous antigen expression or slow rates of antigen/ADC internalization (Mahalingaiah et al., 2019). Besides amplifying the anti-tumor potency, the bystander effect can also exacerbate the off-target toxicities of an ADC due to the increased distribution of lipophilic membrane-permeable payloads in normal tissues."

Non-cleavable linked ADCs have outperformed their cleavable counterparts in vivo in several studies, and mAb degradation within the lysosome after ADC internalization is required for non-cleavable linkers to release active drug (Monteiro et al., 2015). Non-cleavable linkers can potentially provide a greater therapeutic window compared to cleavable linkers, due to the fact that the payload derivative from non-cleavable ADCs can kill the target cells (Doronina et al., 2006)(Erickson et al., 2006). In addition, a potentially reduced off-target toxicity compared to the cleavable linker conjugates is expectable, as non-cleavable ADCs can provide greater stability and tolerability. \n\nYelena et al. synthesized the huC242-SMCC-DM1 conjugate binding DM1 to the humanized monoclonal antibody (huC242) via an N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 -carboxylate (SMCC) for non-cleavable thioether linker and tested the cytotoxicity of conjugate on COLO 205 cells and Namalwa cells. Compared with the cantuzumab mertansine (huC242-DM1) containing a cleavable disulfide linker, the huC242-SMCC-DM1 is efficacious only against tumors in which all proliferating cells express the target antigen, and displayed significantly lower in vivo activity in multiple xenograft tumor models (Figure 4) (Kovtun et al., 2006)."

It combines both the advantages of highly specific targeting ability and highly potent killing effect to achieve accurate and efficient elimination of cancer cells, which has become one of the hotspots for the research and development of anticancer drugs. Since the first ADC, Mylotarg \u00ae (gemtuzumab ozogamicin), was approved in 2000 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there have been 14 ADCs received market approval so far worldwide. Moreover, over 100 ADC candidates have been investigated in clinical stages at present. This kind of new anti-cancer drugs, known as \"biological missiles\", is leading a new era of targeted cancer therapy. Herein, we conducted a review of the history and general mechanism of action of ADCs, and then briefly discussed the molecular aspects of key components of ADCs and the mechanisms by which these key factors influence the activities of ADCs. Moreover, we also reviewed the approved ADCs and other promising candidates in phase-3 clinical trials and discuss the current challenges and future perspectives for the development of next generations, which provide insights for the research and development of novel cancer therapeutics using ADCs."

                            "Linkers can be broadly categorized into either cleavable or non-cleavable variants depending on the release mechanisms of their cytotoxic payloads (Tsuchikama et al., 2016). Cleavable linkers are versatile and widely employed in ADC development. These linkers chemically release the payload through reduction, proteolysis, or hydrolysis based on specific tumor cell-associated processes, such as acidification, glutathione reduction, or lysosomal protease activity (Bargh et al., 2019)(Nolting, 2013). Non-cleavable linkers consist of chemical structures that are not fragmented by enzymatic degradation. They resist conventional biochemical processes and require complete lysosomal degradation for payload release. This increases the likelihood of payload release within the target cells while minimizing cytotoxic effects on healthy cells (Oflazoglu et al., 2008). Non-cleavable linkers generally result in less toxicity and have a longer half-life when compared to cleavable linkers (Fu et al., 2022)(Baah et al., 2021). One major disadvantage of non-cleavable linkers, however, is the lack of antitumor activity against adjacent neoplastic cells that may not express the target antigen of the ADC (i.e., bystander killing) (Ogitani et al., 2016)."

                            "Researchers have explored different types of linkers, which can be broadly classified into two categories: cleavable and noncleavable linkers. (Sheyi et al., 2022)55,56 Cleavable linkers have the ability to release a metabolite of the effector molecules from the ADC, allowing it to enter cells, either at the tumor site or within endosomes and lysosomes. These cleavable linkers are further divided into chemically cleavable linkers and enzymatically cleavable linkers, such as peptide-based linkers, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers, and phosphate-based linkers. (Sheyi et al., 2022) Notably, \u03b2-glucuronide-based linkers consist of \u03b2-glucuronidase-sensitive linkers and \u03b2-galactosidase-sensitive linkers. Premature cleavage of these linkers can lead to the effector molecules harming normal cells. (Beck et al., 2017) On the other hand, noncleavable linkers, such as thioether linkers and maleimido caproyl linkers, require internalization of the ADC into cells and subsequent breakdown by lysosomes to release the effector molecules. ADCs with noncleavable linkers depend on complete lysosomal enzymatic degradation of the antibody for payload release, resulting in simultaneous dissociation of the linker. 58",
                            "Therefore, the use of noncleavable linkers must ensure that the linker-drug complex retains the ability to kill tumor cells. Considering the cytotoxicity of the payload and bystander effect, cleavable linkers are prioritized in ADC development, despite a few approved noncleavable effective linkers."

                            "Linkers are biochemical compounds connecting the antibody to the payload. Effective linkers have to guarantee ADC stability in the bloodstream as well as to allow an efficient cleavage upon internalization into tumor cells. Linkers can be classified into cleavable and non-cleavable according to their chemical properties (Beck et al., 2017)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016). Non-cleavable linkers consist of stable bonds resistant to proteolytic degradation, so that cleavage occurs only after lysosome internalization and complete degradation of the antibody. These linkers have higher stability than cleavable ones, but can suffer from lower membrane permeability. Conversely, cleavage of cleavable linkers can depend on external pH (acid-labile linkers), specific lysosomal proteases (protease-cleavable linkers) or glutathione reduction (disulphide linkers) (Beck et al., 2017)(Tsuchikama et al., 2016)(Shen et al., 2012)(Bargh et al., 2019). All aspects of ADC pharmacology can be influenced by the specific design of the linker, as drug stability into circulation, tumor cell permeability, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR, i.e. the number of payload moleculas carried by each antibody), and extent of the bystander effect (Beck et al., 2017)(Shen et al., 2012)."

The properties of the linker between the antibody and the payload are proven to be critical to the success of an ADC. Although ADC linkers can be 'non-cleavable', the vast majority of ADCs in clinical development have specific release mechanisms to allow controlled linker cleavage at the target site and are thus termed 'cleavable'. In recent years, the development of new methods of drug release from ADCs has continued in parallel to the deepening understanding of the biological processes underlying the mechanisms of action of pre-existing technologies.
