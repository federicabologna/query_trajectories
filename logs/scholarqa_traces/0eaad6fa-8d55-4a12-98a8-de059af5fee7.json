Even if islet replacement could be considered a preferable alternative to insulin therapy in long-term diabetic patients, this therapeutic option will be practically limited by the number of islet donors that will never be sufficient. A possible solution to the problem of tissue supply may be found by investigating the potential of embryonic as well as induced pluripotent stem cells to generate functional insulinproducing cells.

Bertera, M. Grupillo, M. Trucco, R. Bottino\n## Abstract\nThe therapy of type 1 diabetes is an open challenging problem. The restoration of normoglycemia and insulin independence in immunosuppressed type 1 diabetic recipients of islet allotransplantation has shown the potential of a cell-based diabetes therapy. Even if successful, this approach poses a problem of scarce tissue supply. Xenotransplantation can be the answer to this limited donor availability and, among possible candidate tissues for xenotransplantation, porcine islets are the closest to a future clinical application. Xenotransplantation, with pigs as donors, offers the possibility of using healthy, living, and genetically modified islets from pathogen-free animals available in unlimited number of islets. Several studies in the pig-to-nonhuman primate model demonstrated the feasibility of successful preclinical islet xenotransplantation and have provided insights into the critical events and possible mechanisms of immune recognition and rejection of xenogeneic islet grafts. Particularly promising results in the achievement of prolonged insulin independence were obtained with newly developed, genetically modified pigs islets able to produce immunoregulatory products, using different implantation sites, and new immunotherapeutic strategies. Nonetheless, further efforts are needed to generate additional safety and efficacy data in nonhuman primate models to safely translate these findings into the clinic.\n## Introduction\nIn the year 2000 the Edmonton protocol proved that clinical pancreatic islet allotransplantation (alloTx) can be successfully performed to treat type 1 diabetes (T1D) using a steroid-free immunosuppressive regimen [1]. Even if islet replacement could be considered a preferable alternative to insulin therapy in long-term diabetic patients, this therapeutic option will be practically limited by the number of islet donors that will never be sufficient. A possible solution to the problem of tissue supply may be found by investigating the potential of embryonic as well as induced pluripotent stem cells to generate functional insulinproducing cells. Clinical applications await successful testing in animal models. Alternatively, xenotransplantation (xenoTx) of pig islets is currently the most advanced and appealing approach with respect to a possible clinical application [2]. Pigs are the best candidates as human substitutes [3] for several reasons: pig insulin differs from human insulin by just one amino acid; pig islets have lower sensitivity to destruction by recurrent T1D autoimmunity than human islets [4], they do not accumulate amyloid [5], and pig donors can be genetically modified to improve immunomodulation and cytoprotection of pig islets. The experimental results of pig islets to non-human diabetic primates xenoTx are more encouraging than those obtained using pig whole organs, which makes their employment predictable in clinical trials in the next few years [6\u2022\u2022]. To make this technique a clinically feasible treatment option we need to generate more convincing preclinical data in the pig-to-primate xenoTx model.",

In the present study, we found that the transplantation of isolated and purified caprine islets, in combination with thalidomide treatment, reversed diabetes in STZ-induced diabetic BALB/c mice as evidenced by increased serum insulin and restoration of euglycemia. These  results are consistent with other studies indicating the efficacy of thalidomide treatment in preventing islet graft rejection, improving graft function and survival in the recipient [12]. \n\nCaprine islet grafts in the immunosuppressed group resulted in approximately similar non-fasting blood glucose levels as in the normal control mice which were near to glucose level in caprine (3.2-8.2 mM). As previously reported, islet xenotransplantation in diabetic animal models establishes normoglycemia in the recipients to the point that is normal for the donor instead of the recipient [31,32]. The results of this study showed that caprine islet grafts are capable of reversing diabetes and normalizing blood glucose levels in the recipient's body. \n\nThe IPGTT profiles revealed the glucose responsiveness of the caprine islet grafts, findings that are comparable to results obtained with islet cells recovered from other mammalian species including pigs, primates, and rodents [33][34][35][36][37][38]. In addition, caprine islets elicited an insulin response under both basal-and glucose-stimulated conditions, with insulin levels equivalent to those obtained with islets from other mammals such as pigs, cows, and dogs, but less than those obtained with rodent islets [39]. Rodent islets secrete much more insulin than islets from human or porcine sources, either basally or under glucose stimulation [40]. Caprine islet cells are efficient insulin-producing cells, similar to human and porcine islet cells, because they were able to maintain euglycemia and glucose  responsiveness in recipients.",

Hani, Z. Allaudin, M. Mohd-Lila, T. Ibrahim, A. Othman\n## Abstract\nType 1 diabetes mellitus is a devastating disease for which there is currently no cure, but only lifetime management. Islet xenotransplantation is a promising technique for the restoration of blood glucose control in patients with diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential use of caprine (goat) islet cells as xenogeneic grafts in the treatment for diabetes in a mouse model.\n## Discussion\nThe major obstacle to successful xenotransplantation is the immunological incompatibility between donor and recipient. In the present study, we found that the transplantation of isolated and purified caprine islets, in combination with thalidomide treatment, reversed diabetes in STZ-induced diabetic BALB/c mice as evidenced by increased serum insulin and restoration of euglycemia. These  results are consistent with other studies indicating the efficacy of thalidomide treatment in preventing islet graft rejection, improving graft function and survival in the recipient [12]. \n\nCaprine islet grafts in the immunosuppressed group resulted in approximately similar non-fasting blood glucose levels as in the normal control mice which were near to glucose level in caprine (3.2-8.2 mM). As previously reported, islet xenotransplantation in diabetic animal models establishes normoglycemia in the recipients to the point that is normal for the donor instead of the recipient [31,32]. The results of this study showed that caprine islet grafts are capable of reversing diabetes and normalizing blood glucose levels in the recipient's body. \n\nThe IPGTT profiles revealed the glucose responsiveness of the caprine islet grafts, findings that are comparable to results obtained with islet cells recovered from other mammalian species including pigs, primates, and rodents [33][34][35][36][37][38]. In addition, caprine islets elicited an insulin response under both basal-and glucose-stimulated conditions, with insulin levels equivalent to those obtained with islets from other mammals such as pigs, cows, and dogs, but less than those obtained with rodent islets [39]. Rodent islets secrete much more insulin than islets from human or porcine sources, either basally or under glucose stimulation [40]. Caprine islet cells are efficient insulin-producing cells, similar to human and porcine islet cells, because they were able to maintain euglycemia and glucose  responsiveness in recipients.",

            "abstract": "Clinical pancreatic islet transplantation is under evaluation for the treatment of autoimmune diabetes, yet several limitations preclude widespread use. For example, there is a critical shortage of human pancreas donors. Xenotransplantation may solve this problem, yet it evokes a rigorous immune response which can lead to graft rejection. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), a clinically available and safe circulating anti-inflammatory and tissue protective glycoprotein, facilitates islet alloimmune-tolerance and protects from inflammation in several models. Here, we examine whether human AAT (hAAT), alone or in combination with clinically relevant approaches, achieves long-term islet xenograft survival. Rat-to-mouse islet transplantation was examined in the following groups: untreated (n\u200a=\u200a6), hAAT (n\u200a=\u200a6, 60\u2013240 mg/kg every 3 days from day \u221210), low-dose co-stimulation blockade (anti-CD154/LFA-1) and single-dose anti-CD4/CD8 (n\u200a=\u200a5\u20137), either as mono- or combination therapies. Islet grafting was accompanied by blood glucose follow-up. In addition, skin xenografting was performed in order to depict responses that occur in draining lymph nodes. According to our results hAAT monotherapy and hAAT/anti-CD154/LFA-1 combined therapy, did not delay rejection day (11\u201324 days untreated vs. 10\u201322 day treated). However, host and donor intragraft inflammatory gene expression was diminished by hAAT therapy in both setups. Single dose T-cell depletion using anti-CD4/CD8 depleting antibodies, which provided 14\u201315 days of reduced circulating T-cells, significantly delayed rejection day (28\u201352 days) but did not achieve graft acceptance. In contrast, in combination with hAAT, the group displayed significantly extended rejection days and a high rate of graft acceptance (59, 61, >90, >90, >90). In examination of graft explants, marginal mononuclear-cell infiltration containing regulatory T-cells predominated surviving xenografts. We suggest that temporal T-cell depletion, as in the clinically practiced anti-thymocyte-globulin therapy, combined with hAAT, may promote islet xenograft acceptance. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism behind the observed synergy, as well as the applicability of the approach for pig-to-human islet xenotransplantation.",

Further studies may both enhance our understanding of the mechanism behind the protective attributes of this clinically-safe approach, as well as to directly test its feasibility in pig-to-human islet xenotransplantation.",

Baranovski, G. Shahaf, E. Lewis\n## Abstract\nClinical pancreatic islet transplantation is under evaluation for the treatment of autoimmune diabetes, yet several limitations preclude widespread use. For example, there is a critical shortage of human pancreas donors. Xenotransplantation may solve this problem, yet it evokes a rigorous immune response which can lead to graft rejection. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), a clinically available and safe circulating anti-inflammatory and tissue protective glycoprotein, facilitates islet alloimmune-tolerance and protects from inflammation in several models. Here, we examine whether human AAT (hAAT), alone or in combination with clinically relevant approaches, achieves long-term islet xenograft survival. Rat-to-mouse islet transplantation was examined in the following groups: untreated (n\u200a=\u200a6), hAAT (n\u200a=\u200a6, 60\u2013240 mg/kg every 3 days from day \u221210), low-dose co-stimulation blockade (anti-CD154/LFA-1) and single-dose anti-CD4/CD8 (n\u200a=\u200a5\u20137), either as mono- or combination therapies. Islet grafting was accompanied by blood glucose follow-up. In addition, skin xenografting was performed in order to depict responses that occur in draining lymph nodes. According to our results hAAT monotherapy and hAAT/anti-CD154/LFA-1 combined therapy, did not delay rejection day (11\u201324 days untreated vs. 10\u201322 day treated). However, host and donor intragraft inflammatory gene expression was diminished by hAAT therapy in both setups. Single dose T-cell depletion using anti-CD4/CD8 depleting antibodies, which provided 14\u201315 days of reduced circulating T-cells, significantly delayed rejection day (28\u201352 days) but did not achieve graft acceptance. In contrast, in combination with hAAT, the group displayed significantly extended rejection days and a high rate of graft acceptance (59, 61, >90, >90, >90). In examination of graft explants, marginal mononuclear-cell infiltration containing regulatory T-cells predominated surviving xenografts. We suggest that temporal T-cell depletion, as in the clinically practiced anti-thymocyte-globulin therapy, combined with hAAT, may promote islet xenograft acceptance. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism behind the observed synergy, as well as the applicability of the approach for pig-to-human islet xenotransplantation.\n## Discussion\nIn conclusion, the study demonstrates that combined temporal T-cell blockade and hAAT therapy, both clinically viable options, are able to significantly advance islet xenograft acceptance in the studied model. Since the mechanism of xenotransplantation is not fully understood, further research is needed to understand the entities that limit such success from reaching full impact. Further studies may both enhance our understanding of the mechanism behind the protective attributes of this clinically-safe approach, as well as to directly test its feasibility in pig-to-human islet xenotransplantation.",

In murine models, BTM did not impair syngeneic islet renal-subcapsular transplant viability or function, and it facilitated diabetes cure for over 150 days.

Two-photon intravital imaging used to map vessel growth through time identified dense vascular networks, with significant collagen deposition and increases in vessel mass up to 30 days after BTM implantation. In a preclinical porcine skin model, BTM implants created a highly vascularized intracutaneous site by day 7 postimplantation. When syngeneic neonatal porcine islets were transplanted intracutaneously, the islets remained differentiated as insulin-producing cells, maintained normal islet architecture, secreted c-peptide, and survived for over 100 days. Here, we show that BTM facilitates formation of an islet-supportive intracutaneous neodermis in a porcine preclinical model, as an alternative islet-transplant site. Article Highlights Human and porcine pancreatic islets were transplanted into a fully vascularized biodegradable temporizing matrix (Novosorb) that creates a unique intracutaneous site outside of the liver in a large-animal preclinical model. The intracutaneous prevascularized site supported pancreatic islet survival for 3 months in a syngeneic porcine-transplant model. Pancreatic (human and porcine) islet survival and function were demonstrated in an intracutaneous site outside of the liver for the first time in a large-animal preclinical model.",

Most of this process is completed by 12 months, and certainly by 18 months there is no histological evidence of its implantation. \n\nThere are several strengths to this study, including the demonstration of long-term islet survival in a robust, syngeneic, large-animal model and islet survival in the background of systemic immunosuppression in both the allogeneic and xenogeneic porcine models with evidence of early function, as demonstrated by the detection of serum c-peptide, in the xenogeneic transplant group, thus supporting further translational development toward curative models. Another major strength of the study is that the porcine model represents the animal skin model most similar to humans. Unlike rodents and nonhuman primates, pigs lack a panniculus carnosus (i.e., subcutaneous muscle layer under hair-bearing skin); instead, they possess a panniculus adiposus, a structure in common with human skin in all but a few locations. However, pig models also pose significant challenges (e.g., maintaining immune suppression, husbandry issues, dietary considerations) that make curative studies challenging. Nonetheless, given the physiological and architectural similarities of porcine and human skin, the current data would be supportive of future work using BTM to facilitate a novel, alternative site for islet transplantation. \n\nA current limitation of the study relates to the distribution and delivery of islets into the intracutaneous site. It is recognized that islets need to be within 200 mm of a blood supply for viability; hence, the cannula route of administration used in this study, although appropriate for demonstration of proof of principle and function on implanted islets, is not yet optimized to deliver an islet mass necessary for insulin independence in large animals. Because the external diameter of the cannula was 500 mm, islets in the central core were potentially rendered ischemic. Further experimentation to optimally deliver islets in proximity to vasculature is required.",

Two-photon intravital imaging used to map vessel growth through time identified dense vascular networks, with significant collagen deposition and increases in vessel mass up to 30 days after BTM implantation. In a preclinical porcine skin model, BTM implants created a highly vascularized intracutaneous site by day 7 postimplantation. When syngeneic neonatal porcine islets were transplanted intracutaneously, the islets remained differentiated as insulin-producing cells, maintained normal islet architecture, secreted c-peptide, and survived for over 100 days. Here, we show that BTM facilitates formation of an islet-supportive intracutaneous neodermis in a porcine preclinical model, as an alternative islet-transplant site. Article Highlights Human and porcine pancreatic islets were transplanted into a fully vascularized biodegradable temporizing matrix (Novosorb) that creates a unique intracutaneous site outside of the liver in a large-animal preclinical model. The intracutaneous prevascularized site supported pancreatic islet survival for 3 months in a syngeneic porcine-transplant model. Pancreatic (human and porcine) islet survival and function were demonstrated in an intracutaneous site outside of the liver for the first time in a large-animal preclinical model.\n## DISCUSSION\nLarger molecular residue is absorbed by macrophages or giant cells, leaving an intact blood vasculature, which has shown persistence in human biopsy specimens out to 5 years. Most of this process is completed by 12 months, and certainly by 18 months there is no histological evidence of its implantation. \n\nThere are several strengths to this study, including the demonstration of long-term islet survival in a robust, syngeneic, large-animal model and islet survival in the background of systemic immunosuppression in both the allogeneic and xenogeneic porcine models with evidence of early function, as demonstrated by the detection of serum c-peptide, in the xenogeneic transplant group, thus supporting further translational development toward curative models. Another major strength of the study is that the porcine model represents the animal skin model most similar to humans. Unlike rodents and nonhuman primates, pigs lack a panniculus carnosus (i.e., subcutaneous muscle layer under hair-bearing skin); instead, they possess a panniculus adiposus, a structure in common with human skin in all but a few locations. However, pig models also pose significant challenges (e.g., maintaining immune suppression, husbandry issues, dietary considerations) that make curative studies challenging. Nonetheless, given the physiological and architectural similarities of porcine and human skin, the current data would be supportive of future work using BTM to facilitate a novel, alternative site for islet transplantation. \n\nA current limitation of the study relates to the distribution and delivery of islets into the intracutaneous site. It is recognized that islets need to be within 200 mm of a blood supply for viability; hence, the cannula route of administration used in this study, although appropriate for demonstration of proof of principle and function on implanted islets, is not yet optimized to deliver an islet mass necessary for insulin independence in large animals. Because the external diameter of the cannula was 500 mm, islets in the central core were potentially rendered ischemic. Further experimentation to optimally deliver islets in proximity to vasculature is required.\n...\nFurther experimentation to optimally deliver islets in proximity to vasculature is required. In addition, the dose of islets transplanted in the preclinical porcine models was not intended to be curative; only the xeno-islet transplant group was rendered diabetic to look for early evidence of function, and the islet dose for all three models was governed by the islet isolation yield achieved. \n\nNevertheless, these studies show proof of principle in large-animal models that pancreatic islets may be successfully transplanted into an intracutaneous site mirroring human skin. Further characterization of this site with regard to potential reduction in instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction should also be performed. The advantage of being able to visualize the islet graft, biopsy specimen, or to completely remove the cellular transplant makes this site a safe option for transplantation of stem cell and xenogeneic sources of insulin-secreting tissue with the potential for translation into clinical practice via this alternative transplant site.",

Even when well controlled\u2014by frequent monitoring of blood glucose and administration of insulin, the long-term complications of the disease are significant and include cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy (1). Here we review recent progress in preclinical models of pig islet xenotransplantation and discuss the remaining challenges that need to be addressed before the application of this form of therapy can be established in patients with T1D.\n\nDuring the past decade, islet allotransplantation alone (without previous kidney transplantation) using deceased human donor pancreata has been indicated mainly in patients who have had T1D for >5 years with life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes and wide fluctuations in blood glucose levels. Although the initial long-term results were rather disappointing (2), the results of islet allotransplantation have improved significantly in recent years, with 5-year insulin-independent normoglycemia achieved in >50% of patients at experienced centers (3). There is increasing evidence that successful islet allotransplantation greatly reduces the incidence of hypoglycemic episodes (2) and reduces or slows the incidence of late complications of T1D (4). This may extend the indications for islet transplantation to patients with progressive complications. For example, islet transplantation in a patient with preterminal renal failure may prevent disease progression, possibly avoiding the need for hemodialysis and kidney transplantation, provided that nonnephrotoxic immunosuppressive drug therapy is administered.\n\nCurrently, in the U.S., the median waiting time for a kidney allograft from a deceased human donor is >4 years (5). However, islets from two deceased human donor pancreata are frequently required to achieve normoglycemia in a diabetic patient.

Alternative anatomical sites for islet transplantation. Even though the pig could provide an unlimited supply of islets, the inefficiency of islet transplantation into the portal vein resulting from IBMIR remains an obstacle for applying islet xenotransplantation on a clinical scale. To avoid or minimize IBMIR, an alternative approach is to place the islets in a site where they are not immediately exposed to blood, and investigation in this area is ongoing. A number of sites have been investigated, some of which seem worthy of continued assessment. \n\nTransplantation into the gastric submucosal space can be achieved through endoscopy (40) and offers the advantage of possible endoscopic biopsy of the graft for investigation of rejection, apoptosis, or both (41).

In the U.S., it is estimated that about 1.5 million people suffer from T1D. Even when well controlled\u2014by frequent monitoring of blood glucose and administration of insulin, the long-term complications of the disease are significant and include cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy (1). Here we review recent progress in preclinical models of pig islet xenotransplantation and discuss the remaining challenges that need to be addressed before the application of this form of therapy can be established in patients with T1D.\n\nDuring the past decade, islet allotransplantation alone (without previous kidney transplantation) using deceased human donor pancreata has been indicated mainly in patients who have had T1D for >5 years with life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes and wide fluctuations in blood glucose levels. Although the initial long-term results were rather disappointing (2), the results of islet allotransplantation have improved significantly in recent years, with 5-year insulin-independent normoglycemia achieved in >50% of patients at experienced centers (3). There is increasing evidence that successful islet allotransplantation greatly reduces the incidence of hypoglycemic episodes (2) and reduces or slows the incidence of late complications of T1D (4). This may extend the indications for islet transplantation to patients with progressive complications. For example, islet transplantation in a patient with preterminal renal failure may prevent disease progression, possibly avoiding the need for hemodialysis and kidney transplantation, provided that nonnephrotoxic immunosuppressive drug therapy is administered.\n\nCurrently, in the U.S., the median waiting time for a kidney allograft from a deceased human donor is >4 years (5). However, islets from two deceased human donor pancreata are frequently required to achieve normoglycemia in a diabetic patient. Because of the limited number of suitable deceased donor pancreata, the overall number of \u2026\n## STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME THE REMAINING HURDLES\nAlemtuzumab for deep lymphodepleting induction therapy currently is included in the most successful clinical regimens for islet allotransplantation. We have recently developed an NHP model for the use of alemtuzumab (39), and we plan to use alemtuzumab in our next islet xenotransplantation experiments. Alternative anatomical sites for islet transplantation. Even though the pig could provide an unlimited supply of islets, the inefficiency of islet transplantation into the portal vein resulting from IBMIR remains an obstacle for applying islet xenotransplantation on a clinical scale. To avoid or minimize IBMIR, an alternative approach is to place the islets in a site where they are not immediately exposed to blood, and investigation in this area is ongoing. A number of sites have been investigated, some of which seem worthy of continued assessment. \n\nTransplantation into the gastric submucosal space can be achieved through endoscopy (40) and offers the advantage of possible endoscopic biopsy of the graft for investigation of rejection, apoptosis, or both (41). Intramuscular transplantation has already reached the clinical stage in islet autotransplantation (42). In diabetic monkeys, islets loaded onto a biodegradable scaffold, wrapped with omentum and placed between abdominal muscle layers, resulted in significant metabolic improvement in allotransplantation experiments (43). Immunomodulation. Pig islet transplantation may be enhanced by cotransplantation of mesenchymal stem cells of either recipient or donor origin (44) or of donor Sertoli cells (45). Both cell types may provide immunoprotection, revascularize the islets more quickly, and reduce inflammatory response.",

            "abstract": "Xenotransplantation using porcine donors is rapidly approaching clinical applicability as an alternative therapy for treatment of many end-stage diseases including type 1 diabetes. Porcine neonatal islet cell clusters (NICC) have normalised blood sugar levels for relatively short periods in the preclinical diabetic rhesus model but have met with limited success in the stringent baboon model. Here we report that NICC from genetically modified (GM) pigs deleted for \u03b1Gal and expressing the human complement regulators CD55 and CD59 can cure diabetes long-term in immunosuppressed baboons, with maximum graft survival exceeding 22 months. Five diabetic baboons were transplanted intraportally with 9,673 \u2013 56,913 islet equivalents (IEQ) per kg recipient weight. Immunosuppression consisted of T cell depletion with an anti-CD2 mAb, tacrolimus for the first 4 months, and maintenance with belatacept and anti-CD154; no anti-inflammatory treatment or cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis/treatment was given. This protocol was well tolerated, with all recipients maintaining or gaining weight. Recipients became insulin-independent at a mean of 87 \u00b1 43 days post-transplant and remained insulin-independent for 397 \u00b1 174 days. Maximum graft survival was 675 days. Liver biopsies showed functional islets staining for all islet endocrine components, with no evidence of the inflammatory blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) and minimal leukocytic infiltration. The costimulation blockade-based immunosuppressive protocol prevented an anti-pig antibody response in all recipients. In conclusion, we demonstrate that genetic modification of the donor pig enables attenuation of early islet xenograft injury, and in conjunction with judicious immunosuppression provides excellent long-term function and graft survival in the diabetic baboon model.",

This incredible burden is treated with various forms of exogenous insulin therapy but whole pancreas or islet cell transplantation remains the gold standard for treatment. Pancreas or islet transplantation restores glucose homeostasis without constant external monitoring and prevents the occurrence of severe hypoglycaemic episodes, dramatically improving the patient's quality of life and attenuating the secondary complications of diabetes (2). However, there are too few organ donors to provide enough pancreata for even a fraction of the patients who would benefit from transplantation. This shortage has stimulated extensive research into the use of pigs as alternative islet donors. One advantage of using pigs is that they can be genetically modified to protect islet xenografts from immunological challenges including the intense innate response triggered by intraportal delivery, known as the instant bloodmediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) (3). \n\nOld World non-human primates (NHP) provide the best preclinical model for xenotransplantation of adult porcine islets or neonatal islet cell clusters (NICC), because like humans they possess pre-existing antibodies to the dominant carbohydrate xenoantigen galactose-a1,3-galactose (aGal). Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques are the most widely used NHP model in islet xenotransplantation. Shin et al. achieved a median survival of 10 months for wild-type (WT) adult porcine islet xenografts in macaques (4,5). However, a high dose of islets was required, along with a complex immunosuppressive protocol that would be unacceptable in the clinic. A more clinically applicable regimen was less effective at preventing rejection and significantly reduced the duration of insulin-independent normoglycemia (6). Graham et al. used clinically available immunosuppressants to achieve median survival of 147 days for WT adult porcine islet xenografts in macaques (7). However, recipients developed a state of systemic inflammation associated with increased incidence and severity of adverse events.",

Hawthorne, E. Salvaris, Yi Vee Chew, Heather Burns, J. Hawkes, H. Barlow, M. Hu, A. Lew, M. Nottle, P. O\u2019Connell, P. Cowan\n## Abstract\nXenotransplantation using porcine donors is rapidly approaching clinical applicability as an alternative therapy for treatment of many end-stage diseases including type 1 diabetes. Porcine neonatal islet cell clusters (NICC) have normalised blood sugar levels for relatively short periods in the preclinical diabetic rhesus model but have met with limited success in the stringent baboon model. Here we report that NICC from genetically modified (GM) pigs deleted for \u03b1Gal and expressing the human complement regulators CD55 and CD59 can cure diabetes long-term in immunosuppressed baboons, with maximum graft survival exceeding 22 months. Five diabetic baboons were transplanted intraportally with 9,673 \u2013 56,913 islet equivalents (IEQ) per kg recipient weight. Immunosuppression consisted of T cell depletion with an anti-CD2 mAb, tacrolimus for the first 4 months, and maintenance with belatacept and anti-CD154; no anti-inflammatory treatment or cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis/treatment was given. This protocol was well tolerated, with all recipients maintaining or gaining weight. Recipients became insulin-independent at a mean of 87 \u00b1 43 days post-transplant and remained insulin-independent for 397 \u00b1 174 days. Maximum graft survival was 675 days. Liver biopsies showed functional islets staining for all islet endocrine components, with no evidence of the inflammatory blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) and minimal leukocytic infiltration. The costimulation blockade-based immunosuppressive protocol prevented an anti-pig antibody response in all recipients. In conclusion, we demonstrate that genetic modification of the donor pig enables attenuation of early islet xenograft injury, and in conjunction with judicious immunosuppression provides excellent long-term function and graft survival in the diabetic baboon model.\n## INTRODUCTION\nAn estimated 22 million people currently suffer from type 1 diabetes mellitus (1). This incredible burden is treated with various forms of exogenous insulin therapy but whole pancreas or islet cell transplantation remains the gold standard for treatment. Pancreas or islet transplantation restores glucose homeostasis without constant external monitoring and prevents the occurrence of severe hypoglycaemic episodes, dramatically improving the patient's quality of life and attenuating the secondary complications of diabetes (2). However, there are too few organ donors to provide enough pancreata for even a fraction of the patients who would benefit from transplantation. This shortage has stimulated extensive research into the use of pigs as alternative islet donors. One advantage of using pigs is that they can be genetically modified to protect islet xenografts from immunological challenges including the intense innate response triggered by intraportal delivery, known as the instant bloodmediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) (3). \n\nOld World non-human primates (NHP) provide the best preclinical model for xenotransplantation of adult porcine islets or neonatal islet cell clusters (NICC), because like humans they possess pre-existing antibodies to the dominant carbohydrate xenoantigen galactose-a1,3-galactose (aGal). Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques are the most widely used NHP model in islet xenotransplantation. Shin et al. achieved a median survival of 10 months for wild-type (WT) adult porcine islet xenografts in macaques (4,5). However, a high dose of islets was required, along with a complex immunosuppressive protocol that would be unacceptable in the clinic. A more clinically applicable regimen was less effective at preventing rejection and significantly reduced the duration of insulin-independent normoglycemia (6). Graham et al. used clinically available immunosuppressants to achieve median survival of 147 days for WT adult porcine islet xenografts in macaques (7). However, recipients developed a state of systemic inflammation associated with increased incidence and severity of adverse events.",

This study focuses on the isolation of islets from rabbit pancreases, followed by a comprehensive assessment of their viability and functionality. We developed a novel method for isolating islet cells from the pancreas of adult rabbits. We successfully isolated viable islets, which were subsequently evaluated through a combination of viability assays, an insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The viability assays indicated a high percentage of intact islets post-isolation, while the insulin ELISA demonstrated robust insulin secretion in response to glucose stimulation. FLIM provided insights into the metabolic state of the islets, revealing distinct fluorescence lifetime signatures correlating with functional viability. Our findings underscore the potential of rabbit islets as a model for studying islet biology and diabetes therapy, highlighting the efficacy of combining traditional assays with advanced imaging techniques for comprehensive functional assessments. This research contributes to the optimization of islet isolation protocols and enhances our understanding of islet functional activity dynamics in preclinical settings.",

Current protocols focus primarily on the use of rodent and porcine pancreases. We present a protocol for quickly and efficiently obtaining large numbers of islets using rabbits. Using this protocol, it is possible to obtain a higher yield of isolated islets compared to the current state-of-the-art results. In addition, isolated rabbit islets retain a high viability and metabolic activity compared to the islets from other animals. Our research underscores the promise of rabbit islets as a valuable model for investigating islet biology and diabetes treatment. The data we provide will contribute to the advancement of diabetes research by enhancing our understanding of disease development mechanisms, improving the quality of isolated islets, and potentially offering a new source of cells for xenotransplantation. \n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, E.V. and A.K.

As of 2022, an impressive 94 institutions and 5 networks have been identified as performing islet allotransplantation [4,5]. However, there are several challenges that hinder the widespread use of islet transplantation, such as a shortage of donor organs, ischemic conditions at the transplantation site, and immune reactions to foreign islets [6,7]. \n\nTo address these problems, two main directions of research are being developed: increasing the number of islets [8][9][10] or finding new sources of insulin-producing cells [11][12][13][14], including the promising application of islet xenotransplantation [11,[15][16][17][18][19], and improving transplantation efficiency through alternative sites [12], enhanced oxygen delivery to transplanted islets [20], the use of drugs to increase beta cell activity [21], or the use of decellularized matrices to support islets [12,22]. In parallel, studies on new immunological approaches [23] and the development of innovative encapsulation methods for immunoisolation [24] are being carried out. \n\nAnimal islets serve as models for research and alternative insulin sources, with the donors primarily being mice, rats, pigs, and primates [25][26][27][28]. While rats and mice are common in studies [29], primates closely model human diabetes [18,30], and pigs are used both in research and clinically, particularly in xenotransplantation techniques developed in Asian countries [11,15,17,31,32]. However, the use of rabbits is rare in modern studies of type 1 diabetes. \n\nRabbits have been used in laboratory research on type 1 diabetes and islet isolation, but to a much more limited extent compared to other animals. Research on islet isolation and transplantation in rabbits remains rare, despite their large size and ease of maintenance [33][34][35].",

Our rabbit islet isolation protocol with wellcontrolled digestion times and carefully performed purification steps yielded an average of 4836 \u00b1 604 healthy islets. Despite the similar structure of insulin and C-peptide, as well as the high yield of islets per pancreas, there are limitations associated with obtaining sufficient rabbit islets for human xenotransplantation.

However, it is worth noting that the easier care of rabbits and less labor-intensive islet isolation may contribute to the increased interest in using rabbits to obtain islets for research purposes. The high concentration of islets in the pancreas indicates that fewer animals would be required for research, making it a more efficient model for studying pancreatic function and related diseases. For experiments such as those with induced diabetes, various metabolic parameters, etc., a large number n per experimental group, may be required, which, together with the low cost of maintaining rodents, may be a limiting factor for the use of rabbits in these experiments. However, in vitro studies of the islets themselves, as well as xenotransplantation models from rabbits to rodents, will provide a significant reduction in the number of animals used in an experiment. \n\nRabbit islets have a peri-islet membrane, which ensures their integrity and viability after isolation. The viability of isolated islets tends to be 100% by day 3 of observation. The current islet isolation protocols in rats and mice demonstrate a 90-95% failure of isolated islets [29,66].",

Ermakova, Alexandra Bogomolova, Alena Kashirina, L. Lugovaya, Julia Tselousova, Nasipbek Naraliev, Denis Kuchin, E. Zagaynova, Vladimir Zagainov, A. Kashina\n## Abstract\nIslet transplantation represents a promising therapeutic approach for diabetes management, yet the isolation and evaluation of pancreatic islets remain challenging. This study focuses on the isolation of islets from rabbit pancreases, followed by a comprehensive assessment of their viability and functionality. We developed a novel method for isolating islet cells from the pancreas of adult rabbits. We successfully isolated viable islets, which were subsequently evaluated through a combination of viability assays, an insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The viability assays indicated a high percentage of intact islets post-isolation, while the insulin ELISA demonstrated robust insulin secretion in response to glucose stimulation. FLIM provided insights into the metabolic state of the islets, revealing distinct fluorescence lifetime signatures correlating with functional viability. Our findings underscore the potential of rabbit islets as a model for studying islet biology and diabetes therapy, highlighting the efficacy of combining traditional assays with advanced imaging techniques for comprehensive functional assessments. This research contributes to the optimization of islet isolation protocols and enhances our understanding of islet functional activity dynamics in preclinical settings.\n## Introduction\nIslet transplantation shows great promise for treating type 1 diabetes, with advancements such as the Edmonton protocol and FDA approval of donislecel indicating its growing acceptance [1][2][3]. As of 2022, an impressive 94 institutions and 5 networks have been identified as performing islet allotransplantation [4,5]. However, there are several challenges that hinder the widespread use of islet transplantation, such as a shortage of donor organs, ischemic conditions at the transplantation site, and immune reactions to foreign islets [6,7]. \n\nTo address these problems, two main directions of research are being developed: increasing the number of islets [8][9][10] or finding new sources of insulin-producing cells [11][12][13][14], including the promising application of islet xenotransplantation [11,[15][16][17][18][19], and improving transplantation efficiency through alternative sites [12], enhanced oxygen delivery to transplanted islets [20], the use of drugs to increase beta cell activity [21], or the use of decellularized matrices to support islets [12,22]. In parallel, studies on new immunological approaches [23] and the development of innovative encapsulation methods for immunoisolation [24] are being carried out. \n\nAnimal islets serve as models for research and alternative insulin sources, with the donors primarily being mice, rats, pigs, and primates [25][26][27][28]. While rats and mice are common in studies [29], primates closely model human diabetes [18,30], and pigs are used both in research and clinically, particularly in xenotransplantation techniques developed in Asian countries [11,15,17,31,32]. However, the use of rabbits is rare in modern studies of type 1 diabetes. \n\nRabbits have been used in laboratory research on type 1 diabetes and islet isolation, but to a much more limited extent compared to other animals. Research on islet isolation and transplantation in rabbits remains rare, despite their large size and ease of maintenance [33][34][35].\n\n## Discussion\nOur results demonstrated a high yield of islets from a single pancreas. Compared to existing protocols (about 600 islets of Langerhans per rat [29] and 1786 \u00b1 350 islets per gram of pig pancreas [15]), and considering that the weight of a rabbit pancreas is approximately 1 g, our isolation results are quite attractive. Our rabbit islet isolation protocol with wellcontrolled digestion times and carefully performed purification steps yielded an average of 4836 \u00b1 604 healthy islets. Despite the similar structure of insulin and C-peptide, as well as the high yield of islets per pancreas, there are limitations associated with obtaining sufficient rabbit islets for human xenotransplantation. On average, obtaining sufficient islets for human therapy would require a significant number of rabbits, based on data from pig islet xenotransplantation [65]. In his study, Prochorov used nine rabbits for one human transplant [42]. However, it is worth noting that the easier care of rabbits and less labor-intensive islet isolation may contribute to the increased interest in using rabbits to obtain islets for research purposes. The high concentration of islets in the pancreas indicates that fewer animals would be required for research, making it a more efficient model for studying pancreatic function and related diseases. For experiments such as those with induced diabetes, various metabolic parameters, etc., a large number n per experimental group, may be required, which, together with the low cost of maintaining rodents, may be a limiting factor for the use of rabbits in these experiments. However, in vitro studies of the islets themselves, as well as xenotransplantation models from rabbits to rodents, will provide a significant reduction in the number of animals used in an experiment. \n\nRabbit islets have a peri-islet membrane, which ensures their integrity and viability after isolation. The viability of isolated islets tends to be 100% by day 3 of observation. The current islet isolation protocols in rats and mice demonstrate a 90-95% failure of isolated islets [29,66].\n\n## Conclusions\nDespite the existing protocols for islets from the pancreas of small laboratory animals and humans, the problem of obtaining a stable, high number of islets for both research and transplantation has not yet been solved. Current protocols focus primarily on the use of rodent and porcine pancreases. We present a protocol for quickly and efficiently obtaining large numbers of islets using rabbits. Using this protocol, it is possible to obtain a higher yield of isolated islets compared to the current state-of-the-art results. In addition, isolated rabbit islets retain a high viability and metabolic activity compared to the islets from other animals. Our research underscores the promise of rabbit islets as a valuable model for investigating islet biology and diabetes treatment. The data we provide will contribute to the advancement of diabetes research by enhancing our understanding of disease development mechanisms, improving the quality of isolated islets, and potentially offering a new source of cells for xenotransplantation. \n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, E.V. and A.K.

While pancreas transplantation remains the gold standard for patients who have difficulty controlling their symptoms with exogenous insulin, islet allotransplantation is now able to provide similar results with some advantages that make it an attractive potential alternative. The Edmonton Protocol, which incorporated a large dose of islets from multiple donors with steroid-free immunosuppression helped to establish the modern era of islet transplantation almost 20 years ago. While islet allotransplantation is recognized around the world as a powerful clinical therapy for type 1 diabetes it is not yet recognized by the Federal Drug Administration of the United States. Large-scale clinical trials administered by the Clinical Islet Transplantation Consortium have recently demonstrated that the well-regulated manufacture of a human islet product transplanted into patients with difficult to control type 1 diabetes and with a history of severe hyperglycemic episodes can safely and efficaciously maintain glycemic balance and eliminate the most severe complications associated with diabetes. The results of these clinical trials have established a strong basis for licensure of clinical islet allotransplantation in the US. Recognition by the Federal Drug Administration would likely lead to third party reimbursement for islet allotransplantation as a therapeutic option in the United States and would make the treatment available to many more patients. The high costs of rampant diabetes justify the expense of the treatment, which is in-line with the costs of clinical pancreas transplantation. While much enthusiasm and hope is raised toward the development and optimization of stem cell therapy, the islet transplantation community should push toward licensure, if that means broader access of this procedure to patients who may benefit from it. Even as we prepare to take the first steps in that direction, we must acknowledge the new challenges that a shift from the experimental to clinical will bring. Clinical islet allotransplantation in the United States would be a game-changing event in the treatment of type 1 diabetes and also generate enthusiasm for continued research.",

Greek myths of creatures that were part human and part animal such as the centaur or minotaur show man's early fascination with the mingling of human and animal characteristics. CG Groth reported the first xenotransplantation of porcine fetal islet-like cell clusters in patients with T1D in 1994. While this study demonstrated the feasibility of porcine islet transplantation it did not show improvement in patients (68). In the subsequent decades, porcine islet xenotransplantation has been more fully explored in pre-clinical trials using nonhuman primates (69,70). Humoral rejection represents a major obstacle for successful xenotransplantation. Epitopes of \u03b11,3Gal are found on the surface of almost all animals, with the significant exception of humans and some primates, and represents the primary antigen causing hyperacute rejection in pig to human xenotransplantation and pig to nonhuman primate islet xenotransplantation. A collaborative effort between the University of Pittsburgh and Revivicor, Inc. led to the generation of Gal1,3-galactosyltransferase geneknockout (GTKO) pigs which do not express Gal (71). This proved to be a major milestone in the advancement of xenotransplantation. While additional xenoantigens have since been discovered, Gal remains the most relevant, and GTKO pigs are recognized as the likely background of choice for eventual clinical translation. The knock-out of Gal, however, did not prevent islet rejection and other gene manipulations were also explored. In 2009, the islet group in Pittsburgh was the first to demonstrate long-term islet graft function (for up to 1 year) in streptozotocin induced diabetic nonhuman primates transplanted with pig islets genetically modified to express a human complement-regulatory protein (hCD46).",

Despite evidence that anti-CD154mAb can be effective and safe in pig to nonhuman primate models of islet transplantation (77), it has been associated with thromboembolic complications in humans and is not clinically translatable. Although very promising data are emerging on the use of anti-CD40 antibodies (costimulation blockers) in organ xenotransplantation (78,79), the islet xenotransplantation community is still searching for a clinically translatable immunosuppression that can successfully prevent rejection without excessive side effects. New technology for targeted genome editing, notably clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9), offers hope that more genetic manipulations of pig islets may improve compatibility between host and donor to the point that rejection may be successfully controlled with the use of a previously untenable immunosuppression. The field of islet xenotransplantation is steadily advancing and may be approaching a critical mass of experience and technique to begin clinical trials soon (80). Islet encapsulation is another advanced method of islet transplantation in which isolated islets of either human or pig origin can be transplanted without the need for toxic immunosuppression. This would prove to be especially beneficial for pig islet xenotransplantation. The encapsulation of islets with a semi-permeable barrier that allows the exchange of nutrients and hormones including insulin while maintaining immune-isolation would overcome one of the chief obstacles of xenotransplantation.",

Trucco\n## Abstract\nMilestones in the history of diabetes therapy include the discovery of insulin and successful methods of beta cell replacement including whole pancreas and islet cell transplantation options. While pancreas transplantation remains the gold standard for patients who have difficulty controlling their symptoms with exogenous insulin, islet allotransplantation is now able to provide similar results with some advantages that make it an attractive potential alternative. The Edmonton Protocol, which incorporated a large dose of islets from multiple donors with steroid-free immunosuppression helped to establish the modern era of islet transplantation almost 20 years ago. While islet allotransplantation is recognized around the world as a powerful clinical therapy for type 1 diabetes it is not yet recognized by the Federal Drug Administration of the United States. Large-scale clinical trials administered by the Clinical Islet Transplantation Consortium have recently demonstrated that the well-regulated manufacture of a human islet product transplanted into patients with difficult to control type 1 diabetes and with a history of severe hyperglycemic episodes can safely and efficaciously maintain glycemic balance and eliminate the most severe complications associated with diabetes. The results of these clinical trials have established a strong basis for licensure of clinical islet allotransplantation in the US. Recognition by the Federal Drug Administration would likely lead to third party reimbursement for islet allotransplantation as a therapeutic option in the United States and would make the treatment available to many more patients. The high costs of rampant diabetes justify the expense of the treatment, which is in-line with the costs of clinical pancreas transplantation. While much enthusiasm and hope is raised toward the development and optimization of stem cell therapy, the islet transplantation community should push toward licensure, if that means broader access of this procedure to patients who may benefit from it. Even as we prepare to take the first steps in that direction, we must acknowledge the new challenges that a shift from the experimental to clinical will bring. Clinical islet allotransplantation in the United States would be a game-changing event in the treatment of type 1 diabetes and also generate enthusiasm for continued research.\n## EXTENDING THE REACH OF ISLET TRANSPLANTATION\nTable 1 reports a list of sites used in clinical islet transplantation. \n\nFurther on the frontiers of medicine are alternative methods to produce islets without relying on human organ donors, including techniques for the xenotransplantation of porcine islets. Greek myths of creatures that were part human and part animal such as the centaur or minotaur show man's early fascination with the mingling of human and animal characteristics. CG Groth reported the first xenotransplantation of porcine fetal islet-like cell clusters in patients with T1D in 1994. While this study demonstrated the feasibility of porcine islet transplantation it did not show improvement in patients (68). In the subsequent decades, porcine islet xenotransplantation has been more fully explored in pre-clinical trials using nonhuman primates (69,70). Humoral rejection represents a major obstacle for successful xenotransplantation. Epitopes of \u03b11,3Gal are found on the surface of almost all animals, with the significant exception of humans and some primates, and represents the primary antigen causing hyperacute rejection in pig to human xenotransplantation and pig to nonhuman primate islet xenotransplantation. A collaborative effort between the University of Pittsburgh and Revivicor, Inc. led to the generation of Gal1,3-galactosyltransferase geneknockout (GTKO) pigs which do not express Gal (71). This proved to be a major milestone in the advancement of xenotransplantation. While additional xenoantigens have since been discovered, Gal remains the most relevant, and GTKO pigs are recognized as the likely background of choice for eventual clinical translation. The knock-out of Gal, however, did not prevent islet rejection and other gene manipulations were also explored. In 2009, the islet group in Pittsburgh was the first to demonstrate long-term islet graft function (for up to 1 year) in streptozotocin induced diabetic nonhuman primates transplanted with pig islets genetically modified to express a human complement-regulatory protein (hCD46).\n...\nAn ongoing study with major implications for islet xenotransplantation is being carried out by CG Park and colleagues at the Seoul National University in Korea, where they have successfully maintained normoglycemia in diabetic primates after pig islet transplantation for >600 days (76). \n\nOne common thread between these successful long-term pig to nonhuman primate islet studies is their use of an anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb) based immunosuppression to prevent rejection. Despite evidence that anti-CD154mAb can be effective and safe in pig to nonhuman primate models of islet transplantation (77), it has been associated with thromboembolic complications in humans and is not clinically translatable. Although very promising data are emerging on the use of anti-CD40 antibodies (costimulation blockers) in organ xenotransplantation (78,79), the islet xenotransplantation community is still searching for a clinically translatable immunosuppression that can successfully prevent rejection without excessive side effects. New technology for targeted genome editing, notably clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9), offers hope that more genetic manipulations of pig islets may improve compatibility between host and donor to the point that rejection may be successfully controlled with the use of a previously untenable immunosuppression. The field of islet xenotransplantation is steadily advancing and may be approaching a critical mass of experience and technique to begin clinical trials soon (80). Islet encapsulation is another advanced method of islet transplantation in which isolated islets of either human or pig origin can be transplanted without the need for toxic immunosuppression. This would prove to be especially beneficial for pig islet xenotransplantation. The encapsulation of islets with a semi-permeable barrier that allows the exchange of nutrients and hormones including insulin while maintaining immune-isolation would overcome one of the chief obstacles of xenotransplantation.",

Here, we review several approaches to replacing \u03b2\u2010cells that were recently discussed at a symposium held in Kyoto, Japan. Transplant of donor human islets can effectively treat diabetes and eliminate the need for insulin injections, supporting research aimed at identifying abundant supplies of cells. Studies showing the feasibility of producing mouse islets in rats support the concept of generating pigs with human pancreas that can serve as donors of human islets, although scientific and ethical challenges remain. Alternatively, in vitro differentiation of both human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells is being actively pursued as an islet cell source, and embryonic stem cell\u2010derived pancreatic progenitor cells are now in clinical trials in North America in patients with diabetes. Macro\u2010encapsulation devices are being used to contain and protect the cells from immune attack, and alternate strategies of immune\u2010isolation are being pursued, such as islets contained within long microfibers. Recent advancements in genetic engineering tools offer exciting opportunities to broaden therapeutic strategies and to probe the genetic involvement in \u03b2\u2010cell failure that contributes to diabetes. Personalized medicine might eventually become a possibility with genetically edited patient\u2010induced pluripotent stem cells, and the development of simplified robust differentiation protocols that ideally become standardized and automated.

Embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells combined with genome editing technologies are valuable tools to probe disease mechanisms, engineer in desired attributes such as safety switches and upon differentiation to use as potential replacement cell sources. Other potential cell sources are pigs, possibly with human pancreas. Such 'humanized' animals might also prove valuable for disease modeling, as will other genetically modified species. To accompany cell sources some form of immunoprotection will be required, such as retrievable planar, bead or fiber encapsulation devices. \n\nAs an alternative to using modified porcine organs, it is conceivable to combine gene knockouts in key developmental genes and interspecies chimeras to produce pigs with complementing human organs that can be harvested for transplant. As proof of concept for chimera complementation, Nakauchi et al. first created mice with rat pancreas 11 , and subsequently rats with mice pancreas 12 . These remarkable feats were achieved by injecting rat pluripotent stem cells into early-stage mouse embryos that lacked the Pdx1 gene, or mouse pluripotent stem cells into early-stage rat embryos that lacked the Pdx1 gene, respectively. Furthermore, islets isolated from rats with mouse pancreas were able to successfully reverse diabetes in recipient mice for >1 year, in the absence of chronic immunosuppression. These data provide compelling evidence for the therapeutic potential of stem cell-derived islets generated by blastocyst complementation in a xenogeneic host. As a next step towards the generation of pigs with human pancreas, knockout pig embryos were created with an apancreatic phenotype. Complementation of these embryos with allogenic blastomeres then created functioning pancreata in the vacant niches 13 . Ethical issues and regulations in Japan currently preclude testing the feasibility of reconstituting pancreas from human pluripotent stem cells in these animals.",

Osafune, D. Yabe, N. Inagaki\n## Abstract\nDiabetes is characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose as a result of insufficient production of insulin from loss or dysfunction of pancreatic islet \u03b2\u2010cells. Here, we review several approaches to replacing \u03b2\u2010cells that were recently discussed at a symposium held in Kyoto, Japan. Transplant of donor human islets can effectively treat diabetes and eliminate the need for insulin injections, supporting research aimed at identifying abundant supplies of cells. Studies showing the feasibility of producing mouse islets in rats support the concept of generating pigs with human pancreas that can serve as donors of human islets, although scientific and ethical challenges remain. Alternatively, in vitro differentiation of both human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells is being actively pursued as an islet cell source, and embryonic stem cell\u2010derived pancreatic progenitor cells are now in clinical trials in North America in patients with diabetes. Macro\u2010encapsulation devices are being used to contain and protect the cells from immune attack, and alternate strategies of immune\u2010isolation are being pursued, such as islets contained within long microfibers. Recent advancements in genetic engineering tools offer exciting opportunities to broaden therapeutic strategies and to probe the genetic involvement in \u03b2\u2010cell failure that contributes to diabetes. Personalized medicine might eventually become a possibility with genetically edited patient\u2010induced pluripotent stem cells, and the development of simplified robust differentiation protocols that ideally become standardized and automated. Additional efforts to develop a safe and effective \u03b2\u2010cell replacement strategy to treat diabetes are warranted.\n## Maturation\nFigure 1 | Strategies being explored for the development of novel therapies for diabetes. Embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells combined with genome editing technologies are valuable tools to probe disease mechanisms, engineer in desired attributes such as safety switches and upon differentiation to use as potential replacement cell sources. Other potential cell sources are pigs, possibly with human pancreas. Such 'humanized' animals might also prove valuable for disease modeling, as will other genetically modified species. To accompany cell sources some form of immunoprotection will be required, such as retrievable planar, bead or fiber encapsulation devices. \n\nAs an alternative to using modified porcine organs, it is conceivable to combine gene knockouts in key developmental genes and interspecies chimeras to produce pigs with complementing human organs that can be harvested for transplant. As proof of concept for chimera complementation, Nakauchi et al. first created mice with rat pancreas 11 , and subsequently rats with mice pancreas 12 . These remarkable feats were achieved by injecting rat pluripotent stem cells into early-stage mouse embryos that lacked the Pdx1 gene, or mouse pluripotent stem cells into early-stage rat embryos that lacked the Pdx1 gene, respectively. Furthermore, islets isolated from rats with mouse pancreas were able to successfully reverse diabetes in recipient mice for >1 year, in the absence of chronic immunosuppression. These data provide compelling evidence for the therapeutic potential of stem cell-derived islets generated by blastocyst complementation in a xenogeneic host. As a next step towards the generation of pigs with human pancreas, knockout pig embryos were created with an apancreatic phenotype. Complementation of these embryos with allogenic blastomeres then created functioning pancreata in the vacant niches 13 . Ethical issues and regulations in Japan currently preclude testing the feasibility of reconstituting pancreas from human pluripotent stem cells in these animals.",

Animal models of diabetes mellitus (DM) contribute a lot to the experimental studies of islet transplantation and to evaluations of isolated islet grafts for future clinical applications. Diabetic nonhuman primates (NHPs) represent the suitable models of DMs to better evaluate the effectiveness of islet transplantation, to assess new strategies for controlling blood glucose (BG), relieving immune rejection, or prolonging islet survival, and eventually to translate the preclinical data into tangible clinical practice. This review introduces some NHP models of DM, clarifies why and how the models should be used, and elucidates the usefulness and limitations of the models in islet transplantation.",

                    "text": "On account of similar autoimmune responses that cause islet damage/loss between spontaneous type 1 diabetic animals and human T1DM, these diabetic animals are regarded as useful and reliable models for clearly elucidating the pathogenesis of T1DM, for comprehensively analyzing the induction of immune suppression/tolerance in islet transplantation, and for effectively translating the experimental findings into clinical islet transplantation in diabetic patients. Nevertheless, there is very low incidence of spontaneous T1DM in NHPs (also lower than the incidence of spontaneous type 2 diabetes), and the time course of diabetes progression is extensive too [30]. Nowadays, the most commonly used spontaneous type 1 diabetic animals are biobreeding (BB) rat and nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice [98,99]. The autoimmunity of NOD mice is characterized by several abnormalities in the immune system including the presence of pancreasspecific autoantibodies, autoreactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and defects in T regulatory cells [100,101], which also appear in T1DM patients and rarely exist in surgical/STZ-induced NHP models of IDDM. In order to successfully perform clinical islet transplantation, it is essential to control the allo-, xeno-, and autoimmunity. The NOD mice represent the suitable models for dissecting tolerance mechanisms and assessing influences of different types of immunity in islet transplantation [102][103][104][105]. And obtained experimental results are the important improvements and supplements to the preclinical findings in diabetic NHPs. Finally, the combined data will roundly evaluate the immunosuppressive strategies and further promote immune tolerance in the future clinical islet transplantation. Additionally, in order to clarify and improve the translational value of preclinical trials of islet transplantation, other intrinsic limitations in the NPH models of DM should also be considered, especially in pig-to-NHPs islet xenotransplantation [106].

Animal models of diabetes mellitus (DM) contribute a lot to the experimental studies of islet transplantation and to evaluations of isolated islet grafts for future clinical applications. Diabetic nonhuman primates (NHPs) represent the suitable models of DMs to better evaluate the effectiveness of islet transplantation, to assess new strategies for controlling blood glucose (BG), relieving immune rejection, or prolonging islet survival, and eventually to translate the preclinical data into tangible clinical practice. This review introduces some NHP models of DM, clarifies why and how the models should be used, and elucidates the usefulness and limitations of the models in islet transplantation.\n## Limitations of NHP Models of DM in Islet Research\nOn account of similar autoimmune responses that cause islet damage/loss between spontaneous type 1 diabetic animals and human T1DM, these diabetic animals are regarded as useful and reliable models for clearly elucidating the pathogenesis of T1DM, for comprehensively analyzing the induction of immune suppression/tolerance in islet transplantation, and for effectively translating the experimental findings into clinical islet transplantation in diabetic patients. Nevertheless, there is very low incidence of spontaneous T1DM in NHPs (also lower than the incidence of spontaneous type 2 diabetes), and the time course of diabetes progression is extensive too [30]. Nowadays, the most commonly used spontaneous type 1 diabetic animals are biobreeding (BB) rat and nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice [98,99]. The autoimmunity of NOD mice is characterized by several abnormalities in the immune system including the presence of pancreasspecific autoantibodies, autoreactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and defects in T regulatory cells [100,101], which also appear in T1DM patients and rarely exist in surgical/STZ-induced NHP models of IDDM. In order to successfully perform clinical islet transplantation, it is essential to control the allo-, xeno-, and autoimmunity. The NOD mice represent the suitable models for dissecting tolerance mechanisms and assessing influences of different types of immunity in islet transplantation [102][103][104][105]. And obtained experimental results are the important improvements and supplements to the preclinical findings in diabetic NHPs. Finally, the combined data will roundly evaluate the immunosuppressive strategies and further promote immune tolerance in the future clinical islet transplantation. Additionally, in order to clarify and improve the translational value of preclinical trials of islet transplantation, other intrinsic limitations in the NPH models of DM should also be considered, especially in pig-to-NHPs islet xenotransplantation [106]. (1) Monkeys maintain a lower set point for normoglycemia but higher insulin and C-P secretion than pigs and humans.\n...\n(1) Monkeys maintain a lower set point for normoglycemia but higher insulin and C-P secretion than pigs and humans. Given the differences in glucose metabolism, it is harder to achieve stable glucose homeostasis in pig-to-NHP islet xenotransplantation [107][108][109]. (2) The therapeutic window of some of the commonly used immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and rapamycin) is much smaller in NHPs than in humans [109], possibly resulting in more serious side effects and rendering the NHP models less predictive for the clinical condition. (3) Severe and progressive body weight loss occurs frequently because of gastrointestinal disturbance and diarrhea, particularly if TP is carried out to induce a stable IDDM. The nutritional deficiencies can result in susceptibility to infectious complications, as well as misconception of BG and C-P levels regarding islet graft function [109]. Addressing the problems of diabetic NHP model will eventually lead to optimal experimental designs and proper use of diabetic animals from experimental islet transplantation to translational studies.",

In these studies, chitosan gel and ethylene-vinyl alcohol devices that encapsulated rat pancreatic islets were transplanted intraperitoneally or subcutaneously into mice. 50,51 he devices were observed only up to 1 month after transplantation, and it is unclear whether long-term function can be maintained. In addition, they involved concordant xenotransplantation in which rat pancreatic islets were transplanted into mice, and the immune response received by the devices differs from that of our transplantation of porcine pancreatic islets into mice, that is, discordant xenotransplantation. Treatment of T1D using xenogeneic islets requires the development of macrodevices that can avoid and resist the immune response of discordant xenotransplantation and maintain device function for a long period of time. \n\nAlthough many studies of alginate gels combining derivatives and ion gelation have been reported, [52][53][54][55][56][57] there are no studies in which the transplanted alginate gel device has functioned in vivo for a long period of time. However, studies have reported that ion-crosslinking azido alginate gels have high physical/chemical stability, [52][53][54] show a low host immune response, and have few foreign reactions and minimal inflammation. 55 In addition, the ion-crosslinking azido alginate gel has good cellular compatibility between human and rat pancreatic islets 52 and exhibits high biological activity in cell adhesion and cell proliferation assays. 56,57 These results support the results of improved long-term transplant outcomes with our device. \n\nIn this study, 10,000 IEQ porcine islets were required to improve blood glucose levels in immunocompetent wild-type diabetes mice (Figure 5D). 9][60] In general, the number of islets required to improve blood glucose levels in mouse diabetes models is species dependent.",

Furusako, Shigeki Matsumoto, Koya Shinohara, Yzumi Yamashita, Sayaka Amano, Chinatsu Oyama, M. Shimoda\n## Abstract\nNone\n## DISCUSSION\nHowever, multiple studies of devices for the treatment of T1D have been conducted. In these studies, chitosan gel and ethylene-vinyl alcohol devices that encapsulated rat pancreatic islets were transplanted intraperitoneally or subcutaneously into mice. 50,51 he devices were observed only up to 1 month after transplantation, and it is unclear whether long-term function can be maintained. In addition, they involved concordant xenotransplantation in which rat pancreatic islets were transplanted into mice, and the immune response received by the devices differs from that of our transplantation of porcine pancreatic islets into mice, that is, discordant xenotransplantation. Treatment of T1D using xenogeneic islets requires the development of macrodevices that can avoid and resist the immune response of discordant xenotransplantation and maintain device function for a long period of time. \n\nAlthough many studies of alginate gels combining derivatives and ion gelation have been reported, [52][53][54][55][56][57] there are no studies in which the transplanted alginate gel device has functioned in vivo for a long period of time. However, studies have reported that ion-crosslinking azido alginate gels have high physical/chemical stability, [52][53][54] show a low host immune response, and have few foreign reactions and minimal inflammation. 55 In addition, the ion-crosslinking azido alginate gel has good cellular compatibility between human and rat pancreatic islets 52 and exhibits high biological activity in cell adhesion and cell proliferation assays. 56,57 These results support the results of improved long-term transplant outcomes with our device. \n\nIn this study, 10,000 IEQ porcine islets were required to improve blood glucose levels in immunocompetent wild-type diabetes mice (Figure 5D). 9][60] In general, the number of islets required to improve blood glucose levels in mouse diabetes models is species dependent.\n\n## Limitations of the study\nThis device permitted long-term glycemic control without the need for immunosuppressants. Devices created using the developed CCAG, which achieved both good stability and permeability, exhibited maintained islet engraftment and glycemic control even after relay-transplantation. The device could prevent rejection without immunosuppressive drugs and can withstand discordant xenotransplantation twice. Our aim is to further improve the device for potential clinical application.

            "abstract": "Islet transplantation (ITx) is an effective means to restore physiologic glycemic regulation in those living with type 1 diabetes; however, there are a handful of barriers that prevent the broad application of this functionally curative procedure. The restricted cell supply, requisite for life-long toxic immunosuppression, and significant immediate and gradual graft attrition limits the procedure to only those living with brittle diabetes. While intraportal ITx is the primary clinical site, portal vein-specific factors including low oxygen tension and the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction are detrimental to initial engraftment and long-term function. These factors among others prevent the procedure from granting recipients long-term insulin independence. Herein, we provide an overview of the status and limitations of ITx, and novel innovations that address the shortcomings presented. Despite the marked progress highlighted in the review from as early as the initial islet tissue transplantation in 1893, ongoing efforts to improve the procedure efficacy and success are also explored. Progress in identifying unlimited cell sources, more favourable transplant sites, and novel drug delivery strategies all work to broaden ITx application and reduce adverse outcomes. Exploring combination of these approaches may uncover synergies that can further advance the field of ITx in providing sustainable functional cures. Finally, the potential of biomaterial strategies to facilitate immune evasion and local immune modulation are featured and may underpin successful application in alternative transplant sites.",

                    "text": "The use of islets that originate from different species has been widely explored in order to circumvent the demand for human donors. Multiple sources of xenogeneic islets have been investigated including tissue derived from bovine (110), fish (111), sheep (112) and porcine (pig) (113). Although each source has associated advantages and disadvantages, at present, pig islets prove to be the most promising source due to their similar physiological and morphological features to human islets. Additionally, pigs are an attractive source because of their (i) high fecundity, (ii) efficiency of genetic modification through well-established techniques, (iii) practicality of housing them under pathogen-free conditions, and (iv) cost-efficient feasibility (114). Furthermore, porcine insulin has been used as an established and effective diabetes therapy for over 2 decades, demonstrating that pig islets may serve as a promising alternative cell source for ITx (115). Multiple preclinical studies support this notion; xenotransplantation of neonatal porcine islets has been demonstrated to be an effective means of achieving long-term reversal of diabetes in diabetic rodents (116) and nonhuman primate (NHP) models (117,118) in adjunct to immunosuppressant treatment. However, translating these experimental successes to a clinical setting remains a major challenge. The first ever human islet xenotransplantation of 10 patients with fetal porcine islets was performed by Growth et al. in 1994 (119). They demonstrated that xenografts can survive for up to serval months, but patients failed to show any improvements in their glycemic control (119). Since then, investigators have made procedural adjustments including genetic modifications, islet encapsulation, and isolation modifications in an attempt to improve the clinical success of xenotransplantation. In 2014, Matsumoto et al. transplanted 14 patients with unstable T1DM with encapsulated neonatal porcine islets without immunosuppression and saw a reduction in unaware hypoglycemic events, but only a minimal reduction in HbA1c and daily insulin dosages at 1-year post-transplant (120).",

Wong, A. Pepper\n## Abstract\nIslet transplantation (ITx) is an effective means to restore physiologic glycemic regulation in those living with type 1 diabetes; however, there are a handful of barriers that prevent the broad application of this functionally curative procedure. The restricted cell supply, requisite for life-long toxic immunosuppression, and significant immediate and gradual graft attrition limits the procedure to only those living with brittle diabetes. While intraportal ITx is the primary clinical site, portal vein-specific factors including low oxygen tension and the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction are detrimental to initial engraftment and long-term function. These factors among others prevent the procedure from granting recipients long-term insulin independence. Herein, we provide an overview of the status and limitations of ITx, and novel innovations that address the shortcomings presented. Despite the marked progress highlighted in the review from as early as the initial islet tissue transplantation in 1893, ongoing efforts to improve the procedure efficacy and success are also explored. Progress in identifying unlimited cell sources, more favourable transplant sites, and novel drug delivery strategies all work to broaden ITx application and reduce adverse outcomes. Exploring combination of these approaches may uncover synergies that can further advance the field of ITx in providing sustainable functional cures. Finally, the potential of biomaterial strategies to facilitate immune evasion and local immune modulation are featured and may underpin successful application in alternative transplant sites.\n## Xenogeneic islets\nThe use of islets that originate from different species has been widely explored in order to circumvent the demand for human donors. Multiple sources of xenogeneic islets have been investigated including tissue derived from bovine (110), fish (111), sheep (112) and porcine (pig) (113). Although each source has associated advantages and disadvantages, at present, pig islets prove to be the most promising source due to their similar physiological and morphological features to human islets. Additionally, pigs are an attractive source because of their (i) high fecundity, (ii) efficiency of genetic modification through well-established techniques, (iii) practicality of housing them under pathogen-free conditions, and (iv) cost-efficient feasibility (114). Furthermore, porcine insulin has been used as an established and effective diabetes therapy for over 2 decades, demonstrating that pig islets may serve as a promising alternative cell source for ITx (115). Multiple preclinical studies support this notion; xenotransplantation of neonatal porcine islets has been demonstrated to be an effective means of achieving long-term reversal of diabetes in diabetic rodents (116) and nonhuman primate (NHP) models (117,118) in adjunct to immunosuppressant treatment. However, translating these experimental successes to a clinical setting remains a major challenge. The first ever human islet xenotransplantation of 10 patients with fetal porcine islets was performed by Growth et al. in 1994 (119). They demonstrated that xenografts can survive for up to serval months, but patients failed to show any improvements in their glycemic control (119). Since then, investigators have made procedural adjustments including genetic modifications, islet encapsulation, and isolation modifications in an attempt to improve the clinical success of xenotransplantation. In 2014, Matsumoto et al. transplanted 14 patients with unstable T1DM with encapsulated neonatal porcine islets without immunosuppression and saw a reduction in unaware hypoglycemic events, but only a minimal reduction in HbA1c and daily insulin dosages at 1-year post-transplant (120).",

In the present study, we generated immunocompromised type 1 diabetic G\u00f6ttingen mini-pig models and demonstrated the engraftment of human-induced pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived pancreatic islet cells (iPICs). We induced hyperglycemia with a concomitant reduction in endogenous C-peptide levels in pigs that underwent thymectomy and splenectomy. After estimating the effective in vivo dose of immunosuppressants (ISs) via in vitro testing, we conducted exploratory implantation of iPICs using various implantation methods under IS treatments in one pig. Five weeks after implantation, histological analysis of the implanted iPICs embedded in fibrin gel revealed numerous islet-like structures with insulin-positive cells. Moreover, the area of the insulin-positive cells in the pre-peritoneally implanted grafts was greater than in the subcutaneously implanted grafts. Immunohistochemical analyses further revealed that these iPIC grafts contained cells positive for glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptides, similar to naturally occurring islets. The engraftment of iPICs was successfully reproduced. These data support the observation that the iPICs engrafted well, particularly in the pre-peritoneal space of the newly generated immunocompromised diabetic mini-pigs, forming islet-like endocrine clusters. Future evaluation of human cells in this immunocompromised pig model could accelerate and development of cell therapy products. Graphical Abstract",

Approximately 3.3% to 13.5% of patients with T1DM experience unstable blood glucose regulation and recurrent hypoglycemic symptoms despite appropriate insulin therapy 1,2 . For these patients, pancreas/islet transplantation is a promising therapeutic option; however, it is hampered by the shortage and non-uniform quality of cells in clinical settings 3 . In this context, stem cell-derived islets have gained attention as an alternative cell source owing to the feasibility of largescale cell manufacturing with uniform quality 4,5 . \n\nT1DM rodent models are often used to assess the engraftment and functioning of human primary and stem cellderived islets. However, humans and rodents exhibit significant differences in terms of anatomy, body size, and blood volume. These variations may lead to translational challenges; thus, the use of animal models closer in size to humans is preferable to obtain translatable results for clinical applications. Among the many experimental animals, dogs, non-human primates (NHPs), and pigs 6,7 are commonly used. In addition, mini-pig skin resembles human skin in multiple aspects such as cell components and the thickness of individual skin layers 8,9 . In fact, pigs have been used to evaluate subcutaneously implanted human-sized surgical devices 10 , as well as insulin pumps, whose catheters are inserted into the subcutaneous space 11 . Therefore, diabetic mini-pigs may also be useful models for evaluating human stem cell-derived islets for diabetes treatment. However, reports on the use of diabetic mini-pigs for xenotransplantation are limited because of the complexity of xenoimmunity control in these models 12 . Itoh et al. 12 recently demonstrated the long-term accommodation of artificial human vascular grafts in mini-pigs by combining thymectomy, splenectomy, and ISs. Their findings indicate that immune-compromised mini-pigs could provide a promising platform for xenogeneic engraftment and serve as a model for evaluating the potential of cell therapy using human stem cell-derived islets, including surgical techniques in skin tissue.",

Mochida, Teruki Hamada, Saori Watanabe-Matsumoto, Shuhei Konagaya, Manami Kaneko, Ryo Ito, Hikaru Ueno, Taro Toyoda\n## Abstract\nIn the development of cell therapy products, immunocompromised animal models closer in size to humans are valuable for enhancing the translatability of in vivo findings to clinical trials. In the present study, we generated immunocompromised type 1 diabetic G\u00f6ttingen mini-pig models and demonstrated the engraftment of human-induced pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived pancreatic islet cells (iPICs). We induced hyperglycemia with a concomitant reduction in endogenous C-peptide levels in pigs that underwent thymectomy and splenectomy. After estimating the effective in vivo dose of immunosuppressants (ISs) via in vitro testing, we conducted exploratory implantation of iPICs using various implantation methods under IS treatments in one pig. Five weeks after implantation, histological analysis of the implanted iPICs embedded in fibrin gel revealed numerous islet-like structures with insulin-positive cells. Moreover, the area of the insulin-positive cells in the pre-peritoneally implanted grafts was greater than in the subcutaneously implanted grafts. Immunohistochemical analyses further revealed that these iPIC grafts contained cells positive for glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptides, similar to naturally occurring islets. The engraftment of iPICs was successfully reproduced. These data support the observation that the iPICs engrafted well, particularly in the pre-peritoneal space of the newly generated immunocompromised diabetic mini-pigs, forming islet-like endocrine clusters. Future evaluation of human cells in this immunocompromised pig model could accelerate and development of cell therapy products. Graphical Abstract\n## Introduction\nType 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from the destruction of insulin-releasing \u03b2-cells in the pancreatic islets. Approximately 3.3% to 13.5% of patients with T1DM experience unstable blood glucose regulation and recurrent hypoglycemic symptoms despite appropriate insulin therapy 1,2 . For these patients, pancreas/islet transplantation is a promising therapeutic option; however, it is hampered by the shortage and non-uniform quality of cells in clinical settings 3 . In this context, stem cell-derived islets have gained attention as an alternative cell source owing to the feasibility of largescale cell manufacturing with uniform quality 4,5 . \n\nT1DM rodent models are often used to assess the engraftment and functioning of human primary and stem cellderived islets. However, humans and rodents exhibit significant differences in terms of anatomy, body size, and blood volume. These variations may lead to translational challenges; thus, the use of animal models closer in size to humans is preferable to obtain translatable results for clinical applications. Among the many experimental animals, dogs, non-human primates (NHPs), and pigs 6,7 are commonly used. In addition, mini-pig skin resembles human skin in multiple aspects such as cell components and the thickness of individual skin layers 8,9 . In fact, pigs have been used to evaluate subcutaneously implanted human-sized surgical devices 10 , as well as insulin pumps, whose catheters are inserted into the subcutaneous space 11 . Therefore, diabetic mini-pigs may also be useful models for evaluating human stem cell-derived islets for diabetes treatment. However, reports on the use of diabetic mini-pigs for xenotransplantation are limited because of the complexity of xenoimmunity control in these models 12 . Itoh et al. 12 recently demonstrated the long-term accommodation of artificial human vascular grafts in mini-pigs by combining thymectomy, splenectomy, and ISs. Their findings indicate that immune-compromised mini-pigs could provide a promising platform for xenogeneic engraftment and serve as a model for evaluating the potential of cell therapy using human stem cell-derived islets, including surgical techniques in skin tissue.",

Many diabetic animal models have contributed to such improvements. In this paper, we focus on 3 types of models with different mechanisms for inducing diabetes mellitus (DM): models induced by drugs including streptozotocin (STZ), pancreatomized models, and spontaneous models due to autoimmunity. STZ-induced diabetes is one of the most commonly used experimental diabetic models and is employed using many specimens including rodents, pigs or monkeys. The management of STZ models is well established for islet studies. Pancreatomized models reveal different aspects compared to STZ-induced models in terms of loss of function in the increase and decrease of blood glucose and therefore are useful for evaluating the condition in total pancreatomized patients. Spontaneous models are useful for preclinical studies including the assessment of immunosuppressants because such models involve the same mechanisms as type 1 DM in the clinical setting. In conclusion, islet researchers should select suitable diabetic animal models according to the aim of the study.",

Pancreatomized diabetic large animals were also used for studies about bioartificial pancreas (i.e., islet encapsulation technology using high molecular compound to prevent from immune attack) in allo-and xenotransplantation [112][113][114][115][116][117][118]. Large pancreatomized animal models for islet transplantation, including pig, dog, and monkey, are considered preclinical models and tend to be selected for evaluating some treatments in the clinical setting. One of the recent uses of pancreatomized models is to assess \u03b2 cell regeneration after pancreatectomy. Pancreatectomy over 70% induces some pancreatic regeneration-related factors like pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) and neurogenin-3 (Ngn3), which contribute to the regeneration of \u03b2 cells in rodent models [119][120][121]. Recently, Jung and colleagues revealed that the regeneration of \u03b2 cells could be detected in the remnant pancreas of BALB/c mice with 70% pancreatectomy, and the effect of regeneration was more prominent in pancreatomized mice with islet autotransplantation [122]. It is interesting that islet masses in remnant pancreas were increased with greater expression of Ngn3 and BrdU (a proliferation marker) and lower expression of TUNEL (an apoptosis marker) in pancreatomized mice with islet autotransplantation compared to pancreatomized mice without transplantation. They concluded that insulin released from transplanted islets has a role in the induction of islet proliferation and antiapoptotic effects on remnant islets. Pancreatomized animal is an old diabetic model, but is still important and useful for preclinical trials on islets transplantation and for understanding the mechanism of DM, including islet regeneration.",

Sakata, G. Yoshimatsu, H. Tsuchiya, S. Egawa, M. Unno\n## Abstract\nDue to current improvements in techniques for islet isolation and transplantation and protocols for immunosuppressants, islet transplantation has become an effective treatment for severe diabetes patients. Many diabetic animal models have contributed to such improvements. In this paper, we focus on 3 types of models with different mechanisms for inducing diabetes mellitus (DM): models induced by drugs including streptozotocin (STZ), pancreatomized models, and spontaneous models due to autoimmunity. STZ-induced diabetes is one of the most commonly used experimental diabetic models and is employed using many specimens including rodents, pigs or monkeys. The management of STZ models is well established for islet studies. Pancreatomized models reveal different aspects compared to STZ-induced models in terms of loss of function in the increase and decrease of blood glucose and therefore are useful for evaluating the condition in total pancreatomized patients. Spontaneous models are useful for preclinical studies including the assessment of immunosuppressants because such models involve the same mechanisms as type 1 DM in the clinical setting. In conclusion, islet researchers should select suitable diabetic animal models according to the aim of the study.\n## Pancreatomized Diabetic Model for Islet Transplantation.\nMany groups examined the usefulness of immunosuppressants including cyclosporine using islet allotransplanted dog [108][109][110] and pig models [111]. Pancreatomized diabetic large animals were also used for studies about bioartificial pancreas (i.e., islet encapsulation technology using high molecular compound to prevent from immune attack) in allo-and xenotransplantation [112][113][114][115][116][117][118]. Large pancreatomized animal models for islet transplantation, including pig, dog, and monkey, are considered preclinical models and tend to be selected for evaluating some treatments in the clinical setting. One of the recent uses of pancreatomized models is to assess \u03b2 cell regeneration after pancreatectomy. Pancreatectomy over 70% induces some pancreatic regeneration-related factors like pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) and neurogenin-3 (Ngn3), which contribute to the regeneration of \u03b2 cells in rodent models [119][120][121]. Recently, Jung and colleagues revealed that the regeneration of \u03b2 cells could be detected in the remnant pancreas of BALB/c mice with 70% pancreatectomy, and the effect of regeneration was more prominent in pancreatomized mice with islet autotransplantation [122]. It is interesting that islet masses in remnant pancreas were increased with greater expression of Ngn3 and BrdU (a proliferation marker) and lower expression of TUNEL (an apoptosis marker) in pancreatomized mice with islet autotransplantation compared to pancreatomized mice without transplantation. They concluded that insulin released from transplanted islets has a role in the induction of islet proliferation and antiapoptotic effects on remnant islets. Pancreatomized animal is an old diabetic model, but is still important and useful for preclinical trials on islets transplantation and for understanding the mechanism of DM, including islet regeneration.",

However, considering the large number of type 1 diabetic patients, the shortage of donors is a serious issue. To address this issue, clinical islet xenotransplantation is conducted. The first clinical islet xenotransplantation was performed by a Swedish team using fetal pancreatic tissue. Thereafter, clinical trials of islet xenotransplantation were conducted in New Zealand, Russia, Mexico, Argentina, and China using neonatal pig islets. In clinical trials, fetal or neonatal pancreata are used because of the established reliable islet isolation methods. These trials demonstrate the method\u2019s safety and efficacy. Currently, the limited number of source animal facilities is a problem in terms of promoting islet xenotransplantation. This limitation is due to the high cost of source animal facilities and the uncertain future of xenotransplantation. In the United States, the first xenogeneic heart transplantation has been performed, which could promote xenotransplantation.

Cells are basic units of life with diverse functions in mature and developing organs, which biological properties could be utilized as a promising therapeutic approach for currently intractable and incurable diseases. Xenogeneic cell therapy utilizing animal cells other than human for medicinal purpose has been studied as a new way of treating diseases. Xenogeneic cell therapy is considered as a potential regenerative approach to fulfill current unmet medical needs because xenogeneic cells could be isolated from different animal organs and expanded ex vivo as well as maintain the characteristics of original organs, providing a versatile and plenty cell source for cell-based therapeutics beside autologous and allogeneic sources. The swine species is considered the most suitable source because of the similarity with humans in size and physiology of many organs in addition to the economic and ethical reasons plus the possibility of genetic modification. This review discusses the old proposed uses of xenogeneic cells such as xenogeneic pancreatic islet cells, hepatocytes and neuronal cells as a living drug for the treatment of degenerative and organ failure diseases. Novel applications of xenogeneic mesenchymal stroma cells and urothelial cells are also discussed. There are formidable immunological barriers toward successful cellular xenotransplantation in clinic despite major progress in the development of novel immunosuppression regimens and genetically multimodified donor pigs. However, immunological barriers could be turn into immune boosters by using xenogeneic cells of specific tissue types as a novel immunotherapeutic agent to elicit bystander antitumor immunity due to rejection immune responses. Xenogeneic cells have the potential to become a safe and efficacious option for intractable diseases and hard-to-treat cancers, adding a new class of cellular medicine in our drug armamentarium.",

Paucity of human organ donors has led to the consideration of potential alternative sources of islet cells, with porcine islet cells being attractive candidates for cell therapy. Since porcine insulin has long been used and functions in humans to treat patients before recombinant human insulin became available due to high similarity in porcine insulin protein sequence with only one amino acid residue difference to human insulin, xenogeneic porcine islet cell therapy has long been proposed to treat T1D [26][27][28] . Porcine islet cell xenotransplantation has been investigated as a potential bridge or the ultimate treatment for T1D in decades with substantial progresses in both preclinical and clinical studies. Xenogeneic islet cell therapy could become a clinically applicable treatment with proper clinically applicable immunosuppression regimens or efficient biocompatible matrix encapsulation devices that permit diffusion of oxygen and nutrients and prevent transplanted islet cells from the host immune attacks 26,27 . Preclinical pig-to-nonhuman primate transplantation models have been studied and the first long-term graft survival (>6 month) of pig islet cells in non-human primates (NHPs) has been demonstrated [29][30][31] . Subsequent study further confirmed reproducible curative potential in NHP model that pig islet grafts survived and maintained normoglycemia for >6 months with the longest up to 603 days 32 . The clinical studies with xenogeneic porcine islet cells demonstrated the cell survival and function in the human body with no noted serious adverse events, but these clinical islet cell xenotransplantation trials have not shown to durably prevent severe hypoglycemia while maintaining tight glycemic control in T1D patients 28,33 . \n\nXenogeneic hepatocytes for liver failures.",

Cells are basic units of life with diverse functions in mature and developing organs, which biological properties could be utilized as a promising therapeutic approach for currently intractable and incurable diseases. Xenogeneic cell therapy utilizing animal cells other than human for medicinal purpose has been studied as a new way of treating diseases. Xenogeneic cell therapy is considered as a potential regenerative approach to fulfill current unmet medical needs because xenogeneic cells could be isolated from different animal organs and expanded ex vivo as well as maintain the characteristics of original organs, providing a versatile and plenty cell source for cell-based therapeutics beside autologous and allogeneic sources. The swine species is considered the most suitable source because of the similarity with humans in size and physiology of many organs in addition to the economic and ethical reasons plus the possibility of genetic modification. This review discusses the old proposed uses of xenogeneic cells such as xenogeneic pancreatic islet cells, hepatocytes and neuronal cells as a living drug for the treatment of degenerative and organ failure diseases. Novel applications of xenogeneic mesenchymal stroma cells and urothelial cells are also discussed. There are formidable immunological barriers toward successful cellular xenotransplantation in clinic despite major progress in the development of novel immunosuppression regimens and genetically multimodified donor pigs. However, immunological barriers could be turn into immune boosters by using xenogeneic cells of specific tissue types as a novel immunotherapeutic agent to elicit bystander antitumor immunity due to rejection immune responses. Xenogeneic cells have the potential to become a safe and efficacious option for intractable diseases and hard-to-treat cancers, adding a new class of cellular medicine in our drug armamentarium.\n## Old Proposed Uses of Xenogeneic Cells for Treating Diseases\nAlternative allogeneic stem cell-derived islet cell replacement therapy has been tested in in human clinical trial with inconsistent results 25 . Paucity of human organ donors has led to the consideration of potential alternative sources of islet cells, with porcine islet cells being attractive candidates for cell therapy. Since porcine insulin has long been used and functions in humans to treat patients before recombinant human insulin became available due to high similarity in porcine insulin protein sequence with only one amino acid residue difference to human insulin, xenogeneic porcine islet cell therapy has long been proposed to treat T1D [26][27][28] . Porcine islet cell xenotransplantation has been investigated as a potential bridge or the ultimate treatment for T1D in decades with substantial progresses in both preclinical and clinical studies. Xenogeneic islet cell therapy could become a clinically applicable treatment with proper clinically applicable immunosuppression regimens or efficient biocompatible matrix encapsulation devices that permit diffusion of oxygen and nutrients and prevent transplanted islet cells from the host immune attacks 26,27 . Preclinical pig-to-nonhuman primate transplantation models have been studied and the first long-term graft survival (>6 month) of pig islet cells in non-human primates (NHPs) has been demonstrated [29][30][31] . Subsequent study further confirmed reproducible curative potential in NHP model that pig islet grafts survived and maintained normoglycemia for >6 months with the longest up to 603 days 32 . The clinical studies with xenogeneic porcine islet cells demonstrated the cell survival and function in the human body with no noted serious adverse events, but these clinical islet cell xenotransplantation trials have not shown to durably prevent severe hypoglycemia while maintaining tight glycemic control in T1D patients 28,33 . \n\nXenogeneic hepatocytes for liver failures.",

Oral medication and exogenous insulin can only temporarily maintain blood glucose levels and do not cure the disease. Most patients need life-long injections of exogenous insulin. In recent years, advances in islet transplantation have significantly advanced the treatment of diabetes, allowing patients to discontinue exogenous insulin and avoid complications.Long-term follow-up results from recent reports on islet transplantation suggest that they provide significant therapeutic benefit although patients still require immunotherapy, suggesting the importance of future transplantation strategies. Although organ shortage remains the primary obstacle for the development of islet transplantation, new sources of islet cells, such as stem cells and porcine islet cells, have been proposed, and are gradually being incorporated into clinical research. Further research on new transplantation sites, such as the subcutaneous space and mesenteric fat, may eventually replace the traditional portal vein intra-islet cell infusion. Additionally, the immunological rejection reaction in islet transplantation will be resolved through the combined application of immunosuppressant agents, islet encapsulation technology, and the most promising mesenchymal stem cells/regulatory T cell and islet cell combined transplantation cell therapy. This review summarizes the progress achieved in islet transplantation, and discusses the research progress and potential solutions to the challenges faced.",

Oral medication and exogenous insulin can only temporarily maintain blood glucose levels and do not cure the disease. Most patients need life-long injections of exogenous insulin. In recent years, advances in islet transplantation have significantly advanced the treatment of diabetes, allowing patients to discontinue exogenous insulin and avoid complications.Long-term follow-up results from recent reports on islet transplantation suggest that they provide significant therapeutic benefit although patients still require immunotherapy, suggesting the importance of future transplantation strategies. Although organ shortage remains the primary obstacle for the development of islet transplantation, new sources of islet cells, such as stem cells and porcine islet cells, have been proposed, and are gradually being incorporated into clinical research. Further research on new transplantation sites, such as the subcutaneous space and mesenteric fat, may eventually replace the traditional portal vein intra-islet cell infusion. Additionally, the immunological rejection reaction in islet transplantation will be resolved through the combined application of immunosuppressant agents, islet encapsulation technology, and the most promising mesenchymal stem cells/regulatory T cell and islet cell combined transplantation cell therapy. This review summarizes the progress achieved in islet transplantation, and discusses the research progress and potential solutions to the challenges faced.\n## Islet cells of porcine islet origin\nIn addition to using stem cell-derived islet beta cells to replace donor islet cells, another potential option is xenotransplantation using porcine islets.Compared to human islets, pig reproduction is easier and pig islets are more readily available.More importantly, pig insulin is highly similar to human insulin, differing by only one amino acid.Pig insulin has been used to treat diabetes for decades.Pigs have organs similar in size to humans, enabling production of a sufficient number of islets for xenotransplantation.They are the most promising donor source for xenotransplantation.Although more porcine islet cells are required to achieve adequate insulin secretion compared to human donor islets, porcine islets appear to outperform human islets in studies.Porcine islet cell xenotransplantation has achieved insulin function in non-human primates, suggesting feasibility in clinical settings.Shin et al. reported long-term survival of adult porcine islets transplanted into five rhesus monkeys for over 20 months.These early trials suggest pig islets have great potential to address donor islet shortages for T1D patients.\n\nHowever, there are still some urgent problems to be solved in the use of porcine islet xenotransplantation, the first of which is graft rejection.For example, infusion of porcine islets into the portal vein leads to activation of complement and clotting pathways, resulting in platelet aggregation and thrombosis at the transplant site and hyperacute rejection (64).This is followed by human responses to porcine islet antigens (Galactose a1,3-galactose and N-Glycolylneuraminic acid), as well as zoonotic infections caused by endogenous retroviruses.\n\nIn the meantime, solutions are being tried.One strategy is encapsulating islet cells without immunosuppression to solve the immune rejection problem in porcine islet xenotransplantation.",

Alternatively, other sources of \u00df-cells have been highly sought after, including stem cell-derived \u00df-cells and xenogeneic islet alternatives. Through the recapitulation of pancreatic development, several groups have been able to generate islet-like cells from pluripotent stem cells, and clinical trials have demonstrated C-peptide secretion following transplant of embryonic stem cellderived pancreatic progenitors that mature into islets in vivo, as well as fully differentiated islets [3][4][5]. Despite the success of these trials, the clinical translation of stem cell-derived islets remains limited by the need for cost-efficient cell manufacturing process and, more importantly, concerns over the safety of the cell product due to the teratogenic potential of proliferative off-target cell populations during differentiation [6][7][8][9]. For this reason, xenotransplantation offers a promising alternative as a readily available source of islets for ITx. \n\nThe pig represents the most probable source of islets for xenotransplantation due to its unlimited availability, high breeding potential, large number of offspring, and overall close anatomical and physiological similarity to humans [10]. Moreover, porcine insulin differs by only a single amino acid from that of human insulin, and it was administered to treat diabetes for nearly a century before the introduction of recombinant human insulin, making porcine islets an ideal source for ITx [11]. However, xenozoonoses and xenoantigens were considered major concerns for clinical translation until recently, when two gene-edited pig heart transplants were successfully carried out in living patients [12,13]. In addition, genetically modified pig kidneys have been implanted into two brain-dead human recipients [14].",

Seeberger, G. Korbutt\n## Abstract\nNeonatal porcine islets (NPIs) can mature into a mixed population of endocrine cells that can restore glucose control in mice, pigs, and non\u2010human primates, representing a potential alternative islet source for clinical beta cell replacement therapy. However, it remains unclear how conditions in the recipient influence the maturation and function of these cells. Here, we investigated the impact of host sex on NPIs implanted under the kidney capsule of male and female B6.129S7\u2010Rag1tm1Mom (B6/Rag\u2212/\u2212) mice.\n## Introduction\nIslet transplantation (ITx) has established that cellular therapies can improve glycemic control in a subset of patients with type 1 diabetes, but it is limited by the shortage of adequate donor islets and need for chronic immunosuppression [1,2]. Alternatively, other sources of \u00df-cells have been highly sought after, including stem cell-derived \u00df-cells and xenogeneic islet alternatives. Through the recapitulation of pancreatic development, several groups have been able to generate islet-like cells from pluripotent stem cells, and clinical trials have demonstrated C-peptide secretion following transplant of embryonic stem cellderived pancreatic progenitors that mature into islets in vivo, as well as fully differentiated islets [3][4][5]. Despite the success of these trials, the clinical translation of stem cell-derived islets remains limited by the need for cost-efficient cell manufacturing process and, more importantly, concerns over the safety of the cell product due to the teratogenic potential of proliferative off-target cell populations during differentiation [6][7][8][9]. For this reason, xenotransplantation offers a promising alternative as a readily available source of islets for ITx. \n\nThe pig represents the most probable source of islets for xenotransplantation due to its unlimited availability, high breeding potential, large number of offspring, and overall close anatomical and physiological similarity to humans [10]. Moreover, porcine insulin differs by only a single amino acid from that of human insulin, and it was administered to treat diabetes for nearly a century before the introduction of recombinant human insulin, making porcine islets an ideal source for ITx [11]. However, xenozoonoses and xenoantigens were considered major concerns for clinical translation until recently, when two gene-edited pig heart transplants were successfully carried out in living patients [12,13]. In addition, genetically modified pig kidneys have been implanted into two brain-dead human recipients [14].",

Islet transplantation into the portal vein is the current clinical practice. This method can induce the dysfunction in islet engraftment and survival owing to low oxygen tension, an active innate immune system, and the provocation of an inflammatory response, eventually resulting in the loss of many transplanted islets. Thus, subcutaneous transplantation has been recommended as an alternative choice (van der Windt et al., 2008). \n\nAdult and neonatal pig islets xeno-transplanted in immunosuppressive nonhuman primates survived for more than 6 months (Cardona et al., 2006;Hering et al., 2006). These reports are encouraging since porcine pancreatic xenograft can survive longer than other xenograft organs, suggesting the crucial clue in xenotransplantation. Several investigators alleged that xenotransplantaion of pig pancreatic primoria may be a candidate model as a therapeutics for both types 1 and 2 diabetes (Thomas et al., 1995;Rogers et al., 2006). Rogers et al. (2007) demonstrated that transplantation of embryonic day (E) 28 (E28) pig pancreatic primordia into the mesentery of STZdiabetic rhesus macaques reduced insulin requirement, suggesting the availability for diabetes. Although the report of porcine pancreatic islets xenograft into non-human primates was restricted to type I diabetes (van der Windt et al., 2009;Cooper and Casu, 2009), the usefulness in type II diabetes also remains to be attempted. Komoda et al. (2005) have demonstrated that islets from transgenic pigs expressing N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III showed prolonged survival after transplantation into cynomolgus monkeys.",

Park\n## Abstract\nXenotransplantation is a hot topic currently, since the demand for diverse organs is increasing in patients. Among many species, pigs are suitable animals for xenotranplantation as they share many anatomical and physiological characteristics with humans. This review article provides an overview of porcine xenotransplantation and the rejection of pig xenotransplants in primates, and use of genetically modified and cloned pigs in xenotransplantation. It also highlights major target organs in porcine xenotransplantation and virus infection in xenotransplantation.\n## Pancreatic islet xenotransplantation\nHigh yields of pure and viable porcine islet cells to be used for microencapsulation are crucial for successful xenotransplantation and the reduction of the damage in porcine islet isolation should be considered (Stiegler et al., 2010). Islet transplantation into the portal vein is the current clinical practice. This method can induce the dysfunction in islet engraftment and survival owing to low oxygen tension, an active innate immune system, and the provocation of an inflammatory response, eventually resulting in the loss of many transplanted islets. Thus, subcutaneous transplantation has been recommended as an alternative choice (van der Windt et al., 2008). \n\nAdult and neonatal pig islets xeno-transplanted in immunosuppressive nonhuman primates survived for more than 6 months (Cardona et al., 2006;Hering et al., 2006). These reports are encouraging since porcine pancreatic xenograft can survive longer than other xenograft organs, suggesting the crucial clue in xenotransplantation. Several investigators alleged that xenotransplantaion of pig pancreatic primoria may be a candidate model as a therapeutics for both types 1 and 2 diabetes (Thomas et al., 1995;Rogers et al., 2006). Rogers et al. (2007) demonstrated that transplantation of embryonic day (E) 28 (E28) pig pancreatic primordia into the mesentery of STZdiabetic rhesus macaques reduced insulin requirement, suggesting the availability for diabetes. Although the report of porcine pancreatic islets xenograft into non-human primates was restricted to type I diabetes (van der Windt et al., 2009;Cooper and Casu, 2009), the usefulness in type II diabetes also remains to be attempted. Komoda et al. (2005) have demonstrated that islets from transgenic pigs expressing N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III showed prolonged survival after transplantation into cynomolgus monkeys.",

Several lines of transgenic pigs carrying one and more often, multiple modifications already exist. The vast majority of these modifications aim to mitigate the host immune response by suppressing major xeno-antigens, or expressing immunomodulatory molecules that act locally at the graft site. While these modifications are essential and have proven beneficial in preclinical trials, ensuring good intrinsic islet secretory function is equally important to achieve normoglycemia in recipients. Neonatal and even adult porcine islets are known for their low secretory response to physiological stimulation, a shortcoming that is often overcome by implanting extremely large numbers of such islets to compensate for insulin requirement incompatibilities between donor pigs and rodent, non-human primate or human recipients. Recent studies have revealed the existence of secretory amplifying pathways in porcine beta-cells previously identified in murine and human cells. Building upon these findings, a new line of transgenic pigs where these pathways are activated specifically in beta-cells has been created. Compared to their wild-type counterparts, islets from these transgenic pigs have proven to be better insulin secretors in their native pancreas environment, in vitro after isolation and most importantly in vivo after transplantation to diabetic mice.",

While both models have their pros and cons, they both represent a particularly challenging environment for porcine islets. As discussed earlier, non-human primates have higher insulin requirements than both pigs and humans [4] while rodent insulin differs substantially from its porcine counterpart [29] lessening efficacy of the latter in mice and rats. Therefore, one could expect porcine islets to underperform in both cases. This is particularly exemplified by the extremely large number of islets that are necessary to exert an effect in such experiments. Nonetheless, several studies have reported successful long-term reversal of diabetes following transplantation of free [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37] or encapsulated [38][39][40] porcine islets in preclinical non-human primate models. \n\nAs indicated in Table 1, transplanted islet dose ranged from 10,000 to 100,000 IEQ/kg recipient body weight when using adult pigs as islet donors and 9,000 to 115,000 when using islets from neonatal piglets. Free islets are usually injected in the portal vein, thus mimicking clinical practice in human islet allotransplantation but exposing islets to IBMIR known to cause substantial early islet mass loss and impaired secretory function due to mitochondrial damage in surviving islets [41]. On the other hand, encapsulated islets are transplanted subcutaneously or in the peritoneal space where the main limitation is oxygenation [39] and access to nutrients during the critical period between implantation and graft vascularization. \n\nImmunosuppression whether administered systemically to the recipient and/or created locally by means of genetic modification to the donor cells can help alleviate IBMIR and other immune rejection mechanisms [42] therefore improving transplantation outcome and even decreasing the number of islets required for efficient diabetes reversal [37].",

Mourad, Pierre Gianello\n## Abstract\nClinical pancreatic islet xenotransplantation will most probably rely on genetically modified pigs as donors. Several lines of transgenic pigs carrying one and more often, multiple modifications already exist. The vast majority of these modifications aim to mitigate the host immune response by suppressing major xeno-antigens, or expressing immunomodulatory molecules that act locally at the graft site. While these modifications are essential and have proven beneficial in preclinical trials, ensuring good intrinsic islet secretory function is equally important to achieve normoglycemia in recipients. Neonatal and even adult porcine islets are known for their low secretory response to physiological stimulation, a shortcoming that is often overcome by implanting extremely large numbers of such islets to compensate for insulin requirement incompatibilities between donor pigs and rodent, non-human primate or human recipients. Recent studies have revealed the existence of secretory amplifying pathways in porcine beta-cells previously identified in murine and human cells. Building upon these findings, a new line of transgenic pigs where these pathways are activated specifically in beta-cells has been created. Compared to their wild-type counterparts, islets from these transgenic pigs have proven to be better insulin secretors in their native pancreas environment, in vitro after isolation and most importantly in vivo after transplantation to diabetic mice.\n## PIG ISLET XENOTRANSPLANTATION\nIn the research setup, two main models have been used to evaluate efficacy of porcine islets in treating or alleviating chemically-or surgically-induced type-I diabetes: pig-to-non-human primate and pig-to-rodent. While both models have their pros and cons, they both represent a particularly challenging environment for porcine islets. As discussed earlier, non-human primates have higher insulin requirements than both pigs and humans [4] while rodent insulin differs substantially from its porcine counterpart [29] lessening efficacy of the latter in mice and rats. Therefore, one could expect porcine islets to underperform in both cases. This is particularly exemplified by the extremely large number of islets that are necessary to exert an effect in such experiments. Nonetheless, several studies have reported successful long-term reversal of diabetes following transplantation of free [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37] or encapsulated [38][39][40] porcine islets in preclinical non-human primate models. \n\nAs indicated in Table 1, transplanted islet dose ranged from 10,000 to 100,000 IEQ/kg recipient body weight when using adult pigs as islet donors and 9,000 to 115,000 when using islets from neonatal piglets. Free islets are usually injected in the portal vein, thus mimicking clinical practice in human islet allotransplantation but exposing islets to IBMIR known to cause substantial early islet mass loss and impaired secretory function due to mitochondrial damage in surviving islets [41]. On the other hand, encapsulated islets are transplanted subcutaneously or in the peritoneal space where the main limitation is oxygenation [39] and access to nutrients during the critical period between implantation and graft vascularization. \n\nImmunosuppression whether administered systemically to the recipient and/or created locally by means of genetic modification to the donor cells can help alleviate IBMIR and other immune rejection mechanisms [42] therefore improving transplantation outcome and even decreasing the number of islets required for efficient diabetes reversal [37].",

The Giessen team, led by Reinhard Bretzel, developed methods to enhance the survival and function of porcine islets during cold storage and after transplantation into recipient animals [7]. Key advances by this team also improved the enzymatic digestion of the pancreas and the purification of porcine islets, along with refining the culture conditions that support the long-term functionality of the transplanted islets [8]. \n\nMoreover, the Giessen team shed light on the critical islet mass required to achieve successful metabolic function after transplantation in pig models [9]. These advances were crucial for increasing the number of islets available for experimental and preclinical studies, helping to make xenotransplantation more feasible. \n\nInfluenced by their work in Giessen, Bernhard Hering and Daniel Brandhorst moved from Germany to the USA and the UK, respectively, and further explored porcine islet isolation and transplantation and became prominent figures in the field of islet allo-and xeno-transplantation [10][11][12][13]. \n\nIn Dresden, Germany, the group led by Barbara Ludwig has worked to optimize islet encapsulation technology. Their research uses a variety of animal models, including the isolation of mouse, rat, pig, and human islets. Using a novel immuno-protective membrane, the group demonstrated restoration of normoglycemia, without the need for immunosuppression, in a model of rat islet xenotransplantation into diabetic minipigs [14]. Ludwig's team then showed success in NHP diabetic model, using porcine islet xenografts within a bioartificial pancreas device to create a suitable microenvironment for cell survival [15,16].",

Pig Islet and Cell Xenotransplantation\n# Venue: Transplant International\n# Authors: Rita Bottino, Krish Vasudev, Zuzanna Iwanczyk, Emanuele Cozzi, David K. C. Cooper\n## Abstract\nPig islet xenotransplantation in nonhuman primates (NHPs) has made considerable progress during the past 30 years, and European scientists in both Europe and the USA have contributed to this progress. At times, there have been, or are, active research programs in Sweden, Germany, Belgium, and the USA. The first clinical experiments of wild-type (i.e., genetically-unmodified) pig islet xenotransplantation were carried out by Groth and his colleagues in Stockholm in 1994, but without significant success. Hering\u2019s group in Minneapolis was the first to report prolonged survival of wild-type pig islets in NHPs in 2006, and the first report of insulin-independence for >12 months was by a \u201cEuropean\u201d research team at the University of Pittsburgh in 2009. Recent progress has been slow, in part through a lack of funding, but recent advances in pig organ xenotransplantation suggest that pig islet xenotransplantation is poised for clinical experiments in the near future. In addition, there have been encouraging experimental studies of pig neural cell injections into the brains of monkeys with a pharmacologically-induced Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n## RESEARCH IN GERMANY\nSignificant contributions to the field of porcine islet xenotransplantation were made by members of the Justus-Liebig-Universit\u00e4t in Giessen, particularly in the areas of porcine islet isolation, preservation, and transplantation. The Giessen team, led by Reinhard Bretzel, developed methods to enhance the survival and function of porcine islets during cold storage and after transplantation into recipient animals [7]. Key advances by this team also improved the enzymatic digestion of the pancreas and the purification of porcine islets, along with refining the culture conditions that support the long-term functionality of the transplanted islets [8]. \n\nMoreover, the Giessen team shed light on the critical islet mass required to achieve successful metabolic function after transplantation in pig models [9]. These advances were crucial for increasing the number of islets available for experimental and preclinical studies, helping to make xenotransplantation more feasible. \n\nInfluenced by their work in Giessen, Bernhard Hering and Daniel Brandhorst moved from Germany to the USA and the UK, respectively, and further explored porcine islet isolation and transplantation and became prominent figures in the field of islet allo-and xeno-transplantation [10][11][12][13]. \n\nIn Dresden, Germany, the group led by Barbara Ludwig has worked to optimize islet encapsulation technology. Their research uses a variety of animal models, including the isolation of mouse, rat, pig, and human islets. Using a novel immuno-protective membrane, the group demonstrated restoration of normoglycemia, without the need for immunosuppression, in a model of rat islet xenotransplantation into diabetic minipigs [14]. Ludwig's team then showed success in NHP diabetic model, using porcine islet xenografts within a bioartificial pancreas device to create a suitable microenvironment for cell survival [15,16].",

The purpose of this study is to establish a diabetes mellitus (DM) model in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats using alloxan evaluated by assessing alloxan dosage, the induction rate of diabetes, and glucose stability through insulin treatment. Methods: Over the course of 13 experimental rounds, diabetes was induced in 86 SD rats using alloxan at concentrations of 200 mg/kg (16 rats) or 150 mg/kg (70 rats). Various parameters, including diabetes induction rates, average insulin doses, extent of weight loss, and adverse effects such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), were measured. Results: The administration of 200 mg/kg of alloxan in rats resulted in severe diabetes induction, leading to DKA in three individuals, despite daily insulin glargine administration, DKA prevention was unsuccessful. The stability of alloxan decreases over time, especially when refrigeration is compromised during weighing. In the group treated with 150 mg/kg of alloxan, the diabetes induction rate was 83%. The average insulin dose was 2.21 units/kg/day. In contrast, the group treated with 200 mg/kg of alloxan exhibited a diabetes induction rate of 81% with a statistically significant higher average insulin requirement at 7.58 units/kg/day compared to 150 mg/kg of alloxan. Conclusion: Inducing diabetes in rats with 150 mg/kg of alloxan is considered more suitable for creating a diabetes model for xenogeneic islet transplantation compared to using 200 mg/kg of alloxan. This is due to fewer complications related to DKA or hyperglycemia and reduced need for exogenous insulin treatment.",

            "abstract": "Human allogeneic pancreatic islet transplantation is a life-changing treatment for patients with severe Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) who suffer from hypoglycemia unawareness and high risk of severe hypoglycemia. However, intensive immunosuppression is required to prevent immune rejection of the graft, that may in turn lead to undesirable side effects such as toxicity to the islet cells, kidney toxicity, occurrence of opportunistic infections, and malignancies. The shortage of cadaveric human islet donors further limits islet transplantation as a treatment option for widespread adoption. Alternatively, porcine islets have been considered as another source of insulin-secreting cells for transplantation in T1D patients, though xeno-transplants raise concerns over the risk of endogenous retrovirus transmission and immunological incompatibility. As a result, technological advancements have been made to protect transplanted islets from immune rejection and inflammation, ideally in the absence of chronic immunosuppression, to improve the outcomes and accessibility of allogeneic islet cell replacement therapies. These include the use of microencapsulation or macroencapsulation devices designed to provide an immunoprotective environment using a cell-impermeable layer, preventing immune cell attack of the transplanted cells. Other up and coming advancements are based on the use of stem cells as the starting source material for generating islet cells \u2018on-demand\u2019. These starting stem cell sources include human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that have been genetically engineered to avoid the host immune response, curated HLA-selected donor hiPSCs that can be matched with recipients within a given population, and multipotent stem cells with natural immune privilege properties. These strategies are developed to provide an immune-evasive cell resource for allogeneic cell therapy. This review will summarize the immunological challenges facing islet transplantation and highlight recent bio-engineering and cell-based approaches aimed at avoiding immune rejection, to improve the accessibility of islet cell therapy and enhance treatment outcomes. Better understanding of the different approaches and their limitations can guide future research endeavors towards developing more comprehensive and targeted strategies for creating a more tolerogenic microenvironment, and improve the effectiveness and sustainability of islet transplantation to benefit more patients.",

Teo, N. Ng\n## Abstract\nHuman allogeneic pancreatic islet transplantation is a life-changing treatment for patients with severe Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) who suffer from hypoglycemia unawareness and high risk of severe hypoglycemia. However, intensive immunosuppression is required to prevent immune rejection of the graft, that may in turn lead to undesirable side effects such as toxicity to the islet cells, kidney toxicity, occurrence of opportunistic infections, and malignancies. The shortage of cadaveric human islet donors further limits islet transplantation as a treatment option for widespread adoption. Alternatively, porcine islets have been considered as another source of insulin-secreting cells for transplantation in T1D patients, though xeno-transplants raise concerns over the risk of endogenous retrovirus transmission and immunological incompatibility. As a result, technological advancements have been made to protect transplanted islets from immune rejection and inflammation, ideally in the absence of chronic immunosuppression, to improve the outcomes and accessibility of allogeneic islet cell replacement therapies. These include the use of microencapsulation or macroencapsulation devices designed to provide an immunoprotective environment using a cell-impermeable layer, preventing immune cell attack of the transplanted cells. Other up and coming advancements are based on the use of stem cells as the starting source material for generating islet cells \u2018on-demand\u2019. These starting stem cell sources include human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that have been genetically engineered to avoid the host immune response, curated HLA-selected donor hiPSCs that can be matched with recipients within a given population, and multipotent stem cells with natural immune privilege properties. These strategies are developed to provide an immune-evasive cell resource for allogeneic cell therapy. This review will summarize the immunological challenges facing islet transplantation and highlight recent bio-engineering and cell-based approaches aimed at avoiding immune rejection, to improve the accessibility of islet cell therapy and enhance treatment outcomes. Better understanding of the different approaches and their limitations can guide future research endeavors towards developing more comprehensive and targeted strategies for creating a more tolerogenic microenvironment, and improve the effectiveness and sustainability of islet transplantation to benefit more patients.\n## Xenogeneic islets as an alternative primary cell source for transplantation\nXenogeneic islets, in particular porcine islets, have been explored as an alternative primary cell source to supplement the supply of primary human islets for transplantation.Porcine islets are more readily available and possess functional characteristics that make them a suitable substitute for human islets.They have weaker immunogenicity and porcine insulin is structurally similar to human insulin (with one amino acid difference that is alanine in pigs and threonine in humans) (45).Major hurdles need to be overcome for xenografts to be a feasible alternative in the clinic.These include physiological incompatibility and immunological reaction to non-human donor tissues that trigger both innate and adaptive barriers of the immune system, resulting in rejection.In addition, xenotransplantation presents the potential risk of zoonosis and porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERVs).As such, previous studies have evaluated the feasibility of xenotransplantation of porcine islets into non-human primates (NHPs).One study showed that an anti-CD40 (2C10R4) monoclonal antibody-based immunosuppressive regimen together with tacrolimus was effective in circumventing graft rejection and prolonging porcine islet graft survival in diabetic rhesus monkeys, with median survival (serum porcine C-peptide concentration of >0.15 ng/mL) of 60 days.All monkeys also received anti-thymocyte globulin, cobra venom factor (CVF), adalimumab, and sirolimus (46).In another study, a newly engineered anti-CD40L-specific monoclonal antibody AT-1501 was tested in a cynomolgus macaque model that had undergone intrahepatic islet allotransplantation.The study showed that AT-1501 enabled long-term graft survival with higher C-peptide levels detected compared with conventional immunosuppression (47).AT-1501 was modified to minimize risk of thromboembolic complications that were previously reported for CD40L-based therapies in clinical trials, and therefore appears to be a promising and safe agent for further testing.",

Further research should be followed to prove their benefits in clinical application. \n\nXenogeneic islets are another alternative source for islet transplantation. Pig islets are the most studied xenogeneic islet for transplantation because pigs are relatively easy to breed and raise, produce a large number of islets and their insulin is similar to that of humans. Safety is the most important issue in xenotransplantation. In pigs, porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are important pathogens as they are integrated through the pigs' whole genome. One human study reported that PERV was not detected in human type 1 diabetes  recipients even long after the pig islets were transplanted 21 . In addition, PERV, herpes virus, cytomegalovirus, and other microorganisms are potential sources of zoonosis that should be considered as well. Recently, a genetically engineered porcine heart was transplanted to a 57 year old man. The recipient survived 2 months after surgery and the medical team recently reported that the patient had been infected with porcine cytomegalovirus 22 . Thus, zoonosis is still an important issue in xenotransplantation. For this reason, the current International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) guideline recommends the use of PERV-C negative pigs nurtured at a designated pathogen-free facility 23 . In 2016, Matsumoto et al. 24 demonstrated the efficacy of islet xenotransplantation in humans. In this study, microencapsulated pig islets were transplanted in eight patients with type 1 diabetes without immunosuppressant coverage. The patients who underwent transplantation experienced long-term alleviation of hyperglycemia (HbA1c <7.0% lasting over 600 days) and the restoration of impaired hypoglycemic awareness 24 .",

Yoon\n## Abstract\nIslet transplantation is an important option in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. However, a donor shortage and immunosuppressant\u2010related complications are the current major hurdles of islet transplantation. In this review, we discuss recent updates on islet transplantation to overcome these current obstacles and we share our perspectives on future \u03b2 cell replacement therapy.\n## body\nRecently, Hogrebe et al. 20 introduced a highly efficient iPSC differentiation protocol by targeting the cytoskeleton with latrunculin A (29.1% of NKX6.1 + Cpeptide + ). These results encourage the use of iPSCs-derived blike cells in future diabetes treatment. Further research should be followed to prove their benefits in clinical application. \n\nXenogeneic islets are another alternative source for islet transplantation. Pig islets are the most studied xenogeneic islet for transplantation because pigs are relatively easy to breed and raise, produce a large number of islets and their insulin is similar to that of humans. Safety is the most important issue in xenotransplantation. In pigs, porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are important pathogens as they are integrated through the pigs' whole genome. One human study reported that PERV was not detected in human type 1 diabetes  recipients even long after the pig islets were transplanted 21 . In addition, PERV, herpes virus, cytomegalovirus, and other microorganisms are potential sources of zoonosis that should be considered as well. Recently, a genetically engineered porcine heart was transplanted to a 57 year old man. The recipient survived 2 months after surgery and the medical team recently reported that the patient had been infected with porcine cytomegalovirus 22 . Thus, zoonosis is still an important issue in xenotransplantation. For this reason, the current International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) guideline recommends the use of PERV-C negative pigs nurtured at a designated pathogen-free facility 23 . In 2016, Matsumoto et al. 24 demonstrated the efficacy of islet xenotransplantation in humans. In this study, microencapsulated pig islets were transplanted in eight patients with type 1 diabetes without immunosuppressant coverage. The patients who underwent transplantation experienced long-term alleviation of hyperglycemia (HbA1c <7.0% lasting over 600 days) and the restoration of impaired hypoglycemic awareness 24 .",

Data sources Data used in this review were mainly from English literature of Pubmed database. The search terms were \u201cpig islet\u201d and \u201cxenotransplantation\u201d. Study selection The original articles and critical reviews selected were relevant to this review's theme. Results Pigs are suggested to be an ideal candidate for obtaining available islet cells for transplantation. However, the potential clinical application of pig islet is still facing challenges including inadequate yield of high\u2010quality functional islets and xenorejection of the transplants. The former can be overcome mainly by selection of a suitable pathogen\u2010free source herd and the development of isolation and purification technology. While the feasibility of successful preclinical pig islet xenotranplantation provides insights in the possible mechanisms of xenogeneic immune recognition and rejection to overwhelm the latter. In addition, the achievement of long\u2010term insulin independence in diabetic models by means of distinct islet products and novel immunotherapeutic strategies is promising. Conclusions Pig islet xenotransplantation is one of the prospective treatments to bridge the gap between the needs of transplantation in patients with diabetes and available islet cells. Nonetheless, further studies and efforts are needed to translate obtained findings into tangible applications.",

Islet xenotransplantation, using pigs as a source of islets, is a promising approach to overcome this limitation. The greatest obstacle is the primate immune/inflammatory response to the porcine (pig) islets, which may take the form of rapid early graft rejection (the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction) or T-cell-mediated rejection. These problems are being resolved by the genetic engineering of the source pigs combined with improved immunosuppressive therapy. The results of pig-to-diabetic nonhuman primate islet xenotransplantation are steadily improving, with insulin independence being achieved for periods >1 year. An alternative approach is to isolate islets within a micro- or macroencapsulation device aimed at protecting them from the human recipient's immune response. Clinical trials using this approach are currently underway. This review focuses on the major aspects of pig-to-primate islet xenotransplantation and its potential for treatment of type 1 diabetes.",

            "text": "In the year 2000 the Edmonton protocol proved that clinical pancreatic islet allotransplantation (alloTx) can be successfully performed to treat type 1 diabetes (T1D) using a steroid-free immunosuppressive regimen [1]. Even if islet replacement could be considered a preferable alternative to insulin therapy in long-term diabetic patients, this therapeutic option will be practically limited by the number of islet donors that will never be sufficient. A possible solution to the problem of tissue supply may be found by investigating the potential of embryonic as well as induced pluripotent stem cells to generate functional insulinproducing cells. Clinical applications await successful testing in animal models. Alternatively, xenotransplantation (xenoTx) of pig islets is currently the most advanced and appealing approach with respect to a possible clinical application [2]. Pigs are the best candidates as human substitutes [3] for several reasons: pig insulin differs from human insulin by just one amino acid; pig islets have lower sensitivity to destruction by recurrent T1D autoimmunity than human islets [4], they do not accumulate amyloid [5], and pig donors can be genetically modified to improve immunomodulation and cytoprotection of pig islets. The experimental results of pig islets to non-human diabetic primates xenoTx are more encouraging than those obtained using pig whole organs, which makes their employment predictable in clinical trials in the next few years [6\u2022\u2022]. To make this technique a clinically feasible treatment option we need to generate more convincing preclinical data in the pig-to-primate xenoTx model.",

However, the limited availability of donor organs restricts its widespread use. Porcine pancreatic islets could offer a viable alternative to address this organ shortage. For successful pancreatic islet xenotransplantation using porcine pancreatic islets, efficacy and safety must first be demonstrated in pig-to-nonhuman primate (NHP) preclinical studies, as outlined in the consensus statement of the International Xenotransplantation Association. Our group has achieved long-term survival of wild-type porcine islet grafts in immunosuppressed NHPs by employing two immunosuppressive protocols: one based on CD40-CD40L blockade and another utilizing clinically available immunosuppressants. A clinical trial for pancreatic islet xenotransplantation, following the latter protocol, has received approval from the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS). This review aims to highlight the results of clinical trials involving porcine islet xenotransplantation to date, along with the age-specific and other characteristics of the porcine islets used in these trials and the preclinical NHP studies that support them. It offers insights into the perspectives around the first clinical islet xenotransplantation approved by the Korean MFDS, emphasizing improved long-term graft survival.",

Adequate amounts of available islets can be obtained by selection of a suitable pathogen-free source herd and the development of isolation and purification method. Several studies demonstrated the feasibility of successful preclinical pig-islet xenotransplantation and provided insights and possible mechanisms of xenogeneic immune recognition and rejection.

            "text": "The use of islets that originate from different species has been widely explored in order to circumvent the demand for human donors. Multiple sources of xenogeneic islets have been investigated including tissue derived from bovine (110), fish (111), sheep (112) and porcine (pig) (113). Although each source has associated advantages and disadvantages, at present, pig islets prove to be the most promising source due to their similar physiological and morphological features to human islets. Additionally, pigs are an attractive source because of their (i) high fecundity, (ii) efficiency of genetic modification through well-established techniques, (iii) practicality of housing them under pathogen-free conditions, and (iv) cost-efficient feasibility (114). Furthermore, porcine insulin has been used as an established and effective diabetes therapy for over 2 decades, demonstrating that pig islets may serve as a promising alternative cell source for ITx (115). Multiple preclinical studies support this notion; xenotransplantation of neonatal porcine islets has been demonstrated to be an effective means of achieving long-term reversal of diabetes in diabetic rodents (116) and nonhuman primate (NHP) models (117,118) in adjunct to immunosuppressant treatment. However, translating these experimental successes to a clinical setting remains a major challenge. The first ever human islet xenotransplantation of 10 patients with fetal porcine islets was performed by Growth et al. in 1994 (119). They demonstrated that xenografts can survive for up to serval months, but patients failed to show any improvements in their glycemic control (119). Since then, investigators have made procedural adjustments including genetic modifications, islet encapsulation, and isolation modifications in an attempt to improve the clinical success of xenotransplantation. In 2014, Matsumoto et al. transplanted 14 patients with unstable T1DM with encapsulated neonatal porcine islets without immunosuppression and saw a reduction in unaware hypoglycemic events, but only a minimal reduction in HbA1c and daily insulin dosages at 1-year post-transplant (120).",

The restoration of normoglycemia and insulin independence in immunosuppressed type 1 diabetic recipients of islet allotransplantation has shown the potential of a cell-based diabetes therapy. Even if successful, this approach poses a problem of scarce tissue supply. Xenotransplantation can be the answer to this limited donor availability and, among possible candidate tissues for xenotransplantation, porcine islets are the closest to a future clinical application. Xenotransplantation, with pigs as donors, offers the possibility of using healthy, living, and genetically modified islets from pathogen-free animals available in unlimited number of islets. Several studies in the pig-to-nonhuman primate model demonstrated the feasibility of successful preclinical islet xenotransplantation and have provided insights into the critical events and possible mechanisms of immune recognition and rejection of xenogeneic islet grafts. Particularly promising results in the achievement of prolonged insulin independence were obtained with newly developed, genetically modified pigs islets able to produce immunoregulatory products, using different implantation sites, and new immunotherapeutic strategies. Nonetheless, further efforts are needed to generate additional safety and efficacy data in nonhuman primate models to safely translate these findings into the clinic.",

            "text": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from the destruction of insulin-releasing \u03b2-cells in the pancreatic islets. Approximately 3.3% to 13.5% of patients with T1DM experience unstable blood glucose regulation and recurrent hypoglycemic symptoms despite appropriate insulin therapy 1,2 . For these patients, pancreas/islet transplantation is a promising therapeutic option; however, it is hampered by the shortage and non-uniform quality of cells in clinical settings 3 . In this context, stem cell-derived islets have gained attention as an alternative cell source owing to the feasibility of largescale cell manufacturing with uniform quality 4,5 . \n\nT1DM rodent models are often used to assess the engraftment and functioning of human primary and stem cellderived islets. However, humans and rodents exhibit significant differences in terms of anatomy, body size, and blood volume. These variations may lead to translational challenges; thus, the use of animal models closer in size to humans is preferable to obtain translatable results for clinical applications. Among the many experimental animals, dogs, non-human primates (NHPs), and pigs 6,7 are commonly used. In addition, mini-pig skin resembles human skin in multiple aspects such as cell components and the thickness of individual skin layers 8,9 . In fact, pigs have been used to evaluate subcutaneously implanted human-sized surgical devices 10 , as well as insulin pumps, whose catheters are inserted into the subcutaneous space 11 . Therefore, diabetic mini-pigs may also be useful models for evaluating human stem cell-derived islets for diabetes treatment. However, reports on the use of diabetic mini-pigs for xenotransplantation are limited because of the complexity of xenoimmunity control in these models 12 . Itoh et al. 12 recently demonstrated the long-term accommodation of artificial human vascular grafts in mini-pigs by combining thymectomy, splenectomy, and ISs. Their findings indicate that immune-compromised mini-pigs could provide a promising platform for xenogeneic engraftment and serve as a model for evaluating the potential of cell therapy using human stem cell-derived islets, including surgical techniques in skin tissue.",

            "text": "In addition to using stem cell-derived islet beta cells to replace donor islet cells, another potential option is xenotransplantation using porcine islets.Compared to human islets, pig reproduction is easier and pig islets are more readily available.More importantly, pig insulin is highly similar to human insulin, differing by only one amino acid.Pig insulin has been used to treat diabetes for decades.Pigs have organs similar in size to humans, enabling production of a sufficient number of islets for xenotransplantation.They are the most promising donor source for xenotransplantation.Although more porcine islet cells are required to achieve adequate insulin secretion compared to human donor islets, porcine islets appear to outperform human islets in studies.Porcine islet cell xenotransplantation has achieved insulin function in non-human primates, suggesting feasibility in clinical settings.Shin et al. reported long-term survival of adult porcine islets transplanted into five rhesus monkeys for over 20 months.These early trials suggest pig islets have great potential to address donor islet shortages for T1D patients.\n\nHowever, there are still some urgent problems to be solved in the use of porcine islet xenotransplantation, the first of which is graft rejection.For example, infusion of porcine islets into the portal vein leads to activation of complement and clotting pathways, resulting in platelet aggregation and thrombosis at the transplant site and hyperacute rejection (64).This is followed by human responses to porcine islet antigens (Galactose a1,3-galactose and N-Glycolylneuraminic acid), as well as zoonotic infections caused by endogenous retroviruses.\n\nIn the meantime, solutions are being tried.One strategy is encapsulating islet cells without immunosuppression to solve the immune rejection problem in porcine islet xenotransplantation.",

Additionally, their heart and liver are smaller compared with that of other mammals, including wild pigs, which is an additional concept that must be considered during results comparisons or interpretations of models in which domestic pigs are shown to be different from miniature pigs that have not been selected for the economic burden of metabolic traits. This difference may result in changes in several organ sizes and functions.\n\nDiabetes genetic risk variants have become an issue in humans and in pig models of various interaction forms, including pediatric, juvenile, male, female, and castrated plus domestic verses miniature pig models that address insulitis-T1DM or T2DM. Recently, porcine islets have received more attention for xenotransplantation because once these islets have been genetically modified; they can overcome rejection to some extent [36]. Thus, in theory, genetic modified pigs preselected with the TCF7L2 protective type C/C may provide better or longer lasting islet xenografts to diabetic patients compared with pigs with the T/T sensitive type. The present study points out genetics and other related concerns of diabetes-pig model and emphasizes that well-designed diabetic pig studies could provide useful insights for metabolic syndromes and would likely be of interest for investigations of the glucose homeostasis of pigs, which is similar to that of humans.",

Islets from different age of donor pigs have also been compared in vivo. Two groups of diabetic nude mice populations were implanted with either young and young adult porcine islets or adult islets. One out of 11 recipients of young and young-adult islets achieved normoglycemia, whereas 32 out of 39 transplanted with adult islets became normal, the blood glucose reaching normal range within 4 weeks post-transplantation. Graft function was confirmed as the cause for normoglycemia, as all 32 mice reverted back to hyperglycemia after islet graft removal [36]. Many studies using NHP models have demonstrated the benefits of the pig islets as xenotransplants, with a potential cure for diabetes [25,39,[98][99][100][101].

Pancreatic islet cell transplantation is an attractive alternative and an effective treatment option for type 1 diabetes, however, donor pancreas shortages prevent islet transplantation from being a widespread solution as the supply cannot possibly equal the demand. Porcine islet xenotransplantation has the potential to address these shortages, and recent preclinical and clinical trials show promising scientific support. Pig islets provide a readily available source for islet transplantation, with the recent trials in non-human primates (NHPs) demonstrating their potential to reverse diabetes. The risk of zoonosis can be reduced by designated pathogen-free breeding of the donor pigs, but porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) which are integrated into the genome of all pigs, are especially difficult to eliminate. However, clinical trials have demonstrated an absence of PERV transmission with a significant reduction in the number of severe hypoglycemic episodes and up to 30% reduction in exogenous insulin doses. A number of methods are currently being tested to overcome the xenograft immune rejection. Some of these methods include the production of various transgenic pigs to better xenotransplantation efficiency and the encapsulation of islets to isolate them from the host immune system. Furthermore, ongoing research is also shedding light on factors such as the age and breed of the donor pig to determine the optimal islet quantity and function.",

The structural and physiological similarities between human and pig organs, along with its unlimited supply, have made them an excellent translational research model [25]. Insulin extracted from pig islets has been used for the treatment of diabetes for decades [10, 11, 20, 33]. Because porcine islets produce insulin patterns similar to those found in humans, and because they are readily available [20], studies strongly suggest that islets obtained from pigs could be a promising substitute for human islets in the treatment of T1D. Recent studies on genetically engineered pigs suggest that these pigs are more suitable for xenotransplantation. For example, alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase gene knockout (GTKO) pigs, have decreased the incidence of immunerejection and improved compatibility between the donor and recipient [31][32][33][34][35][36].\n\nThe major advantages for using pigs as an islet source for xenotransplantation are as follows:\n\n1. Ethically acceptable source.\n\n2. The pig pancreas has structural and physiological similarities to the human organ.\n\n3. Unlimited availability.\n\n4. Easy to breed and produce large litters.\n\n5. Rapid growth into adult organs (6 months).\n\n6. Significantly low cost of maintenance.\n\n7. Elective and emergent availability of the organs.\n\n8.

Patients with diabetic nephropathy represent a uniqueand growingpopulation that would benefit from both islet and kidney transplantation. Indeed, the favorable riskto-benefit considerations of combined islet and kidney transplantation in this population inspired recent promising clinical studies in islet after kidney transplantation led by the Clinical Islet Transplantation (CIT) Consortium (2).

Clinical translation of porcine islet transplantation predated these recent successes in solid organ xenotransplantation, with encouraging pig-to-NHP studies leading to several small clinical studies using porcine islets in humans (11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21).

Moreover, life-long multiple immunosuppressive constitute a substantial limitation to the clinical application of islet xenoTx, providing a compelling rationale to pursue a clinically applicable strategy for the induction of tolerance. \n\nThe recent news from New York announcing kidney xenotransplantation in two brain death patients (14) and, subsequently, the world's first Tx of a genetically modified pig heart in a human patient has caught the public's attention (15). It is now timely to review and discuss the current status and potential of clinical islet xenoTx. \n\nIn the Research Topic entitled \"Xenotransplantation for the Therapy of Diabetes: A New Look\" we present four articles. Two of them focus on characterizing porcine islets and the other two introduce complementary or alternative strategies for islet replacement, such as via blastocyst complementation technology or human stem-cell-derived beta cells. \n\nThe article by Arefanian et al. from the University of Alberta assessed the yield, cell composition, and function of islets isolated from neonatal pigs at different ages. For previous experimental studies, two sources of pig islets have historically been used: neonatal pigs (16) or adult pigs (13,(17)(18)(19). It is generally accepted that adult pig islets are fragile and that their isolation is technically more challenging than human islet isolation; only a limited number of facilities are proficient in the provision of adult pig islets. Neonatal pig islet isolation is technically less complicated and therefore more broadly replicable. However, the islet yields are lower, thus, requiring multiple donors versus one adult to generate an islet mass sufficient to reverse diabetes in large mammals and potentially in human recipients. Neonatal islets compared to adult islets require a longer time to produce insulin following Tx (16). Thus, it is not yet clear whether to use neonate or adult pigs as islets donors and this decision, therefore, is subject to the individual institutions. Optimizing pig donor age for multi-organ retrieval for xenoTx poses a significant practical problem for companies seeking to raise pigs for xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "For patients with type 1 diabetes, \u03b2-cell replacement is a superior therapeutic option over daily insulin injections [47]. Xenotransplantation of pig pancreatic islets is a viable alternative to allotransplantation, as discussed in several reviews [5,48,49]. Although the isolation of adult porcine islets (APIs) is challenging, some researchers prefer them over neonatal/fetal porcine islets (NPIs) due to their lower \u03b1-Gal expression, greater insulin production capacity, and immediate functionality post-transplantation [50]. In contrast, NPIs are easier to isolate but require functional maturation in vitro. Nevertheless, many research groups opt for NPIs from the 1to 5-day-old pancreas and have developed concepts to improve their in vitro maturation [51][52][53][54]. \n\nRegardless of the islet source, over 50% of islets transplanted into the portal vein, a standard protocol in clinics, are lost due to the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) [55]. This innate immune response is more severe for xenoislets than for alloislets [55,56]. Therefore, overcoming the host immune response is crucial for successful islet xenotransplantation. In pigto-NHP preclinical trials, surprisingly, the longest islet survival of over 900 days was achieved using WT APIs [57]. However, the recipients required a clinically unacceptable immunosuppressive regimen, and the engrafted pig islets were rejected once the immunosuppression was withdrawn [57]. Genetically modifying the donor pigs can help circumvent the host immune response. APIs from human CD46-expressing pigs survived for over 396 days in immunosuppressed diabetic cynomolgus monkeys [58], whereas NPIs from GGTA1-KO pigs survived for up to 249 days in immunosuppressed diabetic rhesus monkeys [59].",

However, considering the huge number of patients with type 1 diabetes, human donor shortage is a serious issue. To overcome the donor shortage issue, xenotransplantation is an attractive option. In fact, clinical islet xenotransplantation has been conducted since 1990s. The first clinical trial was performed using fetal pigs and demonstrated the porcine pancreatic tissue could survive in human body with immunosuppressive strategies. To scale up the islet production, Canadian group established a method for islet isolation from neonatal pigs. Their method has been used for clinical islet xenotransplantation in New Zealand, Russian, Mexico, Argentina, and China. Recently Korean group published a clinical protocol for islet xenotransplantation using adult pigs. For the next generation of islet xenotransplantation, gene-modified pigs were created. Especially \u201csuperislets\u201d created by Belgian group demonstrated promising preclinical outcomes. With advanced donor pigs, islet xenotransplantation might become a suitable treatment for the majority of type 1 diabetic patients.

Type 1 diabetes can be treated successfully by islet allotransplantation, the results of which are steadily improving. However, the number of islets that can be obtained from deceased human donors will never be sufficient to cure more than a very small percentage of patients who might benefit from transplantation. Although there are some differences in glucose metabolism between pigs and humans, the use of pigs could provide an unlimited supply of islets, and the insulin produced would undoubtedly control glucose levels. Transplantation of islets into the portal vein results in islets residing in the liver; however, an early inflammatory response and rejection remain problematic, even when the recipient is receiving immunosuppressive therapy. In the long term, immunosuppressive drugs may exhibit toxicities to patients and specifically harm the islet cells. In contrast, encapsulation techniques provide islets with a physical barrier that prevents antibodies binding to the islet graft while still allowing insulin to be released into the recipient\u2019s circulation; in theory, patients receiving encapsulated grafts might not require exogenous immunosuppressive therapy. Nonhuman primates with encapsulated pig islet transplants have remained insulin-independent for several weeks, but long-term efficacy remains uncertain. Furthermore, techniques are now available to knock out genes from the pig and/or insert human genes, thus rendering the antigenic structure of pigs closer to that of humans, and providing protection from the human immune response. Islet transplantation from genetically engineered pigs has been followed by insulin independence in a small number of nonhuman primates for greater than 1 year. Neonatal islets have some advantages over adult islets in that they are easier to isolate and culture, and have the ability to proliferate during the first few months after transplantation. In 2009, the International Xenotransplantation Association set up a group to encourage and advise on clinical trials of pig islet xenotransplantation; this group\u2019s guidelines are discussed. Clinical trials of encapsulated pig islets are already under way.",

            "text": "Islets obtained from embryonic, fetal, neonatal, young, or adult pigs have been selected as the grafts for xenotransplantation. Despite several years of study, no exact consensus has been achieved about the selection of the most optimal pig to supply adequate viable isolated islet cells for preclinical xenotransplantation (11,12). Only islet xenografts harvested from neonatal (2-3 days old) and adult (>6 months) pigs have been shown to correct diabetes in non-human primates (NHPs) or humans (13)(14)(15)(16). \n\nFetal pig islet-like cell clusters (ICCs) and neonatal pig islets (NPIs) are immature cells, which can be easily obtained by enzymatic digestion and simple culture. Other advantages of ICCs and NPIs are their apparent resistance to ischemic and inflammatory damage during isolation that makes islet recovery more efficient. However, several studies suggested that ICCs had poor insulin response to glucose (17)(18)(19)(20)(21), Typically, ICCs requires 2-3 months for maturation to achieve in vivo functionality (22). Additionally, in diabetic monkeys, transplanted pig ICCs were almost completely destroyed within 12 days post-transplantation (23). All the disadvantages restrict the potential clinical application of pig ICCs. \n\nNeonatal pig islets consist of differentiated pancreatic endocrine cells (about 35%) and primarily epithelial cells (about 57%), which is also considered as islet precursor cells (24,25). NPIs are more responsive to high glucose than ICCs and subsequently have a powerful functional ability to restore normoglycemia in diabetic animals, which are mainly due to \u03b2 cell expansion and the striking differentiation of epithelial cells into \u03b2 cell (26)(27)(28)(29). NPIs clearly express xenoantigens including sialic acid antigens, Hanganutziu-Deicher (H-D) antigens, and Gal\u03b11-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc-R (\u03b1-Gal) epitopes (30).",

            "text": "This new treatment modality was tested in rats, and authors concluded that it was a promising approach for safe and effective islet transplantation and long-term type 1 DM management. \n\nHuman pluripotent stem cell-derived islets were produced in different laboratories worldwide and studied in animal models, with some promising results and a potential cell resource for diabetes treatment [81,82]. However, these new approaches have not been systematically assessed in humans or animal models physiologically similar to humans [80]. Xenogeneic islets isolated from pigs is another area of research. Trials of porcine islet xenografts transplanted into primate models have shown a potential to achieve insulin independence and prolonged islet-graft function (>600 days) [34,35]. The disadvantage is that it seems to cause a greater immunological hurdle compared with islet allotransplantation [26,83]. \n\nThese efforts in engineering, regenerative medicine, and xenogeneic islets from pigs will meet some issues concerning their clinical application in humans and ethical concerns regarding their origin, as well as how, when, and where will patients have access to these advanced therapies. There are several dangers associated with xenotransplantation, such as immunological rejection of the organ, endogenous viruses infecting the recipients, animal welfare, and fair distribution of organs [84]. With a shortage of human tissue available, it is no wonder that researchers have considered the pig as a potential source. For example, porcine valves are routinely used in aortic valve replacements in the UK. However, there is currently no legislation which specifically regulates xenotransplantation in the UK, but a non-statutory body, the UK Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority (UKXIRA) exists to monitor developments in the xenotransplantation field. \n\nThe lack of uniform definitions for success in \u03b2-cell replacement therapy should be addressed in order to make treatment options comparable in the future [26].",

            "text": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by pancreatic islet cell destruction by CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and autoantibodies, resulting in insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia (1). Conventional treatment of T1D includes exogenous insulin therapy, which reduces, but may not prevent, the development of the long-term complications of hyperglycemia. In late-stage T1D patients, especially those with 'brittle' diabetes, it is difficult to prevent complications such as cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, and lifethreatening hypoglycemic episodes (1). \n\nIslet allotransplantation has been identified as an efficient therapy for T1D, but, faced with the shortage of pancreases from deceased human donors, pig-to-human islet xenotransplantation has emerged as a potential alternative (2). Although pig-tononhuman primate (NHP) islet xenotransplantation has resulted in insulin independence, several problems remain. \n\nThe age of the islet-source pig may be important to islet quality. Adult pigs have a mature islet structure, lower galactose-a1,3-galactose (Gal) expression on islets, and a higher islet yield (3). Neonatal pig islets are easier to isolate and at a lower cost (3). To overcome immunological rejection of pig-to-NHP islet transplants, genetic modification of the source pig plays an important role by deleting xenoantigen expression and introducing human 'protective' proteins (4). New alternative modifications, e.g., expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), are being explored. A consensus has been reached that, in regard to the transplantation of pig organs into humans, the expression of the three known carbohydrate xenoantigens (Gal, Neu5Gc, Sda) should be deleted (resulting in tripleknockout [TKO] pigs) (4,5), but this remains uncertain after pig islet transplantation.",

            "text": "An estimated 22 million people currently suffer from type 1 diabetes mellitus (1). This incredible burden is treated with various forms of exogenous insulin therapy but whole pancreas or islet cell transplantation remains the gold standard for treatment. Pancreas or islet transplantation restores glucose homeostasis without constant external monitoring and prevents the occurrence of severe hypoglycaemic episodes, dramatically improving the patient's quality of life and attenuating the secondary complications of diabetes (2). However, there are too few organ donors to provide enough pancreata for even a fraction of the patients who would benefit from transplantation. This shortage has stimulated extensive research into the use of pigs as alternative islet donors. One advantage of using pigs is that they can be genetically modified to protect islet xenografts from immunological challenges including the intense innate response triggered by intraportal delivery, known as the instant bloodmediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) (3). \n\nOld World non-human primates (NHP) provide the best preclinical model for xenotransplantation of adult porcine islets or neonatal islet cell clusters (NICC), because like humans they possess pre-existing antibodies to the dominant carbohydrate xenoantigen galactose-a1,3-galactose (aGal). Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques are the most widely used NHP model in islet xenotransplantation. Shin et al. achieved a median survival of 10 months for wild-type (WT) adult porcine islet xenografts in macaques (4,5). However, a high dose of islets was required, along with a complex immunosuppressive protocol that would be unacceptable in the clinic. A more clinically applicable regimen was less effective at preventing rejection and significantly reduced the duration of insulin-independent normoglycemia (6). Graham et al. used clinically available immunosuppressants to achieve median survival of 147 days for WT adult porcine islet xenografts in macaques (7). However, recipients developed a state of systemic inflammation associated with increased incidence and severity of adverse events.",

Paucity of human organ donors has led to the consideration of potential alternative sources of islet cells, with porcine islet cells being attractive candidates for cell therapy. Since porcine insulin has long been used and functions in humans to treat patients before recombinant human insulin became available due to high similarity in porcine insulin protein sequence with only one amino acid residue difference to human insulin, xenogeneic porcine islet cell therapy has long been proposed to treat T1D [26][27][28] . Porcine islet cell xenotransplantation has been investigated as a potential bridge or the ultimate treatment for T1D in decades with substantial progresses in both preclinical and clinical studies. Xenogeneic islet cell therapy could become a clinically applicable treatment with proper clinically applicable immunosuppression regimens or efficient biocompatible matrix encapsulation devices that permit diffusion of oxygen and nutrients and prevent transplanted islet cells from the host immune attacks 26,27 . Preclinical pig-to-nonhuman primate transplantation models have been studied and the first long-term graft survival (>6 month) of pig islet cells in non-human primates (NHPs) has been demonstrated [29][30][31] . Subsequent study further confirmed reproducible curative potential in NHP model that pig islet grafts survived and maintained normoglycemia for >6 months with the longest up to 603 days 32 . The clinical studies with xenogeneic porcine islet cells demonstrated the cell survival and function in the human body with no noted serious adverse events, but these clinical islet cell xenotransplantation trials have not shown to durably prevent severe hypoglycemia while maintaining tight glycemic control in T1D patients 28,33 . \n\nXenogeneic hepatocytes for liver failures.",

            "text": "Table 1 reports a list of sites used in clinical islet transplantation. \n\nFurther on the frontiers of medicine are alternative methods to produce islets without relying on human organ donors, including techniques for the xenotransplantation of porcine islets. Greek myths of creatures that were part human and part animal such as the centaur or minotaur show man's early fascination with the mingling of human and animal characteristics. CG Groth reported the first xenotransplantation of porcine fetal islet-like cell clusters in patients with T1D in 1994. While this study demonstrated the feasibility of porcine islet transplantation it did not show improvement in patients (68). In the subsequent decades, porcine islet xenotransplantation has been more fully explored in pre-clinical trials using nonhuman primates (69,70). Humoral rejection represents a major obstacle for successful xenotransplantation. Epitopes of \u03b11,3Gal are found on the surface of almost all animals, with the significant exception of humans and some primates, and represents the primary antigen causing hyperacute rejection in pig to human xenotransplantation and pig to nonhuman primate islet xenotransplantation. A collaborative effort between the University of Pittsburgh and Revivicor, Inc. led to the generation of Gal1,3-galactosyltransferase geneknockout (GTKO) pigs which do not express Gal (71). This proved to be a major milestone in the advancement of xenotransplantation. While additional xenoantigens have since been discovered, Gal remains the most relevant, and GTKO pigs are recognized as the likely background of choice for eventual clinical translation. The knock-out of Gal, however, did not prevent islet rejection and other gene manipulations were also explored. In 2009, the islet group in Pittsburgh was the first to demonstrate long-term islet graft function (for up to 1 year) in streptozotocin induced diabetic nonhuman primates transplanted with pig islets genetically modified to express a human complement-regulatory protein (hCD46).",

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic disease affecting over 463 million people globally, as recently reported by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). 1 Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease in which beta cells are completely destroyed, resulting in metabolic dysfunction as a consequence of insufficient circulating levels of insulin. 2,3 Insulin therapy (exogenous insulin) is a principle method of treatment, but it does not mimic exactly the physiology of insulin secretion in the body. 4 The alternative is pancreas transplantation and/or pancreatic islet cell transplantation. \n\nHowever, the severe shortage of available cadaveric donors limited the widespread adoption of this transplantation. 5 In addition, the number of pancreases and islet quality decreased by several factors, including increasing donor age and obesity. 6 For these reasons, many researchers studied alternative source of islets to solve these key supply problems. Xenotransplantation using pig islets is one of the candidates for clinical transplantation into diabetic patients. Successful xenotransplantation from pigs to humans provides a potential unlimited supply of tissues and cells, resolving the shortage of donor tissues for transplantation. 7 Several research groups studied islet xenotransplantation using pigs as the source of insulin-producing cells. 8 There has been considerable research exploring the use of purified enzyme blends in islet isolation that have been specifically developed for islet isolation in an attempt to improve consistency and increase yields and function of isolated islets. 9 Since 2006, a total of 9 groups performed non-human primate experiments using porcine islets. In 2015, Shin JS et al 10 reported on islets isolated from two pigs transplanted into 4-to 6-kg non-human primates (NHPs). \n\nPorcine islets were isolated using Liberase MTF C/T GMP-grade enzymes. They also used Cobra Venom Factor (CVF), anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody and ATG induction, and sirolimus immunosuppression, in addition to anti-CD154. 3 of 5 recipients also received ex vivo expanded regulatory T-cell therapy.",

Porcine islets, deemed a viable alternative, recently demonstrated successful longterm survival without zoonotic risks in a clinically relevant pig-to-non-human primate islet transplantation model. This success prompted the development of a clinical trial protocol for porcine islet xenotransplantation in humans. Methods A single-center, open-label clinical trial initiated by the sponsor will assess the safety and efficacy of porcine islet transplantation for diabetes patients at Gachon Hospital. The protocol received approval from the Gachon Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) under the Investigational New Drug (IND) process. Two diabetic patients, experiencing inadequate glycemic control despite intensive insulin treatment and frequent hypoglycemic unawareness, will be enrolled. Participants and their family members will engage in deliberation before xenotransplantation during the screening period. Each patient will receive islets isolated from designated pathogen-free pigs. Immunosuppressants and systemic infection prophylaxis will follow the program schedule. The primary endpoint is to confirm the safety of porcine islets in patients, and the secondary endpoint is to assess whether porcine islets can reduce insulin dose and the frequency of hypoglycemic unawareness. Conclusion A clinical trial protocol adhering to global consensus guidelines for porcine islet xenotransplantation is presented, facilitating streamlined implementation of comparable human trials worldwide.",

[83].Different strategies and biomaterials for encapsulation of pig islets are under investigation, with one highlight being 6-month survival of pig islets after alginate macroencapsulation in diabetic monkeys [84].Also, different sites of implantation, mainly the peritoneal cavity and omentum, but also the bone marrow, are being investigated with respect to the loss of function and limited survival due to pericapsular fibrosis.\n\nThe progress in the field of encapsulated porcine islets has been reviewed elsewhere in detail [79].",

Porcine islet xenotransplantation has long been proposed as a solution to this organ shortage, but enthusiasm for islet xenotransplantation waned in the face of mixed results from pre-clinical and early clinical studies. However, progress in the field of kidney and heart xenotransplantation with the development of rapid genome editing technologies, novel immunosuppression regimens, and even tolerance induction strategies has led to significant improvements in pig-to-NHP heart and kidney graft survival in recent years. As described in this review, these broader developments in xenotransplantation have contributed to specific improvements in pig-to-NHP islet xenograft transplantation, with recent studies demonstrating reversal of diabetes with costimulation-based immunosuppression protocols using islets obtained from multiply modified pigs (55).\n\nRecent pig-to-human heart and kidney xenograft transplants have recaptured the popular imagination. As the transplant community nears clinical trials in pig-to-human heart and kidney xenograft transplantation (https://www.wsj. com/articles/fda-said-to-plan-pig-organ-transplant-clinicaltrials-11656622411), there is renewed interest in clinical islet xenotransplantation. Given recent progress, there may be adequate pre-clinical efficacy and safety data to initiate select clinical trials within targeted patient populations, according to guidelines established by the International Xenotransplantation Association (11). The results of ongoing pre-clinical studies focusing on further genetic modifications of donor pigs, optimizing costimulation blockade without anti-CD154 mAb, and applying tolerance-inducing strategies to pre-clinical islet xenotransplantation will provide more clarity on the question of when islet xenotransplantation will become a viable clinical solution to diabetes.",

(1994) performed the first clinical islet xenotransplantation using foetal porcine islet cell-like clusters (ICCs), providing preliminary data for subsequent clinical islet xenotransplantation. There has also been some work in islet xenotransplantation from pigs to NHPs and successful reversal of recipient diabetes and achievement of long-term normoglycemia (Dufrane et al., 2006;Hering et al., 2006;Cardona et al., 2007). Moreover, in some clinical trials (Yang and Yoon, 2015), xenografts were performed using encapsulated neonatal porcine islets, and the grafts were maintained for more than 2 years with a significant reduction in the number of hypoglycemic episodes. In islet xenotransplantation, islet encapsulation and gene editing technologies are currently used to alleviate rejection (Dhanasekaran et al., 2017). Targeted specific removal of porcine endogenous retroviruses from the genomes of porcine cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 can improve islet xenotransplantation safety. The production of pigs with multiple genetic modifications for xenotransplantation using the targeted specificity of CRISPR/Cas9 has been discussed in this paper and will not be discussed here.",

Islet transplantation into the portal vein is the current clinical practice. This method can induce the dysfunction in islet engraftment and survival owing to low oxygen tension, an active innate immune system, and the provocation of an inflammatory response, eventually resulting in the loss of many transplanted islets. Thus, subcutaneous transplantation has been recommended as an alternative choice (van der Windt et al., 2008). \n\nAdult and neonatal pig islets xeno-transplanted in immunosuppressive nonhuman primates survived for more than 6 months (Cardona et al., 2006;Hering et al., 2006). These reports are encouraging since porcine pancreatic xenograft can survive longer than other xenograft organs, suggesting the crucial clue in xenotransplantation. Several investigators alleged that xenotransplantaion of pig pancreatic primoria may be a candidate model as a therapeutics for both types 1 and 2 diabetes (Thomas et al., 1995;Rogers et al., 2006). Rogers et al. (2007) demonstrated that transplantation of embryonic day (E) 28 (E28) pig pancreatic primordia into the mesentery of STZdiabetic rhesus macaques reduced insulin requirement, suggesting the availability for diabetes. Although the report of porcine pancreatic islets xenograft into non-human primates was restricted to type I diabetes (van der Windt et al., 2009;Cooper and Casu, 2009), the usefulness in type II diabetes also remains to be attempted. Komoda et al. (2005) have demonstrated that islets from transgenic pigs expressing N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III showed prolonged survival after transplantation into cynomolgus monkeys.",

            "text": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by absolute insulin deficiency primarily due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic \u03b2\u2010cells. The prevailing treatment for T1DM involves daily subcutaneous insulin injections, but a substantial proportion of patients face challenges such as severe hypoglycemic episodes and poorly controlled hyperglycemia. For T1DM patients, a more effective therapeutic option involves the replacement of \u03b2\u2010cells through allogeneic transplantation of either the entire pancreas or isolated pancreatic islets. Unfortunately, the scarcity of transplantable human organs has led to a growing list of patients waiting for an islet transplant. One potential alternative is xenotransplantation of porcine pancreatic islets. However, due to inter\u2010species molecular incompatibilities, porcine tissues trigger a robust immune response in humans, leading to xenograft rejection. Several promising strategies aim to overcome this challenge and enhance the long\u2010term survival and functionality of xenogeneic islet grafts. These strategies include the use of islets derived from genetically modified pigs, immunoisolation of islets by encapsulation in biocompatible materials, and the creation of an immunomodulatory microenvironment by co\u2010transplanting islets with accessory cells or utilizing immunomodulatory biomaterials. This review concentrates on delineating the primary obstacles in islet xenotransplantation and elucidates the fundamental principles and recent breakthroughs aimed at addressing these challenges.",

The pig may potentially be an unlimited source of organs for patients with diabetes, although the appropriate age for islet isolation is not known. As juvenile pigs are more easily reared in uncontaminated conditions, we analyzed the distribution of endocrine cell clusters by comprehensively evaluating juvenile porcine pancreatic development to propose an appropriate age cut-off for islet isolation from the juvenile porcine pancreas [43] . We found that the isolation of porcine pancreatic islets approximately 35 d after birth may offer benefits with regard to their xenotransplantation potential. Further research into the optimal timeline for islet isolation is being conducted in DPF pigs generated at our research center.",

            "text": "Pig islet xenotransplantation is a procedure that could help address the limited number of human organs available for islet transplantation [1]. Pig islets have been used successfully for the reversal of diabetes in animal models including non-human primates; however, few human studies have been performed [2][3][4][5]. Many previous and recent studies in the field of xenotransplantation have focused on developing methods such as the creation of genetically modified pigs to prevent immune rejection upon transplantation, with less focus placed on pig islets' biology and development [5], which are fundamental in our understanding of the tissue we hope to use as a possible solution to the shortage of human islets for transplantation. \n\nIt is known that significant anatomic and physiological differences exist within the endocrine pancreas across species, making it important to study physiological pathways in pigs, as they likely differ from those seen in rodents and humans [6][7][8][9]. In addition, if one compares the islet cells in the neonatal pig pancreas with those seen in the adult pig pancreas, the typical structure in the adult pig islets is not observed in the neonatal pig islets. Like others, our research group believes that due to practical and biological advantages, neonatal pig islets (NPI) are the most promising source of islets for xenotransplantation [9][10][11]. Hence, a better understanding of how neonatal pig islets develop over time and the molecules involved during this process would facilitate the clinical translation of neonatal pig islet xenotransplantation. \n\nThe primary cellular pathway we are interested in initially investigating includes members within the conserved family of transmembrane adhesion molecules known as cadherins [12]. Epithelial (E) cadherins are known to play a role in endocrine pancreas development and structure in humans and rodents, but these findings have not been previously explored in pigs [13,14].",

            "text": "In 1994, CG Groth reported the first xenotransplantation of porcine fetal islet-like cell clusters in a T1D patient. This study demonstrated the feasibility of porcine islet transplantation but did not show improvement in the patient's condition (238). Over the following decades, porcine islet xenotransplantation has been more thoroughly explored in preclinical trials with non-human primates (239,240). Humoral rejection is the main obstacle to the success of xenotransplantation. The a1,3Gal epitope, present on the surface of almost all animals except humans and some primates, is the primary antigen causing hyperacute rejection in pig-to-human and pig-to-non-human primate islet xenotransplantation. The University of Pittsburgh and Revivicor, Inc. designed Gal knockout (GTKO) pigs that do not express Gal (158). This proved to be a significant milestone in the development of xenotransplantation. Although other xenogeneic antigens were later discovered, Gal remains the most relevant, and GTKO pigs are considered a potential choice for eventual clinical translation. However, Gal knockout does not prevent islet rejection, and other genetic manipulations have been explored. In 2009, the Pittsburgh islet team first demonstrated long-term function (up to one year) of islet grafts in streptozotocin-induced diabetic non-human primates transplanted with porcine islets genetically modified to express human complement regulatory protein (hCD46). hCD46 expressed on porcine islets limited antibody-mediated rejection, allowing for the reduction of immunosuppression to maintain sufficient islet mass for long-term normal function. However, it did not reduce the initial islet loss associated with IBMIR as expected (241). This led to the further development of multigene pig islet donors capable of providing multifaceted protection to enhance islet transplantation. Five years later, the same group achieved similar success, long-term transplantation of islets from multigene pigs for the first time.",

(4) Other inconveniences are the high cost of islet isolation, the poor durability of insulin independence, autoimmunity and rejection after transplantation (2,3,5,6). \n\nTo supply the scarcity of islets, animal donors, such as pigs, could provide an alternative source of cells for transplantation (7). However, xenotransplantation is challenged by the possible risk of infection from pathogens within the donor animal. Specifically, all pigs contain multiple copies of porcine endogenous retrovirus and at least three variants of pig endogenous retrovirus (PERV), which can infect human cells in vitro. Thus, there is a risk of PERV infection associated with the xenotransplantation of pig islets to immunosuppressed human patients (8,9). \n\nIn this context, to evaluate the quality and function of isolated human islets (10), the rodent has been chosen over other animals in most studies that involve islet rejection and the prevention of type 1 diabetes (3). \n\nManikandan et al. (11) studied the antioxidant effect of black tea on the regeneration of pancreatic -cells and observed a positive therapeutic effect in rodent studies. Recently, Gu et al. (12) described an alternative therapeutic strategy to treat type 1 diabetes, namely, treatment by nanoparticles, which sustainably promotes the self-regulation of glucosemediated insulin secretion. This effect is observed for a longer period of time than the insulin injections that are currently used for treatment. \n\nAlthough there have been many positive results related to the xenotransplantation of human islets to rodents, researchers have rarely achieved a breakthrough in the clinical treatment of islet transplantation, perhaps because of the differences between the human immune system and the rodent model. These differences have stimulated the development of humanized rodent models, which allow the detailed study of human immune system cells and transplanted human islets in vivo (3).",

            "text": "This review has highlighted the challenges of the cellular immune response in islet xenotransplantation. Currently there is no immunosuppressive strategy that overcomes the dual challenges of efficacy and safety. This brings us back to the need to refocus on one of the major advantages of xenotransplantation; the opportunity to genetically modify the donor with the aim of minimising the treatment required for the recipient. Over the past two decades there have been considerable progress in developing a genetically modified pig islets that overcomes the dual problems of IBMIR and cell mediated rejection. This has been accelerated more recently by the generation of multi-transgenic pigs using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. This new generation of pigs have been designed to target simultaneously several components of the immune system. \n\nThey have yet to be formally tested in NHP models of islet xenotransplantation, although preliminary studies of porcine kidneys from these pigs transplanted into cynomologus monkeys have shown promising results (134). A new option for islet cell replacement has been reported recently. In February of 2022 ViaCyte/CRISPR announced in a press release that their first patient was treated in phase 1 trial of gene-edited islet cell replacement therapy for type1 diabetes, suggesting the development of gene-edited, stem cell-derived, \"hypoimmunogenic\" islet cell products as a promising alternative strategy for treatment of T1D. Whilst this sounds promising, formal evaluation of the trial results in the peer reviewed literature is awaited. As with many new medical immunosuppressive reagents, progress in xenotransplantation has been governed by technological advances and the \"next generation\" of genetically modified pigs could result in porcine islet xenotransplantation being a successful treatment for T1D.",

            "text": "Recently, our group reported successful results where five consecutive diabetic monkeys achieved normoglycemia for at least 6 months after transplantation of adult porcine islets, with the longest survival day reaching to >603 days [26]. During a follow-up study, one monkey showed normoglycemia up to ~1000 days using a CD40-CD154 blockade such as anti-CD154 or anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody [27]. These two studies pose an important implication that porcine islet graft can survive in the liver, which is rather a harsh environment, for a significantly long duration. The caveat of these studies would be transplanting relatively high numbers of islets (100,000 IEQ/kg) to maintain normoglycemia for a long duration, which would reflect the species incompatibility between NHP and pig. The normal fasting blood glucose level (BGL) of a monkey has been known to be around 60 mg/ dL, and the monkey requires higher amount of insulin for glycemic control than pigs and probably humans [28]. As rhesus monkeys have about 25-year lifespan, 1000 days could approximate to 3000 days (>8 years) in humans, suggesting that transplanted porcine islets can treat diabetic patients for a long time, given that immunosuppression should be well maintained with suitable drugs. Currently, our group is actively seeking to develop clinically applicable immunosuppressive regimen in the same pig-to-NHP islet xenotransplantation model. \n\nIn this chapter, we will describe the detailed procedures of islet isolation from adult SNU miniature pigs, diabetes induction and islet transplantation, immune monitoring after transplantation, and finally biopsy and subsequent immunohistochemical analyses. Because other related topics including encapsulated pig islets, islet sources, immunosuppression regimen, and overall results from several pig-to-NHP islet xenotransplantation have been elegantly described elsewhere [15,[29][30][31][32], here we will focus on the above themes while briefly reviewing past and current status of each area.",

            "text": "Animal models are essential tools for investigating the aetiology and pathogenesis of diabetes as well as for developing effective treatment methods, such as islet transplantation or genetic engineering [1,2]. Although a range of wellcharacterized and widely used models of type 1 diabetes in rodents are currently available, they do not reliably predict therapeutic outcomes in larger mammals [2][3][4]. Large animal models are a valuable complement to rodents for both physiological and practical reasons. Anatomically, the porcine and human pancreases are quite similar. In both species, it is a retroperitoneal organ, and the pancreatic head wraps the portal vein [5]. In addition, the firmness of the pig pancreatic parenchyma is similar to the gland in humans [6]. Physiologically, pig islets offer a very competitive product for \u03b2-cell replacement because of their morphological characteristics, ability to respond to glucose challenge, and cell composition and also because of the fact that the pig and human insulin differ in only one amino acid [5,7]. \n\nAmong the new emerging technologies for diabetes therapy, gene and cellular injections are currently attractive and of great potential. However, there are persistent and severe obstacles to their applications mainly because of the topography and structure of the pancreas [3]. So far, there are no effective ways of approaching the pancreas without causing significant unwanted effects, such as infection of other organs [8] or toxicity and damage of the pancreas parenchyma [3,9]. Arterial or venous injection via the pancreatic circulation has been reported in dogs [10], but surgical clamping of the pancreatic circulation was necessary. Alternatively, gene injection through the pancreatic duct has been tested in rats and mice [3], but the high infusion pressure required was related to complications like pancreatitis. \n\nSuccessful islet gene and cellular therapies will depend on the appropriate choice of the route of administration [2,10]. To make these therapies viable in the clinical setting, preclinical investigations should be aimed at identifying safe ways to deliver the cells or vectors into recipients and at defining effective methods for preventing postadministration loss of transferred elements.",

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus is a severe and debilitating chronic disease that develops in nearly 5% of the world's population [1,2].For all patients who have type 1 diabetes (insulin deficiency due to autoimmune destruction of beta cells) or severe type 2 diabetes (impaired insulin secretion combined with reduced sensitivity to insulin), the only practical treatment possible today is lifelong insulin replacement by multiple daily injections.However, even for very compliant patients participating in a carefully titrated insulin therapy protocol aimed at avoiding glycemic fluctuations, it is difficult to tightly control blood glucose levels.Thus, severe microvascular complications associated with the disease may develop [3][4][5][6].Transplantation of an entire pancreas or pancreatic islets would potentially benefit millions of such patients [7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. Unfortunately, this alternative is extremely limited by the shortage of human donor organs available for transplantation [14][15][16].\n\nConsidering the ethical limitations associated with implementation of new strategies for islet allotransplantation, such as from human embryonic tissues, and the ongoing debate regarding the use of human embryonic stem cells or adult pancreatic stem cells for transplantation, the use of porcine tissues might potentially provide an attractive, unlimited source of pancreatic tissue [17].\n\nSeveral safety concerns, in particular the potential hazards associated with endogenous porcine retroviruses, have presented major obstacles to such xenotransplantation [18][19][20].However, it is important to note that previous pig-tohuman xenotransplantations have not revealed a single instance of porcine retrovirus transmission to a human [21].Moreover, a recent study has suggested that these viruses could be eradicated from pig herds bred specifically for xenotransplantation [22].Thus, as argued recently by Ogata and Platt [23], although the potential threat of porcine retroviruses to public health cannot be entirely dismissed, it should be approached by careful attention to the xenograft recipients, rather than being a reason for abandoning the xenotransplantation approach.",

The restoration and maintenance of normoglycemia due to islet graft function was demonstrated by islet-deficient pancreata of recipients and recurrence of the diabetic state upon removal of the graft-bearing chamber. In addition, rat C-peptide was detectable during the implantation period and disappeared from minipig serum immediately after explantation. A second group of animals were followed for a prolonged time period. In these animals, the BW increased by 65% over 70 days period following transplantation. Although the initially transplanted islet mass of 6,2706700 IEQ/kg BW is approximately 20% of islet mass reported in other xenotransplant models [6], it was effective in restoring glycemic control in the recipient animals. However, as BW steadily increased, the nominal dose decreased and eventually impacted the blood glucose levels. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses showed that the recipient's pancreas was almost depleted of beta-cells and that islet graft was morphologically intact with intense insulin staining. Therefore, graft failure was not likely a consequence of islet regeneration, immune rejection, or insufficient nutrient/oxygen supply.\n\nXenotransplantation using pig islets is considered to be a potential solution for the shortage of human organs and for the treatment of diabetes [30]. The designated pathogen free (DPF) status of donor pigs, however, cannot be attained for endogenous viruses, such as porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) as they are integrated into the genome. Despite intensive research, preclinical studies were unable to demonstrate PERV or PERV/C transmission to human cells [31]. Nevertheless, the immune barrier described herein adds another layer of confidence to the safety in xenotransplantation of islets.\n\nFor humans with type 1 diabetes (in whom a total of 300,000-500,000 IEQ is required for glycemic control), implantation of 2 devices with the dimensions of the devices described herein (albeit, with higher surface density) may be required. Another potential approach includes the implantation of an elliptically-designed device (186110670 mm in",

The baboon recipient maintained normal serum creatinine with no evidence of rejection for six months following kidney and islet transplant but was euthanized due to sepsis related to pyelonephritis in setting of stent occlusion on POD180. Immediately after islet transplantation, hyperglycemia was reversed with normalization of blood sugars from >250mg/dL (pre-transplant) to 80-110 mg/dL. Porcine islets functioned and maintained normal BG levels without any exogenous insulin treatment throughout the recipient's postoperative course. Post-mortem evaluation of liver confirmed presence of insulinstaining islets. \n\nDiscussion: timing of sequential transplants and immunomodulatory strategies may be important for success of islet-afterkidney xenotransplantation \n\nAs referenced above (see Preclinical progress in porcine islet xenotransplantation), investigators have recently achieved cure of diabetes in baboons using pooled islets from neonatal genetically modified pig donors (46). However, this required an average of 14 neonatal pancreases (70 piglets for 5 baboon recipients). In our model, we have achieved normoglycemia using islets derived from a single source adult pig with an administered islet mass of 12,500 IEQ/ kg. Of note, this is within range though slightly less than was required in the recent clinical islet-after-kidney transplantation studies where successful islet transplants averaged >16,000 IEQ/kg (2). \n\nOne reason for the success of free islet transplantation in this model may be timing of sequential transplants: kidney-first transplantation promotes absorption of anti-pig antibodies, likely reducing IBMIR following islet transplantation, corresponding to reduced loss of islets. This may have enabled durable reversal of diabetes with fewer islet equivalents as compared with clinical isletafter-kidney transplantation. Indeed, the possible antibody absorption benefits of sequential transplant timing is less clear in the clinical islet-after-kidney studies, where islet transplantation occurred well after index kidney transplantation.",

The sequence of porcine insulin differs by only a single amino acid from that of human insulin and, moreover, porcine insulin was administered to treat diabetes successfully for nearly a century before the introduction of recombinant human insulin (12). \n\nIn the realm of islet xenotransplantation, porcine C-peptide measurements serve as a critical marker for evaluating the survival and functionality of transplanted pig islets in human recipients. This test, measuring the level of C-peptide, a byproduct of insulin production, provides insights into the pancreatic beta cells' ability to produce insulin post-transplantation.

The first nationally-regulated clinical trial of intra-peritoneal alginate-poly-L-ornithinealginate (APA) encapsulated (neonatal) porcine islet xenotransplantation in nonimmunosuppressed diabetic patients was carried out in New Zealand and was associated with some reduction in hypoglycemic unawareness (Matsumoto et al., 2014).

Male BALB/c mice (Medical College, Xi'an Jiaotong University, China), weighing 20-25 g, were rendered diabetic by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (Sigma, USA) at a dose of 150 mg/kg. Hyperglycemia was defined as a fasting glucose level greater than 16.7 mmol/L on two consecutive occasions after STZ injection. All experiments were approved by the Medical Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. \n\nAdult porcine pancreas procurement, digestion and islet purification. Pancreases were obtained from 12 adult large white pigs (aged 12 months) with an average weight of 150 kg (Medical College, Xi'an Jiaotong University, China). Pancreatic islets were isolated and purified as described previously [26][27][28][29]. \n\nIslet xenotransplantation. The IDDM model mice served as recipients. Maestri et al. suggested that portal vein transfusion of donor-specific DCs is the optimal route [30]. After anesthesia with 10% chloric aldehyde, the mice were placed in the supine position and the abdominal was surgically opened. The imDC (1610 7 in 0.5 mL) or mCTLA4-Ig suspension (10 mg) was infused into the liver of mice via the portal vein using a 23-gauge needle. The following day, porcine islets (600-800 IEQ) were transplanted into the renal subcapsular space of the unilateral kidneys of the mice [29,31]. The experimental mice were then randomly divided into seven groups (n = 15 per group). \n\nIn vivo experimental protocol was as follows: \n\n1) Islet xenotransplantation performed with inhibition of the direct pathway of T-cell activation.",

However, the donor organ is limited. Porcine islets are the best alternative source to overcome this limitation, and pig-to-nonhuman primate (NHP) naked islet xenotrans- plantation studies are being performed worldwide. Several studies including our own have presented successful proof-of-concept results based on immunosuppression regimen including the anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody. Particularly, long-term control of diabetes by adult porcine islet transplantation has been demonstrated in five consecu tive monkeys, and the longest survival was ~1000 days after transplantation. Currently, pig-to-NHP islet xenotransplantation based on clinically applicable immunosuppression regimen is being pursued. In this chapter, we will describe all the procedures of pig-to-NHP naked islet xenotransplantation: (1) the porcine islet isolation from designated pathogen-free (DPF) miniature pigs, (2) diabetes induction in monkeys, (3) transplantation procedure via the portal vein, (4) immune monitoring comprising humoral and cellular immunity after porcine islet transplantation, and finally (5) liver biopsy and sub sequent immunohistochemical procedure in detail.",

            "text": "Many groups examined the usefulness of immunosuppressants including cyclosporine using islet allotransplanted dog [108][109][110] and pig models [111]. Pancreatomized diabetic large animals were also used for studies about bioartificial pancreas (i.e., islet encapsulation technology using high molecular compound to prevent from immune attack) in allo-and xenotransplantation [112][113][114][115][116][117][118]. Large pancreatomized animal models for islet transplantation, including pig, dog, and monkey, are considered preclinical models and tend to be selected for evaluating some treatments in the clinical setting. One of the recent uses of pancreatomized models is to assess \u03b2 cell regeneration after pancreatectomy. Pancreatectomy over 70% induces some pancreatic regeneration-related factors like pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) and neurogenin-3 (Ngn3), which contribute to the regeneration of \u03b2 cells in rodent models [119][120][121]. Recently, Jung and colleagues revealed that the regeneration of \u03b2 cells could be detected in the remnant pancreas of BALB/c mice with 70% pancreatectomy, and the effect of regeneration was more prominent in pancreatomized mice with islet autotransplantation [122]. It is interesting that islet masses in remnant pancreas were increased with greater expression of Ngn3 and BrdU (a proliferation marker) and lower expression of TUNEL (an apoptosis marker) in pancreatomized mice with islet autotransplantation compared to pancreatomized mice without transplantation. They concluded that insulin released from transplanted islets has a role in the induction of islet proliferation and antiapoptotic effects on remnant islets. Pancreatomized animal is an old diabetic model, but is still important and useful for preclinical trials on islets transplantation and for understanding the mechanism of DM, including islet regeneration.",

            "text": "Definitive evaluation of composite I-K transplantation in a pigto-NHP model also requires a control: independent kidney and free islet transplantation. Negative controls were present in previous studies of composite IK technologiesin pig-to-pig, baboon-tobaboon, and macaque-to-macaque modelsand demonstrated preservation of islets with composite I-K transplantation across allogeneic barriers. In the past year, due to lack of inbred or cloned source pigs, we tested an alternative strategy for combined islet and kidney transplantation across a xenogeneic barrier that would also serve as a control of the composite I-K strategy. This alternative approach involves delayed islet transplantation after kidney and vascularized thymus transplantation (role of vascularized thymus transplantation in the induction of tolerance across xenogeneic barriers reviewed in (28)), using a recipient size-matched kidney and thymus source pig, as well as a large source pig for islets. Notably this approach (without thymus co-transplantation) is also similar to recent work in human islet-after-kidney transplantation conducted by the CIT consortium. Although additional cases are required, we have achieved reversal of diabetes and life-supporting renal function for 180 days with this kidney-first sequential islet and kidney xenotransplantation (52). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of maintenance of durable normoglycemia and stable creatinine with porcine kidney and islets in a diabetic and life-supporting pig-to-baboon combined kidney, vascularized thymus and islet xenotransplantation model. These preliminary results were recently presented at the International Xenotransplantation Association Congress (San Diego, 2023), and are described in detail in the following sections:",

            "text": "The ultimate goal to provide a cure for all patients suffering from type-1-diabetes has remained out of the patients reach despite major advances in technologies. There has however, for a number of decades been a concerted effort to use various forms of por- cine \u03b2-cells as a replacement transplant alternative to cadaveric human donors. This has seen major advances in the last decade with significant development of multi-transgenic donor pigs that now can potentially be used for xenotransplantation. This has been achieved with cellular transplants leading the way using porcine islet cell transplants as a form of \u03b2 cell replacement in pre-clinical studies to treat diabetic non-human primates in various guises. These uniquely modified islet cells have the potential to offer an unlimited source of insulin-producing cells once we have solved all of the issues required to prevent loss of the xenotransplant. This chapter provides an in depth over - view as to how the most recent advances have been achieved in regards to the genetic modification of donor pigs to provide protection from hyperacute rejection, instant blood mediated inflammatory reaction, xenoantibody and cellular responses to provide long-term functional islet cell xenotransplants to be able to move islet cell xenotrans- plantation to the clinic.",

This review focuses on genetic modification strategies aimed to overcome remaining hurdles standing in the way of clinical porcine islet transplantation and to develop neural cell xenotransplantation.Recent FindingsIn addition to previously described genetic modifications aimed to mitigate hyperacute rejection, instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction, and cell-mediated rejection, new data showing the possibility of increasing porcine islet insulin secretion by transgenesis is an interesting addition to the array of genetically modified pigs available for xenotransplantation. Moreover, combining multiple modifications is possible today thanks to new, improved genomic editing tools.SummaryGenetic modification of large animals, pigs in particular, has come a long way during the last decade. These modifications can help minimize immunological and physiological incompatibilities between porcine and human cells, thus allowing for better tolerance and function of xenocells.",

At first, the Seoul group conducted 68 porcine islet isolation to identify important parameters for successful islet isolation. The pigs with a mean age 25 months, median age of 24.3 months and a mean weight of 88 kg were used. The number of male and female pigs was the same. The male pigs were bred without castration. The complete pregnancy related history was recorded for the female pigs. The general condition of all pigs was carefully examined and noted. After transfer to the operative unit a week before operation, the pigs' adaptation to their new environment was monitored by observing their feeding by a veterinarian. \n\nThey divided the isolation outcomes based on islet yield, then compared the outcomes between high yield group and low yield group. The total islet yield in high yield group was 304,962 \u00b1 25,014 IEQ and in low yield group was 142,672 \u00b1 12,493 IEQ. They identified good or moderate pancreatic distention with collagenase, older age (>2yr), and male gender are significant parameters to obtain high total islet yield 22 . \n\nThe group demonstrated long-term control of diabetes in immunosuppressed nonhuman primate by the transplantation of adult porcine islets 23 . The immunosuppression protocol is shown in Table 5. \n\nIn addition to immunosuppression, they used cobra venom factor and anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody to reduce instant blood mediate reaction (IBMIR). For induction immunosuppression, they used anti-thymoglobulin, for maintenance immunosuppression they used sirolimus. Three out of five cases, they used own Treg as shown in Table 5. They transplanted 81,000 IEQ/kg in the first case and 100,000 IEQ/kg in all the other cases. The diabetic nonhuman primates could maintain an insulin free status more than 603 days in the first case, 167 days in the second case, 512 days in the third case, 303 days in the fourth case, and 180 days in the fifth case.",

            "text": "Diabetes causes several complications in patients, which burden health care systems. Allogeneic islet transplantation could improve physiological glucose metabolism [1]. However, the number of available human donor organs has not kept pace with the growing transplant candidate waiting lists, and a significant number of these patients die without receiving transplants [2]. This allotransplantation issue has stimulated research on the induction of insulin-producing cells and bioengineering. An alternate approach is the use of living cells, tissues, or organs from another species as donors. The concept of cross-species transplantation is known as xenotransplantation, and the transplanted cells, tissues, or organs are called xenografts. Xenotransplantation is an attractive option to overcome the issue of donor shortage [3,4]. \n\nPigs have been selected as the most suitable potential source of organs for xenotransplantation, because there are many similarities between humans and pigs, including similarities related to physiology and anatomy [5,6]. Additionally, porcine and human insulin differ by only one amino acid, and porcine insulin has been used for several decades in clinics. Pigs are widely available in many countries, are easily bred, and are known to have large litters. Additionally, ethical issues associated with the slaughter of nonhuman primates do not exist. Moreover, ethical and regulatory frameworks for islet xenotransplantation are present in several countries, and now, there is a greater awareness of the importance of developing an internationally harmonized ethical and regulatory framework [7]. Thus, pig-to-human xenotransplantation offers a potential bridge to the growing disparity between graft requirement among patients with diabetes and graft availability [3,4]. Indeed, islet transplantation from porcine pancreas was performed for the first time in the 1990s [8]. The International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) launched a consensus statement in 2009 on conditions for safely undertaking clinical trials of porcine islet products in patients with type 1 diabetes [9]. This statement covers the key aspects of ethical requirements. Recently, clinical porcine islet xenotransplantation was restarted under comprehensive regulations in New Zealand [10].",

            "text": "An ongoing study with major implications for islet xenotransplantation is being carried out by CG Park and colleagues at the Seoul National University in Korea, where they have successfully maintained normoglycemia in diabetic primates after pig islet transplantation for >600 days (76). \n\nOne common thread between these successful long-term pig to nonhuman primate islet studies is their use of an anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb) based immunosuppression to prevent rejection. Despite evidence that anti-CD154mAb can be effective and safe in pig to nonhuman primate models of islet transplantation (77), it has been associated with thromboembolic complications in humans and is not clinically translatable. Although very promising data are emerging on the use of anti-CD40 antibodies (costimulation blockers) in organ xenotransplantation (78,79), the islet xenotransplantation community is still searching for a clinically translatable immunosuppression that can successfully prevent rejection without excessive side effects. New technology for targeted genome editing, notably clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9), offers hope that more genetic manipulations of pig islets may improve compatibility between host and donor to the point that rejection may be successfully controlled with the use of a previously untenable immunosuppression. The field of islet xenotransplantation is steadily advancing and may be approaching a critical mass of experience and technique to begin clinical trials soon (80). Islet encapsulation is another advanced method of islet transplantation in which isolated islets of either human or pig origin can be transplanted without the need for toxic immunosuppression. This would prove to be especially beneficial for pig islet xenotransplantation. The encapsulation of islets with a semi-permeable barrier that allows the exchange of nutrients and hormones including insulin while maintaining immune-isolation would overcome one of the chief obstacles of xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "A STZdiabetic rat can be rendered normoglycemic lifelong with no exogenous insulin requirement by transplantation of 5 -8 pig pancreatic primordia. Extrapolating, it would take 100 -200 primordia to render a diabetic macaque independent of exogenous insulin. A second explanation is proposed by Graham and Schuurman in their recent review of the usefulness and limitations of the diabetic macaque model in evaluating long-term survival of porcine islets [16]. The authors propose that there are three main contributors to the mild hyperglycemia that is common in xenografted diabetic non-human primates: 1) species incompatibilitiesunderlying a lower insulin secretion rate by the porcine graft; 2) the set point in insulinsecretion that is at higher blood glucose levels in pigs than in monkeys; and 3) a marginal mass of engrafted islets. The authors speculate the mild hyperglycemia observed in transplanted diabetic primates might not be of high relevance when considering the use of porcine islet transplantation in human diabetics. This is because humans and pigs have normal fasting blood glucose values in a similar range while in primates, the values are much lower. Additionally, the authors suggest, if the intrinsic insulin-producing capacity of porcine islets is lower than that of human islets, the effective dose of porcine islets may need to need to be increased. A similar argument could apply to the \"effective dose\" of porcine pancreatic primordia, in which case more than 100 -200 may be required to render a diabetic macaque independent of exogenous insulin. Alternatively, unlike the case for mature islets, beta cell precursors in transplanted embryonic pancreas have the potential to differentiate into a mass of mature insulin-producing cells sufficient to render a diabetic host euglycemic. A single native embryonic pancreas does so in every non-diabetic pig, primate or human. Future efforts are appropriately directed to engineering transplanted pig pancreatic primordia towards more robust differentiation within the in vivo bioreactor that is the diabetic host.",

            "text": "Type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Present methods for treating IDDM, including insulin administration and antidiabetic drugs, are not effective in preventing adverse complications, especially long-term complications (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group, 1993). Replacing pancreatic endocrine tissue via islet transplantation is a physiological approach to particular restoration of hyperglycemia in IDDM patients (Narang and Mahato, 2006). Segmental pancreatic grafts obviate the need for exogenous insulin and postpone development of glomerular lesions in diabetic patients. However, the supply of donor organs is clearly a significant limitation of allotransplantation. To overcome this supply problem, microencapsulated islet cells from pigs are currently under consideration for xenotransplantation (Shapiro et al., 2000;Ryan et al., 2001Ryan et al., , 2002)). The shortage of pancreases from human donors remains a primary obstacle to routine use of islet transplants as a treatment option (Brunicardi and Mullen, 1994). Furthermore, the desire to transplant microencapsulated islet tissue without need for immunosuppression has resulted in the development of immunoisolation devices (Lim and Sun, 1980;Rayat et al., 1999). Islets encapsulation is a frequently explored immunoisolation approach. For decades, IDDM patients have been using porcine insulin (Krickhahn et al., 2002). The pig is currently regarded as an ideal source for microencapsulated islet cells for clinical xenotransplantation (Rayat et al., 1999). Therefore, isolating viable and functional porcine islet cells is a critical issue. \n\nPorcine pancreatic islets may be a potential source for islet xenografts for diabetic patients because of following reasons. Firstly, pig insulin has been used in humans for patients with diabetes mellitus for a long time (Krickhahn et al., 2002).",

            "text": "On account of similar autoimmune responses that cause islet damage/loss between spontaneous type 1 diabetic animals and human T1DM, these diabetic animals are regarded as useful and reliable models for clearly elucidating the pathogenesis of T1DM, for comprehensively analyzing the induction of immune suppression/tolerance in islet transplantation, and for effectively translating the experimental findings into clinical islet transplantation in diabetic patients. Nevertheless, there is very low incidence of spontaneous T1DM in NHPs (also lower than the incidence of spontaneous type 2 diabetes), and the time course of diabetes progression is extensive too [30]. Nowadays, the most commonly used spontaneous type 1 diabetic animals are biobreeding (BB) rat and nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice [98,99]. The autoimmunity of NOD mice is characterized by several abnormalities in the immune system including the presence of pancreasspecific autoantibodies, autoreactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and defects in T regulatory cells [100,101], which also appear in T1DM patients and rarely exist in surgical/STZ-induced NHP models of IDDM. In order to successfully perform clinical islet transplantation, it is essential to control the allo-, xeno-, and autoimmunity. The NOD mice represent the suitable models for dissecting tolerance mechanisms and assessing influences of different types of immunity in islet transplantation [102][103][104][105]. And obtained experimental results are the important improvements and supplements to the preclinical findings in diabetic NHPs. Finally, the combined data will roundly evaluate the immunosuppressive strategies and further promote immune tolerance in the future clinical islet transplantation. Additionally, in order to clarify and improve the translational value of preclinical trials of islet transplantation, other intrinsic limitations in the NPH models of DM should also be considered, especially in pig-to-NHPs islet xenotransplantation [106].

            "text": "With the increasingly promising results from both clinical islet allotransplantation and experimental islet xenotransplantation, we can be cautiously optimistic that genetically engineered pigs will provide islets in sufficient numbers to allow treatment of T1D within years rather than decades. Just as with allotransplantation, patients with episodes of severe hypoglycemia or patients with stable kidney grafts probably would be the first candidates. However, problems associated with IBMIR need to be overcome, either by further genetic manipulation of the pig islets, therapy with drugs that reduce its severity, or identification of a successful alternative site for islet transplantation. \n\nAgainst this backdrop, it should be stressed that the need for intensive, long-term immunosuppressive therapy needs to be reduced. This might be achieved by successful encapsulation or by further genetic engineering of the pig that will provide at least some local \"endogenous\" protection from the T cell immune response. The more that the pig islets can be genetically manipulated in this respect, the less exogenous immunosuppressive therapy will be required. \n\nWe suggest that the transplantation of islets from GTKO/ hCD46/pCTLA4-Ig Ins /TFPI Ins /hCD39 Ins pigs combined with an effective, clinically applicable immunosuppressive regimen (e.g., induction alemtuzumab and maintenance tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, which is currently associated with favorable results after clinical islet allotransplantation [3]) may be sufficiently successful in an NHP model to fulfill published criteria for a clinical trial (9). Results of such studies of NHPs should be available within the next 18 months. If the results do not fulfill the criteria for a clinical trial, then testing of pigs with further genetic modification, for example, expression of heme oxygenase-1, and alternative immunosuppressive regimens will be required.",

            "text": "Progress made in human islet transplantation in the past 15 years has made commonplace the restoration of nearnormoglycemia, insulin independence, and protection from severe hypoglycemia with a low risk of procedural complications in immunosuppressed T1D recipients. 49 These favorable outcomes can now be achieved in single-donor islet transplant recipients, both with refined induction therapy 94 and calcineurin inhibitor-sparing maintenance immunosuppression. 95,96 Increasing evidence indicates that insulin independence can be maintained in more than 50% of recipients for 5 years 50 and that islet transplants have slow progression of microvascular complications. 97 Improving human islet allotransplant efficacy and safety outcomes have inspired investigators to develop more widely available cell-based diabetes therapies. Preclinical safety and efficacy data obtained in the last 10 years in the stringent pig-to-nonhuman primate (NHP) islet transplant setting, [98][99][100][101][102][103][104][105][106][107][108][109] and preliminary safety data obtained in recent pilot clinical trials, 110 suggest that xenogeneic pig islets can possibly be developed into an islet \u03b2-cell replacement therapy with broad applicability. However, several hurdles remain to be overcome.\n\nIn the preclinical pig-to-NHP model (Table 1), several groups have achieved insulin independence for longer than 180 days with near-physiologic control of fasted and postprandial glucose in a small number of NHP after porcine islet xenotransplantation.

            "text": "Pancreatomized animals are one of the oldest models for DM. This model was considered to be and used as a type 1 DM model because of the elimination of the pancreatic \u03b2 cells. The difference between this model and type 1 DM is the stability of the blood glucose: the type 1 DM model has a deficiency of insulin release but preservation of other hormonal functions that act to increase the blood glucose (i.e., glucagon). Pancreatomized diabetic animals have been used as islet autotransplantation models. Minnesota group performed pancreatectomy and islet autotransplantation in pigs in 1976 [93]. This group also performed islet autotransplantation of pancreatomized dogs and succeeded in achieving normoglycemia at the same time [39]. After their success, many experimental models of total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation using dogs were published in the 1970s and proved the effectiveness of the treatment [94][95][96]. These findings contributed to clinical trials of total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation for chronic pancreatitis [97]. Large pancreatomized animal models have also been used for the evaluation of cryopreserved islets [98][99][100][101] and optimal transplant sites [102][103][104][105][106][107]. Large pancreatomized diabetic animal models have been used not only for islet autotransplantation studies but also for allotransplant studies. Many groups examined the usefulness of immunosuppressants including cyclosporine using islet allotransplanted dog [108][109][110] and pig models [111].",

While these differences between outcomes of preclinical and clinical xenogeneic islet transplantation may be partly explained by differences in the immunosuppression regimens used in the clinical trialsnotably, CD40/CD40L costimulatory blockade, which has been critical to success in most preclinical studies, was not utilizedfurther trials have been limited by more recent consensus guidelines outlining an international framework to promote standardized clinical translation of pig-to-human islet transplantation from source pig development and manufacturing to patient monitoring (22). \n\nMoreover, in the many years since these clinical studies in islet xenotransplantation were conducted, the landscape of diabetes management has changed. Patients with diabetes have other options for durable disease management. Innovations in glucose monitoring and the rapid development of hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery systems have improved quality of life for patients living with diabetes (23), and ongoing clinical trials of novel stem-cell derived islet cell therapy have published early and highly promising results (24). However, porcine islet xenotransplantation remains a compelling therapeutic possibility for patients with diabetic nephropathy who need both kidney and islet replacement. In these patients, there are minimal added risks associated with islet transplantation, as these patients are already on immunosuppression for their kidney grafts; in fact, islets may help protect against premature kidney graft loss associated with diabetes (25) as well as improve long-term vascular diabetic outcomes (26). Here, we will briefly highlight immunologic barriers in porcine islet transplantation, chronicle preclinical progress in the field, and summarize our own experience in combined islet and kidney transplantation, using both 1) vascularized islets in an islet-kidney composite graft, and 2) our more recent strategy of sequential kidney followed by islet xenotransplantation.",

In these studies, islet cells from genetically engineered pigs have been transplanted into various animal models where they have had diabetes induced and are transplanted to potentially restore insulin production. For decades there have also been a significant number of early attempts with both free and encapsulated islets to treat human patients suffering from Type 1 diabetes (55, 56). These have had variable results and no study to date has shown significant change or complete resolution of the recipient's diabetic state. This has been due to the use in the most part of wild type pig islets rather than purpose developed and bred transgenic pigs (55, 56). However, results from preclinical xeno-islet trials have shown great promise in improving glucose control in non-human-primates establishing it as a potential therapeutic modality for treating diabetic patients (13).",

Previous studies suggested that German Landrace and Large White pigs appeared to be more suitable islet donor breeds than Duroc, Pietrain, Hampshire, Belgium Landrace, local farmers (hybrid), and wild-type pigs (42,43). The German Landraces showed the highest numbers of large islets (150 \u00b5m) and islet volume density (%) (43). In contrast, Heiser et al. reported that Pietrain pig could produce more islet yields than purebred German Landrace, Munich minipig \"Troll,\" and hybrid pigs (44). The variability of results in different laboratories was possibly related to alterations in islet isolation and preparation procedure. Recently, very high islet yields (up to 9,589 \u00b1 2,838 IEQ/g pancreas) with large size and well-function were harvested from adult Chicago Medical School (CMS) miniature pigs (45). The CMS miniature pigs can be bred under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. All these making this pig breed potentially a better donor candidate for future clinical islet xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "Islet transplantation shows great promise for treating type 1 diabetes, with advancements such as the Edmonton protocol and FDA approval of donislecel indicating its growing acceptance [1][2][3]. As of 2022, an impressive 94 institutions and 5 networks have been identified as performing islet allotransplantation [4,5]. However, there are several challenges that hinder the widespread use of islet transplantation, such as a shortage of donor organs, ischemic conditions at the transplantation site, and immune reactions to foreign islets [6,7]. \n\nTo address these problems, two main directions of research are being developed: increasing the number of islets [8][9][10] or finding new sources of insulin-producing cells [11][12][13][14], including the promising application of islet xenotransplantation [11,[15][16][17][18][19], and improving transplantation efficiency through alternative sites [12], enhanced oxygen delivery to transplanted islets [20], the use of drugs to increase beta cell activity [21], or the use of decellularized matrices to support islets [12,22]. In parallel, studies on new immunological approaches [23] and the development of innovative encapsulation methods for immunoisolation [24] are being carried out. \n\nAnimal islets serve as models for research and alternative insulin sources, with the donors primarily being mice, rats, pigs, and primates [25][26][27][28]. While rats and mice are common in studies [29], primates closely model human diabetes [18,30], and pigs are used both in research and clinically, particularly in xenotransplantation techniques developed in Asian countries [11,15,17,31,32]. However, the use of rabbits is rare in modern studies of type 1 diabetes. \n\nRabbits have been used in laboratory research on type 1 diabetes and islet isolation, but to a much more limited extent compared to other animals. Research on islet isolation and transplantation in rabbits remains rare, despite their large size and ease of maintenance [33][34][35].",

One of the greatest barriers to this technique is the low number of pancreas donors and the low number of pancreases that are available for transplantation. Rodent models have been chosen in most studies of islet rejection and type 1 diabetes prevention to evaluate the quality and function of isolated human islets and to identify alternative solutions to the problem of islet scarcity. The purpose of this study is to conduct a review of islet xenotransplantation experiments from humans to rodents, to organize and analyze the parameters of these experiments, to describe trends in experimental modeling and to assess the viability of this procedure. In this study, we reviewed recently published research regarding islet xenotransplantation from humans to rodents, and we summarized the findings and organized the relevant data. The included studies were recent reports that involved xenotransplantation using human islets in a rodent model. We excluded the studies that related to isotransplantation, autotransplantation and allotransplantation. A total of 34 studies that related to xenotransplantation were selected for review based on their relevance and current data. Advances in the use of different graft sites may overcome autoimmunity and rejection after transplantation, which may solve the problem of the scarcity of islet donors in patients with type 1 diabetes.",

            "text": "In the research setup, two main models have been used to evaluate efficacy of porcine islets in treating or alleviating chemically-or surgically-induced type-I diabetes: pig-to-non-human primate and pig-to-rodent. While both models have their pros and cons, they both represent a particularly challenging environment for porcine islets. As discussed earlier, non-human primates have higher insulin requirements than both pigs and humans [4] while rodent insulin differs substantially from its porcine counterpart [29] lessening efficacy of the latter in mice and rats. Therefore, one could expect porcine islets to underperform in both cases. This is particularly exemplified by the extremely large number of islets that are necessary to exert an effect in such experiments. Nonetheless, several studies have reported successful long-term reversal of diabetes following transplantation of free [30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37] or encapsulated [38][39][40] porcine islets in preclinical non-human primate models. \n\nAs indicated in Table 1, transplanted islet dose ranged from 10,000 to 100,000 IEQ/kg recipient body weight when using adult pigs as islet donors and 9,000 to 115,000 when using islets from neonatal piglets. Free islets are usually injected in the portal vein, thus mimicking clinical practice in human islet allotransplantation but exposing islets to IBMIR known to cause substantial early islet mass loss and impaired secretory function due to mitochondrial damage in surviving islets [41]. On the other hand, encapsulated islets are transplanted subcutaneously or in the peritoneal space where the main limitation is oxygenation [39] and access to nutrients during the critical period between implantation and graft vascularization. \n\nImmunosuppression whether administered systemically to the recipient and/or created locally by means of genetic modification to the donor cells can help alleviate IBMIR and other immune rejection mechanisms [42] therefore improving transplantation outcome and even decreasing the number of islets required for efficient diabetes reversal [37].",

Female adult pigs that have produced >2 litters (retired breeders, usually >2 years old and > 200 kg) are preferred over young adult pigs because they consistently provide a higher yield of high-quality islets (3,11). We add the ref: Bottino R, 2007 Our previous review summarized the above advantages (3). Using GMP-grade collagenase (collagenase AF-1 and liberase MTF C/T), one adult pig can yield up to 720,000IEQ (12), which is enough for islet xenotransplantation in a diabetic patient of approximately 60kg in weight. However, the limitations of adult pig islets include difficulty in isolation, higher costs for pig maintenance and islet isolation, and poor proliferative capacity (3) (Table 1).",

            "text": "raft.\n\nIn parallel with developments in islet allotransplantation, scientists have also begun to experiment with porcine islets. Just over a century after Watson Williams attempted to transplant ovine pancreatic tissue, researchers have revived xenotransplantation as a possible therapy to cure diabetes and other conditions. Porcine islets have been sourced from fetal, neonatal and adult pigs. Source pigs may be wild-type or genetically modified. Pigs are an ideal source of islet cells because they are readily available, breed quickly, produce large litters and display insulin secretion patterns comparable to those found in humans (Liu and Harlan 2008). Porcine insulin was used to treat diabetics for many decades. The hyper-acute rejection of pig tissue may be ameliorated through cloning and genetic modification. Though pigs are generally the preferred source animal, researchers have also experimented with islet cells from other species including cows, rabbit and fish (Mihalicz et al. 2011). By comparison to non-human primates, pigs pose less disease risks and less ethical concerns since they are lower on the evolutionary scale (Boneva and Folks 2004).\n\nThe first islet xenotransplantation clinical trial was performed by Carl-Gustav Groth, the former Chief Physician of Transplant Surgery at Karolinska University Hospital, in Huddinge, Sweden. Though Groth first conceived of the idea in the mid-70s, it was not until the 1990s that he performed his clinical trial. Between 1990 and 1993, Groth treated ten participants with islet cells from porcine foetuses (Groth et al. 1994). The pig cells were either transplanted into the kidney capsule or infused into the intra-portal vein. A subsequent kidney biopsy identified viable islet cells and a related hormone called glucagon indicating insulin secretion. Though the trial did not lead to any reductions in the participant's insulin requirements, it did offer valuable preliminary data on graft function and indication of long term survival of porcine cells in the human body. Two years later, another team of Swedish scientist attempted to treat two dialysis patients with animal external therapy. Patient blood was circulated through pig kidneys for over an hour before it was returned to the patient's body (Hanson 2011).\n\nGroth's",

            "text": "NPIs clearly express xenoantigens including sialic acid antigens, Hanganutziu-Deicher (H-D) antigens, and Gal\u03b11-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc-R (\u03b1-Gal) epitopes (30). However, with the development of genetic engineering technology, stable gene transferred NPIs can therefore effectively attenuate the xenoantigenicity (30)(31)(32). In pig-islet xenotransplantation, several studies suggested that cell numbers in the range of 25,000-100,000 islet equivalents (IEQ)/kg recipient body weight were required to achieve insulin independence in diabetic NHPs (13,16,(33)(34)(35). Usually, after in vitro culture, tissue from one neonate pancreas yields about 50,000 NPI aggregates (24); thus, at least four neonate pig donors are required to treat a diabetic primate weighing 6-8 kg. \n\nAdult pig is regarded as the major donor source of islet xenografts, which can supply a sufficient number of viable islet cells and start functioning immediately after transplantation. More than 255,000 adult pig islets (APIs) with high purity (80-95%) can be isolated from an adult pig donor (36). Furthermore, published study also reported an extremely high APIs yield, up to 800,000 IEQ per pancreas after purification (37). The achievements make it possible to perform single pig donor clinical xenogeneic transplantation. Additionally, in comparison with young pig (<6 months) pancreas, a great number of large (150-200 \u00b5m) and well-structured islets can be obtained from adult pig donors (38)(39)(40). In large islets, the centralized structure for both collagen and capillaries could reduce enzymatic digestion-induced islet damage and subsequently facilitate post-transplant revascularization (38,41). Consequently, APIs possess a better potential for cellular engraftment in xenotransplantation. \n\nThe breed and strain of donor pigs have a vital impact on the outcome of islet isolation.",

For example, organs are in short supply; several human pancreas donors are often needed to treat one diabetic recipient; the intrahepatic site may not be the most appropriate site for islet implantation; and immunosuppressive regimens, which are associated with side effects, are often required to prolong survival of the islet graft. An alternative source of insulin-producing cells would therefore be of major interest. Pigs represent a possible alternative source of beta cells. Grafting of pig islets may appear difficult because of the immunologic species barrier, but pig islets have been shown to function in primates for at least 6 mo with clinically incompatible immunosuppression. Therefore, a bioartificial pancreas made of encapsulated pig islets may resolve issues associated with islet allotransplantation. Although several groups have shown that encapsulated pig islets are functional in small-animal models, less is known about the use of bioartificial pancreases in large-animal models. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of encapsulated pig islets, to determine obstacles to implantation in humans and possible solutions to overcome these obstacles.",

            "text": "Dogs and pigs are the large animal models used for translational studies in research on obesity and diabetes mellitus [22,23]. The canine model is especially powerful in allowing quantification of liver glucose uptake; researchers can induce diabetes mellitus in dogs with pancreatectomy or with the use of alloxan and/or streptozotocin (STZ) [24,25]. In these models, metabolic defects are evident in all of them, including increased visceral, subcutaneous, and total adipose tissue mass, increased IR and a \u03b2-cell defect. The dog model also provides invasive measures and assessments impossible in humans or rodent models, particularly for studies involving oral administration of compounds because canine gastrointestinal anatomy and physiology are highly similar to those of human beings. The pig is another large animal model used for diabetes mellitus; it shares the structure and function of the gastrointestinal tract, the development and morphology of the pancreas, and overall metabolic status with humans [26]. Genetic engineering of pigs represents an approach for diabetes mellitus research, including transgenic pigs expressing a dominant-negative glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) [27] and ubiquitous expression of a dominant-negative human hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b1 (HNF1A) [28]. High fat and cholesterol (HFC) diets with or without STZ have been adapted for the establishment of pig models for T2D [29,30]. While pigs are increasingly used as models for obesity and diabetes mellitus research, dogs remain an important model in this field.",

Islets from 7- and 10-day-old pigs showed significantly better function both in vitro and in vivo compared to islets from 3- and 5-day-old pigs however, the islet yield from 10-day-old pigs were significantly less than those obtained from the other pigs. Since islets from 3-day-old pigs were used in our previous studies and islets from 7-day-old pigs reversed diabetes more efficiently than islets from other groups, we further evaluated the function of these islets post-transplantation. B6 rag-/- mouse recipients of various numbers of islets from 7-day-old pigs achieved normoglycemia faster and showed significantly improved response to glucose challenge compared to the recipients of the same numbers of islets from 3-day-old pigs. These results are in line with the findings that islets from 7-day-old pigs showed reduced voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) channel activity and their ability to recover from post-hypoxia/reoxygenation stress. Despite more resident immune cells and immunogenic characteristics detected in islets from 7-day-old pigs compared to islets from 3-day-old pigs, the combination of anti-LFA-1 and anti-CD154 monoclonal antibodies are equally effective at preventing the rejection of islets from both age groups of pigs. Collectively, these results suggest that islets from various ages of neonatal pigs vary in yield, cellular composition, and function. Such parameters may be considered when defining the optimal pancreas donor for islet xenotransplantation studies.",

Fetal and neonatal pig islets have the higher expression of GAL and will be more susceptible to xenorejection than adult pig islets [28,29].

            "text": "Xenotransplantation of pig islets has proven equally effective as human islets in preclinical trials; therefore, scientists are striving hard to make this approach a clinical reality. The idea of pig islet transplantation may overcome the shortage of good-quality islets. Strong immune suppression with xeno-antigens and IBMIR is a major challenge faced by pig islets' transplantation in preclinical studies. Extensive gene editing by user-friendly CRISPR-Cas9 system promises to rewrite the bright future of pig islet transplantation by developing IBMIR-resistant islets. Though ideal biocompatible material is still a matter of debate, encapsulation techniques offer overall protection of islets from the recipient's immune system. Several preclinical trials of encapsulated pig islets are underway with some promising results. Excitingly, 9.5year survival of encapsulated neonatal pig islets in a human trial in Auckland has been reported (76). Meanwhile, the groundbreaking work of Alireza Rezania, DA Anderson, and D Melton have leveraged the use of stage 7 (functional) beta cells to cure T1D. Contrary to pig islets, encapsulated SC-derived b cells equivalent to 10,000 IEq/kg of T1D patients might overt T1D with the minimal use of immunosuppressant if derived from iPSCs obtained from the same T1D patient (Table 5). \n\nIn conclusion, SC beta cells for the treatment of T1D increase quality-adjusted life years (115, 117) and prevent complications, although a reduction in manufacturing costs will be essential to achieve cost-effectiveness. By scaling up the manufacturing, as promised, facilitating the supply chain management, and reducing the manufacturing costs, iPSCbased b cell replacement therapies may become a tangible reality.",

            "text": "Type 1 diabetes has been treated successfully by transplanting islets of Langerhans, the endocrine tissue that releases insulin [1] . Despite the clinical efficacy of islet transplantation, serious issues preclude its broad clinical application, including the side effects of chronic immunosuppressive regimens and a shortage of human donors. For example, it was recently estimated that only one pancreas is available per 333 patients with type 1 diabetes in the United States [2] . This situation is aggravated by the need of each recipient undergoing transplantation for 2-4 pancreases [1,3] . This shortage of pancreas donors therefore justifies the search for alternative sources of insulin-producing cells. Swine appear to be the major candidates for islet procurement because: (1) humans have been treated with porcine insulin for > 40 years (pig and human insulin differ by only one amino acid); \n\n(2) pigs have large litters with offspring that rapidly attain adult size and are therefore amenable to genetic engineering; (3) pig pancreases contain large islets that respond to glucose stimulation; and (4) since pigs are widely bred and slaughtered for food, the use of their islets to restore human health may be an option that could satisfy sociocultural and ethical concerns [4][5][6] . \n\nUnlike primarily vascularized organs, pancreatic islets are implanted without direct connection to the host vascular network, with 7 to 14 d needed to re-establish blood flow [7][8][9][10][11][12] . Thus, it was thought that pig islet xenografts could escape typical hyperacute rejection and acute vascular rejection [13] . In vivo, however, pig islets in nonimmunosuppressed nonhuman primates are rejected by both humoral and cellular immune reactions [14][15][16] . Diffuse, presumably nonspecific IgG deposits were observed within islet-associated accumulations of platelets 12 h after transplantation. Deposits of large amounts of IgM and moderate to large amounts of C3, C5, and C9 were present on islet surfaces 2 to 3 d after xenografting [15][16][17] .",

Despite improvements in delivering exogenous insulin to T1D patients, pancreas or islet transplantation remains the best way to regulate their glycaemia. Results from experimental islet transplantation have improved dramatically in the last 15 years, to the point where it can be comparable to pancreas transplantation, but without the accompanying morbidity associated with this procedure. As with other transplants, the limiting factor in islet allotransplantation is the relatively small number of organs made available by deceased human donors throughout the world. A strong case can be made for islet xenotransplantation to fill the gap between supply and demand; however, transplantation across species presents challenges that are unique to that setting. In the search for the most suitable animal for human xenotransplantation, the pig has many advantages that make it the likely animal of choice. Potentially one of the most beneficial advantages is the ability to genetically engineer porcine donors to be more compatible with human recipients. Several genetic manipulations have already proven useful in relation to hyperacute rejection and inflammation (instant blood mediated inflammatory reaction), with the potential of even further advancement in the near future.",

Current efforts are focused on identifying the optimal pig islet source and overcoming the immunological barrier. The optimal age of the pig donors remains controversial since both adult and neonatal pig islets have advantages. Isolation of adult islets using GMP grade collagenase has significantly improved the quantity and quality of adult islets, but neonatal islets can be isolated at a much lower cost. Certain culture media and coculture with mesenchymal stromal cells facilitate neonatal islet maturation and function. Genetic modification in pigs affords a promising strategy to prevent rejection. Deletion of expression of the three known carbohydrate xenoantigens (Gal, Neu5Gc, Sda) will certainly be beneficial in pig organ transplantation in humans, but this is not yet proven in islet transplantation, though the challenge of the \u20184th xenoantigen\u2019 may prove problematic in nonhuman primate models. Blockade of the CD40/CD154 costimulation pathway leads to long-term islet graft survival (of up to 965 days). Anti-CD40mAbs have already been applied in phase II clinical trials of islet allotransplantation. Fc region-modified anti-CD154mAbs successfully prevent the thrombotic complications reported previously. In this review, we discuss (I) the optimal age of the islet-source pig, (ii) progress in genetic modification of pigs, (iii) the immunosuppressive regimen for pig islet xenotransplantation, and (iv) the reduction in the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction.",

To alleviate the scarcity of donors, islet xenotransplantation offers exciting prospects. The first reported attempt to transplant porcine islets into human patients of T1D was carried out in 1994. 59 Results demonstrated detectable C-peptide levels in patient urine for up to 300 days after transplant. However, these were without significant effects on blood glucose levels. 59 Since then, there have been small clinical studies, which reported benefits of using pig-derived islets for the treatment of T1D. 60,61 These studies provided strong clinical benefits for treating T1D. However, a number of challenges limit the clinical implementation of this approach, including a reliable source of pig islets, developing strategy for immune isolation of xeno-islets, and identifying suitable sites for transplantation.\n\nPreclinical studies have reported additional benefits of using neonatal porcine islet-like cell pancreatic cell clusters (NPCCs) as opposed to mature islets. This includes robust survival during pre-transplant islet isolation procedures, especially in the ischaemic ex vivo environment. 62 In addition, after transplant, the encapsulated NPCCs are reported to proliferate and differentiate into mature \u03b2 cells, providing robust glucose control. 62 Unlike mature islet cells, NPCCs are also resistant to cytotoxic effects of the host pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3). 63 Regarding potential zoonosis from porcine graft, there are variety of designated pathogen-free pig breeds available, including the Chicago Medical School miniature pigs, New Zealand Auckland Island pigs, and transgenic pigs targeting porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV). 62 There are also studies, which have demonstrated stable glycaemic control using transplantation of genetically modified xeno-islet grafts. For instance, islets genetically altered to overexpress anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 have been transplanted and demonstrate stable functional profile with minimal",

Islet xenotransplantation using DPF pigs is considered as a promising fundamental solution to the donor shortage. However, crossspecies infection, especially PERV infection, poses risks to the community, and discussions among key opinion leaders have been implemented by the WHO. As a result, the IXA Consensus Statement was published in 2016, envisioning a future where cost-effective delivery of islet transplants to diabetic patients is facilitated by medical pigs. With the risk of infection always kept in mind, cases of clinical islet xenotransplantation have been accumulated, and steady progress has been made toward a feasible, safe, and effective treatment for diabetic patients. In addition, the development of donor pigs optimal for transplantation using the",

Based on etiology, DM can be divided into four groups, including type 1 DM, type 2 DM, other specific types of diabetes, and gestational diabetes [4]. Among them, type 2 DM is characterized by relative moderate insulin deficiency resulting from a decreased effect of insulin in target tissues, e.g., muscles and adipose tissue (insulin resistance), or a secretory defect of insulin with or without insulin resistance [4,5]. \n\nUse of appropriate animal models for type 2 DM is important for understanding its pathogenesis and development and testing of therapeutics for treatment of this disease. Rodent models provide a number of advantages over other mammals; however, there are also several drawbacks, which might primarily include the fact that, genetically and physiologically, rodents are not as close to humans, compared to other mammals, e.g., monkey and pig, etc. Among them, pigs share the structure and function of the gastrointestinal tract, the development and morphology of the pancreas, and overall metabolic status with humans [6,7,8], and have also demonstrated comparable pharmacokinetics of the compound via subcutaneous administration [9] with humans; therefore, use of pigs might be a good alternative for replacement of rodents for use in diabetes research. Owing to their small size and ease of handling, even at full maturity, mini-pigs were found to be suitable for use in long-term studies. The pancreas of mini-pigs resembles the human pancreas in size, shape, and position. In addition, the amino acid sequences of insulin between pig and human differ only in a single residue. Based on these various advantages, the mini-pig is of particular interest for studies related to human type 1 DM [10].",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation using porcine donors is rapidly approaching clinical applicability as an alternative therapy for treatment of many end-stage diseases including type 1 diabetes. Porcine neonatal islet cell clusters (NICC) have normalised blood sugar levels for relatively short periods in the preclinical diabetic rhesus model but have met with limited success in the stringent baboon model. Here we report that NICC from genetically modified (GM) pigs deleted for \u03b1Gal and expressing the human complement regulators CD55 and CD59 can cure diabetes long-term in immunosuppressed baboons, with maximum graft survival exceeding 22 months. Five diabetic baboons were transplanted intraportally with 9,673 \u2013 56,913 islet equivalents (IEQ) per kg recipient weight. Immunosuppression consisted of T cell depletion with an anti-CD2 mAb, tacrolimus for the first 4 months, and maintenance with belatacept and anti-CD154; no anti-inflammatory treatment or cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis/treatment was given. This protocol was well tolerated, with all recipients maintaining or gaining weight. Recipients became insulin-independent at a mean of 87 \u00b1 43 days post-transplant and remained insulin-independent for 397 \u00b1 174 days. Maximum graft survival was 675 days. Liver biopsies showed functional islets staining for all islet endocrine components, with no evidence of the inflammatory blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) and minimal leukocytic infiltration. The costimulation blockade-based immunosuppressive protocol prevented an anti-pig antibody response in all recipients. In conclusion, we demonstrate that genetic modification of the donor pig enables attenuation of early islet xenograft injury, and in conjunction with judicious immunosuppression provides excellent long-term function and graft survival in the diabetic baboon model.",

This model shared important characteristics with type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, including reduced glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and progressive reduction of \u03b2-cells (Renner et al. 2010). Metabolic signatures of specific amino acids and lipids were investigated in this model and several potential biomarkers of early phases of \u03b2-cell dysfunction and mass reduction were identified (Renner et al. 2012 a). Transgenic pigs with permanent diabetes were created by SCNT with a mutated insulin gene. These pigs show typical features of progressive diabetes, including cataract development and pathology of kidneys and the nervous system (Renner et al. 2012 b). \n\nTransgenic pigs with \u03b2-cell specific expression of LEA29Y served as donors in a xenotransplantation model. Xenograft islet cell clusters from these pigs rescued diabetes and prevented rejection in a humanized mouse model (Klymiuk et al. 2012). Transgenic cloned pigs have also been produced carrying a dominant negative mutant for a hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b1 mutation showing obvious diabetic symptoms (Umeyama et al. 2009). The use of islets from pigs transgenic for a fluorogenic protein GFP (green fluorescent protein or Kusabira-Orange) may facilitate development of islet cell xenotransplantation (Teratani et al. 2012).",

It seems apparent that besides the current technological difficulties regarding proliferative capacity and phenotype maintenance, also the time requirements limit the clinical use of primary human cells. Together with the lack of human donors, this stimulated the search for alternative sources of cells. Pigs emerged as promising candidates for the production of donor tissues as they resemble many anatomical and physiological features of humans. For the cardiovascular system in particular, properties like an identical heart weight to body weight ratio, similar coronary circulation and hemodynamics, as well as comparable healing characteristics of the myocardium [7] rendered pigs not only as a suitable model organism but also as a potential donor for heart xenotransplantation.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, studies in diabetic animal models have demonstrated that porcine islet cell transplantation was sufficient to normalize blood glucose in the recipients, thus proving physiologic activity and metabolic regulation across the species barrier [8,9]. These findings raised hope for the implementation of xenogeneic cell replacement as potential therapy for a multitude of human diseases and disorders and inspired a number of research activities in the newly emerging field of xenogeneic cell therapy [10][11][12]. In fact, translation into clinical trials was achieved for the application of porcine islets of Langerhans with [13] and without Sertoli cells [14] to treat diabetic patients. Long-term follow-up studies documented decreased insulin requirements in a majority of patients [15] and the recent development of encapsulation strategies is supposed to overcome remaining immunological complications [16].",

            "text": "Successful long-term survival of islet grafts was achieved by Dirk van der Windt and his colleagues through a combination of strategies, including optimized diabetes induction in cynomolgus monkeys, an anti-inflammatory protocol, an immunosuppressive regimen based on an anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb), and the use of pig islets expressing the human complement regulator CD46 [44]. This was the first report of pig islet transplantation resulting in insulin-independence and normoglycemia for a period of >12 months (Figure 2). This significant achievement was later replicated using GTKO pig donors that expressed multiple human transgenes targeting complement and coagulation activation and inflammation [46]. It demonstrated the beneficial effects of tissue targeted gene editing in modulating IBMIR and early islet loss, thus advancing the acceptance of genetically-engineered porcine tissues for transplantation. However, in neither study were the results consistently successful. \n\nConducting pre-clinical trials with long-term follow-up enabled the refinement of methodologies for monitoring diabetes in NHPs post-transplantation. Marco Marigliano (Italy) and his colleagues demonstrated that monitoring hemoglobin A1C is a reliable metric for assessing glucose control both before and after islet xenotransplantation [47]. \n\nStandardization of experimental conditions ensured the overall safety of the procedure. However, complications were reported. For example, Nathalie Campanile (Switzerland) reported that, 1 week after intraportal pig islet transplantation, one recipient developed acute gastric dilatation that proved fatal [48]. Acute gastric dilatation had been described before in NHPs and has subsequently proved problematic in baboons after pig organ transplantation. The report by the Pittsburgh group offered guidelines for preventing or managing acute gastric dilatation. \n\nRita Bottino and Angela Criscimanna (Italy) reported interesting findings related to the recovery of beta cell mass and function in NHPs that had been rendered diabetic with streptozotocin and subsequently received porcine islet transplants [49].",

            "text": "The first scientific attempt to transplant pig islets into patients with T1D by Groth et al. (6) in 1994 resulted in detectable pig C-peptide in urine beyond 300 days and insulinpositive staining of graft biopsies in patients receiving combined human kidney and pig islet transplants. Despite these results, glucose metabolism remained unaltered. In Mexico, pediatric diabetic patients have been transplanted with pig islets that were co-transplanted with Sertoli cells placed in a stainless steel chamber that was implanted under the skin (7). In New Zealand, pig islets have been encapsulated individually in alginate and transplanted into the peritoneal cavity, an immunoisolating approach that avoids the need for immunosuppressive therapy (8). A trial of this approach is underway with appropriate regulatory oversight, and publication of the results is anticipated. \n\nRegardless of the results of these xenotransplantation trials, lively discussion about their justification on regulatory and ethical grounds has emerged. Whereas the level of regulatory oversight of the Mexican trial was likely insufficient, the trial in New Zealand is being regulated carefully by that country's Ministry of Health (8). Nevertheless, none of these clinical studies was preceded by peerreviewed, preclinical data in NHPs proving the efficacy of the therapy. The World Health Organization and the International Xenotransplantation Association have both stressed that, in addition to the need for strict procedures to guarantee a safe pig product, patients should be exposed to islet xenotransplantation only if there is a relatively high expectation of benefit (9,10). Although convincing preclinical data from experiments in NHPs was not required in the past before the introduction of islet allotransplantation, these data remain the best indication of the potential therapeutic benefit of islet xenotransplantation. In recent years, significant progress has been made, with pig islets providing sustained (.1 year) normoglycemia in a small number of NHPs in which diabetes had been induced.",

However, immunological responses, such as instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) [14][15][16], hyperacute, and cellular rejection, remain major hurdles to overcome and improve porcine islet survival [17][18][19][20][21]. Therefore, several strategies have been explored to overcome immune complications in this setting. The development of genetically modified pigs lacking the expression of certain surface proteins that play key roles in immune rejection upon porcine islet transplantation demonstrates promising results in improving porcine islet survival through combating IBMIR and hyperacute rejection. Preclinical studies also revealed that the blockade of co-stimulatory cell surface molecules suppresses T cell activation, hampers cellular rejection, and improves islet survival in vivo. With no evidence of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) transmission, clinical studies of porcine islet xenotransplan-tation in T1D patients showed initial successes; however, most recipients failed to maintain long-term normal glycemic levels. Encapsulating pig islets has been suggested as effective in reducing xenogeneic immune rejection and prolonging graft survival and was tested in two clinical studies in T1D patients but showed only minimal reduction in their daily insulin needs [22][23][24][25][26].",

            "text": "The shortage of human pancreas donor organs imposes severe restrictions on the use of allotransplantation to treat diabetes mellitus [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. When performed, whole pancreas transplantation requires use of potent immunosuppressive medications that have significant complications. Newer, more targeted immunosuppressive regimens that do not require steroids or high-dose calcineurin inhibitors make islet transplantation a more attractive option. However, side effects of immune suppression that must be maintained so long as the islet graft functions remain a source of morbidity and even mortality [15]. Thus transplantation therapy for diabetes trades one set of morbidities (associated with  diabetes and its medical treatment) for another (associated with immune suppression).\n\nThe severity of humoral rejection effectively precludes the use of pigs as whole pancreas organ donors for humans. However, because they are vascularized by the host posttransplantation, islets like other cell transplants are not subject to humoral rejection. Porcine islets are rejected within two weeks of transplantation in non-immune suppressed non-human primates [8,[16][17][18]. Experience Journal of Transplantation 5 with pig to primate islet or neonatal islet transplantation in immune suppressed non-human primates shows that sustained insulin independence can be achieved, but only through the use of agents that are not approved for human use or that result in a high level of morbidity and mortality [19][20][21]. Thus, the need for host immune suppression is a barrier for pig-to-human islet xenotransplantation.\n\nXenotransplantation of embryonic pig pancreatic primordia in lieu of mature pig organs or porcine islets couples the wide availability of pig organs with the immunological advantages inherent in transplanting cellular embryonic tissue, circumventing humoral rejection and obviating the need for host immune suppression [1]. However, obtaining embryonic pig pancreata is technically challenging because surgery must be performed on multiple pregnant sows and isolation carried out from scores of embryos to obtain sufficient numbers of",

            "text": "Islet xenotransplantation is a promising alternative approach to Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) treatment and has achieved long-term normoglycemia in porcine-to-primate studies (247-249). Based on preliminary studies in NHPs, the first case of clinical islet xenotransplantation to human can be traced back to 1994 (250). Currently, clinical trials using islet xenotransplantation are developing more rapidly than those in other xenotransplantation areas. In 2014, a clinical trial using islet xenotransplantation under regulatory framework was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov (251). This was followed by Phase I/IIa and IIb clinical trials using encapsulated neonatal porcine islets in xenotransplantation performed in Argentina (252), which resulted in a mean transplant estimated function of approximately 0.5, with transplants maintained for more than two years, and a significant reduction in the number of unaware hypoglycemia episodes. Surely, there are still many problems to be solved for islet xenotransplantation before reaching their clinical use, including physiological function consistency, immune rejection, islet loss, and prevention of PERVs infection (253). Immune rejections included HAR, mediated by Gal and non-Gal antigens (254), instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) that may have provoked 60-80% of islet loss (255), and CD4 + T cell-mediated cellular rejection that plays a major role in islet destruction (256). Strategies to alleviate rejection mainly include islet encapsulation and gene editing technology. Recent clinical trials mainly focused on encapsulating the neonatal porcine islets in different high molecular compounds (257). While cell encapsulation technology can potentially shield the islets from the host's immune rejection at initial stage, long-term therapeutic efficacy is still a challenge (258). Another hot spot of research is to attempt different transplantation sites, including the portal vein, subrenal capsule, subcutaneously, the muscle, spleen, gastric submucosal space and peritoneum, depending on the islet volume and its",

However, previous limited clinical trials failed in their attempts to treat diabetic patients by transplantation of advanced gestational age porcine embryonic pancreas. In the present study we examined growth potential, functionality, and immunogenicity of pig embryonic pancreatic tissue harvested at different gestational ages. Methods and Findings Implantation of embryonic pig pancreatic tissues of different gestational ages in SCID mice reveals that embryonic day 42 (E42) pig pancreas can enable a massive growth of pig islets for prolonged periods and restore normoglycemia in diabetic mice. Furthermore, both direct and indirect T cell rejection responses to the xenogeneic tissue demonstrated that E42 tissue, in comparison to E56 or later embryonic tissues, exhibits markedly reduced immunogenicity. Finally, fully immunocompetent diabetic mice grafted with the E42 pig pancreatic tissue and treated with an immunosuppression protocol comprising CTLA4-Ig and anti\u2013CD40 ligand (anti-CD40L) attained normal blood glucose levels, eliminating the need for insulin. Conclusions These results emphasize the importance of selecting embryonic tissue of the correct gestational age for optimal growth and function and for reduced immunogenicity, and provide a proof of principle for the therapeutic potential of E42 embryonic pig pancreatic tissue transplantation in diabetes.",

            "text": "The object of allogeneic islet Tx is not that it should be the first therapeutic option for all. For many patients, exogenous insulin and tight metabolic control can be effective. However, for the many patients for whom islet Tx is the most effective option, including those with the most lifethreatening forms of T1D, it would be beneficial to be able to offer the procedure in the US. As demand increases, the supply of pancreata suitable for islet isolation may eventually become inadequate. Xenotransplantation (xenoTx) of porcine organs such as kidneys has long been considered as a possibility to overcome the limitations placed on organ Tx by insufficient human donors to accommodate demand. Research into xenoTx has primarily been driven by long waiting lists for kidney Tx that currently include over 90,000 individuals [100] and adds 40,000 annually [99]. \n\nLikewise, porcine islets have been considered as a replacement for human pancreas donors for islet Tx [101]. Physiological differences among species, and particularly immunological incompatibilities, have led to sophisticated measures to produce pigs more compatible to humans [102]. Dr. Thomas Starzl, often considered \"the father of modern transplantation\" showed early interest in xenoTx [103] and was a proponent of genetic engineering of pig donors. Several authors of this report were part of the group that was responsible for the breakthrough generation of the first \u03b11,3-Galactosyltransferase-deficient pigs [104] that represents the foundation of recent successful pre-clinical xenoTx. Our group has extensive experience in pig-tononhuman primate islet Tx models of diabetes [105][106][107]. We successfully demonstrated graft survival for a milestone of 1 year using genetically engineered pigs and repeated this success with multi-genetic pigs by adding various combinations of human transgenes [106,107]. A South Korean group has demonstrated graft survival >900 days using unmodified wild-type pigs [108]. These pre-clinical results, however, have been possible due to the use of clinically unavailable immunosuppression based on anti-CD154mAbs [109].",

Although these different types of implants have not yet been sufficiently investigated and compared for their biologic properties, porcine islet cell grafts are expected to be superior to currently used human islet cell grafts in terms of their capacity to reproducibly achieve a metabolically adequate functional b-cell mass with physiologic properties. Their production can rely on expertise in industrial pig farming for breeding high-health, medical-grade pigs as organ donors, with the option of using sources that are genetically engineered to facilitate cell survival in humans. Guidelines for clinical testing have been established [11] and measures identified for protecting survival of xenografted porcine b cells in rodents and nonhuman primates [10,[12][13][14]. It will be necessary to define a combination protocol that is not associated with a higher morbidity than that observed with current human islet cell transplant protocols.",

This limitation could be associated with some form of immune rejection or the inability of the implanted islets to replenish dying islets via stem cell differentiation and self-renewal.\n\nStudies over the past three decades indicate that both immunogenicity and poor self-renewal might potentially be addressed by the use of human fetal pancreatic precursor tissues (2,3). However, considering the ethical issues associated with the use of human fetal tissues and the proven efficacy of pig insulin in humans, the focus of such studies has shifted to xenotransplantation of pig embryonic pancreatic tissue.\n\nWhile several studies demonstrated the remarkable regenerative capacity of embryonic day (E)28\u2013E42 pig pancreatic tissues in various rodent models (4\u20137) and the ability of E42 tissue to correct diabetes in nonhuman primates (NHP) (8), the issue of immunogenicity remained highly controversial.\n\nIn particular, at the heart of this debate was the suggestion by Rogers et al. that pig embryonic pancreatic (6) or renal (9) tissues harvested at E28 can completely evade graft rejection in fully immune competent mice or rats and, \u2026",

Patient blood was circulated through pig kidneys for over an hour before it was returned to the patient's body (Hanson 2011).\n\nGroth's work has inspired other scientists to pursue islet xenograft through animal experimentation and clinical trials. A number of studies have demonstrated that porcine islet xenotransplantation could reverse diabetes in non-human primates for at least 6 months (Hering and Walawalkar 2009;Hering et al. 2006). Islet xenotransplantation clinical trials have also been conducted in several countries including Mexico, Russia, China, New Zealand and Argentina. Some of these trials indicate that islet xenotransplantation reduces the required daily dosage of insulin and the incidence of hypoglycaemia (Torrie 2012). However, in some countries, the development of islet xentransplantation was halted for several years due to public health concerns regarding the risks of infectious diseases. In the next section, I will address the global public controversy over xenotransplantation and proposals for a moratorium on high-risk research.\n\nThe Publics in/and Xenotransplantation: initial responses to the risk of retroviral contagion\n\nIn the early 1990s, the field of xenotransplantation revitalised its research agenda with the announcement of the first transgenic pig in Cambridge, England (Connor 1993). Named Astrid, this pig was produced by British firm, Imutran. Astrid was engineered with a gene-human decay-accelerating factor (or hDAF)-to inhibit immunological rejection of porcine organs and tissues in humans (Rosengard et al. 1995). Two years later, Imutran announced the results from its cardiac xenograft experiments in monkeys. Two out of its ten cynomologus monkeys survived for more than 60 days after their native heart were replaced with a heart from a transgenic pig (Laurance 1995;The Guardian 1995). This news was welcomed by biotechnology industry and positively reported in the media. One journalist equated Imutran's achievement to",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation is a promising approach to circumvent the current organ shortage. Specifically, pig has been considered the most suitable xenogeneic source for clinical islet transplantation [1][2][3][4]. Hyperacute rejection, however, is the greatest barrier to successful xenotransplantation in humans following this strategy, which substantially jeopardizes the xenograft survival. To address this, alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase-knockout pigs were generated [5] and with the knockout pigs as the xenogeneic source, prolonged xenograft survival was observed in non-human primates [6]. Since evidence showed that the predominant epitope Gal(1-3) is expressed on pig endothelial cells with little expression on pig islets [7], this suggests that porcine islets may not undergo hyperacute rejection. However, the cell-mediated xenogeneic immune response is still a major challenge to successful xenotransplantation [4]. Koulmanda [8] reported that xenografts were rejected within 7 to 14 days of fetal porcine islet transplantation in mice. Xenograft survival was prolonged to 35 days in the class II-, CD4 + mice. Moreover, islet survival reached approximately100 days in CD4 + T-cell-depleted mice. These results suggested that cell-mediated xenogeneic immune responses plays a central role in successful xenotransplantation of porcine islets either by the direct pathway comprising donor antigen presenting cell (APC)-dependent responses or by the indirect pathway comprising host APC-dependent responses [9]. \n\nDendritic cells (DCs) are crucial regulators of immunity with their ability to induce and maintain allogeneic tolerance. It is now well-recognized that immature, 'alternatively activated', genetically modified, maturation-resistant DCs of either donor or host origin, can promote allograft survival [10,11]. However, some DC subtypes in a tolerogenic state are unstable.",

A number of sites have been investigated, some of which seem worthy of continued assessment. \n\nTransplantation into the gastric submucosal space can be achieved through endoscopy (40) and offers the advantage of possible endoscopic biopsy of the graft for investigation of rejection, apoptosis, or both (41).

Several research groups have explored porcine islets as an alternative to the inconsistent and chronic shortage of pancreases from human organ donors. Studies have confirmed successful transplant of porcine islets into non\u2010human primate models of diabetes; however, in most cases, they require more than one adult porcine donor to achieve sufficient viable islet mass for sustained function. The importance of GMP\u2010grade reagents includes the following: specific enzymes utilized in the pancreatic isolation process were identified as a key factor in successful human clinical islet transplantation trials using cadaveric islets. As xenotransplantation clinical research progresses, isolation reagents and digestion enzymes play a key role in the consistency of the product and ultimately the outcome of the islet xenotransplant. In this study, we evaluated several commercially available enzyme blends that have been used for islet isolation. We evaluated their impact on islet isolation yield and subsequent islet function as part of our plan to bring xenotransplantation into clinical xenotransplantation trials.",

            "text": "Larger molecular residue is absorbed by macrophages or giant cells, leaving an intact blood vasculature, which has shown persistence in human biopsy specimens out to 5 years. Most of this process is completed by 12 months, and certainly by 18 months there is no histological evidence of its implantation. \n\nThere are several strengths to this study, including the demonstration of long-term islet survival in a robust, syngeneic, large-animal model and islet survival in the background of systemic immunosuppression in both the allogeneic and xenogeneic porcine models with evidence of early function, as demonstrated by the detection of serum c-peptide, in the xenogeneic transplant group, thus supporting further translational development toward curative models. Another major strength of the study is that the porcine model represents the animal skin model most similar to humans. Unlike rodents and nonhuman primates, pigs lack a panniculus carnosus (i.e., subcutaneous muscle layer under hair-bearing skin); instead, they possess a panniculus adiposus, a structure in common with human skin in all but a few locations. However, pig models also pose significant challenges (e.g., maintaining immune suppression, husbandry issues, dietary considerations) that make curative studies challenging. Nonetheless, given the physiological and architectural similarities of porcine and human skin, the current data would be supportive of future work using BTM to facilitate a novel, alternative site for islet transplantation. \n\nA current limitation of the study relates to the distribution and delivery of islets into the intracutaneous site. It is recognized that islets need to be within 200 mm of a blood supply for viability; hence, the cannula route of administration used in this study, although appropriate for demonstration of proof of principle and function on implanted islets, is not yet optimized to deliver an islet mass necessary for insulin independence in large animals. Because the external diameter of the cannula was 500 mm, islets in the central core were potentially rendered ischemic. Further experimentation to optimally deliver islets in proximity to vasculature is required.",

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) represents a group of physiological dysfunctions characterized by hyperglycemia, resulting from insulin resistance (as seen in type 2 diabetes mellitus-T2DM), inadequate insulin secretion/production, or excessive glucagon secretion (in type 1 diabetes mellitus-T1DM). Type 1 diabetes is a chronic, progressive autoimmune disease affecting approximately 1% of the population in the developed world. In contrast, type 2 diabetes is primarily caused by insulin resistance coupled with reduced insulin output, affecting approximately 8.5% of the adult population [1]. For patients with poorly controlled diabetes especially type 1 DM, despite insulin therapy, allogeneic islet transplantation with immunosuppressant has been undergoing clinical trial [2]. However, while allogeneic islets are preferable due to lower immune responses compared to xenogeneic islets, their availability of supply is limited. To overcome this challenge, research is underway to use xenogeneic pancreatic islets, particularly from pigs, which offer an infinite supply despite the potential for a greater immune response compared to allogeneic islets [3]. This approach aims to advance diabetes treatment. Xenogeneic porcine pancreatic islet transplantation, particularly when performed via the portal vein in non-human primate (NHP) models, often encounters strong cellular and humoral rejection responses, necessitating potent immunosuppressants [4]. To overcome these challenges, encapsulated islet transplantation has been investigated as an alternative strategy for diabetes management, aiming to shield transplanted islets from the host immune response [5]. \n\nBefore attempting clinical trials with encapsulated porcine xenogeneic islets incorporating state-of-the-art technologies, it is imperative to validate their efficacy in the diabetic NHP model [6]. However, considering the high costs associated with non-clinical trials in the diabetic NHP model, it is essential to precede efficacy assessments in a diabetic rat model.",

But a large quantity of clinical data indicated that longterm insulin injection could induce insulin resistance and was not favorable to prevent some serious complications [1] . Longterm application of immunosuppressive drugs, for example, high-dose cyclosporine and tacrolimus, could bring about toxic effects on islets and normal liver and kidney [2,3] . So in some cases, it is limited to use immunosuppressive drugs for a long period at high dose. However, islet transplantation has the potential to cure diabetes mellitus [4] , especially insulindependent diabetes mellitus [5] . Islet transplantation could make insulin maintain normal level of blood glucose and prevent serious complications. In general, islet allotransplantation is safe and efficient to reduce hyperglycemia, and leads to insulin independence in patients with insulin dependent diabetes [6,7] . But this kind of islets source is limited, which becomes the chief obstacle for treating patients. So it is necessary to find alternative islet sources, such as xenotransplantation of islets of new-born pigs. However, the rejection for xenotransplantation should be mornitored efficiently. Usually, the way of preventing rejection lies in using high dose of immunosuppressive drugs, which gives rise to serious side effects. On the other hand, pre-injection of a suitable number of the same donor lymphocytes or blood cells could induce immune tolerance in different kinds of organ transplantations [8][9][10][11][12][13][14] . Some other laboratories also reported that immunologic isolation, or transplantation of microencapsulated islets, could reduce rejection of islet xenotransplantation [15,16] . In the present study, pig islet xenotransplantation in mice was performed after injection of donor hepatocytes, splenocytes or their mixture.",

            "text": "Preclinical research in the field of ITx is mostly done in rodents. However, body size is of major importance for developing clinically applicable imaging modalities with improved sensitivity and resolution; hence, the translational value of rodent models is limited. Moreover, their pancreatic islet physiology differs from humans. 22 Consequently, NHP models have been used; however, their demand of insulin for glucose control is much higher than in humans. 23 In intrahepatic ITx of pancreatectomized or streptozotocin-induced diabetic NHPs, 100,000 IEQs/kg BW of adult pig islets or 9600 to 56,900 IEQs/kg BW of NPIs were required to achieve normoglycemia. 13,24 The lag time to normalize recipients' blood glucose levels and to come off INS ranged between 20 and 189 days. 13 n the present study, we used a genetically modified MIDY pig model which gets consistently diabetic without further interventions. PIPIT of 3300 to 9700 IEQs NPIs/kg BW was sufficient to cure diabetes in this model. As immature NPIs were transplanted, in vivo maturation and volume expansion were essential to achieve a critical functional islet graft mass normalizing the recipients' blood glucose levels. In vivo matured NPI grafts in the liver consisted of alpha-, beta-, and delta-cells, resembling the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas and required for proper glucose control. Similar to the findings in NHP ITx models, no correlation between NPI transplant mass and reversal of diabetes was observed. One possible explanation is an instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction, which may lead to a loss of up to >50% ICCs in the early posttransplant period. Hypoxia-based engraftment failure is another important cause of early islet graft loss. 25 Longitudinal noninvasive islet graft imaging is thus an important asset in ITx, shedding light on the graft fate. Only a few studies performed islet graft imaging in large animal models or clinical settings.",

            "text": "subclinical concentrations. As will be discussed in more detail below, especially picornaviruses have been shown to impair the function of islet cells. 32,33 Furthermore, double-stranded (ds) RNA, produced by many virus infections, acting via toll-like receptor (TLR) binding induced a decrease in insulin production. 34 When screening for the best source of pig islets, it was found that adult porcine pancreata yield, on average, more than five times the amount of islets than do neonatal pancreata, the high price of adult pigs led to the cost per islet being more than twice that of neonatal islets. 35 The variability of isolation outcome depends on age and breed of the animals and the quality of the initial organ and this represents a major obstacle to pig islet cell xenotransplantation. [36][37][38][39][40][41][42] In most of these investigations analyzing the optimal conditions for islet cell preparations for transplantation, for example, comparing neonatal with adult islet cells and designing methods for their isolation, no screening for porcine viruses had been performed. For example, when islet cells from Chicago Medical School miniature pigs were analyzed, extremely high yields of well-functioning islets were isolated from adult animals. 41 The animals were bred in a barrier-sustained specified pathogen free/gnotobiotic facility; however, a list of analyzed viruses was not published. When Wuzhishan (WZS) miniature pigs were compared with slaughterhouse pigs, the islet yield of the WZS miniature pigs' pancreata was significantly higher than that of the market pigs and WZS islets appeared to be of higher quality. 42 The reason may be the infection of slaughterhouse pigs with different viruses. 43,44 When adult porcine islets from genetically unmodified pigs were transplanted intraportally into streptozotocin-diabetic, immunosuppressed cynomolgus macaques, reversal of diabetes for more than 100 days was observed; however, the virus status of the animals was not stated. 26",

            "text": "he early hope that islet transplantation might offer an attractive treatment modality for latestage type 1 diabetes has been tempered over the last decade, largely due to the observation that the transplants exhibit reduced insulin production after a few years (1). This limitation could be associated with some form of immune rejection or the inability of the implanted islets to replenish dying islets via stem cell differentiation and self-renewal. \n\nStudies over the past three decades indicate that both immunogenicity and poor self-renewal might potentially be addressed by the use of human fetal pancreatic precursor tissues (2,3). However, considering the ethical issues associated with the use of human fetal tissues and the proven efficacy of pig insulin in humans, the focus of such studies has shifted to xenotransplantation of pig embryonic pancreatic tissue. \n\nWhile several studies demonstrated the remarkable regenerative capacity of embryonic day (E)28-E42 pig pancreatic tissues in various rodent models (4-7) and the ability of E42 tissue to correct diabetes in nonhuman primates (NHP) (8), the issue of immunogenicity remained highly controversial. \n\nIn particular, at the heart of this debate was the suggestion by Rogers et al. that pig embryonic pancreatic (6) or renal (9) tissues harvested at E28 can completely evade graft rejection in fully immune competent mice or rats and, more recently, even in NHP (10). In contrast, Tchorsh-Yutsis et al. (11) reported fierce T-cell-mediated rejection of E28 pig pancreatic tissue in mice or rats, and prompt rejection was likewise demonstrated by Clancy et al. (12), who tested acceptance of allogeneic fetal renal tissue in rats. Further, it has been demonstrated that even embryonic (13) or mesenchymal ( 14) stem cells cannot evade rejection. \n\nThe new report in Diabetes by Fourcade et al. ( 15) provides additional important data regarding the growth potential and immunogenicity of allogeneic fetal pancreatic tissue as a source for transplantation. The authors elegantly demonstrate that a minimal amount of tissue harvested from just two mouse embryos can correct hyperglycemia in diabetic animals.",

            "text": "The successful application of islet transplantation under Edmonton protocol suffers from the shortage of adequate donor islets. Even if we consider one pancreas per T1D patient, there would still be an extreme shortage of donors to establish it as a widespread clinical reality. Importantly, sometimes two or more donors are needed to induce longterm normoglycemia in T1D patients due to the loss of islets in the first 60 min of intraportal transplantation via IBMIR (8). In this pursuit, the concept of xenotransplantation of pig islets promised to resolve the islet donor shortage (10,29,(32)(33)(34). \n\nPig is considered as a good source of islets due to the following reasons (1): human and pig insulin differs only by one amino acid (35), as exemplified by the fact that humans have been treated successfully with porcine insulin for >40 years (10) (2); adult pig pancreas consists of an ample number of islets that respond to glucose stimulation (3); pigs are easily bred, sacrificed for food, and have large litters with offspring that rapidly attain adult size (4); pig islets, if coming from a single donor, could be more consistent as compared with human cadaveric islets that have different degrees of functionality, cold ischemia injury, and islet damage due to the presence of disease (5); the autoimmune responses against pig islets are different from those against human islets; and (6) genomic editing of pigs with required immune-modulatory gene(s) can make pig islets less prone to degradation mechanisms (10,36). Despite all these advantages, the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion capacity of adult and juvenile pig islets was reported as one-third compared with human islets. Muller et al. performed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) on human islets, adult pig islets (APIs), and juvenile pig islets (JPI) by challenging them separately with basal glucose (2.5 mM) and high glucose (16.7 mM).",

            "text": "Islet transplantation (ITx) has established that cellular therapies can improve glycemic control in a subset of patients with type 1 diabetes, but it is limited by the shortage of adequate donor islets and need for chronic immunosuppression [1,2]. Alternatively, other sources of \u00df-cells have been highly sought after, including stem cell-derived \u00df-cells and xenogeneic islet alternatives. Through the recapitulation of pancreatic development, several groups have been able to generate islet-like cells from pluripotent stem cells, and clinical trials have demonstrated C-peptide secretion following transplant of embryonic stem cellderived pancreatic progenitors that mature into islets in vivo, as well as fully differentiated islets [3][4][5]. Despite the success of these trials, the clinical translation of stem cell-derived islets remains limited by the need for cost-efficient cell manufacturing process and, more importantly, concerns over the safety of the cell product due to the teratogenic potential of proliferative off-target cell populations during differentiation [6][7][8][9]. For this reason, xenotransplantation offers a promising alternative as a readily available source of islets for ITx. \n\nThe pig represents the most probable source of islets for xenotransplantation due to its unlimited availability, high breeding potential, large number of offspring, and overall close anatomical and physiological similarity to humans [10]. Moreover, porcine insulin differs by only a single amino acid from that of human insulin, and it was administered to treat diabetes for nearly a century before the introduction of recombinant human insulin, making porcine islets an ideal source for ITx [11]. However, xenozoonoses and xenoantigens were considered major concerns for clinical translation until recently, when two gene-edited pig heart transplants were successfully carried out in living patients [12,13]. In addition, genetically modified pig kidneys have been implanted into two brain-dead human recipients [14].",

The SC space of pigs is anatomically similar to that of humans (48); thus, this transplantation model provided the opportunity to study the potential for clinical translation. In addition, the xenogeneic transplantation may exacerbate immune cell infiltration and likewise fibrotic deposition near the device and thus worsen graft oxygenation. We thus hypothesized that enhanced O 2 supply was especially critical in this transplantation model. Our primary intents of this proof-ofconcept investigation were to derive a clinically feasible transplantation procedure for the iBED design and to study the potential for iBED to support surviving, functional cells in large animals.\n\nFirst, the iBEDv3 was modified and scaled to support higher islet payloads (iBEDv3S). The twisted silicone tubing was fixed in the adapter as previously described, although, in this design, the silicone tubing was only half-filled with PDMS before curing, providing protection from mechanical stress to alginate near the tank (Fig. 7A). In addition, the tank was enlarged to 22 mm in diameter and 8 mm in thickness, increasing the Li 2 O 2 /PFC-loading capacity 10-fold from the iBEDv3 design, and the tubing length was extended to 40 mm (Fig. 7B). Following incubation in 5% CO 2 , bubbles with high and uniform O 2 content were found at all lengths of the tubing, suggesting maintained CO 2 responsiveness and rapid gas transfer throughout the device (Fig. 7, C and D, and fig. S27). The islet alginate encapsulation layer was added as done previously (Fig. 7E).\n\niBEDv3S devices, containing a subclinical dose of islets (1500 IEQ within 180 \uf06dl of alginate), were implanted in the ventral deep SC space in minipigs (n = 4, including three minipigs for 1 month and one minipig for 2 months) ( Fig. 7F and movie S3).

            "text": "In 2014, Matsumoto et al. transplanted 14 patients with unstable T1DM with encapsulated neonatal porcine islets without immunosuppression and saw a reduction in unaware hypoglycemic events, but only a minimal reduction in HbA1c and daily insulin dosages at 1-year post-transplant (120). A similar 2016 clinical study in Argentina, where 8 patients underwent intraperitoneal transplantation with encapsulated neonatal porcine islets, also saw patients experiencing fewer episodes of unaware hypoglycemia and an improvement in HbA1c, but no change in daily insulin injections (121). Beyond ITx, recent thrilling advancements in clinical xenotransplantation highlighted the genetic modification approach. Two separate patients were transplanted with a genetically modified pig heart or kidney with 10 and 69 gene edits, respectively (122,123). Triumphantly, no acute rejection was seen with both procedures with the pig heart failing at 48 days and the pig kidney at just under two months after transplantation. These thrilling cases shed light on the possibility of a functional alternative organ source that may help fill the demand for organ transplantation. Exploring the clinical transplantation of islets from these genetically modified pigs may address the immunological barriers of xenotransplantation. As islet isolation disturbs the intricate vasculature perfusing islets, significantly lower exposure to xenogeneic antigens on donor endothelial cells would be expected in comparison to whole-organ transplants, where the whole-organ vasculature is derived from porcine. Despite the acute hypoxic conditions preceding angiogenesis as described, this process may ensure reduced exposure to additional donor tissue and reduce the risk of rejection. While the two pig-to-human heart and kidney transplant mechanism of rejection is still under investigation, we propose reducing exposure to xenogeneic endothelial cells may lead to more sustainable outcomes in xenogeneic ITx of these modified porcine strains. Moreover, the overall lower transplant mass in tandem with these genetic modifications may support more sustained long-term islet graft function. Examining their utility in clinical studies would serve as a confirmation.",

Using xenogeneic islets for transplantation is required in light of donor shortage and the large number of diabetic patients that qualify for islet transplantation. Until now, however, host immunoreactivity against the xenogeneic graft has been a major drawback for the use of porcine islets. Our study demonstrates the applicability of a novel immunoprotective membrane that allows successful xenotransplantation of rat islets in diabetic minipigs without immunosuppressive therapy. Rat pancreatic islets were encapsulated in highly purified alginate and integrated into a plastic macrochamber covered by a poly-membrane for subcutaneous transplantation. Diabetic Sinclair pigs were transplanted and followed for up to 90 days. We demonstrated a persistent graft function and restoration of normoglycemia without the need for immunosuppressive therapy. This concept could potentially offer an attractive strategy for a more widespread islet replacement therapy that would restore endogenous insulin secretion in diabetic patients without the need for immunosuppressive drugs and may even open up an avenue for safe utilization of xenogeneic islet donors.",

The Giessen team, led by Reinhard Bretzel, developed methods to enhance the survival and function of porcine islets during cold storage and after transplantation into recipient animals [7]. Key advances by this team also improved the enzymatic digestion of the pancreas and the purification of porcine islets, along with refining the culture conditions that support the long-term functionality of the transplanted islets [8]. \n\nMoreover, the Giessen team shed light on the critical islet mass required to achieve successful metabolic function after transplantation in pig models [9]. These advances were crucial for increasing the number of islets available for experimental and preclinical studies, helping to make xenotransplantation more feasible. \n\nInfluenced by their work in Giessen, Bernhard Hering and Daniel Brandhorst moved from Germany to the USA and the UK, respectively, and further explored porcine islet isolation and transplantation and became prominent figures in the field of islet allo-and xeno-transplantation [10][11][12][13]. \n\nIn Dresden, Germany, the group led by Barbara Ludwig has worked to optimize islet encapsulation technology. Their research uses a variety of animal models, including the isolation of mouse, rat, pig, and human islets. Using a novel immuno-protective membrane, the group demonstrated restoration of normoglycemia, without the need for immunosuppression, in a model of rat islet xenotransplantation into diabetic minipigs [14]. Ludwig's team then showed success in NHP diabetic model, using porcine islet xenografts within a bioartificial pancreas device to create a suitable microenvironment for cell survival [15,16].",

This was later followed by corneal transplantations from pigs to humans and kidney transplantations in NHP [15,16]. The first pancreatic xenotransplantation was performed by Watson et al., implanted three ovine fragments into the subcutaneous plane of a diabetic patient. Though clinically significant blood glucose reduction was not demonstrated, the blood sugar level did decrease [17]. This pioneering work was followed by many experimental xenotransplantations, but results were mostly inconclusive [18][19][20][21]. Shumakov et al. reported 53 fetal porcine xenotransplants and 18 fetal bovine xenotranaplants in diabetic patients [22]. A century later, Groth et al. performed clinical xenotransplantation trial using fetal porcine islet cell-like clusters (ICCs) and provided preliminary data regarding the function and survival of grafts. After porcine islets were transplanted into 10 insulin-dependent diabetic kidney-transplant patients, detectable levels of porcine C-peptide were identified in the urine for up to 400 days and in one case, renal graft biopsy showed insulin and glucagon positive cells after staining [23]. Several xenotransplantation studies have also been performed in NHPs [20], and have succeeded in reversing diabetes [24][25][26][27] and in reducing daily insulin dosage requirement [28]. Transplanted porcine islet grafts were also shown to survive and function in NHPs for longer than 6 months with immunosuppression [25,27,29]. The longest survival rate is now over 603 days according to Shin et al.,[30]. Studies have also shown that microencapsulation of the transplanted islets and immune-isolation lead to better survival rate without the need for aggressive immunosuppressive therapy [26].",

            "text": "Islet transplantation is a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes, but the shortage of donor organs limits its routine application. As potential donor animals, we generated transgenic pigs expressing LEA29Y, a high-affinity variant of the T-cell costimulation inhibitor CTLA-4Ig, under the control of the porcine insulin gene promoter. Neonatal islet cell clusters (ICCs) from INSLEA29Y transgenic (LEA-tg) pigs and wild-type controls were transplanted into streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic NOD-scid IL2Rg null mice. Cloned LEA-tg pigs are healthy and exhibit a strong b-cell-specific transgene expression. LEA-tg ICCs displayed the same potential to normalize glucose homeostasis as wild-type ICCs after transplantation. After adoptive transfer of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, transplanted LEA-tg ICCs were completely protected from rejection, whereas reoccurrence of hyperglycemia was observed in 80% of mice transplanted with wild-type ICCs. In the current study, we provide the first proof-of-principle report on transgenic pigs with b-cell-specific expression of LEA29Y and their successful application as donors in a xenotransplantation model. This approach may represent a major step toward the development of a novel strategy for pig-to-human islet transplantation without side effects of systemic immunosuppression. Diabetes 61:1527-1532, 2012 T ype 1 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease associated with development of severe complications (1). It has been shown that type 1 diabetes can be cured by the transplantation of the pancreas or isolated islets of Langerhans. Nonetheless, the success of pancreas and islet transplantation is limited by the shortage of organ donors and the need for systemic immunosuppressive therapy (2) and is therefore restricted to few patients (3).\n\nLimited availability of human donor organs may be overcome by the use of pigs as organ donors. Pig-to-human xenotransplantation faces the problem of strong rejection, predominantly by direct T-cell recognition of pig major histocompatibility complex and indirect T-cell response to x",

Individuals suffering from diabetes who are facing repeated and intense unawareness of hypoglycemia even after receiving the best possible medical treatment may be the most appropriate individuals to consider as potential candidates. Those with diabetic nephropathy would benefit from the successful transplantation of both a pig kidney and pig islets. The low risk in pig islet xenotransplantation trials is attributed to rigorous safety protocols, including genetic engineering of pigs to reduce human immune reactions and meticulous screening for pathogens. This approach minimizes potential zoonotic infections and immunogenic complications. Compliance with FDA regulations is ensured through adherence to established guidelines for xenotransplantation, encompassing product safety, ethical standards, and clinical trial conduct. Detailing these aspects can enhance the research's credibility, demonstrating a commitment to safety, regulatory compliance, and ethical considerations in advancing xenotransplantation as a therapeutic option.

            "text": "Clinical human islet transplantation is emerging as a suitable therapeutic option in T1D patients with uncontrollable glycemic management limited by hypoglycemia unawareness and effective hormonal counter-regulation [7,8]. Improving the islet processing techniques and introducing new immunomodulatory strategies, we expect to increase the benefit/risk ratio of human islet alloTx. However, the discrepancy between the number of potential islet recipients (ie, patients with T1D with frequent episodes of severe hypoglycemia and those with devastating microvascular diabetes complications) [9] and the number of available donors remains the major crucial issue to be solved, before a broader use of islet transplantation might become a reliable clinical alternative [1]. \n\nPig islet xenoTx currently represents a very promising solution to the limited donor supply [10]. It is important to underline that pig islets might have different additional distinct advantages over human islets for this purpose. First, the quality of prepared pig islets from a pig donor is consistently higher than human islets from a deceased donor (no comorbidity, senescence, brain death, and cold ischemia injury). Second, porcine islet xenografts may be resistant to destruction by recurrent autoimmunity [11]. Third, the risk of infectious disease transmission associated with xenoTx of pancreatic islets is lower than the one observed in human islet alloTx. Furthermore, it is possible to induce donor-specific immunologic hyporesponsiveness pretreating the recipient with donor antigen(s) [12] or using genetically modified pig islets with the overexpression of genes encoding cytoprotective and immunomodulatory molecules [13].",

            "text": "Background Pancreatic islet xenotransplantation is a potential treatment for diabetes mellitus, and porcine pancreas may provide a readily available source of islets. Islets in juvenile pigs are smaller than those in young adult pigs, but the insulin content is very similar. In addition, as juvenile pigs are more easily reared in uncontaminated conditions, many researchers have conducted studies using pancreatic islets from juvenile pigs. We aimed to analyze the distributions of endocrine cell clusters by comprehensively evaluating juvenile porcine pancreatic development and to propose an appropriate age at which islets could be isolated from the juvenile porcine pancreas. Methods Splenic (SL) and duodenal lobe (DL) samples were collected from the pancreases of pigs aged 0\u2013180 days (n = 3/day after birth). The chronological changes in endocrine cell clustering were analyzed in relation to morphological changes, cell characterization, numbers, islet areas, and gene expression. Results In juvenile pigs aged 0\u201321 days, the pancreas contained numerous endocrine cells, and compact islets appeared from 21 days of age. Well-defined small islets were seen at 28 days of age, and the clusters were denser in the SL than in the DL. At 35 days of age, the islets were morphologically similar to those observed at 180 days of age, and the greater number of islets was similar to that seen at 90 days of age. The differences in the islets\u2019 cytoarchitecture between the lobes were negligible. The expression of \u03b2-cell-related genes was higher in the juvenile pancreas than in the adult pancreas, and the expression of neurogenin-3 decreased dramatically over time. Conclusions These findings may have implications for attempts to refine the most appropriate age for islet isolation from porcine donors. Focusing on porcine pancreatic islets isolated at around 35 days after birth may offer benefits regarding their xenotransplantation potential.",

            "text": "The ferret and pig models mirror the human disease more closely, including age-dependent development of diabetes [67]. Newborn CFTR 2/2 ferrets have relatively mild disease of the exocrine pancreas and primarily display only acinar duct dilation, but most go on to develop severe inflammation and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in the first months of life [68]. They serve as a useful model for human infants with cystic fibrosis, most of whom have only mild pancreatic lesions with acinar duct dilation at birth and subsequently undergo pancreatic destruction. The CFTR 2/2 pigs, on the other hand, develop pancreatic inflammation during late gestation and are all born with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [69]. The pig is therefore suitable for modeling the later or more severe stages of human pancreatic disease in cystic fibrosis. In terms of the islet pathology, CFTR 2/2 ferrets exhibit abnormal glucose tolerance and decreased first-phase insulin secretion at birth, before exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [68]. CFTR 2/2 pigs and DF508 pigs also show impaired glucose tolerance and insulin secretion defects at birth and subsequently develop spontaneous hyperglycemia without appreciable loss of islet cell mass [69]. These latter observations imply that structural destruction of the endocrine pancreas may not be required for the development of CFRD, although it is certainly expected to increase the odds of overt diabetes by diminishing the b-cell reserve.",

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a metabolic disease characterized by high blood glucose levels. Type 1 diabetes results from the failure of the beta cells in pancreas to produce enough insulin [16]. Transplantation of pancreatic islets containing insulin producing \u03b2 cells has recently been used to cure type 1 diabetes. However, allo-islet transplantation is limited owing to shortage of donors; instead, xenotransplantation using islets from non-human animals has emerged as an alternative source of donor tissue. Owing to their physiological similarities to humans, ease of mass breeding, and availability of breeding in pathogen-free facilities, pigs are considered an optimal animal model for xeno-islet transplantation [1]. Especially, the NPCCs have been used valuably as good as the APIs. Although the maturity of NPCCs is lower than that of APIs, NPCCs have some advantages over APIs including, having a relatively simple and inexpensive islet isolation procedure, ability to develop resistance to hypoxic environments and proliferation in vivo after transplantation [1][2][3]. For these reasons, we used 3-5-day-old neonatal pigs as the islet source in this study. \n\nUnfortunately, once pig islets are implanted into human or nonhuman primate blood vessels, severe immune reactions such as IBMIR or hyperacute rejection often occur. IBMIR usually occurs due to several tissue factors (TF) expressed in pig islets that mediate coagulation in human blood vessels via activation of an extrinsic pathway. Alpha-galactose or non-gal antigens expressed on the surface of pig cells can also be targets of natural human antibodies, followed by a complementing cascade activation called hyperacute rejection. As a result, grafts are lost following hypoxia by clot formation from the coagulation pathway and cell death by complement activation in the host [3]. To solve these problems, encapsulation, a method of coating pancreatic islets with biocompatible materials to protect them against attack by antibody or complement reactions, has been tried.",

While elimination of targets of preformed Nabs (particularly elimination of a-gal with creation of a-1,3 Galactosyl transferase gene knockout or GalTKO source pigs) has been essential for successful pig-to-NHP heart and kidney xenotransplantation (4,41,42), the impact of using GalTKO source pigs on xenograft survival in islet transplantation is less conclusive, which may be a function of changes in a-gal expression with islet maturation (43)(44)(45). Similarly, correcting for species incompatibilities between porcine and primate complement regulatory systems through individual insertion of human complement regulatory proteins may not significantly reduce the incidence of IBMIR (44). However, combining carbohydrate antigen gene knockouts with complement regulatory transgenes proves additive: xenogeneic islets from GalTKO.hCD55.hCD59 and GalTKO.hCD39.hCD46 source pigs demonstrated reduced islet loss and attenuated IBMIR (15, 16). More recently, islets derived from neonatal GalTKO.hCD55.hCD59 source pigs demonstrated cure of diabetes with >1 year of insulin independence in the stringent pigto-baboon model (46).",

            "text": "Our results demonstrated a high yield of islets from a single pancreas. Compared to existing protocols (about 600 islets of Langerhans per rat [29] and 1786 \u00b1 350 islets per gram of pig pancreas [15]), and considering that the weight of a rabbit pancreas is approximately 1 g, our isolation results are quite attractive. Our rabbit islet isolation protocol with wellcontrolled digestion times and carefully performed purification steps yielded an average of 4836 \u00b1 604 healthy islets. Despite the similar structure of insulin and C-peptide, as well as the high yield of islets per pancreas, there are limitations associated with obtaining sufficient rabbit islets for human xenotransplantation. On average, obtaining sufficient islets for human therapy would require a significant number of rabbits, based on data from pig islet xenotransplantation [65]. In his study, Prochorov used nine rabbits for one human transplant [42]. However, it is worth noting that the easier care of rabbits and less labor-intensive islet isolation may contribute to the increased interest in using rabbits to obtain islets for research purposes. The high concentration of islets in the pancreas indicates that fewer animals would be required for research, making it a more efficient model for studying pancreatic function and related diseases. For experiments such as those with induced diabetes, various metabolic parameters, etc., a large number n per experimental group, may be required, which, together with the low cost of maintaining rodents, may be a limiting factor for the use of rabbits in these experiments. However, in vitro studies of the islets themselves, as well as xenotransplantation models from rabbits to rodents, will provide a significant reduction in the number of animals used in an experiment. \n\nRabbit islets have a peri-islet membrane, which ensures their integrity and viability after isolation. The viability of isolated islets tends to be 100% by day 3 of observation. The current islet isolation protocols in rats and mice demonstrate a 90-95% failure of isolated islets [29,66].",

            "text": "Porcine insulin is very close to human insulin with only one amino acid of difference, and for many years, until recombinant human insulin became available, it was used in clinical practice to treat diabetes [8] . In many other ways, the pig is a suitable source of islets for xenotransplantation into human recipients. In the last decade, several groups from around the world have shown success in restoring insulin independence for a period > 6 mo in diabetic nonhuman primate recipients of pig islets, a breakthrough achievement in xenotransplantation [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] . While the results of pigto-nonhuman primate models cannot fully predict the pig-to-human results due to dissimilarities among the different donors and recipient species, they are necessary steps to reach clinical application [18,19] . These results provide evidence that porcine islets would very likely function to restore glycemic control in humans. \n\nThe pig is already a potentially interesting donor for tissues and organs (in particular heart, kidney, lung and liver) due to the anatomical and size compatibility with human recipients. Many tissues (e.g., cardiac valves) are already broadly utilized with human patients [20] . While non-vascularized or decellularized tissues such as the valves are easier to implant than organs or islets, as they do not entail the complexity of dealing with xenorejection, the willingness of the public to accept porcine cardiac valves helps lay the groundwork for acceptance of additional medical uses for the pig. \n\nPractical considerations also make the pig a likely candidate for medical use. While nonhuman primates are the closest animals to humans from an evolutionary standpoint and, therefore, would be immunologically and physiologically more adaptive to human needs, their use in clinical xenotransplantation would not likely be accepted. Apes are endangered species, thus raising ethical concerns. They have litters of one or two offspring (like humans) and their growth requires years to reach full size, making it difficult to achieve a sufficient number of potential donors to satisfy demand.",

In addition, transplantation of galactosyl knock-out neonate pig islets was found to significantly enhance normoglycemia rates in diabetic primates, likely due to the decreased susceptibility of these xenografts to innate immunity mediated by complement and preformed xenoantibodies [33] . These results, however, required treatment with a heavy immunosuppressive regimen, in particular an anti-CD154-specific mAb, an antibody that induced thromboembolic events precluding its clinical use [34] . Despite the unacceptability of these immunosuppressive regimens in humans, these results are very encouraging since an alternative, nontoxic regimen combined with xenotransplantation of pig islets may induce normoglycemia in diabetic patients. \n\nA bioartificial pancreas, in which islets of Langerhans are encapsulated within a semipermeable membrane, may be an alternative therapeutic device for patients with insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus. It may constitute a safe and simple method of transplanting islets without the need for immunosuppressive therapy. Since the semipermeable membrane protects the islets from the host immune system, the islets are likely to survive and release insulin for a long period of time, thereby controlling glucose metabolism in the absence of immunosuppressive medication. Nevertheless, several important questions are associated with the transplanta-Dufrane D et al .

Xenotransplantation is a strategy to overcome supply problems. Implantation of tissue obtained early during embryogenesis is a way to reduce transplant immunogenicity. Insulin-producing cells originating from embryonic pig pancreas obtained very early following pancreatic primordium formation (embryonic day 28 (E28)) engraft long-term in non-immune, suppressed diabetic rats or rhesus macaques. Morphologically, similar cells originating from adult porcine islets of Langerhans (islets) engraft in non-immune-suppressed rats or rhesus macaques previously transplanted with E28 pig pancreatic primordia. Our data are consistent with induction of tolerance to an endocrine cell component of porcine islets induced by previous transplantation of embryonic pig pancreas, a novel finding we designate organogenetic tolerance. The potential exists for its use to enable the use of pigs as islet cell donors for humans with no immune suppression requirement.",

            "text": "After the IBMIR, and likely driven, in part, by this event, the adaptive immune response to xenografted islets is largely T cell-mediated (24). Success in NHPs has been achieved only when costimulatory signals between antigen-presenting cells and T helper cells are blocked, especially with an anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Unfortunately, the increased risk of thromboembolic complications with the use of anti-CD154 mAb (25) prevents this biological from being applied clinically, and alternative strategies are warranted. \n\nThe autoimmunity associated with T1D is caused by selfreactive T and B cells directed against proteins expressed in pancreatic b-cells. Proinsulin, islet antigen-2, glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 and -67, and islet cell autoantigen of 69 kDa are the major targets. After allotransplantation of islets, autoimmune lymphocytes can react against the same antigens expressed on grafted islets, thereby contributing to graft failure (26). Although it is largely unknown whether this will occur after islet xenotransplantation, T cells from patients with T1D proliferate when incubated with fetal pig islet-like cell clusters (27), and they are specifically directed against pig glutamic acid decarboxylase. It can be anticipated, therefore, that xenografted pig islets will be subjected to autoimmune activity, as well as xenoimmune activity, to some extent. \n\nThe current evidence is that pig islet transplantation, even if associated with xenosensitization, would not lead to sensitization against alloantigens, and therefore would not compromise subsequent islet or kidney allotransplantation (reviewed in Cooper et al. [28]). Donor age and preparation of pig islets. Significant debate has taken place about whether the ideal islets for clinical transplantation should be from fetal, neonatal, or adult pigs (Table 2). It generally is known that adult pig islets are more difficult to isolate successfully than adult human islets.",

            "text": "The major obstacle to successful xenotransplantation is the immunological incompatibility between donor and recipient. In the present study, we found that the transplantation of isolated and purified caprine islets, in combination with thalidomide treatment, reversed diabetes in STZ-induced diabetic BALB/c mice as evidenced by increased serum insulin and restoration of euglycemia. These  results are consistent with other studies indicating the efficacy of thalidomide treatment in preventing islet graft rejection, improving graft function and survival in the recipient [12]. \n\nCaprine islet grafts in the immunosuppressed group resulted in approximately similar non-fasting blood glucose levels as in the normal control mice which were near to glucose level in caprine (3.2-8.2 mM). As previously reported, islet xenotransplantation in diabetic animal models establishes normoglycemia in the recipients to the point that is normal for the donor instead of the recipient [31,32]. The results of this study showed that caprine islet grafts are capable of reversing diabetes and normalizing blood glucose levels in the recipient's body. \n\nThe IPGTT profiles revealed the glucose responsiveness of the caprine islet grafts, findings that are comparable to results obtained with islet cells recovered from other mammalian species including pigs, primates, and rodents [33][34][35][36][37][38]. In addition, caprine islets elicited an insulin response under both basal-and glucose-stimulated conditions, with insulin levels equivalent to those obtained with islets from other mammals such as pigs, cows, and dogs, but less than those obtained with rodent islets [39]. Rodent islets secrete much more insulin than islets from human or porcine sources, either basally or under glucose stimulation [40]. Caprine islet cells are efficient insulin-producing cells, similar to human and porcine islet cells, because they were able to maintain euglycemia and glucose  responsiveness in recipients.",

            "text": "Hering et al. very recently published an important result from a Phase 3 clinical trial, which had intended to test the efficacy and safety of the standardized human pancreatic islet product in the patients with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) and severe hypoglycemic events (SHEs). The results showed that islet transplantation was effective for preventing hypoglycemic unawareness and providing sustained glycemic control (<5.6% of HbA1c) and thus should be considered for patients with T1D and IAH in whom other less-invasive treatments have been ineffective in preventing SHEs [13]. Although human allogeneic islet transplantation is now considered to be widely applicable to more T1D patients possibly under the coverage of health insurance reimbursement, the supply of donor organ is significantly limited, leading to only 0.1% of the patients gaining access to this promising therapy. \n\nPorcine islets have long been considered to be the best alternative source for the human counterpart [14]. Pigs are easy to breed and have large litters at delivery and, most importantly, have high degree of physiological similarity to humans and a long history of use of porcine insulin for treating T1D patients. In addition, they can be bred in specific pathogen-free (SPF) and/or designated pathogen-free (DPF) status and thus healthier donor pancreata can be supplied unlimitedly, though relatively high cost is required for maintaining them in a clean facility which is regularly monitored for microbial pathogens. To achieve clinical xenotransplantation, several groups started pig-to-NHP islet xenotransplantation from the late 1990s [15]. However, in these early studies, porcine islets that had been transplanted into the portal vein or kidney subcapsule of the monkeys survived only for several days to weeks despite of using strong immunosuppression regimen. Loss of the significant number of islets immediately after transplantation has been the most difficult obstacle to overcome. Goto et al. had focused on this phenomenon and tried to delineate the cellular and molecular mechanism underlying this early islet loss [16].",

To validate and optimize novel therapeutics for safe application in humans, an appropriate large animal model is needed. Large animals, especially pigs, are well suited for biomedical research and share many similarities with humans, including body size, anatomical features, physiology, and pathophysiology. Moreover, pigs already play an important role in translational studies, including clinical trials for xenotransplantation. Progress in genetic engineering over the past few decades has facilitated the development of transgenic animals, including porcine models of diabetes. This article discusses features that attest to the attractiveness of genetically modified porcine models of diabetes for testing novel treatment strategies using recent technical advances.",

            "text": "This was accomplished through the transplantation of wild-type porcine islets, combined with an immunosuppressive regimen that included an anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb; 5C8)-which is not considered clinically applicable-and low-dose sirolimus, with or without ex vivo expanded Treg cells [27]. Subsequently, we reported similar, albeit less robust, outcomes using an anti-CD40 mAb (2C10R4) [28], which has potential for clinical use. Most recently, we maintained normal glycemic control in three of seven diabetic NHPs and significantly reduced the need for exogenous insulin in five of these seven animals. This was achieved using a clinically applicable immunosuppressive regimen that included ATG, adalimumab, anakinra, tocilizumab, intravenous im-munoglobulin, tacrolimus, belimumab, rapamycin, and tofacitinib [29]. While this study could substantially advance the area of islet xenotransplantation clinical trials, the intensity of the immunosuppressive protocol used limits its widespread application. Consequently, additional strategies may be necessary, such as employing genetically engineered pigs or developing novel immunosuppressive drugs with fewer adverse effects.",

Among them, a pig-tobaboon heart transplant experiment at the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported a long survival time of up to 945 days (33). In 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the GalT-KO pigs, the platforms for all transgenic pigs, as a source of human therapeutics including xenotransplantation. In 2022, the University of Alabama reported that a kidney derived from a genetically modified pig was transplanted into a brain-dead decedent (34), which marked the first clinical application of xenotransplantation from a pig to a human. The 10-GE pig kidneys were transplanted into a man who was brain dead from head trauma after bilateral nephrectomy. No HAR and PERV transmission were observed. Although the porcine kidney produced urine within 30 min, serum creatinine did not decrease during the study period. Histological findings on postoperative periods demonstrated endothelial injury with diffuse thrombotic microangiopathy. The decedent's general condition deteriorated after transplantation, leading to progressive multiple organ failure. Thus, the study was terminated only after 3 days. Further study, including the mechanisms and prevention of microvascular injuries, is required to uncover the etiology of poor renal recovery. \n\nPig islet transplantation into a human has a longer history than organ transplantation in xenotransplantation (35)(36)(37). Transplantation of encapsulated wild-type porcine islets to established brittle type 1 diabetes mellitus was performed without immunosuppression, which resulted in improved HbA1c and reduced unaware hypoglycemic events (37). However, only a slight decrease in insulin doses was observed, and no patient could achieve insulin independence. Aside from encapsulated islet transplantation, there have been attempts to transplant naked porcine islets into NHPs.",

            "text": "Xenogeneic islets, in particular porcine islets, have been explored as an alternative primary cell source to supplement the supply of primary human islets for transplantation.Porcine islets are more readily available and possess functional characteristics that make them a suitable substitute for human islets.They have weaker immunogenicity and porcine insulin is structurally similar to human insulin (with one amino acid difference that is alanine in pigs and threonine in humans) (45).Major hurdles need to be overcome for xenografts to be a feasible alternative in the clinic.These include physiological incompatibility and immunological reaction to non-human donor tissues that trigger both innate and adaptive barriers of the immune system, resulting in rejection.In addition, xenotransplantation presents the potential risk of zoonosis and porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERVs).As such, previous studies have evaluated the feasibility of xenotransplantation of porcine islets into non-human primates (NHPs).One study showed that an anti-CD40 (2C10R4) monoclonal antibody-based immunosuppressive regimen together with tacrolimus was effective in circumventing graft rejection and prolonging porcine islet graft survival in diabetic rhesus monkeys, with median survival (serum porcine C-peptide concentration of >0.15 ng/mL) of 60 days.All monkeys also received anti-thymocyte globulin, cobra venom factor (CVF), adalimumab, and sirolimus (46).In another study, a newly engineered anti-CD40L-specific monoclonal antibody AT-1501 was tested in a cynomolgus macaque model that had undergone intrahepatic islet allotransplantation.The study showed that AT-1501 enabled long-term graft survival with higher C-peptide levels detected compared with conventional immunosuppression (47).AT-1501 was modified to minimize risk of thromboembolic complications that were previously reported for CD40L-based therapies in clinical trials, and therefore appears to be a promising and safe agent for further testing.",

            "text": "Pancreatic or islet transplantations have a long history in human patients that evolved in parallel with experimental procedures in mice and dogs (reviewed in [70,71]). At that time, the aim was not to treat diabetic dogs, but to use those dogs as an animal model to perform pancreatic or islet transplants on that could generate knowledge to be applied in human medicine. The first successful canine pancreas allotransplantation was reported in 1927 [72] and continued ever since [73][74][75][76][77][78] (Figure 3(2)). Unfortunately, long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs remains essential in these patients (reviewed in [79]). One of the technical bottlenecks in pancreas allotransplantation is the surgical risk that digestive enzymes of the exocrine pancreas leak into the abdominal cavity during the procedure, resulting in significant morbidity and/or mortality [71]. Therefore, research has focused on the development of islet transplantation techniques as a less invasive alternative to replace the non-functional pancreas (Figure 3(3)). Islet dissociation, purification, and possible ectopic sites for transplantation (intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intrahepatic) were investigated in rodents, pigs, and dogs [70], and the liver is now considered the gold standard for ectopic transplantation sites in rodents [80]. \n\nDogs were used as a pre-clinical large animal model before islet cell transplantations were performed in humans. In most studies, pancreatic islet allotransplantation was conducted in healthy dogs that were made insulin-dependent by either pancreatectomy or drug therapy [81][82][83][84][85]. However, a few studies were performed in dogs with spontaneous DM (Table 1). In 1985, the first allotransplantation of at least 30 \u00d7 10 3 islets in the liver of dogs with spontaneously occurring T1DM as well as in pancreatectomised dogs was reported, which resulted in normal blood glucose levels [86].",

Patients suffering from degenerative and autoimmune diseases could benefit from such treatments. In particular, pancreatic islet allotransplantation for the treatment of type I diabetes became a clinical reality thanks to great advances in islet isolation and preservation and to less aggressive immunosuppression. Transplantation of other cell types such as hepatocytes, bone marrow, or umbilical cord stem cells is also used in the clinic today while neural cell transplantation which could represent a significant step forward in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders is still in an early development stage. However, and regardless of tissue-specific considerations and difficulties, a common major obstacle standing in the way of wide-spread use of cell transplantation is the lack of human donors, therefore opening the door for the use of alternative sources of cells from other species. In this context, pigs emerged as suitable candidates for providing xenocells due to anatomical and physiological similarities with humans. The possibility of genetically modifying donor pigs to mitigate the host immune reaction to xenografted cells and to adapt their function to human physiology when needed will definitely accelerate the transition of cell xenotransplantation from the bench to the clinic.",

            "text": "Thus, problems with detection of xenogeneic C-peptide should not be the basis of transplant validation, as soon as normoglycemia is present. Yet, the possible metabolic pathway of xenogeneic C-peptide is speculative; however, it might lay on the root of recipient species' enzymatic activity. \n\nHowever, despite these reports, the authors decided to conduct research using porcine pancreatic islets and demonstrate the functionality of bionic pancreatic constructs. There is a difference in the anatomy of pancreatic islets between species: mice and pigs islets differ in their morphology and distribution of specific cells within an islet [42,43]. However, despite these differences, pig islets are the most anatomically and functionally similar to human islets. Therefore, the authors decided to use them in this study [44]. Moreover, in light of the available studies, it was shown that porcine islets are as functional as mouse islets, so they can be used in studies in a mouse model. Therefore, by providing each mouse with an additional 3000 pancreatic islets, it was expected that the islets in a well-functioning pancreas would be less active. Therefore, the analysis of the C-peptide and glucose levels in fasting mice allowed the determination of the functionality of the bionic scaffolds. Their functionality was demonstrated by decreasing the concentration of mouse C-peptide and lowering glucose levels. The results of glucose and C-peptide measurements confirmed this assumption and thus became another milestone in research into new therapies in T1D (type 1 diabetes) [44][45][46]. \n\nThere is no doubt that pancreas or pancreatic islet transplantation is currently the only method of treating people with type 1 diabetes who suffer from severe complications. Islets isolation and transplantation have shown great progress in development in recent years [47]. However, despite intensive progress in the field of transplantation, transplan-tation of pancreatic islets or the entire pancreas is still not an ideal solution. Therefore, transplantology is more and more willing to cooperate with other scientific fields, e.g., tissue engineering using 3D-bioprinting technology from natural polymers [47].",

            "text": "Human pancreatic islet transplantation through portal vein infusion, is a current clinical beta-cell replacement therapy to treat patients with advanced Type I Diabetes (T1D). However, live-long immunosuppression, difficulties to achieve long-term islet graft function and insulin independence as well as the shortage of suitable pancreata from heart-beating brain-dead donors for islet isolation, are still important limitations for ongoing allo-transplantation programs. \n\nPig islet xenotransplantation is a promising alternative to overcome the bottleneck of islet availability for the treatment of T1D. However, clinical application of pig to human islet transplantation will depend on genetic engineering of pigs to overcome immune barriers and to reduce risks of pathogen infection of porcine viruses (1). Recently, significant progress has been achieved with the transplantation of pig organs presenting several genomic modifications to prevent hyperacute rejection (2,3) and cellular immune responses (4,5). In immunosuppressed nonhuman primates, long-term control of diabetes by the transplantation of adult porcine islets had been successfully achieved (6,7). Other strategies to protect porcine islets from the host immune system include islet encapsulation in semi-permeable hydrogel, such as alginate (8) functionalized by bioactive ligands or by poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) derivatives (9,10). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells and play an important role in tissue repair, angiogenesis and their immunomodulatory action on immune cells have been widely studied (11,12). In the field of islet transplantation MSC are investigated for the improvement of islet function and graft survival after transplantation. Numerous studies of co-culture and co-transplantation with MSCs indicate a functional support. However, due to variable transplantation settings and origins of MSCs the immunomodulatory role, as well as their ability to reduce inflammatory processes in vivo remains controversial.",

G} ottingen minipigs are used most widely because they can be reared to adulthood at reasonable cost. Initially this model was considered to be a model of type 1 diabetes, occasionally requiring additional streptozotocin or alloxan injection to increase the reduction of the b-cell mass 221 . Subsequent exploration disclosed the correlation of the b-cell mass and the extent of insulin deficiency, providing a model of type 2 diabetes 222 . Inconsistency of hyperglycemia is ascribed to compensatory b-cell activation in the remaining b-cells 223 . The large size of animals allowed the sequence of perturbed insulin secretion and its association with islet pathology to be shown 224 .\n\nThere is a long history of studying non-human primates for translational research in metabolic diseases ( Figure 2). Commonly used species include rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), cynomologus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), baboons (Papio species), African Green Monkeys (Chlorocebus species), and common marmocets (Callithrix jacchus) 225,226 . There are clear differences in the metabolic regulation of lipogenesis, thermogenesis as well as insulin-mediated glucose utilization between monkeys and humans. Notwithstanding, studies in non-human primates have led directly to translational studies confirming the same mechanism in humans. In particular, it is of note that the presence of islet amyloidosis with marked bcell loss characteristic of type 2 diabetes is common in humans and diabetic monkeys, implicating a similar etiology of islet lesions in monkeys and humans 227 . An important advantage of the use of non-human primate models includes their close genetic relationship to humans and physiological similarity to humans. The relatively larger size of the animal is well suited to imaging studies of islets or transplantation studies 228",

            "text": "Studies in the pig-to-NHPs islet xenoTx model are needed to provide evidence of safety and efficacy prior to clinical phase 1 and 2 trials. To meet these criteria, preclinical studies should be performed in diabetic NHPs; to obtain these, three different approaches have been used. Spontaneous diabetes, reported in several strains of monkeys including cynomolgus, is usually associated with age, obesity, \u03b2-cell degeneration, and extensive amyloid deposition [33]; the availability of these monkeys is limited, and their diabetes could not be considered as a faithful T1D model. Surgical pancreatectomy is a second option, but its execution is difficult and it has associated morbidity problems. This technique is probably the most convincing in the generation of irreversible diabetes, but pancreatectomy needs to be total to avoid potential residual function and possibly \u03b2-cell regeneration, and it has the disadvantage of eliminating the endogenous exocrine pancreatic function. The third approach currently used is chemical induction of hyperglycemia through streptozotocin (STZ) [34]. STZ is a compound derived from the bacterium Streptomyces achromogenes with the ability to selectively destroy \u03b2 cells by DNA damage and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide depletion [34]. Its intravenous administration successfully achieves killing of \u03b2 cells and subsequent induction of hyperglycemia, but a discussion on the optimal dose remains an open problem. \n\nA single dose of 30 mg/kg of STZ is not sufficient to induce complete diabetes; although larger doses (100-150 mg/kg) are, they are also associated with harmful side effects [11,35]. Nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity are some of the major disadvantages of high-dose STZ; nonetheless, STZ-induced diabetic monkeys usually remain diabetic and insulin dependent for years, with no significant endogenous C-peptide release even after glucose stimulation and histologic evidence of only a few insulin-staining cells surviving in the pancreas [11].",

Eloy et al. described normalization of glucose after transplantation of E15, but not E18 embryonic chick pancreas into non-immune-suppressed STZ-diabetic immune-competent rats [23]. Abraham et al. [24] described successful xenoengraftment in multiple organs of human pancreatic isletderived progenitor cells infused in nonimmunosuppressed immune-competent mice. It is possible that xenotransplantation of fetal pancreas is particularly suited to induction of tolerance. However, neither Eloy et al. [23], nor Abraham et al. [24], nor we [7,8,[10][11][12] define an immunological mechanism.\n\nAlthough the antigenicity of fetal tissues may be less than that of corresponding adult tissues, animal data suggest the reduction is not enough by itself to ensure permanent graft survival [25]. Thus, the use of embryonic tissue (pancreas) per se cannot explain our findings. Host immune suppression is required for successful engraftment of embryonic pig pancreas in rodents [16] or nonhuman primates [17] carried out using methodology different from ours. Therefore, it is likely that one or more differential factors in the methodology we employ are critical for engraftment of embryonic pig pancreas without an immune suppression requirement. Such factors could include the developmental stage of embryos from which primordia are obtained, the number of pancreatic primordia transplanted, the manner in which embryonic pancreas organs are incubated in vitro prior to implantation, the diabetic status of the host, the transplantation site and methodology for securing the implants in place, and the stringency by which glucose levels in diabetic hosts are controlled after transplantation [13].\n\nWe have proposed [13] that transplantation of E28 pig pancreatic primordia in the mesentery and migration of cells",

Recent clinical and preclinical trials of islet cell transplantation and xenotransplantation, respectively, suggest that xenogeneic cellular therapy may indeed provide a viable option for the treatment of diabetes. Serendipitously, adult pig islets do not express the galactosyl-\u03b1-1,3-galactose epitope. Instead, rejection [39] of xenogeneic islets in NHPs results from direct or indirect activation of T cells by donor pig xenopeptides. Targeted prevention of T cell co-stimulation has led to great strides in pig islet xenotransplantation to NHPs [40,41]. However, maintenance of immunosuppression puts patients at risk for opportunistic infections, and can cause significant cardiovascular, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, and (in female patients) reproductive toxicity [42,43]. Pig transgenesis could provide an alternative approach to systemic T-cell costimulation blockade, instead relying on the local provision of immunotherapeutic proteins by the xenograft [44,45].\n\nPrevention of zoonotic transmission of pathogens from donor pigs to patients is also crucial for clinical application of porcine xenotransplantation. Although husbandry in a biosecure environment can eliminate most risk, endogenous agents such as porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) require special attention. Indeed, upon co-cultivation of pig and human cells, PERVs inefficiently traverse the species barrier [46][47][48]. Although no evidence of pig to human transfer has ever been observed in vivo [49][50][51], it is prudent to develop pigs with a reduced genetic potential for PERV transmission [52][53][54][55][56].",

These include in particular anti-CD154 antibodies and also FTY720, anti-LFA-1 antibodies, and LFA-3-Ig. Alternative strategies, such as antagonistic anti-CD40 antibodies, are being investigated; however, none of these investigational antibodies will be available for clinical research in islet xenotransplantation in the very foreseeable future.\n\nThe risks of immunotherapeutic protocols being developed for initial pilot clinical trials must not be higher than the risks associated with immunosuppression currently used clinically in organ and islet allotransplantation. For islet xenotransplantation to be applied very broadly in the future, a rejection prophylaxis with a very favorable safety profile will be required. It is reasonable to assume that immunotherapeutic protocols will become increasingly more selective and safe as our understanding of the immunobiology of islet xenotransplantation improves.\n\nThe second major obstacle to broader clinical application of islet xenotransplantation is the high number of designated pathogen-free donor pancreases required for manufacturing a therapeutic patient dose of neonatal porcine and adult pig islets. The minimum number of nonencapsulated pig islets transplanted to achieve normoglycemia in NHP has been 50 000 IEQ/kg or greater for neonatal islets 99,102,103 and 25 000 IEQ/kg or greater for adult islets, 98 though much greater numbers have been transplanted in some studies",

As summarized above, prolonged porcine islet xenograft survival has been achieved with protocols based on CD154-CD40 costimulatory blockade by several groups. However, long-term functional survival exceeding 180 days, the efficacy milestone to be met in 5 or more of 8 NHP before initiating clinical trials according to the consensus statement of the International Xenotransplantation Association, 126,127 has been demonstrated in only a small proportion of transplanted NHPs (1 to 2 of 3 to 7 in several studied cohorts; Table 1). Lack of more consistent success could be ascribed to failure of the protocol to prevent rejection or to failure of the preclinical model to accommodate the protocol. 128 Therefore, continued understanding and improvement of the preclinical animal model is a critical requirement for documenting longterm success on a consistent basis.\n\nLong-term success has also been precluded by a high proportion of engraftment failure after porcine islet transplantation due to IBMIR and complement-mediated lysis of islets triggered by binding of preformed xenoreactive antibodies. Engraftment of neonatal porcine islets has recently improved considerably with the use of GT-KO donors. 103,111 Early posttransplant loss of adult islets from GT-KO can be very significant, 107 possibly due to the activation of complement by transplanted islets via the alternative pathway. 106",

            "text": "The use of xenogeneic sources is another valid strategy for overcoming donor organ shortage. Previously, xenogeneic insulin from pigs has been adopted for human diabetes treatment for more than 60 years because of the amino acid similarity of porcine insulin to human insulin. The idea of using porcine islets as an alternative source of human islets was also derived from biological evidence. Porcine islets have the ability to respond to glucose stimuli within the same physiological range as human islets. Another advantage is the easy and reproducible isolation procedure. In contrast to human islet isolation, procedures adopted for porcine sources allow the preparation of high-quality porcine islets with good predictability and without being compromised by comorbidities, brain death, and ischemia. Additionally, porcine islets might be potentially used for highly allosensitized patients who present circulating antibodies against human leukocyte antigens (HLA), limiting the donors' pool of compatibility with those patients (226). \n\nInitially, the clinical use of porcine sources encountered some relevant limitations, especially related to the risk of zoonosis and more specifically, to the risk of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) transmission (227). This can be overcome by genetic modification of the donor pigs. In a recent study, Yang et al. demonstrated the production of pigs with genetically inactivated PERVs using a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 and transposon technologies (228). Therefore, the use of animal sources coupled with advanced gene editing and cloning strategies has provided the opportunity to obtain genetically modified endocrine pancreatic sources, which can potentially cancel these concerns and improve their function. In this scenario, the low risk-benefit ratio of exploiting porcine islets as an alternative source to human islets makes them a promising option for the treatment of T1D (226). \n\nTwo fundamental aspects need to be considered when choosing the optimal porcine islet source: age and strain. Adult pigs can supply mature and large islets with the potential to efficiently secrete insulin within a few minutes or hours after transplantation, and the number of islets isolated from a sole adult pig might be sufficient for T1D patients (229).",

As a consequence, nonhuman primates became the preferred choice in many experimental settings [75]. \n\nAlthough being the model that resembles the situation in humans at its best, the use of NHPs is often limited by increased regulatory requirements and ethical concerns. The high demands on husbandry and training, zoonotic risks, and the need for personal protective equipment are making these experiments extremely costly. Nevertheless, baboons, cynomolgus monkeys, and rhesus macaques do have the unique cross-reactivity with human immunoreagents. NHPs are frequently used in xenotransplantation research, using pigs as organ donors. Pigs are usually the donors, as they can be relatively easy genetically manipulated, e.g., with knockout of the Gal antigen. As a result of the size ratio, baboons are frequently used as recipients in solid organ pig xenotransplantation. Smaller NHPs, such as cynomolgus macaques, play an important role in xeno-islet transplantation [75]. \n\nIn contrast, pig and dog models are a satisfactory solution offering a relative ease of experimental handling, lower costs of breeding and handling, and in terms of pigs, they are socially more accepted [9]. However, the choices of available species-specific immunoreagents are still limited, but the increased demand is leading to the development of new reagents [9].",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation has the potential to overcome the severe shortage of human organ donors. Recent studies suggest that pancreatic islet xenotransplantation has an impressive potential to become the first standardized clinical application of xenotransplantation. 26,27 However, the high immunogenicity of the grafts poses a major obstacle for the success and widespread of xenotransplantation as a standard therapy. 0][31] Furthermore, acute rejection mediated by the concerted action of T cells, B cells and antibodies may lead to xenograft dysfunction and rejection. After xenotransplantation, MHC mismatch between donor and recipient leads to humoural and cellular immune responses, ultimately leading to the development of acute and chronic rejection of the graft. 32,33 Although strong immunosuppressive treatments may prevent or delay acute rejection, the development of chronic vasculopathies is a risk for the survival of the xenograft. 28 5][36] Hence, here we evaluated the impact of silencing SLA expression in the strength of human humoural and cellular immune responses. As the compact structure of the islets represents a major hurdle to vector transduction of the inner cell mass of the islets, we have dissociated the islets to achieve higher transduction efficiencies and allowing the generation of low immunogenic islets. According to the limited data available in the literature, islet isolation from neonatal pigs may have advantages over adult pigs. Some reports suggest that islets' isolation during the first week of life may have minor advantages over later weeks. Among the advantages listed, the authors highlight the surprisingly better islet yield per gram of pancreas even when compared to adult pigs, together with an easier islet isolation and higher resistance to hypoxia, F I G U R E 3 Silencing SLA expression does not affect cell viability.

Furthermore, the recent progress of porcine organ graft survival in nonhuman primates may spur the possibility of successful xenotransplantation [96] . Pigs have been considered a source of islet replacement therapy for T1DM for many years [97] . In 1994, in a first-in-human trial, Groth et al [98] transplanted fetal pig islets encased within the human kidney capsule into T1DM patients. The study was remarkable as porcine C-peptide was detectable for more than 300 d, without any observable serious side effects, although there was no insulin independence or reduction in exogenous insulin requirement. Encapsulated pig islets, branded as Diabecell \u00ae , to treat patients with unstable T1DM have undergone clinical trials in New Zealand and Argentina, and encouraging preliminary results indicate correction of hypoglycemic unawareness and improved a modest reduction in the hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. However, detectable porcine C-peptide was strikingly absent in these subjects [99][100][101][102][103] .",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation using porcine pancreatic islets has the potential to alleviate donor shortages and to provide a nearly unlimited source of beta cells. Along with successful porcine islet isolation, the need for a site that can provide optimal revascularisation leading to adequate blood glucose control is essential for long-term success [1]. We have previously shown that fetal pig pancreatic fragments (FPPFs) transplanted under the kidney capsule where these kidneys were subsequently transplanted can effectively cure both renal failure and diabetes in a single transplant [1]. Xenotransplantation of a composite kidney/FPPF graft would have the significant advantages of only requiring a single transplant and giving time for the FPPFs to mature prior to transplantation [1].\n\nThese findings are extremely relevant to both neonatal and adult islet tissues as ultimately all islet tissue is calculated on the same basis of islet equivalence and so when transplanted ends up developing to provide the same functional mass and capacity regardless of the site into which it is transplanted.\n\nWe have compared outcomes for porcine islets transplanted into three sites: kidney, liver and spleen subcapsular spaces. Porcine islets transplanted beneath the kidney capsule performed well. Transplant of islets into the kidney subcapsule showed superior results for recipient blood glucose and insulin response compared with islets transplanted into the liver and spleen. The kidney subcapsular transplant site outcomes support the findings of our companion paper investigating mouse and human islets [8].\n\nThe choice of site for the transplant has an impact on both long-term outcome and short-term complications. While the kidney has advantages shown in this study and in [8], it is unlikely to be a viable clinical option due to the small subcapsular space available in the human kidney. Groth et al were the first to transplant fetal pig islets under the kidney capsule in humans in the clinical setting [10]. However, despite having biopsiable tissue, no graft had functional porcine C-peptide release. Nevertheless, Groth et al's study supports the potential application of composite islet/renal grafts wherein readily accessible extra islets could be co-transplanted with a kidney graft. Alternatively, the islets could be co-",

Inert polyethylene microspheres served as a control for the effects of portal embolization. Digital analysis of immunohistochemistry targeting IBMIR mediators was performed at 1 and 24 h after intraportal islet infusion. Early findings observed in transplanted islets include complement and antibody deposition, and infiltration by neutrophils, macrophages and platelets. Insulin, complement, antibody, neutrophils, macrophages and platelets were similar between GTKO and WT islets, with increasing macrophage infiltration at 24 h in both phenotypes. This model provides an objective and internally controlled study of distinct islet preparations and documents the temporal histology of IBMIR.",

The ideal porcine candidate for xenotransplantation is a pig devoid of any zoonotic micro-organisms and PERV-C. PERV-inactivation has proved to be beneficial for successful xenotransplantation. Pigs that have been genetically modified to PERV have the potential to offer safe and effective organ and tissue supplies for xenotransplantation in the future. Combating zoonotic microorganisms can be accomplished through evaluation and screening processes and by breeding genes devoid of PERV, resulting in PERV knockout pigs, both of which may aid in reducing the risk of zoonotic infections. Pre-xenotransplantation microbial investigations, monitoring of the recipient, and a treatment plan designed especially for the recipient to avoid disease conditions all require careful planning. The latest innovations in xenotransplantation need to be built upon by evaluating the limitations of genetic engineering and proposing strategies for their advancement. Still, significant challenges to clinical human islet xenotransplantation are present, and future efforts should be directed toward developing an ideal genetically engineered swine islet donor source and establishing long-term viable islets with clinically meaningful immunosuppression. Researchers have proven that by successfully bypassing all the hurdles faced in xenotransplantation, in addition to being an effective means of obtaining normal blood glucose levels and reducing several illnesses associated with diabetes, it might embark a novel way for new therapeutic options for type 1 diabetic patients. Lowering the risk of post-xenotransplantation rejection reactions, IBMIR loss, acute inflammation, and chronic inflammatory markers in newly genetically modified porcines will not only increase graft survival but also further advance this field of research.",

Morel Transplant Unit, Department of Surgery, University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland Porcine pancreases are considered as a suitable source of islets for future use in xenotransplantation, because of the similarity between human and porcine insulin. However, mass isolation of porcine islets remains a real challenge, because of the important fragility of pig islets. Transplantation in a large animal model should provide an adequate support to better assess the feasibility of pig islet isolation and transplantation. Method: Islets were isolated from pancreases of slaughterhouse pigs (age 5-8 month), using a modified automated method. From one pancreas we obtained a mean + SD of 115'000 + 57'107 purified islets. The islets were transplanted by intraportal embolisati0n into the liver of surgically panereatectomized pigs. Each recipient was transplanted with islets pooled from 3 donors, which represents a number of purified islets ranging from 205'000 to 667'000\"(6'949 to 29'000 islets/kg body weight of the recipient). Study gTOUpS: In group (N=6), the recipients did not receive any immunosuppression. In group 2 (N=4) an immunosuppressive treatment of CsA (6 mg/kg/d) and Azathioprine (5 mg/kg/d) was administred by intra-venous (N=3) or intra-muscular (N=I) route, until rejection. The daily monitoring consisted of plasma glucose and insulin measurements. Liver biopsies were performed after recurrence of hyperglycemia and analysed for histology and immunohistological staining for insulin.

            "text": "Initially, due to the easy isolation process, fetal pig islet-like cell clusters (ICCs) and neonatal pig islets (NPIs) have been used to reverse hyperglycemia in mice studies. In addition to their easy isolation process, ICCs and NPIs are apparently resistant to ischemic and inflammatory damage. Despite these advantages, the following demerits questioned their clinical applicability: 2 to 3 months of maturation time to achieve in vivo functionality (38, 39), poor insulin response to glucose (40,41), and complete destruction of ICCs within 12 days post-transplantation in diabetic monkeys (42). After that, the transplantation biologist focused on neonatal pig islets-comprised of differentiated pancreatic endocrine cells (about 35%) and primarily epithelial cells (about 57%). In contrast to ICCs, NPIs present the following important attributes: b cell expansion, significant ability for differentiation of epithelial cells into b cells, and comparatively higher responsiveness to glucose (43)(44)(45). Ironically, the use of NPI, however, was questioned by the high expression of xeno-antigens including sialic acid antigens, Hanganutziu-Deicher antigens, and Gala1-3Galb1-4GlcNAc-R (21). Furthermore, just 50,000 NPIs per neonatal pancreas are not sufficient for its large-scale clinical applicability, and as a result, four neonate pig donors are required to treat a diabetic primate weighing 6-8 kg (46). However, less harvesting time and reduction in the housing cost of pigs led to the use of these islets in various trials (discussed later in this article). On the contrary, approximately 255,000 adult pig islets (APIs) with high purity (80-95%) can be isolated from an adult pig donor, and based on the Edmonton protocol, 5,000-10,000 IEQ/kg is needed to treat hyperglycemia (11,32). Therefore, APIs are considered as a better source to correct hyperglycemia compared with ICCs and NPIs.",

The findings in GIPR dn transgenic pigs suggest that, in addition to its role as an incretin hormone, GIP is necessary for the expansion of \u2424-cell mass and that its partial loss of function cannot be fully compensated by hyperactivation of the GLP-1/GLP-1R system. \n\nIn conclusion, GIPR dn transgenic pigs resemble characteristic features of human type 2 diabetic patients very closely in the following ways: disturbed GIP function, glucose intolerance, and reduced pancreatic \u2424-cell mass. Moreover, GIPR dn transgenic pigs may be an attractive animal model for the development and preclinical evaluation of incretin-based therapeutic strategies (40). Another potential application of GIPR dn transgenic pigs is the development of novel techniques for dynamic in vivo monitoring of pancreatic islet mass (41). Due to their size and close physiological and anatomical similarities to humans (42), pigs represent attractive animal models for translating novel therapeutic and diagnostic principles into clinical practice.",

Here we review recent progress in preclinical models of pig islet xenotransplantation and discuss the remaining challenges that need to be addressed before the application of this form of therapy can be established in patients with T1D. \n\nDuring the past decade, islet allotransplantation alone (without previous kidney transplantation) using deceased human donor pancreata has been indicated mainly in patients who have had T1D for .5 years with life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes and wide fluctuations in blood glucose levels. Although the initial long-term results were rather disappointing (2), the results of islet allotransplantation have improved significantly in recent years, with 5-year insulinindependent normoglycemia achieved in .50% of patients at experienced centers (3). There is increasing evidence that successful islet allotransplantation greatly reduces the incidence of hypoglycemic episodes (2) and reduces or slows the incidence of late complications of T1D (4). This may extend the indications for islet transplantation to patients with progressive complications. For example, islet transplantation in a patient with preterminal renal failure may prevent disease progression, possibly avoiding the need for hemodialysis and kidney transplantation, provided that nonnephrotoxic immunosuppressive drug therapy is administered. \n\nCurrently, in the U.S., the median waiting time for a kidney allograft from a deceased human donor is .4 years (5). However, islets from two deceased human donor pancreata are frequently required to achieve normoglycemia in a diabetic patient.",

            "text": "Among the newer treatment strategies that have been proposed, transplantation of pancreatic islets, obtained either from other human or animal donors, has received considerable attention worldwide. This is because islet transplantation can restore not only the insulin-secreting unit, but also the precise insulin release in response to rising blood glucose and multiple signals arising within and beyond the islets. Because human islet transplantation is limited by the shortage of human islet tissue, human embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from the patient are being developed into transplantable insulin producing cells. Recent reports indicate that iPS cells may not be transplantable into mice of the same strain without immune rejection (Zhao et al, 2011). The US FDA guidelines highlight concerns that stem cell derived lines may undergo malignant transformation or develop into teratomas after transplantation (Fink et al 2009). While stem cell line-derived insulin producing cells are still at an early stage of research, pig islets are viewed as a promising alternative since: (a) the supply of pig pancreatic cells can be increased by breeding more donor animals; (b) pig and human insulins have close structural and biological similarities; and (c) physiological glucose levels in pigs are similar to those in humans (Elliott, 2011). The rationale for this treatment approach (termed 'xenotransplantation') is that the implanted pig islets have the potential to mimic the normal physiological insulin response in type 1 diabetics, such that near-normal blood glucose levels may be achievable without insulin injections or with reduced requirements. As a consequence, long-term diabetes complications may be prevented and patients should experience less hypoglycaemia than they do with the currently recommended 'intensive' insulin regimens. Thus the need and rationale for improved diabetes control is clear but the effectiveness and practicality of islet transplants, whether from human, porcine or other sources, has yet to be firmly established. As with any transplanted tissue, organ or cells, whether from human or animal, the host immune system must be considered. Immunosuppression has been studied and used extensively in islet transplant patients.",

            "text": "In the rat transplantation model, our data extends our previous observation in the mouse model that embryonic pig pancreatic tissue harvested at different gestational time points, including E28 and E42, are fiercely rejected upon transplantation into immune-competent recipients. Considering that E42 tissue exhibits more robust growth potential, the new data presented here further support the suggestion that E42 pancreatic pig tissue is best suited for transplantation in diabetic recipients, at least in this rodent xenotransplantation model. Our results are in contrast to the previous suggestion of Rogers and colleagues (6,9) that E28 pancreatic tissue can evade the immune system in Lewis rats. Our failure to find in these rats any detectable trace of pig pancreatic tissue cannot be due to growth deficiencies, as the same E28 tissue exhibited growth and development in immune deficient Nude rats.\n\nThis discrepancy between our results and those of Rogers and colleagues (6,9) are intriguing. However, it should be noted that in the latter study pig insulin blood levels were not monitored to establish the role of the pig implant in attaining normoglycemia, and, therefore, it is conceivable that autologous recovery of the rat islets might have occurred as suggested in other recent studies (24,25). While unable to evade the immune system in our models, early embryonic pig or human tissues were shown to be less immunogenic compared with their adult counterparts (1,2,10,11,18,19,26). Thus, it was important to define a minimally toxic immunosuppressive protocol for transplantation of embryonic pig tissues. In our initial attempt to demonstrate the proof of concept in the NHP model, we chose a conventional protocol comprising induction with ATG and rituxan, followed by maintenance with CTLA4-Ig, RAD, and FTY720. This relatively intensive immune suppression enabled us to demonstrate that, indeed, implanted E42 pig pancreatic tissue can grow, differentiate, and induce complete insulin independence in diabetic NHP (20). However, further reduction of this immune suppression protocol is desirable before applying this approach for studies in diabetic primates or humans.\n\nOur previous experience in mice, similar to results in",

            "text": "Optimizing pig donor age for multi-organ retrieval for xenoTx poses a significant practical problem for companies seeking to raise pigs for xenotransplantation. Arefranian/Rayat et al. present a study that compares the functional performance of neonatal pig islets at ages, 3, 5, 7, or 10 days, with the aim to identify a preferable donor age. They concluded that islets from 7-day-old donors offer higher yields and better functions. \n\nMost studies focusing on porcine islet physiology examine beta cell function and insulin secretion, but less is known about glucagon responses by porcine alpha cells. Mourad et al. at the University Catholique de Louvain assessed glucagon secretion by comparing neonatal porcine islets with adult porcine islets. Glucagon and insulin were assessed both in vitro through dynamic perifusion of isolated islets and in vivo with glucose tolerance tests. Porcine beta cells have been known to be less responsive to glucose stimulation than human beta cells; however, Mourad et al. demonstrated that porcine alpha cells are particularly responsive to glucose changes. These findings suggest the critical role of glucagon in porcine islet physiology and underscore the importance of characterizing species-specific differences in endocrine cell function. The combination of low insulin response to glucose by beta cells and the potent glucose-mediated inhibitory response of glucagon secretion by alpha cells may explain the supraphysiologic blood glucose levels in recipients after porcine islet transplantation even if adequate numbers of islets are transplanted. \n\nThe other studies included in this Research Topic introduce new and emerging strategies for islet replacement. Kano et al. describes progress led by his group and others in organogenesis using blastocyst complementation. Since it was first proposed in 2010, substantial technical improvements have led to notable successes in rat-to-mouse islet xenotransplantation (19). This technology is still in its infancy, and there are still challenges that limit the rapid translation of these results from small animal studies to large animal interspecies studies.",

Embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells combined with genome editing technologies are valuable tools to probe disease mechanisms, engineer in desired attributes such as safety switches and upon differentiation to use as potential replacement cell sources. Other potential cell sources are pigs, possibly with human pancreas. Such 'humanized' animals might also prove valuable for disease modeling, as will other genetically modified species. To accompany cell sources some form of immunoprotection will be required, such as retrievable planar, bead or fiber encapsulation devices. \n\nAs an alternative to using modified porcine organs, it is conceivable to combine gene knockouts in key developmental genes and interspecies chimeras to produce pigs with complementing human organs that can be harvested for transplant. As proof of concept for chimera complementation, Nakauchi et al. first created mice with rat pancreas 11 , and subsequently rats with mice pancreas 12 . These remarkable feats were achieved by injecting rat pluripotent stem cells into early-stage mouse embryos that lacked the Pdx1 gene, or mouse pluripotent stem cells into early-stage rat embryos that lacked the Pdx1 gene, respectively. Furthermore, islets isolated from rats with mouse pancreas were able to successfully reverse diabetes in recipient mice for >1 year, in the absence of chronic immunosuppression. These data provide compelling evidence for the therapeutic potential of stem cell-derived islets generated by blastocyst complementation in a xenogeneic host. As a next step towards the generation of pigs with human pancreas, knockout pig embryos were created with an apancreatic phenotype. Complementation of these embryos with allogenic blastomeres then created functioning pancreata in the vacant niches 13 . Ethical issues and regulations in Japan currently preclude testing the feasibility of reconstituting pancreas from human pluripotent stem cells in these animals.",

We investigated whether the transgenic expression of a human complement\u2010regulatory protein (hCD46) on porcine islets would improve the outcome of islet xenotransplantation in streptozotocin\u2010induced diabetic Cynomolgus monkeys. Immunosuppression consisted of thymoglobulin, anti\u2010CD154 mAb for costimulation blockade, and mycophenolate mofetil. Following the transplantation of islets from wild\u2010type pigs (n = 2) or from 1,3\u2010galactosyltransferase gene\u2010knockout pigs (n = 2), islets survived for a maximum of only 46 days, as evidenced by return to hyperglycemia and the need for exogenous insulin therapy. The transplantation of islets from hCD46 pigs resulted in graft survival and insulin\u2010independent normoglycemia in four of five monkeys for the 3 months follow\u2010up of the experiment. One normalized recipient, selected at random, was followed for >12 months. Inhibition of complement activation by the expression of hCD46 on the pig islets did not substantially reduce the initial loss of islet mass, rather was effective in limiting antibody\u2010mediated rejection. This resulted in a reduced need for immunosuppression to preserve a sufficient islet mass to maintain normoglycemia long\u2010term.",

            "text": "To determine the capacity of the pig embryonic pancreatic graft to control hyperglycemia in transplanted mice, we initially allowed the implanted tissue to grow and develop, and then we induced diabetes in the grafted NOD-SCID by alloxan [30].This approach is based on the selective toxicity of alloxan, which destroys rodent, but not human or porcine beta cells, a circumstance that enabled us to assess the potential of the pig pancreatic implant to sustain normal glucose levels in a recipient whose own pancreas was practically destroyed [31,32].\n\nExperiments included 17 recipient mice grafted with growing E42 pig embryonic pancreas, 4 mo after transplant, followed for pig insulin level by ELISA, and 13 control nongrafted NOD-SCID mice.Both groups were intravenously injected with alloxan.Glucose concentrations were followed before and at various time points after alloxan injection.Prior to alloxan treatment, average glucose levels were similar in both grafted and control animals (5.6 6 0.6 and 6.2 6 1.1 mmol/l, respectively, p \u00bc 0.2).Pig insulin levels were negative in all control animals, while pig insulin levels in the E42pancreas-grafted mice ranged from 18 to 1,086 pmol/l.Within 3 d following alloxan injection, three animals in the control group had died, while the remaining ten survivors exhibited high glucose levels, with an average of 29.1 6 5 mmol/l.The hyperglycemia persisted in all control mice, which eventually died within 18 d after alloxan injection (Figure 5A).Of the 17 grafted mice, 13 did not develop hyperglycemia while four mice had glucose levels above 16.5 mmol/l after alloxan treatment.When analyzing the pig insulin level at 16 wk after transplantation (before alloxan injection), it was noted that the four mice who later failed to control hyperglycemia exhibited the lowest pig insulin levels (below 120 pmol/l), whereas in all 13 grafted mice exhibiting normal blood glucose levels following alloxan treatment the pig insulin level was above 120 pmol/l before alloxan treatment.",

This field has benefited from improvement of islet isolation techniques, cell encapsulation, availability of reliable experimental models, and better understanding of risks inherent to pig cell use in humans. Recent advances in genome editing tools allowed production of multi-transgenic pigs with efficient expression of desired genes [41, 51, 75, 76\u2022, 77] without causing deleterious effects on islet function [23, 33\u2022]. Most if not all of these genetic modifications of donors are aimed to mitigate immune rejection of grafted cells without the need for radical immunosuppression. Physiological incompatibilities between porcine and human islets need to be taken into consideration and genetic modification of pig beta cells aimed to increase insulin secretion are being investigated with promising results [5\u2022]. Combining these genetic engineering strategies with microbiological selection of animals and pathogen-free breeding as well as cell encapsulation techniques is bringing therapeutic islet xenotransplantation closer than ever to widespread application.",

            "text": "As well, marker identification can be useful for islet cell transplantation, which is being explored as a treatment for diabetes. \n\nFew proteomic studies have been done using human pancreatic tissues to elucidate the mechanisms of diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancers because of difficulty in preparing human samples [4][5][6][7]. Instead, in vivo experiments have mainly used animal models. Several studies have contributed to the understanding of the molecular network governing developing pancreas in mouse and rat models [8,9]. \n\nThe pig has become an attractive subject of study because of its potential use for xenotransplantation [10]. Nonhuman primate, such as apes and monkeys, more closely resemble humans anatomically and physiologically than do pigs. Nonetheless, xenotransplantation using nonhuman primates as xenograft donors is unlikely primarily because of the infectious risks to human patients and their contacts. Pigs produce large litters (up to 10 littermates), have a short gestation time (4 months), are somewhat similar to humans anatomically and physiologically, are available in large numbers (an estimated 90 million pigs are raised for human consumption yearly in the United States) and have a long history of providing medicinal products (skin, insulin, cardiac prostheses, clotting factors) for humans. For these reasons, the pig has become the most likely candidate for consideration as an organ donor [11][12][13][14]. Hindering this potential, the development of pig pancreas is not well understood. \n\nIn this study we investigated changes in the proteomic profile during pig pancreas development in embryonic day 60 (E60), neonatal and 6-month-old pigs using twodimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).",

            "text": "Currently, pig islet xenoTx studies in NHPs have been reported by 15 institutions, including transplantation in nondiabetic (Table 1) [19,23,[39][40][41][42][43] and diabetic recipients (Table 2) [13], [15\u2022, 16, 17, 38, 39, 42, 44-48]. However, prolonged restoration (>3 months) of insulin independence after porcine islet xenoTx in NHPs with spontaneous, chemical, or surgically induced diabetes has only been reported by a few groups [16,17,[46][47][48], with xenograft survival exceeding 6 months in even fewer cases. These promising findings indicate that pig islet xenoTx has the potential to cure diabetes in NHPs, and provide a strong rationale to envision clinical future applications. \n\nLong-term insulin independence has been achieved using different strategies, such as: 1) intraportal infusion of wild-type adult and neonatal pigs islet in immunosup-pressed diabetic NHPs [15\u2022, 17]; 2) intraportal infusion of islets from adult \u03b1-1,3-Gal-deficient animals transgenic for human membrane cofactor protein (CD46) in STZ-diabetic immunosuppressed NHPs [15\u2022, 46]; 3) implantation of embryonic pig pancreatic precursor tissue in STZ-diabetic animals [48]; 4) intraperitoneal transplantation of microencapsulated adult pig islets in nonimmunosuppressed spontaneously diabetic NHPs; and 5) subcutaneous implantation of a monolayer of encapsulated adult islets on a collagen matrix in a nonimmunosuppressed NHP [48, 49\u2022\u2022]. The choice of the anatomical site for the implantation of porcine islets in the recipient is a crucial aspect in xenoTx. The current clinical practice is to put islets into the liver, through the portal vein.",

Current protocols focus primarily on the use of rodent and porcine pancreases. We present a protocol for quickly and efficiently obtaining large numbers of islets using rabbits. Using this protocol, it is possible to obtain a higher yield of isolated islets compared to the current state-of-the-art results. In addition, isolated rabbit islets retain a high viability and metabolic activity compared to the islets from other animals. Our research underscores the promise of rabbit islets as a valuable model for investigating islet biology and diabetes treatment. The data we provide will contribute to the advancement of diabetes research by enhancing our understanding of disease development mechanisms, improving the quality of isolated islets, and potentially offering a new source of cells for xenotransplantation. \n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, E.V. and A.K.

Immune rejection, physiological incompatibility and bio\u2010safety are the most critical issues. Methods To ensure the safety and efficacy of gene editing, second\u2010 and third\u2010generation sequencing technologies have allowed us to obtain a clearer genetic background of donor pigs for xenotransplantation. Based on the Changsha Communiqu\u00e9, the local DPF\u2010 excluded lists and DPF donor facility were established in Changsha, China. A pig\u2010to\u2010human islet clinical trial was conducted and overseen by the respective Chinese governmental agency. Results The DPF standards for pig husbandry eliminated specific pathogens in donor pigs. We have established a PERV\u2010C free, genetic information clean, DPF donor for xenotransplantation. A clinical trial of ten adult patients (9M:1F) with type 1 diabetes who received DPF porcine islet xenotransplantation via the portal vein were performed. Clinical accepted immunosuppressant drugs and autologous Treg were used for controlling immune rejection. No cross\u2010species infection events occurred in this trial, and importantly, no cross\u2010species transmission of PERV was found. Conclusions Xenotransplantation is a pioneer study and safety is the most important issue. The fundamental principles for establishing xenotransplantation donor pigs should follow the Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 (2008), the second WHO consultation,and the 2018 Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 which would finally help reducing the risks of xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "Islet cell transplantation represents a promising therapy to achieve normoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes (1). Loss of islet mass during the isolation process and in the first days after transplantation is a major challenge for islet transplantation. This is mainly mediated by hypoxia due to the limitation of oxygen diffusion until sufficient revascularization has developed (2,3). It has been shown that smaller islets display a better function in vitro and in vivo (4)(5)(6). Native mouse and human islets have been reported to spontaneously re-aggregate into cell clumps after being dissociated into single cells (7). Pre-defined uniform cluster size was achieved using the hanging drop culture or customized microwell devices (8)(9)(10)(11)(12).\n\nSince the supply of high-quality human islets is limited by the paucity of organ donors, alternative cell sources such as porcine islet cells are demanded. Xenotransplantation of pig islets is very promising because supply of porcine islets is unlimited, techniques to isolate islets on a large scale are established (13), and recent progress on genetic modification of pigs has generated donor animals which provide islets which significantly decrease the severity of humoral and cellular immune responses (14). Successful long-term transplantation of neonatal and adult porcine islets into diabetic non-human primates (NHP) with insulin independence for a maximum of 965 days were described in several studies under systemic immunosuppression using potent co-stimulation inhibitors (15)(16)(17). However, translation of these studies to clinical trials is still limited because antibodies to block the CD40/CD154 costimulation pathway are not approved for application in human beings thus far (18).\n\nNeonatal porcine islet like cell clusters (NPICCs) represent useful candidate cells for xenotransplantation (19) because they are easier to isolate as compared to adult islets and more robust against hypoxia and inflammation (20). The disadvantage is that NPICCs consist of immature cells and precursor cells which need several weeks for maturation after transplantation until glucosedependent insulin secretion and normog",

            "text": "In the present study, we have successfully generated and characterized a transgenic pig expressing INS-SNAP and demonstrate its suitability for the in vivo labeling of insulin SGs. We provide a strategy to overcome two major limitations of \u03b2 cell research: the translational gap between rodents and humans and ex vivo experiments for insulin turnover using isolated pancreatic islets. We generated a transgenic pig as a model system, since it closes this translational gap. Pigs are akin to humans in the anatomy of their gastrointestinal tract and the morphology and function of the pancreas (20). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the structure and composition of pig pancreatic islets is much closer to human than to rodent islets (25), although some morphological and functional differences in islets between humans and pigs were reported (26,27). Moreover, the molecular and developmental signatures of pig and human islets and \u03b2 cells are also more similar to each other than those of human and rodents (28). This makes the pig a compelling model organism not only for the study of systemic metabolism but specifically also for that of islets and \u03b2 cell function.\n\nThe age of insulin SGs has been associated with the likelihood of exocytosis, and recently, a connection of the dysregulation of SG age with metabolic stress has been made (29). We chose the SNAP-tag fused with insulin in our pig model, since it allows for the conditional and flexible labeling of age-defined insulin SG pools with fluorophores of different colors over longer time spans, compared to fluorescent timer proteins (30). We used this technology successfully in isolated mouse islets to map age-distinct SG pools (16). However, this knock-in mouse showed signs of impaired glucose tolerance (15), a problem that did not occur in the transgenic SOFIA pig. Notably, the SOFIA mouse is a knock-in model with SNAP fused in frame at the C terminus of Ins2, leading to a high expression of insulin2-SNAP. This may delay proinsulin2-SNAP folding and processing and thus could account for the impaired glucose tolerance of these mice. Therefore, we chose to generate the pig as a transgenic model, hoping to overcome the aforementioned problems, which turned out to be successful. Our strategy for the pig model was based on",

            "text": "However, these trials did not achieve long-term islet graft function or complete insulin independence (85,86). Several other studies have similar clinical outcomes (87, 88). \n\nIn the US, an Investigational New Drug (IND) must be filed with the FDA, including detailed information about the source of the animal tissue, the genetic modifications made to reduce immune rejection, preclinical safety and efficacy data, and the design of the proposed clinical trial. Recently, an encapsulated pig islet IND has been filed and approved for islet transplantation (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06575426). Clinical results are expected to be released in the course of 2025. \n\nXenotransplantation faces significant regulatory challenges, particularly related to biosafety concerns. One major issue is the risk of transmitting porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) from pigs to humans, although studies suggest minimal risk with genetically modified pigs. Regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, mandate rigorous safety protocols and continuous monitoring for xenotransplantation trials. The future of xenotransplantation will depend on advancements in genetic modifications, improved immune protection strategies, and addressing ethical and safety concerns. If these challenges are met, xenotransplantation may provide a scalable and reliable source of islets for treating patients with T1D. \n\nSince the 1970s, researchers have been investigating regenerative approaches by differentiating human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into functional insulin-producing beta cells by mimicking developmental cues from embryogenesis. \n\nIn the 1990s, early research focused on differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into insulin-producing beta cells (69,89). Progress accelerated with the introduction of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in 2007 (90), allowing for the generation of beta-cells from adult cells.",

Naturally, preserving implanted islets from the host immune response was central in most of these studies. Once this primordial step has been achieved by means of immunosuppression, encapsulation, genetic modification of donors, or a combination of these strategies, the efficacy of porcine islet transplantation is evaluated by looking for signs of diabetes alleviation and by verifying secretory function of grafted tissue. Moreover, host testing for possible porcine pathogens is undertaken to demonstrate biosafety of islet xenotransplantation.

In the case of kidney allotransplantation, 40% of wait-listed patients are likely to die within five years, since chronic dialysis is a suboptimal form of therapy for many, and their quality of life remains poor [1]. Diabetes patients often suffer, due to insufficient compliance, from later complications despite insulin treatment. Since the supply of human pancreata or islet cells is very low [2], only xenotransplantation of pig islet cells may solve this problem. \n\nPigs are suitable as donor animals, and they are advantageous due to their nearly unlimited availability, short breeding time, and large litters. Pig kidneys and hearts are comparable in size and function to human organs. There is a high physiological similarity, as, for example, pig insulin has been used to treat diabetes for decades. Pigs can be easily genetically modified and cloned, and pig farming is less expensive. In contrast, apes are endangered species, and most monkeys are too small to serve as donor animals. \n\nXenotransplantation must overcome three hurdles on its way into the clinic: rejection, especially hyperacute rejection (HAR); physiological incompatibility; and the risk of transmission of zoonotic pig microorganisms. HAR is based on the presence of preexisting antibodies against sugar residues present on pig proteins, but absent on human proteins. Zoonotic means that the pig microorganisms not only infect the transplant recipient, but induce a more or less severe disease. Whereas most pig viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa can be eliminated by selection, vaccination, antiviral drugs, early weaning, colostrum deprivation, and embryo transfer, that is not possible for the porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), because they are integrated in the genome of the pigs.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation is not yet standard treatment. There is current research into the feasibility of using donor animal organs such a kidney and liver. However, unlike cells, organs are difficult to screen against potential infectious agents. If clinical trials with cell transplants for diabetes are successful, porcine islet transplants will lead the way for the use of other cells for the treatment of nervous system disorders and enzyme deficiencies (Skinner et al, 2009). \n\nPorcine islet xenotransplantation has the potential to be beneficial for those with absolute insulin deficiency. There is now a consensus that the procedure is relatively safe from xenotic infections. The results of several non-human primate and rodent studies indicate significant efficacy may be achieved. The early results of human clinical trials also suggest that this form of treatment for Type 1 diabetes, without immunosuppression, is worthwhile. There is the concern that the treatment may be too expensive to be a practical treatment for the large numbers of patients who are expected to benefit from porcine islet implants. However, a health economic analysis of quality adjusted life years suggests that this approach may be cost effective taking into account the current cost of treating the disease and complications of cardiovascular disease, blindness, limb amputation, end-stage kidney disease and neuropathy (Beckwith et al, 2010).",

            "text": "Further, the report by the Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry for allogeneic islet transplantation performed during the years 1999 to 2010, indicated that the rate of recipients achieving insulin-independence for 3 years showed increasing stability, from only 10% before 1999 to 44% in the years from 2007-2010 [16,17]. Using potent application of immunotherapy, a higher rate of insulin-independence can thus be achieved [18,19]. Increased levels of C-peptide and reduction of glycated hemoglobin, (Hb-A1c), attested to the increasing durability of islet graft function. However, the limitation of transplantable pancreatic donor material is still a major hurdle. To meet the demand for islet transplantation, a potential alternative is the use of animal sourced islets. The use of pancreatic islets obtained from pigs has emerged as a practical alternative to the use of human tissues, due to their greater availability and physiologic similarities to human islets. Long-term graft survival, in non-human primates, of porcine islets isolated from adult, neonatal or genetically engineered pigs has been reported [20][21][22]. Infusion of adult porcine islets resulted in normoglycemia in immunosuppressed, diabetic, non-human primates [23]. \n\nMinimization of attack by the host's immune system is a critical issue in achieving efficient islet engraftment. Immunosuppressive therapy, however, itself causes undesirable side effects. Despite many preclinical and clinical trials, there is still not a single standard immunosuppressive regimen that can be used to suppress acute and chronic immune reactions, with lower toxicity, to grafted islets. \n\nAn islet encapsulation technology to treat diabetes, another conceptual option, has been developed. By trapping islets into man-made devices, a physical barrier between the islet cells and the immune system is created, thus allowing normal physiologic function of encapsulated islet cells. The system has been tested in several experimental models [24]. A pilot trial for safety and efficacy to treat patients with T1D is in progress [3].",

The establishment of an efficient system for the production of designated pathogen-free (DPF) pigs is a prerequisite for the clinical application of xeno-islet transplantation therapy. Therefore, we developed a feasible and economic method that consists of uterectomy of a full-term sow, recovery of fetuses from the uterus, and rearing of neonatal piglets under aseptic conditions in specially designed isolator units. Full-term sows were subjected to a midventral incision under general anesthesia. Each excised uterus was transferred to the recovery unit through a disinfecting tube, and the fetuses were recovered from the uterus. The piglets thus recovered were then transferred to the second isolator unit for artificial nursing with a \u03b3-irradiated milk substitute. Swab samples of the body surface of the pigs and the internal surface of the rearing unit were collected weekly to test the sterility of the piglets. The samples were examined using a standard protocol that was developed and recommended by the Japanese Association for Laboratory Animal Science. At the end of the rearing period, the blood and internal organs, including the pancreas, were collected to analyze sterility and the presence of viruses. The average recovery rate of live piglets was 93.3%. The body weight of the neonatal piglets did not differ significantly from that of the control piglets that were obtained via natural farrowing. Blood and tissue samples obtained from the piglets after the rearing period tested negative for bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Of the viruses currently designated in the guideline for xenotransplantation by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, 58 were proven to be absent based on the results of negative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The uterectomyisolated rearing method has potential applicability for the practical production of donors using neonatal piglets for xeno-islet transplantation [78] .",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation provides another alternative for the limited supply issue faced from the too few human islets available from donated human pancreases. In 2006, two groups reported long-term survival of porcine islets in non-human primates [29,30]. Recently, Shin et al. demonstrated that pig islet grafts survived for greater than 6 months and were able to maintain normoglycemia for >6 months in four immunosuppressed non-human primates [31]. Given issues of supply and demand, porcine islet xenotransplantation for T1D now appears to be a therapeutic consideration following extensive preclinical investigations, suggesting that clinical trials may be now justified. Two current reviews provide in-depth insight into the advances and shortcomings in this field [32,33].\n\nhESCs An effective cell-based therapeutic for T1D requires cells that sense glucose fluctuations and respond with appropriate insulin secretion. While islet transplantation has shown promise as a treatment for type T1D, a major obstacle to this approach is the shortage of the islets containing insulin-producing cells. Over the past decade, hESCs/iPSCs have emerged as promising sources for the pancreatic \u03b2-cells lost in T1D. hESCs are characterized by their capacity for self-renewal and differentiation to almost any specific cell type in the human body. The first study demonstrating functional and meaningful secretion of insulin after transplantation into mice of \u03b2cells generated from hESC was published in 2008 [34], less than 10 years after the initial reports on spontaneous in vitro differentiation of hESC into insulin producing cells [35]. The advent of iPSCs in 2007 by Takahashi and Yamanaka [36,37] opened the possibility of reprogramming a patient's own fibroblasts into \u03b2-cells for use in clinical situations, including T1D. Since the initial publications, this patient-specific approach towards treatment of various diseases has allowed researchers to address the effect of point mutations, gene deletions, or translocations on the function of a cell in culture or in a model animal system.\n\nAlthough critical gaps in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive the genesis of insulin producing cells from hESCs/",

This animal received vascularized thymic lobe (VTL) graft cotransplantation from the kidney source pig, which has been shown to prolong xenograft survival in pig-to-baboon renal xenotransplantation (reviewed in (28)). Interferon gamma (IFNg) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay was performed to assess the potential immunomodulatory effect of VTL co-transplantation in this case. ELISpot assay at POD 180 demonstrated pig-specific unresponsiveness, suggesting that co-transplanted VTL graft may promote immunomodulatory effects. Further studies will clarify the mechanisms of in vitro unresponsiveness (59). \n\nAdditional cases are needed to replicate this work, but these encouraging results indicate that our negative control strategy, sequential kidney followed by islet xenotransplantation may reverse diabetes and renal insufficiency.",

            "text": "These results have been positive because glycemic control has been superior to that demonstrated in therapies such as the application of subcutaneous insulin. Islets transplantation has improved substantially in last decade with multiple refinements including more optimal islets preparation, culture, safer transplant techniques and more effective anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory interventions. Excellent therapeutic effects have been confirmed as a result of reactive insulin secretion, leading to a normalized blood glucose level, which cannot be reproduced with pharmacological insulin therapy [124,125]. However, some problems need to be resolved, such as severe donor shortages, and more research is need regarding alternative transplant sites that can be grafted efficiently, alternative cell sources, blood-mediated inflammatory reaction, and the functional preservation of \u03b2-cells [126,127]. \n\nPrior to the implementation of the DNA recombinant technique, insulin from pigs was utilized for the treatment of diabetic patients [128]. Insulin from pigs is practically identical to human insulin, with only one amino acid difference [129]. Pig pancreatic islets can be adequately applied for clinical use in humans, avoiding some of the technical limitations involved in cadaveric transplants, such as senescence, brain death, comorbidities, or cold ischemia [130,131]. Several works have been carried out in which the therapeutic effectiveness of pig islets in nonhuman primates was observed. However, technical difficulties with these xenografts, including virus transmission or interspecies antigenicity, have limited their use [132,133]. New techniques of gene editing, as well as the generation of pigs with human pancreata as the source of pancreatic islets, are under investigation [134,135]. Porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) is considered the major challenge of biosafety in xenotrasplantation. Editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 have been used to inactivate PERV genes reducing PERV transmission to human cells. Additionally, the potential to humanize the pig genome using CRISPR-Cas9 technologies will generate more promise in xenotransplant, however increasing ethical challenges.",

Islet xenotransplantation using porcine islets is drawing attention as a means to overcome the donor shortage. In clinical trials involving the transplantation of neonatal porcine islets into diabetic patients in Sweden, serum porcine C-peptide was detected and graft survival was confirmed. 4 Furthermore, in clinical trials in New Zealand and Argentina, the glycemic control of patients with T1D improved after they were transplanted with alginate microcapsules encapsulating neonatal porcine islets. 5,6 igs are an advantageous source for islet cells because they have high fertility and because a large amount of islets can be acquired at low cost. In addition, in contrast to human cadaver donors, there would be minimal damage to the tissue due to ischemia or lethal diseases, and quality-controlled and fresh MOTIVATION A shortage of donors and the need for immunosuppressants are major issues of islet transplantation for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Therefore, we are developing T1D treatment using xenogeneic islets and bioartificial pancreas (BAP). However, no BAP devices currently meet all of the functions of long-term glycemic control, islet survival, immunoprotection, discordant xenotransplantation feasibility, and biocompatibility. To address this, we developed a hydrogel with long-term stability and permeability for encapsulating islets in this study. Furthermore, we found an immunoprotective membrane with high biocompatibility for wrapping xenogeneic islets and used them to develop BAP devices. \n\norgans and cells can be obtained. There is no concern about tumorigenicity, which is a problem with embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem-derived cells. 7 In addition, pigto-human infectious diseases can be controlled by using pathogen-free pigs.",

The increase in the number of successful islets transplantations also require the elimination of the need for multiple islet donors per recipient [46]. Several attempts to increase the viability of transplantable islets have been proposed, mainly related to improvement of islet isolation process, to pharmacological interventions and to new immunosuppressive protocols. Many interventions are being tested to improve islet survival, such as the use of growth factors [50], glucagon-like peptides (GLP) and GLP-1 analogs [51], oxygen carriers [52], substances that reduce inflammatory response [53], anticoagulants [54], antiapoptotic drugs [55] and antioxidant compounds [44]. Immunoisolation of transplanted islets with semi-permeable membranes is an attractive strategy to preclude the use of immunosuppressive agents, however, the perfect immunoisolation system has not been found yet.\n\nProlonged reversal of diabetes obtained in non-human immunosuppressed primates transplanted with porcine pancreatic islets suggests that xenotransplant with pig islets may be an alternative to circumvent problems of islet availability for diabetic patients. However, for this transplant modality to reach clinical applicability, longterm clinical trials should be performed. Among the aspects to be specifically examined are overcoming the immune reaction and carefully evaluating the risk of por-cine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) transmission [45]. This last aspect is extremely relevant, considering that recipients of xenografts might be taking immunosuppressive drugs, which decrease the host resistance, increasing the possibility of virus (re)activation. In spite of these safety issues, some researches believe that, in the future, it will be possible to move forward from pre-clinical studies into clinical trials of xenotransplantation [46].\n\nOne of the major limitations of islet transplantation is the scarcity of islets. Therefore, strategies to develop islet cells in vitro",

            "text": "Most islet xenotransplantation laboratories have focused on porcine islets, which are both costly and difficult to isolate. Teleost (bony) fish, such as tilapia, possess macroscopically visible distinct islet organs called Brockmann bodies which can be inexpensively harvested. When transplanted into diabetic nude mice, tilapia islets maintain long\u2010term normoglycemia and provide human\u2010like glucose tolerance profiles. Like porcine islets, when transplanted into euthymic mice, they are rejected in a CD4 T\u2010cell\u2010dependent manner. However, unlike pigs, tilapia are so phylogenetically primitive that their cells do not express \u03b1(1,3)Gal and, because tilapia are highly evolved to live in warm stagnant waters nearly devoid of dissolved oxygen, their islet cells are exceedingly resistant to hypoxia, making them ideal for transplantation within encapsulation devices. Encapsulation, especially when combined with co\u2010stimulatory blockade, markedly prolongs tilapia islet xenograft survival in small animal recipients, and a collaborator has shown function in diabetic cynomolgus monkeys. In anticipation of preclinical xenotransplantation studies, we have extensively characterized tilapia islets (morphology, embryologic development, cell biology, peptides, etc.) and their regulation of glucose homeostasis. Because tilapia insulin differs structurally from human insulin by 17 amino acids, we have produced transgenic tilapia whose islets stably express physiological levels of humanized insulin and have now bred these to homozygosity. These transgenic fish can serve as a platform for further development into a cell therapy product for diabetes.",

            "text": "Islet quantity and quality varies with the breed of pigs. Readily available market pigs have shown to yield lower when compared to the well-studied breeds of pigs like Landrace pigs, Chicago Medical School (CMS) miniature pigs and Chinese Wuzhishan (WZS) miniature pigs [23,25,27]. Two major factors which have been studied in relation to the source of pig islets for xenotransplantation are the breed and age of the donors. Some well-studied breeds are the Landrace pigs, Chicago Medical School (CMS) miniature pigs, and the Chinese Wuzhishan (WZS) miniature pigs. Market weight pigs are easily available, but studies have shown lower yields than for other breeds [39]. Landrace pigs have been shown to yield large sized (>250 \u03bcm) islets with a high islet volume density [39,40]. Adult Chicago Medical School (CMS) miniature pigs are bred under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, and contain large-sized islets. The yield is greater than market or other miniature pigs (9589 \u00b1 2838 IEQ/g), making CMS pigs one of the best sources for obtaining islets [39,[41][42][43][44][45]. Another miniature pig, the Chinese Wuzhishan (WZS) pig has also shown an islet yield greater than that of market pigs [39,46]. Though no consensus has been arrived at the optimal breed for the preclinical/clinical studies, these breeds has been well documented to yield better islets than others. Higher expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) protein in islet capsules makes isolation easier and German Landrace pigs have higher ECM [24].\n\nAdditionally, age [43,44,[47][48][49] and size of the donor pigs [36,[50][51][52] are major factors that affect islet isolation outcomes. Some studies have also suggested that gender may play a role in the final islet yield [39,53,54]. Pig islets can be obtained at four distinct life-stages: embryonic, fetal, neonatal and adult [55], and Table 1 summarizes the significance, advantages,",

            "text": "Despite decades of research in humans and mouse models of disease, substantial gaps remain in our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development of type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, translation of therapies from preclinical efforts capable of delaying or halting \u03b2-cell destruction has been limited. Hence, a pressing need exists to identify alternative animal models that reflect human disease. Canine insulin deficiency diabetes is, in some cases, considered to follow autoimmune pathogenesis, similar to NOD mice and humans, characterized by hyperglycemia requiring lifelong exogenous insulin therapy. Also similar to human type 1 diabetes, the canonical canine disorder appears to be increasing in prevalence. Whereas islet architecture in rodents is distinctly different from humans, canine pancreatic endocrine cell distribution is more similar. Differences in breed susceptibility alongside associations with MHC and other canine immune response genes parallel that of different ethnic groups within the human population, a potential benefit over NOD mice. The impact of environment on disease development also favors canine over rodent models. Herein, we consider the potential for canine diabetes to provide valuable insights for human type 1 diabetes in terms of pancreatic histopathology, impairment of \u03b2-cell function and mass, islet inflammation (i.e., insulitis), and autoantibodies specific for \u03b2-cell antigens.",

            "text": "Several studies have confirmed the versatility of PCL for the development of a scaffold for beta cell replacement. ][23] Furthermore, it supports islet functional survival 21,22 and seems valuable for directing the differentiation of less mature insulin-producing cells. 24,25 [28] The transition from rodent models to large preclinical models is always challenging. In addition to upscaling the device, it is essential to use a model that resembles the skin structure of humans. Here we used immunocompetent pigs and found that the device had to fulfill additional requirements compared with the mouse model. For example, the skin structure of pigs is more rigid\u201a which forced us to test different polymers. T1D curative studies in pigs are difficult due to the need for immunosuppression and issues with housing and care. Therefore, we used a standard immunosuppression model using cyclosporine to prevent allograft rejection and were able to show successful islet survival in this model for a month. The devices were well vascularized\u201a and islets had normal morphology. Safety and functional survival were shown in this study, and the next step will be efficacy studies in diabetic pigs. \n\nThe major difference between our procedure and other biomaterial-based approaches [28][29][30][31][32][33] is the prevascularization period. During this prevascularization time, the device is implanted under the skin without the presence of islets, allowing the material-induced inflammatory response to dampen and providing the opportunity for blood vessels to invade. This leads to improved nutrient delivery and less loss of islet cells due to hypoxia and necrosis. Furthermore, it supports the glycemic control of the grafted islets in the scaffold, as also shown with a similar approach by Patikova et al. 34 A possible disadvantage is the need for 2 separate surgical procedures. However, these are simple procedures that might even be done under local anesthesia. Our pig study shows fast recovery and wound healing after implantation and transplantation. There is always some degree of tissue response due to the surgery and the placement of a \"foreign\" material.",

            "text": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of insulin-secreting beta cells in the pancreatic islets. This results in a deficiency of endogenous insulin, necessitating conventional insulin treatment [1]. However, patients with type 1 diabetes who retain less than 5% of their beta cell volume require intensive insulin therapy to mitigate complications associated with the disease [2]. The administration of large doses of insulin can lead to life-threatening severe hypoglycemic events [3]. \n\nTo reduce hypoglycemic events resulting from insulin overdose, allogeneic islet transplantation has been ex-plored [4]. In 2000, successful clinical trials of allogeneic islet transplantation were conducted using the Edmonton protocol [5]. Subsequently, in 2016, phase 3 clinical trial outcomes were published, demonstrating that the procedure could prevent severe hypoglycemia and achieve more stable glycemic control [6]. In 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of allogeneic islets as a biological product, thus establishing allogeneic islet transplantation as a standard treatment option for type 1 diabetes, comparable to intensive insulin therapy [7]. \n\nHowever, considering the large number of patients with unstable type 1 diabetes, the issue of donor shortage for allogeneic islet transplantation must be addressed. To overcome this challenge, researchers have investigated the use of porcine islets [8]. The primary benefit of porcine islet xenotransplantation is the potential for an unlimited supply of healthy islets. However, porcine islets elicit a stronger immune response than allogeneic islet transplants. Additionally, xenogeneic islets are classified as medicinal products, meaning that both the production of designated pathogen-free pigs [9] and the isolation of their islets must adhere to pharmaceutical production standards [10]. While the use of designated pathogen-free pigs reduces the risk of zoonosis, concerns regarding porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) remain [11]. Moreover, such studies are subject to ethical considerations and legal regulations [12].",

They were found to be free of all tested microorganisms with exception of HEV. HEV was detected in young animals, in some sows soon after delivery and their offspring (Table 6) An anti-HEV humoral immune response was also reported in one mother and her offspring. These data demonstrate a mother to piglet transmission of HEV explaining the presence of the virus in a SPF facility with high hygienic standards.

            "text": "cine insulin works well in humans, the pig has been suggested as a kidney or pancreas organ donor for humans with chronic kidney disease or diabetes. While humoral rejection is ameliorated following transplantation into nonhuman primates of kidneys from pigs transgenic for the human complement activator, decay accelerating factor [35], or the use of kidneys or organs from transgenics that do not express alpha 1,3 galactosyltransferase [36], neither the immunosuppressive regimens used for pig to primate kidney transplantation nor the outcomes would be acceptable in humans. The severity of humoral rejection effectively precludes the use of pigs as whole pancreas organ donors for humans. However, because they are vascularized by the host after transplantation, islets like other cell transplants are not subject to humoral rejection. Recent experience with pig to primate islet or neonatal islet transplantation shows that sustained insulin independence can be achieved, but only through the use of immunosuppressive agents that are not approved for human use or that result in a high level of morbidity and mortality in diabetic primates [37][38][39]. Thus, the need for host immune suppression is a barrier for pig-to-primate kidney or islet xenotransplantation.\n\nThe use of individual cells including stem cells to regenerate or repair damaged kidney tissue or differentiate into insulin-producing cells (cell therapies) offers an alternative to whole organ replacement. Since cells are nonvascularized, these approaches can circumvent humoral rejection of xenogeneic tissue mediated by preformed antibodies directed against donor endothelial antigens.

For controls, similarly constructed devices without the inverse-breathing mechanism were implanted lateral to the iBEDv3S devices in two of the pigs. Following retrieval at 1 month, almost all islets in the control devices were fragmented or necrosed with observable pyknosis, karyorrhexis, and loss of nuclei and only weakly positive for insulin in certain regions ( fig. S28), indicating the challenging nature of the SC space for cell survival. In contrast, within retrieved iBEDv3S at 1 month, numerous surviving islets were observed with healthy morphology at both proximal and distal locations from the terminal tank (Fig. 7G). Apoptosis, when detected, was found in a few peripheral islet cells ( fig. S29, D and H), rather than in central cells, suggesting that these cells might have died from a xenogeneic immune response rather than hypoxia. Immunostaining also revealed positive expression of insulin in retrieved islets, indicating maintained islet function (Fig. 7H and fig. S29, E to H). For comparison, insulin expression was 9.6-fold higher, and DAPI content was 3.4fold higher in islets from the iBEDv3S devices than that from the control devices ( fig. S29I). Characterization of the retrieved iBEDv3S at 2 months also revealed several intact and insulin-positive islets (although a higher portion of cells, again in the islet peripheries, exhibited apoptosis) (fig.

Similar results were obtained when studying adult islets obtained from transgenic pigs. As shown in (Fig. 4B), adult InsGLP-1M3R islets had a higher stimulation index compared to controls (4.7 vs. 2.2 respectively). AUC comparison revealed a 15-fold amplification of the secretory response to high glucose thus confirming the significant improvement of islet insulin secretion following expression of the InsGLP-1M3R cassette in pigs at both neonatal and adult ages.

As shown in Fig. 4 D and E, inhibition of glucagon by high glucose was greater in the case of neonatal islets (six folds) compared to their adult counterparts (1.9 folds). Islets from transgenic pigs also showed a greater effect of glucose on glucagon secretion from neonatal islets (three folds) than from adult ones (1.3 folds). However glucagon levels remained higher in the case of transgenic islets before and after glucose stimulation. \n\n1.6. Porcine Islet Xenotransplantation. Diabetes reversal defined as nonfasting glycemia <200 mg/dL occurred in all mice having received InsGLP-1M3R islets. In 12 out of 14 transgenic islet recipients, hyperglycemia amelioration was observed within 4 wk of islet implantation under the kidney capsule. In two mice, diabetes reversal took 9 and 14 wk to occur, respectively.",

They investigated glucose metabolic responses in both pigs and NHPs and discussed their implications for clinical translation. Casu further examined differences in insulin secretion and glucose metabolism between \u03b11,3galactosyltransferase gene-knockout (GTKO) pigs and wildtype pigs [38]. GTKO pigs showed differences in insulin secretion compared to wild-type pigs. Although the genetic or molecular basis for these differences was not determined, the study concluded that these physiological variations are unlikely to significantly impact the outcome of GTKO porcine islet xenotransplantation. \n\nIn subsequent research, Martin Wijkstrom (Sweden), who had spent time working with Bernhard Hering in Minnesota, studied glucose metabolism in genetically-modified pigs expressing human transgenic proteins regulated by an insulin promoter [39]. These transgenic pigs exhibited improved blood glucose regulation compared to wild-type pigs, suggesting that human gene expression under an insulin promoter enhances the potential of these pigs as sources of islets for xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "A proof of principal for a potential practical cure has been shown with the establishment of the Edmond protocol in 2000. In this protocol, isolated allogenic cadaveric islets are infused in the portal vein of long-standing T1D patients that receive non-steroid immunosuppression [7,8]. Importantly, islet recipients achieve on average ~35 months of insulin independence [9]. Subsequently, islet transplantation was often performed in conjunction with kidney transplantation [10]. However, there are several challenges associated with this procedure that prevent it from becoming widely accessible for patients. A major drawback with islet transplantation is the limited availability of high-purity isolated human cadaveric donor islet material. This is required to restore euglycemia in patients. Typically, each patient receives 10,000 islet equivalents (IEQs) per kilogram of body weight, an amount that usually needs to be extracted from two donor pancreases. In addition, initial clinical trials showed some patients requiring multiple islet infusions throughout the study, further highlighting the need for an abundant source of functional insulin-producing cells. The chronic immune suppression of patients, especially in children and adolescents, is problematic due to long-term complications, including severe and chronic infections and malignancy. In addition, studies have shown that immune suppressive agents impair \u03b2-cell function and survival using animal models [11,12]. Indeed, functional cadaveric islet grafts are frequently lost within 2-5 years due to recurring autoimmunity, side effects of immunosuppressants, and other unknown mechanisms [9,13]. The lack of sufficient donor islets has prompted the search for alternative and abundant sources of functional \u03b2(-like) cells for replacement therapy purposes, and much progress has been made using different approaches. \n\nSince porcine insulin has been shown to be physiologically well-matched to humans, the xenotransplantation of porcine islets has been considered an effective strategy to provide adequate amounts of islet material to treat T1D patients.",

            "text": "The primary challenges in the early stages of porcine islet transplantation are HAR and IBMIR [95].When the NHP immune system detects Gal\u03b1 (1,3) in porcine tissue, it triggers the classical complement pathway, resulting in the formation of membrane attack complexes and cell lysis.Thus, knockdown of the islet surface \u03b1-Gal epitope is therefore a logical choice [96].In addition to removing the \u03b1-Gal antigen, reducing IBMIR also requires the expression of human complement regulatory factors (hCD46, hCD55, hCD59) [97].When porcine pancreatic islets are transplanted into non-human primates (NHPs) with diabetes, a significant portion of the graft is typically lost early due to IBMIR and intense immunosuppressive therapy [98].Windt et al. addressed complement activation by expressing hCD46 on pig islets, effectively limiting antibody-mediated rejection and preserving islet quality.While this approach didn't prevent the immediate loss of most transplanted islets, it significantly improved the outcomes of islet xenotransplantation in diabetic cynomolgus monkeys, maintaining normoglycemia for over 12 months [99,100].Hawthorne et al. achieved minimal IBMIR when transplanting \u03b1-Gal-deficient pigs with hCD55 and hCD59 transgenes onto neonatal islet cell clusters, combined with a clinically relevant immunosuppressive protocol [101].Achieving clinical long-term survival of pancreatic islets may require more effective immunosuppression or further modification of donor genes.",

Biopsies showed viable islets up to day 14, but not thereafter, with a progressive mononuclear cell and macrophage infiltration. These results suggest that powerful immune responses are involved in rejection of discordant xenogeneic islets and that adequate immunosuppressive regimens still need to be developed.\n\nThe first clinical experience of porcine islet xenotransplantation into human patients was reported by the Swedish group headed by Groth [77]. This surgical team transplanted a total of 10 diabetic patients with porcine islets, but no reduction in insulin requirement was observed in any of them [20]. However, the trial indicated that some xenogeneic islet cells do not appear to be acutely rejected if the patient is receiving pharmacological immunosuppressive therapy. Furthermore, xenotransplantation of porcine fetal pancreatic tissue into the human can be carried out without morbidity.\n\nEncapsulation of islets has been proposed for preventing rejection of both allo and xeno islets. The principle is that permeability of the capsule membrane is sufficient to allow nutrients and oxygen to reach the islets and for insulin to be released into the bloodstream, but restrictive enough to exclude immune cells and antibodies. Such encapsulation can be achieved using alginate-polylysinealginate capsules. Functional in vitro tests of microencapsulated islets have shown that insulinrelease profiles following glucose stimulation are similar to those of free islets. Microencapsulated islet allo-and xenografts have been implanted successfully in rodents, reversing chemically-induced diabetes [25,78,79]. Porcine encapsulated islets have been reported to induce normoglycaemia in a spontaneously diabetic cynomolgus monkey (without immunosuppressive therapy) for more than 800 days [80]. Insulin-independence has also been reported for >9 months in an immunosuppressed type 1 diabetic patient transplanted intraperitoneally with encapsulated all",

First, the regulatory framework established by national health authorities (including but not limited to the US FDA and European Medicines Evaluation Agency) and the recommendations made by International Xenotransplantation Association and the World Health Organization provide a safe and suitable framework for conducting clinical trials of investigational porcine islet products in T1D. Second, a surveillance and safety program has been developed to detect, measure, manage, report, and respond to infectious diseases caused by known infectious agents and, possibly, previously unknown or unexpected pathogens in individual recipients of pig tissues. Finally, suitable, designated pathogen-free, WT source pigs have been generated for planned pilot clinical trials. However, other key requirements remain to be met, including first and foremost the development of a safe and consistently effective rejection prophylaxis and the development of a commercially viable porcine islet product. Accordingly, the significance of islet xenotransplantation in the care of patients with diabetes in the next 10 years will be determined by progress made in these 2 areas. Equally important in the determination of the future significance of islet xenotransplantation will be the progress made in the development of the AP and stem cell-derived sources of islet cells.",

            "text": "Neither the physiology of glucose metabolism [1,2] nor the pathophysiologies of types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus [3][4][5][6][7][8] are fully understood. Among the promising methods for treating type 1 diabetes is the transplantation of isolated microencapsulated islets of Langerhans [9,10]; metabolic surgery is one of the recently introduced treatment options for type 2 diabetes [11,12]. Many open questions regarding experimental diabetes treatment modalities have been answered in studies using small animal diabetes models. Such studies, for example, have answered fundamental questions regarding the appropriate transplantation site for islets cells [13,14], the function of islets cell transplants in vivo [15,16], the recipient immune response to islets cell transplants [17], and regarding postoperative glucose homeostasis in the field of diabetes metabolism research [18]. As valuable as such studies are, however, questions regarding the feasibility of such concepts under preclinical conditions can only be answered in large animal models of diabetes. \n\nAlthough non-human primates are ideally suited for such studies due to their genetic and physiological proximity to humans, ethical considerations and the personnel required and the high associated costs have limited primate studies to a very minimum. For training in the course of transplantation the minipig is a serious alternative because of its physiological resemblance to humans, but also due to its size, ease of handling, and the much lower costs entailed. Because spontaneous diabetes is unknown in swine, the diabetes must be induced. The present study compares two different diabetes models in Goettingen minipigs (GMP), one model inducing diabetes chemically with the beta cell toxin streptozotocin (STZ), the other inducing diabetes surgically by total pancreatectomy (PE). \n\nBoth variants have already been described in the literature [19][20][21][22]. The results with STZ are largely uniform: the severity of the induced diabetes depends on the STZ dosage. The results with PE are less consistent. Postoperative survival of the animals has been reported as less than 10 days, which would disqualify PE as a diabetes-induction method.",

Histologic comparison of the tissue containing IVM-treated (IVM + ) versus control (IVM -) islets demonstrated abundant healthy \u03b2-cells in the former cohort in contrast to loss of islet morphology and viability in the latter (Extended Data Fig. 2). These observations were consistent across xenogeneic transplantation of porcine islets (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 2).\n\nWe next assessed whether human islets would experience similar survival when engrafted subcutaneously in diabetic immunoincompetent hosts. In contrast to human pancreatic islets transplanted without IVM, those engrafted with IVM uniformly reversed diabetes, corroborated by measurements of blood glucose (Fig. 1b) and human C-peptide (Fig. 1c). Excision of the islet-bearing skin in the long-term recipients of human islets led to prompt recurrence of hyperglycemia. The IVM + islets exhibited persistent collagen I in the islet extra-cellular environment and demonstrated preserved cellular morphology (Fig. 1d). Subsequently, we evaluated the kinetics of glucose disposal in recipients bearing long-term subcutaneous islets. Recipients bearing IVM + islets from mice, swine or humans (n=5 in each group) demonstrated normal glucose clearance, akin to healthy non-diabetic mice (Extended Data Fig. 3).\n\nHaving confirmed the efficacy of IVM in the absence of alloreactivity in immunoincompetent hosts, we sought to examine its potential in immune-competent rodent models. B6 recipients were placed on an immunosuppressive regimen (Fig. 2a, for details see Online Methods) targeting B and T cell compartments, with an anti-B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) antibody and rapamycin, respectively. 20 The animals were then subcutaneously transplanted with Balb/c islets (Fig. 2b), and histologic examination of the long-term euglycemic allografts demonstrated healthy and functional islets, and an absence of inflammatory or fi",

Isolated porcine islets were 3D-cultured using growth factor-reduced matrigel in organoid culture medium consist of advanced DMEM/F12 with Wnt-3A, R-spondin, EGF, Noggin, IGF-1, bFGF, nicotinamide, B27, and some small molecules.

            "text": "Pig islet xenoTx shows important, but not insurmountable limitations, even if recent accomplishments in preclinical pig-to-NHP model hold great promises and may have future implications. Concerning preclinical animal models of islet xenoTx there are some relevant considerations on speciesspecific glucose metabolism. For instance, pigs and humans share blood glucose levels in similar concentrations, whereas nondiabetic monkeys exhibit lower unstimulated blood glucose. Endogenous C-peptide levels in monkeys are in higher ranges than in humans, and substantially higher than in pigs. When porcine islets engraft in diabetic NHPs they need to adapt to the higher metabolic demands of their recipients. This results in new cutoff parameters of glucose metabolism associated with good graft islet function, intermediate between donor and recipient baselines [37]. We may envision that, based on the metabolic differences between humans and monkeys, humans and pigs, porcine islets would perform more efficiently in humans than in monkeys. Nonetheless, to pursue the use of porcine islets in preclinical as well as clinical models it is necessary to modify the immunosuppressive protocols and to evaluate agents that can be substitutes for anti-CD154 antibodies, critical and effective components of major studies [16,17,46] because of their thromboembolic effect. Preliminary studies suggest that antagonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies could be equally effective when combined with IL-2R antibodies, CD28 antagonists, and sirolimus. Several other immunosuppressant agents are currently under investigation [54]. \n\nIn the future, immunosuppressive molecules should be selected based on their ability to facilitate negative vaccination systems during the pretransplantation phase by administration of donor antigen to the recipient. The immunological obstacles to xenoTx are significant. A way to reduce the immune response after implantation of pig islet cells in the recipient is the use of transgenic animals. Good results using pigs expressing hCD46 (a human complement-regulatory protein) suggest that protection from complement activation is beneficial to survival of the graft (Fig. 1) [15\u2022].",

These results encourage the use of iPSCs-derived blike cells in future diabetes treatment. Further research should be followed to prove their benefits in clinical application. \n\nXenogeneic islets are another alternative source for islet transplantation. Pig islets are the most studied xenogeneic islet for transplantation because pigs are relatively easy to breed and raise, produce a large number of islets and their insulin is similar to that of humans. Safety is the most important issue in xenotransplantation. In pigs, porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are important pathogens as they are integrated through the pigs' whole genome. One human study reported that PERV was not detected in human type 1 diabetes  recipients even long after the pig islets were transplanted 21 . In addition, PERV, herpes virus, cytomegalovirus, and other microorganisms are potential sources of zoonosis that should be considered as well. Recently, a genetically engineered porcine heart was transplanted to a 57 year old man. The recipient survived 2 months after surgery and the medical team recently reported that the patient had been infected with porcine cytomegalovirus 22 . Thus, zoonosis is still an important issue in xenotransplantation. For this reason, the current International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) guideline recommends the use of PERV-C negative pigs nurtured at a designated pathogen-free facility 23 . In 2016, Matsumoto et al. 24 demonstrated the efficacy of islet xenotransplantation in humans. In this study, microencapsulated pig islets were transplanted in eight patients with type 1 diabetes without immunosuppressant coverage. The patients who underwent transplantation experienced long-term alleviation of hyperglycemia (HbA1c <7.0% lasting over 600 days) and the restoration of impaired hypoglycemic awareness 24 .",

            "text": "Allogenic islet transplantation is considered the standard therapy for unstable type 1 diabetic patients.The aim of allogenic transplantation is currently not to achieve an insulin-free status but to avoid severe hypoglycemia and maintain excellent blood glucose levels [4].\n\nConsidering the huge number of type 1 diabetic patients, it is apparent that there is a shortage of human organ donors.To overcome the shortage of donors, clinical islet xenotransplantation has been conducted using fetal or neonatal porcine islets.\n\nThe difference in structure between human insulin and porcine insulin is only one amino acid.After the discovery of insulin in 1922, porcine insulin was used to treat type 1 diabetic patients for 60 years.Therefore, porcine insulin is a well-established treatment, which suggests that porcine islet transplantation should also be a viable treatment.\n\nThe Swedish group opened the door to this concept based on the idea that islet cell-like clusters (ICC) in fetal rodent tissue and human pancreatic tissue can be utilized to treat diabetes.Then, Korbutt and his colleague established a neonatal porcine islet isolation protocol, which can provide stable, high quantities of quality ICCs.This is critically important for islet transplantation.Since then, ICCs or neonatal porcine islets have been used clinically.\n\nTo prevent immunological rejection, the New Zealand team used microencapsulation, while the Mexican group used Sertoli cells.Both groups have shown safety and clinical benefits, including some cases being insulin-free.The Chinese group used Tregs and immunosuppressive drugs, and their patients' status was substantially improved.Further clinical trials are important to improve and establish islet xenotransplantation.\n\nHowever, clinical trials of islet xenotransplantation have only been conducted in limited groups.This limitation is mainly caused by the inadequate availability of source animal facilities that can supply clinical-grade pigs.In fact, the New Zealand facility provided clinical-grade pig islets for the New Zealand trial, the Russian trial, the Mexican trial, and the Argentine trial, while the Chinese facility provided clinical-grade pig islets for the Chinese trial.In other words, only two facilities provided clinical-grade pig islets.",

            "text": "Genetic engineering of pigs is a remarkably refined approach for generating tailored porcine diabetes research models. Transgenic (Tg) pigs are an attractive model for the analysis of pancreatic development and for testing novel diabetes treatments. Several groups have generated porcine diabetic models. Renner et al [56] generated pigs with T2DM that could express a human dominant-negative incretin hormone-glucosedependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor mutant (GIPR dn ) in pancreatic islets controlled by the rat insulin promoter. A permanent neonatal diabetes pig model was established by generating Tg pigs that expressed a mutant porcine INS (insulin) gene (INS C94Y) orthologous to human INS C96Y [57][58][59][60] . However, no diabetes-associated renal pathological changes were detected in these models. Diabetes has a multitude of phenotypic manifestations that are unlikely to be recapitulated in a single animal model. Pancreatic duodenum homeobox 1 (PDX1) expression is crucial for pancreatic organogenesis and is a key regulator of insulin gene expression [61] . Using genomeediting technologies, PDX1-knockout (KO) pigs are generated; however, PDX1-KO is fatal [62][63][64] . Nonetheless, a few of PDX1-modified pigs generated by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated proteins9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system that is introduced into zygotes can survive [65] .",

NIH guidelines regarding reporting of experimental conditions were followed.\n\nAnimals Recipients were 6-month-old male Westran pigs (Westmead Hospital, Westmead, NSW, Australia). Westran pigs are a highly inbred strain (>13 generations of sibling mating). Donors were Westran fetal piglets at 70-90 days gestation. Recipient pigs were housed at the Westmead Hospital Research Centre using approved husbandry and ethical standards [9].\n\nInduction of diabetes in pigs Recipient pigs underwent a total native pancreatectomy performed via midline incision under general anaesthesia between day 96 and 100 after transplantation. The duodenum was preserved. All pancreatectomised pigs received pancreatic enzyme replacement (Cotazym-S Forte capsules; Organon Canada, Scarborough, ON, Canada) daily.\n\nPorcine islet isolation and transplantation Porcine pancreatic islets were isolated from 70-90-day-old fetal pig pancreases as described previously [9]. Islet tissue was transplanted from 72 piglets into 18 recipient adults (four donors per recipient). The transplant sites were beneath the capsule of the liver, kidney or spleen. Equivalent amounts of islet tissue were transplanted into each of the organs and there were no macroscopic differences at transplantation or at the time of biopsy. For transplantation, a mini-laparotomy was performed on recipient Westran pigs under general anaesthetic to expose the organs. An incision was made in the capsule of the transplanted organ to permit insertion of a 14-gauge cannula and the islets were injected as the cannula was slowly withdrawn. A 5.0 Prolene purse-string suture was used to close the injection site. Recipient pigs were transplanted with islets at a dose of \u22655000 islet equivalents (IEQ) per kg body weight, which is analogous to the usual human situation. The native pancreas was removed at operation between days 96 and 100 as above. Grafts were biopsied 120 days after transplantation (i.e. 20 days after native pancreatectomy). No immunosuppression was provided. Islet samples were random",

            "text": "Despite the great success of allotransplantation and then xenotransplantation of islets, 60% islet loss within 2 to 3 days in either case (via intraportal transplantation strategy) turned out to be one of the hurdles in restoring adequate islet mass secreting enough amount of insulin. Induction of instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) as a result of activation of thrombosis and complement pathways is the sole reason for post-transplantation islet loss (13)(14)(15)(16). A multitude of strategies are now being attempted to reduce instant islet loss as a result of IBMIR (17)(18)(19). One recent advancement in this direction is CRISPR-Cas9mediated genetic modification for the development of IBMIRresistant pigs. Pig islets expressing human-derived complementregulatory protein (CD46) and tissue factor (CD39), either alone or in combination, turned out to be beneficial in maintaining a state of normoglycemia in diabetic monkeys for more than 1 year. Lately, abrogation of IBMIR in xenotransplantation of neonatal pig islet cell cluster in nonhuman primates (NHPs) by GGTA -/-CD55 + CD59 + pigs further proved the hypothesis (20,21). \n\nIn addition to IBMIR, immune incompatibility between donor and recipient is another major reason for xenogeneic rejection, and a potent immune suppression regimen is therefore needed to overcome xeno-immunity. Ironically, these permanent immune suppressants have shown to be deleterious and toxic for both islet grafts as well as recipients. Therefore, encapsulation of islets has been attempted in various clinical trials to rescue the pig islets from the recipient's immune response (22). Though islets encapsulated in various kinds of biocompatible materials are now being used in clinical trials, the biocompatibility of the encapsulating material is still a matter of debate.",

Oberholzer.1,2 1Bioengineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago; 2Surgery, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago. Islet transplantation is a promising therapy for T1DM, but shows variable success. A long-standing goal is to develop an effi cient system for the delivery of molecular cargos to islets in order to improve islet transplant outcomes. Common viral and non-viral systems can only deliver molecular cargos to the periphery cells of an islet. Most of these systems alternate islet function, pose potential oncogenic risks, and increase immunogenicity. Gold nanoparticles are macromolecular nanostructures with high biocompatibility containing void spaces in their interior regions and modifi able surface groups that allow conjugation of therapeutic drugs and proteins. Gold nanoparticles of 12 nm in size have demonstrated a high effi cacy to enter cells without auxiliary agents and minimal cytotoxicity. We hypothesize that gold nanoparticles could be used as a unique vehicle to deliver functional molecular cargos for islets. Previous studies performed in the lab indicated the ability to use Cy5 labeled gold nanoparticles conjugated with a specifi c oligonucleotide sequence. A new spherical nanoparticle tagged with Cy5 was tested for penetration effi cacy. Gold nanoparticles were conjugated with mRNA and tagged with green fl uorescent protein (GFP) in order to further determine the stability and time required for the mRNA to be delivered and expressed. Gold nanoparticle transfection effi cacy was tested in human islets using confocal microscopy and optimal concentration was determined. Islet function was evaluated by measuring the calcium infl ux and insulin secretion in response to glucose. (i) Confocal images showed high uptake of gold nanoparticles including islet cores. (ii) 12 nM of gold nanoparticles conjugated with Cy5, Cy5/Oligonucleotide and GFP/mRNA were tested for 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours of incubation in order to determine the optimal condition. (iii) The functionality of gold nanoparticle-treated islets was well preserved after 72 hours. There was no signifi cant difference in the intracellular calcium concentration of the control group versus the islets treated with gold nanoparticles (p>0.05). Mitochondrial potential indices demonstrated similarity between the control group and islets treated with gold nanoparticles (p>0.05). With the ability to use gold nanoparticles as a delivery system to islets with high transfection effi cacy will allow the possibility to conjugate a specifi c protein or siRNA.

Longstanding-diabetic NOD mice (2-3 weeks post-diagnosis) received 500 syngeneic insulitis-free islets under the kidney capsule and were subsequently injected with anti-CD3 (145-2C11 clone, 2.5 \u03bcg/d) i.v for 5 consecutive days and gavaged during 6 weeks with L.lactis-PINS+IL10 (2 \u00d7 109 CFU). Combining anti-CD3 with L.lactis-PINS+IL10 maintained graft function in 57% of diabetic recipients (n=7; 2 weeks post-diagnosis) compared to 37% in mice under anti-CD3 mono-therapy (n=11). Three weeks post-diagnosis, the combination therapy was successful in 42% of islet-transplanted mice (n=12) compared to 25% of mice receiving anti-CD3 alone (n=8). Normoglycemia was maintained long-term (>16 weeks post-transplantation). Each of the anti-CD3-based therapies increased the frequency of CD4+(CD25+)Foxp3+ T regulatory cells locally in the kidney-draining lymph nodes. These results demonstrate that orally-administered non-pathogenic and non-colonizing L.lactis modifi ed to secrete whole human PINS and IL10 can maintain normal blood glucose levels in islet-transplanted longstanding diabetic NOD mice when introduced in the window of opportunity for tolerance created by low-dose systemic anti-CD3 mAb.

Hawkes, E. Jimenez-Vera, P. O\u2019Connell. National Pancreas and Islet Transplant Unit, University of Sydney at Westmead Hospital, Westmead, NSW, Australia. Background The ability to consistently isolate large numbers of islets suitable for clinical transplantation is crucial to the success of islet transplantation. The aim of this study was to determine what donor characteristics were predictive of a transplantable islet preparation and whether enzyme type had an effect on attainment of transplantable islets.Method Islets were isolated from pancreases of heart beating deceased donors with a modifi cation of the Ricordi method using SERVA NB1 collagenase and NP (SERVA) or Liberase (Roche). Islet preparations were divided into transplanted and Nontransplanted, and total islet equivalents (IEQ) and IEQ/gram (IEQ/g) pancreas were compared. Donor characteristics such as donor age, body mass index (BMI), pancreas weight and cold ischaemic time (CIT) were also compared and analysed statistically. The Transplanted group was then stratifi ed according to donor age into 10 year cohorts and total IEQ and IEQ/g pancreas between cohorts compared. Results 150 islet isolations performed between 2003 and 2013 were evaluated. Islet preparations from DCD, IAK and type1 individuals were excluded. A total of 101 isolations were performed using SERVA and 49 using Liberase. Of these 35 were transplanted: 23/101 (1 in 4) SERVA and 12/47 (1 in 4) Liberase. Transplanted islet preparations had a greater total IEQ and IEQ/g pancreas compared to their non-transplanted counterparts. Donor characteristics predictive of a suitable islet preparation were shorter CIT (342\u00b123vs 421\u00b114min p=0.005), larger BMI (31.4\u00b11 vs 27.7\u00b1 0.5 kg/m2 p>0.001) and greater pancreas weight (101\u00b13 vs 85\u00b12g p>0.001). When stratifi ed for age of donor there were a number of signifi cant differences especially in the 40-49yr cohort where preparations achieved a signifi cantly greater number of IEQ (934,297\u00b1110,483 p=0.02) and IEQ/g pancreas (9,157\u00b11,047 p=0.001) with those in the >50y having lower numbers of IEQ and IEQ/g pancreas. Conclusions Donor factors predictive of a transplantable islet preparation were shorter CIT, higher BMI and larger pancreases. The pancreases from the 40\u201349 years age group provided greater islet yields. Both enzyme types yielded the same proportion of transplanted preparations.

            "abstract": "Dialysis as a therapy for end-stage kidney failure is life preserving but replaces only a small fraction of normal kidney function and has and considerable morbidity. Kidney transplantation provides a higher level of renal function and a less constrained lifestyle. However, it is limited by the numbers of human organs available. Use of oral hypoglycemic drugs and insulin are cornerstones of treatment for diabetes mellitus. However, adequate control of glucose levels cannot be attained by most patients, and intensive insulin therapy leads to hypoglycemia. In contrast, whole pancreas or islet transplantation can normalize glucose control. Unfortunately, a major limitation to the use of either is the insufficient supply of human organs. Furthermore each requires the use of immune suppression that, in effect, trades one set of morbidities (associated with diabetes and its medical treatment) for another (associated with immune suppression) [1]. \n \nCell therapies offer an alternative to whole organ replacement. This issue of Current Opinion in Organ Transplantation, organogenesis and organ regeneration and repair after transplantation focuses on novel cell therapies under development for kidney disease and diabetes mellitus and the some of the scientific underpinnings that will enable their use. \n \nThe first contribution, Classic and current opinion in embryonic organ transplantation [2] represents an exercise of the section editor\u2019s prerogative to summarize his investigations into the use of embryonic kidney or pancreas transplantation as an organ replacement therapy. Historical (classic) precedents for the use of embryonic primordia as donor organs are reviewed as are important antecedent investigations, one [3] from a contributing author for this issue [4]. An important key point is, on the basis of the author\u2019s experience and that of others, it is impossible to know what will happen after an embryonic organ is transplanted to an ectopic site until one does the experiment. \n \nIn the second contribution, Drs. Patricia Murray and Adrian Woolf update the journal\u2019s readership on the use of stem and progenitor cells to recapitulate kidney function [4]. Within this field, the authors highlight recent research papers focusing on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and kidney-derived stem/progenitor cells (KSPCs). ln preclinical studies, MSCs ameliorate varied acute and chronic kidney diseases. Their efficacy depends on immunomodulatory and paracrine properties. MSCs do not differentiate into functional kidney epithelia. iPSCs can be derived from healthy individuals or from patients with kidney disease by forced expression of precursor genes. Like ESCs, iPSCs are pluripotent and theoretically have the potential to form functional kidney epithelia when used therapeutically. KSPCs, existing as cell subsets within adult and developing kidneys, constitute attractive future therapeutic agents. Molecular, morphological and functional characterization of \u2018kidney cells\u2019 generated from ESCs, iPSCs, KSPCs have not been exhaustive, and long-term safety associated with their use has yet to be established. \n \nNext, Drs. Luis Tapias and Harald Ott summarize recent investigations employing the use of decellularized scaffolds to bioengineer functional organs including heart, lung, and liver [5]. In addition, Dr. Ott\u2019s own elegant work describing regeneration and experimental orthotopic transplantation of a bioengineered kidney occupies a deservedly prominent place in the review [6]. Decellularized whole-organ scaffolds can be obtained from virtually any organ in the body. The scaffolds retain the specific microarchitecture of the extracellular matrix preserving the organ\u2019s three dimensional blueprint. The use of human pluripotent stem cells extracted from a patient requiring organ replacement holds great promise to repopulate decellularized scaffolds. Bioengineered organs have been successfully created in the laboratory and transplanted in small animal models. However, thus far the regenerated organs have shown only rudimentary function [5]. \n \nA review highlighting current insights into the renal collecting system is next. Drs. Kevin Bush, Gleb Martovetsky and Sanjay Nigam explain why the ureteric bud can be considered an iterative tip-stalk generator (ITSG), how its morphogenesis can be recapitulated ex vivo, and how cultured ureteric bud retains inductive competence and can incorporate appropriately into engineered kidney like tissues. The authors propose that the inherent ability of the ureteric bud to branch can be exploited to generate the scaffold around which to build a renal structure ex vivo, as happens during kidney development. \n \nThis issue concludes with a manuscript from Drs Ricardo Calafiore, Pia Montanucci and Guiseppe Basta that outlines strategies for stimulating endogenous pancreatic progenitor cells or for using of exogenous stem cells for the treatment of diabetes mellitus [8] and one from Drs. Aaron DeWard, Junji Komori and Eric Lagasse entitled, Ectopic Transplantation sites for cell-based therapy [9]. Drs. DeWard, Komori and Lagasse opine that a major reason why hematopoetic stem cell transplantation has been superior to alternative cell therapies is the ability to adequately address what they term the four S\u2019s: source, surveillance, safety, and site. Their review briefly discusses each of these components, with the main focus on the site of transplantation as a major factor to achieve clinical success. The authors consider potential benefits and limitations of ectopic transplantation sites used in rodent studies that could be employed in patients. The sites include the sub-renal capsular, subcutaneous, intra peritoneal or intra venous spaces, and the spleen or muscle. They point out that the ideal transplantation site needs to be relatively accessible, provide sufficient space, offer access to vasculature, and support long-term engraftment, suggest that the lymph node meets these criteria better than other commonly used sites, and envision the lymph node acting as an in vivo bioreactor to support ectopic tissue function [9]. Interestingly, members of this group have described engraftment of functional hepatocytes in lymph nodes following intra peritoneal injection [10], similar to engraftment of beta cells originating from embryonic pig pancreas after mesenteric implantation [2]. \n \nThe contributions included herein reflect the section editor\u2019s interest in using cell based therapies to replace renal or endocrine pancreatic function.

Here we report the successful engraftment of islets in diabetic cynomolgus monkeys when loaded on a synthetic biodegradable scaffold and placed in an omental pouch. One autologous and five allogeneic diabetic monkey transplants under the cover of steroid\u2010free immune suppression (SFIS) were undertaken. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and C\u2010peptide (CP), exogenous insulin requirements (EIR), intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), A1C and histopathology were used to assess islet engraftment and survival. All animals achieved CP levels > 1.0 ng/mL following transplant, a 66\u201392% posttransplant decrease in EIR and reduced A1C. Following graft removal, CP became negative and histopathological analysis of the explanted grafts demonstrated well\u2010granulated and well\u2010vascularized, insulin\u2010positive islets, surrounded by T\u2010cell subsets and macrophages. Compared to intrahepatic allogeneic islet transplants (n = 20), there was a delayed engraftment for omental pouch recipients but similar levels of CP production were ultimately achieved, with a broad range of IEQ/kg transplanted in both sites. Our results suggest this extrahepatic transplantation site has potential as an alternative site for clinical islet cell transplantation."

Glucose tolerance was most different and therefore significant (P = 0.001) in high-fat-fed mice after 6 h of fasting (1,973 +/- 96 vs. 1,248 +/- 83 mmol.l(-1).120 min(-1)). The difference in glucose tolerance was greater following an OGTT (142%), in contrast to an IPGTT, with a 127% difference between high fat and chow. We also found that administering 2 g/kg of glucose resulted in a greater level of significance (P = 0.0008) in glucose intolerance in high-fat- compared with chow-fed mice. A fixed dose of 50 mg glucose regardless of body weight was enough to show glucose intolerance in high-fat- vs. chow-fed mice. Finally, high-fat-fed mice showed glucose intolerance compared with their chow-fed counterparts whether they were tested under conscious or anesthetized conditions. We conclude that 2 g/kg glucose administered orally following 6 h of fasting is best to assess glucose tolerance in mice under these conditions.",

Pigs were fed a control diet or a diet supplemented with 200 micrograms of Cr/kg of diet as CrPic. Thirty (15 per diet, initial BW was 21.3 kg) and 24 (12 per diet, initial BW was 24.9 kg) crossbred barrows were used in Exp. 1 and 2, respectively. The diets were formulated to provide 120% of the lysine requirement for 20- to 50-kg pigs. A glucose tolerance test (IVGTT; 500 mg of glucose/kg BW) and an insulin challenge test (IVICT; .1 IU of porcine insulin/kg BW) were conducted. In addition, during Exp. 1, a GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) challenge was conducted. All data were pooled across experiments, except where noted. Average daily gain, ADFI, gain/feed, and fasting (15 to 18 h) plasma glucose and total protein concentrations were not affected (P > .10) by dietary treatment. Fasting plasma cholesterol (P < .05) was increased and NEFA (Exp. 2 only, P < .02), urea N (P < .07), and insulin (P < .10) concentrations were decreased in pigs fed CrPic. During the IVGTT and IVICT, glucose disappearance rate (k, percentage/minute) was increased (P < .04) and glucose half-life (t1/2, minutes) was decreased (P < .04) in pigs fed CrPic; however, insulin kinetics were not altered (P > .10). During the GHRH challenge, pigs fed CrPic had decreased (P < .09) area under the response curve for GH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

However, measurement of beta-cell function as an estimate of beta-cell mass is currently the only method possible in humans. The present study was performed to investigate different functional tests as predictors of beta-cell mass in the G\u00f6ttingen minipig. beta-cell mass was reduced in the G\u00f6ttingen minipig with a combination of nicotinamide (100 [n = 6], 67 [n = 25], 20 [n = 2], or 0 mg/kg [n = 4]) and streptozotocin (125 mg/kg). Six normal pigs were included. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (n = 43) and insulin secretion test (n = 30) were performed and pancreata obtained for stereological determination of beta-cell mass. During OGTT, fasting glucose (r(2) = 0.1744, P < 0.01), area under the curve for glucose (r(2) = 0.2706, P < 0.001), maximum insulin secretion (r(2) = 0.2160, P < 0.01), and maximum C-peptide secretion (r(2) = 0.1992, P < 0.01) correlated with beta-cell mass.

To examine the clinical relevance of glucocorticoid programming, we gave 50, 120, or 200 microg/kg/d of dexamethasone (dex50, dex120, or dex200) orally from mid-term to a singleton-bearing nonhuman primate, Chlorocebus aethiops (African vervet). Dexamethasone dose-dependently reduced maternal cortisol levels without effecting maternal blood pressure, glucose, electrolytes, or weight gain. Birth weight was unaffected by any dexamethasone dose, although postnatal growth was attenuated after dex120 and dex200. At 8 months of age, dex120 and dex200 offspring showed impaired glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinemia, with reduced (approximately 25%) pancreatic beta cell number at 12 months. Dex120 and dex200 offspring had increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures at 12 months. Mild stress produced an exaggerated cortisol response in dex200 offspring, implying hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis programming.

Pigs were provided free access to either a control diet (C) containing 204 microg Cr/kg or a diet supplemented with an additional 200 microg Cr/kg as high Cr yeast (CR) for between 23 and 30 d. After overnight food deprivation, dextrose (500 g/L) was infused through a jugular vein catheter at a dose of 0.5 g glucose/kg body weight with an infusion rate of 10 g glucose/min within 6 min. High Cr yeast supplementation did not affect body weight gain or food intake. There were no differences in fasting plasma concentrations of either glucose or C-peptide, although basal plasma concentration of insulin tended to be higher in pigs fed CR (P<0.10). Plasma glucose concentrations were lower (P<0.01) at postinfusion times 5, 10, 15 and 20 min in pigs fed CR. Plasma insulin concentrations in pigs fed CR were higher (P<0.05) at 2 and 0 min before the completion of dextrose infusion. However, the increase in plasma insulin concentrations was not accompanied by a comparable elevation in plasma C-peptide concentrations. The 30-min (postinfusion) area of plasma glucose concentrations tended to be lower (P<0.10) in pigs fed CR, but there were no differences in 30-min areas of either plasma insulin or plasma C-peptide concentrations between treatments. Plasma clearance rates of glucose, insulin and C-peptide were higher and their half-lives shorter (P<0.05) in pigs fed CR. In conclusion, dietary high Cr yeast supplementation improved glucose tolerance, possibly through a decrease in hepatic extraction of insulin."

Eventual failure of these devices was believed to be related to loss of islet viability and/or insufficient islet mass. The current study evaluates the effect of increased islet mass produced by implantation of two islet-seeded devices in pancreatectomized dogs and compares the results with those from dogs that received a single device. Twelve of fifteen dogs receiving single devices showed initial function as determined by elimination or reduction of exogenous insulin requirement; four showed initial function and seven showed extended function (100 to 284 days). Excessive weight loss (more than 20%), despite normal FBS and insulin dependence, required that four animals in this latter group be killed. Devices seeded with xenogeneic islets have met with limited success. One dog that received two bovine islet-seeded devices achieved function for more than 100 days; the remaining bovine-seeded devices (n = 8) functioned for only 3 to 16 days. Porcine islet-seeded devices were assessed by intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT). Recipients of two devices seeded with allogeneic islets demonstrated improved IVGTT results when compared to those from pancreatectomized dogs and recipients of single devices but were abnormal when compared to intact animals. Histologic examination of device and autopsy material from all failed experiments was performed and showed no mononuclear cell infiltration of the islet chamber or vascular graft material, only a few incidence of device thrombosis, and varying degrees of islet viability as judged by morphologic and immunohistochemical evaluation. The authors believe they have demonstrated progress toward the development and clinical applicability of the Hybrid Artificial Pancreas.",

Here, we compare the efficacy of transplanting vascularized versus nonvascularized islets into diabetic allogeneic swine recipients. In the vascularized islet transplantation (5,000 islet equivalents [IE]/kg), recipients received minor-mismatched (n = 4) or fully-mismatched (n = 2) IKs after pancreatectomy, with a 12-day course of cyclosporine A (CyA) or FK506, respectively. For the nonvascularized islet transplantation (7,000 IE/kg), three recipients received minor-mismatched islets alone and two recipients received minor-mismatched donor islets placed in a donor kidney on the day of transplantation. All recipients of nonvascularized islets were treated with a 12-day course of CyA. With vascularized islet transplantation, pancreatectomized recipients were markedly hyperglycemic pretransplant (fasting blood glucose >300 mg/dl). After composite IK transplantation, all recipients developed and maintained normoglycemia (<120 mg/dl) and stable renal function indefinitely (>3 months), and insulin therapy was not required. Major histocompatibility complex-mismatched recipients demonstrated in vitro donor-specific unresponsiveness. In contrast, recipients of nonvascularized islets remained hyperglycemic. In conclusion, IK allografts cured surgically induced diabetes across allogeneic barriers, whereas nonvascularized islet transplants did not. These data indicate that prevascularization of islet allografts is crucial for their subsequent engraftment and that composite IKs may provide a strategy for successful islet transplantation."

Type 1 diabetes results from the failure of the beta cells in pancreas to produce enough insulin (Basevi, 2011). Transplantation of pancreatic islets containing insulin producing \u03b2 cells has recently been used to cure type 1 diabetes. However, allo-islet transplantation is limited owing to shortage of donors; instead, xenotransplantation using islets from non-human animals has emerged as an alternative source of donor tissue. Owing to their physiological similarities to humans, ease of mass breeding, and availability of breeding in pathogen-free facilities, pigs are considered an optimal animal model for xeno-islet transplantation (Klymiuk et al., 2016).",

The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of differentorgans, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. Several pathogenic processes are involved in the development of diabetes. These range from autoimmune destruction of the -cells of the pancreas with consequent insulin deficiency to abnormalities that result in resistance to insulin action. The basis of the abnormalities in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism in diabetes is deficient action of insulin on target tissues. Deficient insulin action results from inadequate insulin secretion and/or diminished tissue responses to insulin at one or more points in the complex pathways of hormone action. Impairment of insulin secretion and defects in insulin action frequently coexist in the same patient, and it is often unclear which abnormality, if either alone, is the primary cause of the hyperglycemia. Symptoms of marked hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, sometimes with polyphagia, and blurred vision. Impairment of growth and susceptibility to certain infections may also accompany chronic hyperglycemia. Acute, life-threatening consequences of uncontrolled diabetes are hyperglycemia with ketoacidosis or the nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome. Long-term complications of diabetes include retinopathy with potential loss of vision; nephropathy leading to renal failure; peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot ulcers, amputations, and Charcot joints; and autonomic neuropathy causing gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cardiovascular symptoms and sexual dysfunction. Patients with diabetes have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular, peripheral arterial, and cerebrovascular disease. Hypertension and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism are often found in people with diabetes. The vast majority of cases of diabetes fall into two broad etiopathogenetic categories (discussed in greater detail below). In one category, type 1 diabetes, the cause is an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion. Individuals at increased risk of developing this type of diabetes can often be identified by serological evidence of an autoimmune pathologic process occurring in the pancreatic islets and by genetic markers. In the other, much more prevalent category, type 2 diabetes, the cause is a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. In the latter category, a degree of hyperglycemia sufficient to cause pathologic and functional changes in various target tissues, but without clinical symptoms, may be present for a long period of time before diabetes is detected. During this asymptomatic period, it is possible to demonstrate an abnormality in carbohydrate metabolism by measurement of plasma glucose in the fasting state or after a challenge with an oral glucose load. The degree of hyperglycemia (if any) may change over time, depending on the extent of the underlying disease process (Fig. 1). A disease process may be present but may not have progressed far enough to cause hyperglycemia. The same disease process can cause impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) without fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes. In some individuals with diabetes, adequate glycemic control can be achieved with weight reduction, exercise, and/or oral glucoselowering agents. These individuals therefore do not require insulin. Other individuals who have some residual insulin secretion but require exogenous insulin for adequate glycemic control can survive without it. Individuals with extensive -cell destruction and therefore no residual insulin secretion require insulin for survival. The severity of the metabolic abnormality can progress, regress, or stay the same. Thus, the degree of hyperglycemia reflects the severity of the underlying metabolic process and its treatment more than the nature of the process itself."

Type 1 diabetes results from the failure of the beta cells in pancreas to produce enough insulin (Basevi, 2011). Transplantation of pancreatic islets containing insulin producing \u03b2 cells has recently been used to cure type 1 diabetes. However, allo-islet transplantation is limited owing to shortage of donors; instead, xenotransplantation using islets from non-human animals has emerged as an alternative source of donor tissue. Owing to their physiological similarities to humans, ease of mass breeding, and availability of breeding in pathogen-free facilities, pigs are considered an optimal animal model for xeno-islet transplantation (Klymiuk et al., 2016)."

However, the shortage of islet donors limits its\u2019 broad application. Porcine islet xenotransplantation presents a solution to the donor shortage and recent advances in genetic modification and immunosuppressive regimens provide renewed enthusiasm for the potential of this treatment. Recent findings Advances in genetic editing technology are leading to multigene modified porcine islet donors with alterations in expression of known xenoantigens, modifications of their complement and coagulation systems, and modifications to gain improved immunological compatibility. Recent NHP-based trials of costimulation blockade using CD154 blockade show promising improvements in islet survival, whereas results targeting CD40 are less consistent. Furthermore, trials using IL-6 receptor antagonism have yet to demonstrate improvement in glucose control and suffer from poor graft revascularization. Summary This review will detail the current status of islet xenotransplantation as a potential treatment for type I diabetes mellitus, focusing on recent advances in porcine xenogeneic islet production, assessment in nonhuman primate preclinical models, the outcome of human clinical trials and review barriers to translation of xenoislets to the clinic.",

Subcutaneous pouch is a potential site for islet transplantation. However, insufficient oxygen supply remains challenging. Pretreatment of neovascularization using basic fibroblast growth factor can solve this, but it needs 2\u00d7 operations. We developed a device that contains rat islets in chitosan gel packed in a bag made of highly biocompatible ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer porous membrane. This study investigated whether coencapsulation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) with islets in the device enables novel method of prevascularization-free primary subcutaneous transplantation. Methods. In vitro experiments examined slow release of HGF from the chitosan gel and islet-protection effect of HGF against hypoxia. In the latter, rat islets with/without HGF (200\u2009ng/mL) was cultured in 1% oxygen. In in vivo experiment, fabricated device with/without HGF (10 \u03bcg/device) containing rat islets was primarily transplanted to streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice subcutaneously. Results. In vitro experiments showed sustained release of HGF for 28 d and alleviating effect of HGF on cell death and glucose-responsive insulin release after hypoxic culture. Islet + HGF mice, but not islet-alone mice, showed decreased nonfasting blood glucose and regained body weight after transplantation. In intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, islet + HGF mice exhibited decreased fasting blood glucose (200 \u00b1 55\u2009mg/dL) and good blood glucose disappearance rate (K value) (0.817 \u00b1 0.101) comparing to normal mice (123 \u00b1 28\u2009mg/dL and 1.074 \u00b1 0.374, respectively). However, in islet-alone mice, fasting blood glucose was high (365 \u00b1 172\u2009mg/dL) and K value was indeterminable. Serum insulin in islet + HGF mice (1.58 \u00b1 0.94 \u03bcg/L) was close to normal mice (1.66 \u00b1 0.55 \u03bcg/L), whereas those in islet-alone mice (0.279 \u00b1 0.076 \u03bcg/L) and diabetic mice (0.165 \u00b1 0.079 \u03bcg/L) were low. Immunohistochemical examination showed intact insulin- and glucagon-positive islets in retrieved devices with HGF, but no intact islet was found in the device without HGF. Conclusions. HGF could enhance islet survival in hypoxia and enhance in vivo function of encapsulated islets after primary subcutaneous transplantation."

We have examined the fate of islet xenografts in a recipient with direct relevance to man, the cynomolgus monkey. Rabbit islets were prepared by an intraductal collagenase technique and incubated in neat rabbit, human, or cynomolgus serum, with and without heat inactivation, for up to 6 days. Islets were analyzed by flow cytometry for IGG and IGM binding, and scored for viability by supravital staining. For in vivo studies, isolated islets were prepared from 4 New Zealand White rabbits (15-34 x 10(3) islets 70-85% purity) and transplanted beneath the kidney capsule of normal cynomolgus monkeys after aggregation in either a rabbit or monkey blood clot. The tissue was retrieved at various times up to 4 days after transplantation and processed for light and electron microscopy. The results showed that rabbit islets bind heterophile antibody of both IGG and IGM subtypes. There was slow loss of islet viability in vitro over 3 days of culture in neat human or cynomolgus serum. Destruction of islets in vivo was more rapid with visible damage within 6 hr associated with neutrophil infiltration. Subsequently, there was heavy mononuclear cell infiltration leading to total destruction within 4 days. The results suggest that immediate mechanisms of graft rejection, possibly compliment and neutrophil mediated, represent a major barrier to islet xenotransplantation in humans.",

However, the shortage of islet donors limits its\u2019 broad application. Porcine islet xenotransplantation presents a solution to the donor shortage and recent advances in genetic modification and immunosuppressive regimens provide renewed enthusiasm for the potential of this treatment. Recent findings Advances in genetic editing technology are leading to multigene modified porcine islet donors with alterations in expression of known xenoantigens, modifications of their complement and coagulation systems, and modifications to gain improved immunological compatibility. Recent NHP-based trials of costimulation blockade using CD154 blockade show promising improvements in islet survival, whereas results targeting CD40 are less consistent. Furthermore, trials using IL-6 receptor antagonism have yet to demonstrate improvement in glucose control and suffer from poor graft revascularization. Summary This review will detail the current status of islet xenotransplantation as a potential treatment for type I diabetes mellitus, focusing on recent advances in porcine xenogeneic islet production, assessment in nonhuman primate preclinical models, the outcome of human clinical trials and review barriers to translation of xenoislets to the clinic.",

Since insulin is released by the islets of Langerhans, obtaining viable and functional islets is critical for research and transplantation. The effective and efficient isolation of these small islands of endocrine cells from the sea of exocrine tissue that is the rest of the pancreas is not necessarily simple or quick. Choosing and administering the digestive enzyme, separation of the islets from acinar tissue, and culture of islets are all things that must be considered. The purpose of this review is to provide a history of the development of islet isolation procedures and to serve as a practical guide to rodent islet research for newcomers to islet biology. We discuss key elements of mouse islet isolation including choosing collagenase, the digestion process, purification of islets using a density gradient, and islet culture conditions. In addition, this paper reviews techniques for assessing islet viability and function such as visual assessment, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and intracellular calcium measurements. A detailed protocol is provided that describes a common method our laboratory uses to obtain viable and functional mouse islets for in vitro study. This review thus provides a strong foundation for successful procurement and purification of high-quality mouse islets for research purposes.",

Islet transplantation plays an important role in the treatment of T1DM, with the improved glycometabolic control, the reduced progression of complications, the reduction of hypoglycemic episodes when compared with traditional insulin therapy. The results of phase III clinical trial also demonstrated the safety and efficacy of islet allotransplantation in T1DM. However, the shortage of pancreas donors limits its widespread use. Animals as a source of islets such as the pig offer an alternative choice. Because the architecture of the pig pancreas is different from the islets of mice or humans, the pig islet isolation procedure is still challenging. Since the translation of alternative porcine islet sources (xenogeneic) to the clinical setting for treating T1DM through cellular transplantation is of great importance, a cost-effective, standardized, and reproducible protocol for isolating porcine islets is urgently needed. This manuscript describes a simplified and cost-effective method to isolate and purify adult porcine islets based on the previous protocols that have successfully transplanted porcine islets to non-human primates.

Therefore, the establishment of alternative donor sources and engineered tissue which enables to produce appropriate insulin for controlling blood glucose is an important challenge. The adult pig is a promising and feasible donor source and materials for the engineered tissue for the clinical setting among various candidates. The recent progress of gene-editing technology contributes to possible clinical porcine xenotransplantation, including porcine islet xenotransplantation. For the success of future clinical porcine islet xenotransplantation, establishing an islet isolation technique for acquiring adequate, good quality porcine islets is equally important to use a gene-edited pig. However, the characteristics of porcine islets are different from other species; therefore, establishing a suitable technique for porcine islets is challenging.",

However, information on precautions when using this animal as an experimental model is limited. This review of the literature covers the gamut from the selection of the animal model all the way to its death, and describes procedures for transporting, raising, breeding, housing, administering anesthesia and handling so as to rationalize the utilization of this species while exploiting its unique characteristics. Based upon the literature and our own experience with white New Zealand rabbits, we conclude that the rabbit is an adequate model for experimental surgery."

Although a range of well-characterized and widely used models of type 1 diabetes in rodents are currently available, large animal models are a valuable complement to rodent models for both physiological and practical reasons. The pig is very useful in many aspects as a model for human physiology and pathophysiology because many organ systems of this species, as well as physiological and pathophysiological responses, resemble those of the human. The G\u00f6ttingen minipig is particularly suitable for long-term studies because of its inherent small size and ease of handling, even at full maturity. Of particular relevance to the field of type 1 diabetes are the many similarities evident between humans and pigs with regard to pharmacokinetics of compounds after subcutaneous administration, structure and function of the gastrointestinal tract, morphology of the pancreas, and the overall metabolic status of the two species. Because spontaneous type 1-like diabetes is very rare in pigs, a model of the condition must be induced experimentally, either surgically or chemically. This process is discussed, and the use of the pig as a model in islet transplantation and diabetic complications is briefly summarized."

Using xenogeneic islets for transplantation is required in light of donor shortage and the large number of diabetic patients that qualify for islet transplantation. Until now, however, host immunoreactivity against the xenogeneic graft has been a major drawback for the use of porcine islets. Our study demonstrates the applicability of a novel immunoprotective membrane that allows successful xenotransplantation of rat islets in diabetic minipigs without immunosuppressive therapy. Rat pancreatic islets were encapsulated in highly purified alginate and integrated into a plastic macrochamber covered by a poly-membrane for subcutaneous transplantation. Diabetic Sinclair pigs were transplanted and followed for up to 90 days. We demonstrated a persistent graft function and restoration of normoglycemia without the need for immunosuppressive therapy. This concept could potentially offer an attractive strategy for a more widespread islet replacement therapy that would restore endogenous insulin secretion in diabetic patients without the need for immunosuppressive drugs and may even open up an avenue for safe utilization of xenogeneic islet donors."

The NOD mouse strain is an excellent model of autoimmune disease and an important tool for dissecting tolerance mechanisms. The strength of this mouse strain is that it develops spontaneous autoimmune diabetes, which shares many similarities to autoimmune or type 1a diabetes (T1D) in human subjects, including the presence of pancreas-specific autoantibodies, autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and genetic linkage to disease syntenic to that found in humans. During the past ten years, investigators have used a wide variety of tools to study these mice, including immunological reagents and transgenic and knockout strains; these tools have tremendously enhanced the study of the fundamental disease mechanisms. In addition, investigators have recently developed a number of therapeutic interventions in this animal model that have now been translated into human therapies. In this review, we summarize many of the important features of disease development and progression in the NOD strain, emphasizing the role of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms that affect diabetes in these mice. The information gained from this highly relevant model of human disease will lead to potential therapies that may alter the development of the disease and its progression in patients with T1D.",

We present a novel strategy for inducing long-lasting islet graft survival in diabetic NOD mice in the absence of posttransplant immunosuppression by initial treatment with antilymphocyte serum (ALS) followed by coadministration of donor pancreatic lymph node cells (PLNCs). When treated with ALS/PLNC, diabetic NOD mice become normoglycemic and tolerated minor antigen-disparate islet grafts for >100 days and syngeneic islet grafts indefinitely. Donor T-cells are required for graft prolongation, and tolerant hosts have long-term donor T-cell chimerism. Strikingly, host autoreactive T-cells from mice with long-surviving islet grafts predominantly produce interleukin-4, whereas autoreactive T-cells from mice that rejected their islet grafts predominantly produce interferon-gamma. We thus demonstrate a clinically relevant approach for ablation of recurrent autoimmunity in islet transplantation, involving donor lymphocyte-driven alteration of pathogenic autoreactive T-cells.",

T1DM has classically been attributed to the pathogenic actions of auto-reactive effector T cells(Teffs) on the \u03b2 cell. Recent literature now suggests that a failure of a second T cell subtype, known as regulatory T cells (Tregs), plays a critical role in the development of T1DM. During immune homeostasis, Tregs counterbalance the actions of autoreactive Teff cells, thereby participating in peripheral tolerance. An imbalance in the activity between Teff and Tregs may be crucial in the breakdown of peripheral tolerance, leading to the development of T1DM. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of Treg function in health and in T1DM, and examine the effect of experimental therapies for T1DM on Treg cell number and function in both mice and humans."

                            "DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF DIABETES MELLITUS \u2014 Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of differentorgans, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. Several pathogenic processes are involved in the development of diabetes. These range from autoimmune destruction of the -cells of the pancreas with consequent insulin deficiency to abnormalities that result in resistance to insulin action. The basis of the abnormalities in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism in diabetes is deficient action of insulin on target tissues. Deficient insulin action results from inadequate insulin secretion and/or diminished tissue responses to insulin at one or more points in the complex pathways of hormone action. Impairment of insulin secretion and defects in insulin action frequently coexist in the same patient, and it is often unclear which abnormality, if either alone, is the primary cause of the hyperglycemia. Symptoms of marked hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, sometimes with polyphagia, and blurred vision. Impairment of growth and susceptibility to certain infections may also accompany chronic hyperglycemia. Acute, life-threatening consequences of uncontrolled diabetes are hyperglycemia with ketoacidosis or the nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome. Long-term complications of diabetes include retinopathy with potential loss of vision; nephropathy leading to renal failure; peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot ulcers, amputations, and Charcot joints; and autonomic neuropathy causing gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cardiovascular symptoms and sexual dysfunction. Patients with diabetes have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular, peripheral arterial, and cerebrovascular disease. Hypertension and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism are often found in people with diabetes. The vast majority of cases of diabetes fall into two broad etiopathogenetic categories (discussed in greater detail below). In one category, type 1 diabetes, the cause is an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion. Individuals at increased risk of developing this type of diabetes can often be identified by serological evidence of an autoimmune pathologic process occurring in the pancreatic islets and by genetic markers. In the other, much more prevalent category, type 2 diabetes, the cause is a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. In the latter category, a degree of hyperglycemia sufficient to cause pathologic and functional changes in various target tissues, but without clinical symptoms, may be present for a long period of time before diabetes is detected. During this asymptomatic period, it is possible to demonstrate an abnormality in carbohydrate metabolism by measurement of plasma glucose in the fasting state or after a challenge with an oral glucose load. The degree of hyperglycemia (if any) may change over time, depending on the extent of the underlying disease process (Fig. 1). A disease process may be present but may not have progressed far enough to cause hyperglycemia. The same disease process can cause impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) without fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes. In some individuals with diabetes, adequate glycemic control can be achieved with weight reduction, exercise, and/or oral glucoselowering agents. These individuals therefore do not require insulin. Other individuals who have some residual insulin secretion but require exogenous insulin for adequate glycemic control can survive without it. Individuals with extensive -cell destruction and therefore no residual insulin secretion require insulin for survival. The severity of the metabolic abnormality can progress, regress, or stay the same. Thus, the degree of hyperglycemia reflects the severity of the underlying metabolic process and its treatment more than the nature of the process itself."

Xenotransplantation, with pigs as donors, offers the possibility of using healthy, living, and genetically modified islets from pathogen-free animals available in unlimited number of islets. Several studies in the pig-to-nonhuman primate model demonstrated the feasibility of successful preclinical islet xenotransplantation and have provided insights into the critical events and possible mechanisms of immune recognition and rejection of xenogeneic islet grafts. Particularly promising results in the achievement of prolonged insulin independence were obtained with newly developed, genetically modified pigs islets able to produce immunoregulatory products, using different implantation sites, and new immunotherapeutic strategies."

The autoimmunity of NOD mice is characterized by several abnormalities in the immune system including the presence of pancreasspecific autoantibodies, autoreactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and defects in T regulatory cells (Anderson et al., 2005)(Cabrera et al., 2012), which also appear in T1DM patients and rarely exist in surgical/STZ-induced NHP models of IDDM. In order to successfully perform clinical islet transplantation, it is essential to control the allo-, xeno-, and autoimmunity. The NOD mice represent the suitable models for dissecting tolerance mechanisms and assessing influences of different types of immunity in islet transplantation (Wang et al., 2014)(Deng et al., 2014)(Shi et al., 2004)(Thomas et al., 1995). And obtained experimental results are the important improvements and supplements to the preclinical findings in diabetic NHPs."

                            "Insufficient insulin secretion is a key component of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Since insulin is released by the islets of Langerhans, obtaining viable and functional islets is critical for research and transplantation. The effective and efficient isolation of these small islands of endocrine cells from the sea of exocrine tissue that is the rest of the pancreas is not necessarily simple or quick. Choosing and administering the digestive enzyme, separation of the islets from acinar tissue, and culture of islets are all things that must be considered. The purpose of this review is to provide a history of the development of islet isolation procedures and to serve as a practical guide to rodent islet research for newcomers to islet biology. We discuss key elements of mouse islet isolation including choosing collagenase, the digestion process, purification of islets using a density gradient, and islet culture conditions. In addition, this paper reviews techniques for assessing islet viability and function such as visual assessment, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and intracellular calcium measurements. A detailed protocol is provided that describes a common method our laboratory uses to obtain viable and functional mouse islets for in vitro study. This review thus provides a strong foundation for successful procurement and purification of high-quality mouse islets for research purposes."

                            "Islet transplantation is a useful therapeutic choice for severe diabetes mellitus; however, limited donor supplies have interfered with the use of this treatment. Therefore, the establishment of alternative donor sources and engineered tissue which enables to produce appropriate insulin for controlling blood glucose is an important challenge. The adult pig is a promising and feasible donor source and materials for the engineered tissue for the clinical setting among various candidates. The recent progress of gene-editing technology contributes to possible clinical porcine xenotransplantation, including porcine islet xenotransplantation. For the success of future clinical porcine islet xenotransplantation, establishing an islet isolation technique for acquiring adequate, good quality porcine islets is equally important to use a gene-edited pig. However, the characteristics of porcine islets are different from other species; therefore, establishing a suitable technique for porcine islets is challenging."

While rats and mice are common in studies (Corbin et al., 2021), primates closely model human diabetes (Hamelmann et al., 1994)[30], and pigs are used both in research and clinically, particularly in xenotransplantation techniques developed in Asian countries [11,(Bertera et al., 2020)(Coe et al., 2020)(Lu et al., 2021)[32]. However, the use of rabbits is rare in modern studies of type 1 diabetes."

                            "Transplantation of pancreatic islets from other species to man has the potential to cure diabetes, but whether such islet grafts will be subject to damage due to natural antibody-mediated hyperacute rejection is unknown. We have examined the fate of islet xenografts in a recipient with direct relevance to man, the cynomolgus monkey. Rabbit islets were prepared by an intraductal collagenase technique and incubated in neat rabbit, human, or cynomolgus serum, with and without heat inactivation, for up to 6 days. Islets were analyzed by flow cytometry for IGG and IGM binding, and scored for viability by supravital staining. For in vivo studies, isolated islets were prepared from 4 New Zealand White rabbits (15-34 x 10(3) islets 70-85% purity) and transplanted beneath the kidney capsule of normal cynomolgus monkeys after aggregation in either a rabbit or monkey blood clot. The tissue was retrieved at various times up to 4 days after transplantation and processed for light and electron microscopy. The results showed that rabbit islets bind heterophile antibody of both IGG and IGM subtypes. There was slow loss of islet viability in vitro over 3 days of culture in neat human or cynomolgus serum. Destruction of islets in vivo was more rapid with visible damage within 6 hr associated with neutrophil infiltration. Subsequently, there was heavy mononuclear cell infiltration leading to total destruction within 4 days. The results suggest that immediate mechanisms of graft rejection, possibly compliment and neutrophil mediated, represent a major barrier to islet xenotransplantation in humans."

In addition, caprine islets elicited an insulin response under both basal-and glucose-stimulated conditions, with insulin levels equivalent to those obtained with islets from other mammals such as pigs, cows, and dogs, but less than those obtained with rodent islets [39]. Rodent islets secrete much more insulin than islets from human or porcine sources, either basally or under glucose stimulation [40]. Caprine islet cells are efficient insulin-producing cells, similar to human and porcine islet cells, because they were able to maintain euglycemia and glucose responsiveness in recipients."

                            "Previously the authors reported on a Hybrid Artificial Pancreas device that maintained patent vascular anastomoses in normal dogs and, when seeded with allogeneic canine islets, maintained normal fasting blood sugars (FBS) in diabetic pancreatectomized dogs. Eventual failure of these devices was believed to be related to loss of islet viability and/or insufficient islet mass. The current study evaluates the effect of increased islet mass produced by implantation of two islet-seeded devices in pancreatectomized dogs and compares the results with those from dogs that received a single device. Twelve of fifteen dogs receiving single devices showed initial function as determined by elimination or reduction of exogenous insulin requirement; four showed initial function and seven showed extended function (100 to 284 days). Excessive weight loss (more than 20%), despite normal FBS and insulin dependence, required that four animals in this latter group be killed. Devices seeded with xenogeneic islets have met with limited success. One dog that received two bovine islet-seeded devices achieved function for more than 100 days; the remaining bovine-seeded devices (n = 8) functioned for only 3 to 16 days. Porcine islet-seeded devices were assessed by intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT). Recipients of two devices seeded with allogeneic islets demonstrated improved IVGTT results when compared to those from pancreatectomized dogs and recipients of single devices but were abnormal when compared to intact animals. Histologic examination of device and autopsy material from all failed experiments was performed and showed no mononuclear cell infiltration of the islet chamber or vascular graft material, only a few incidence of device thrombosis, and varying degrees of islet viability as judged by morphologic and immunohistochemical evaluation. The authors believe they have demonstrated progress toward the development and clinical applicability of the Hybrid Artificial Pancreas."

As proof of concept for chimera complementation, Nakauchi et al. first created mice with rat pancreas 11, and subsequently rats with mice pancreas 12. These remarkable feats were achieved by injecting rat pluripotent stem cells into early-stage mouse embryos that lacked the Pdx1 gene, or mouse pluripotent stem cells into early-stage rat embryos that lacked the Pdx1 gene, respectively. Furthermore, islets isolated from rats with mouse pancreas were able to successfully reverse diabetes in recipient mice for >1 year, in the absence of chronic immunosuppression."

                            "Developing a device that protects xenogeneic islets to allow treatment and potentially cure of diabetes in large mammals has been a major challenge in the past decade. Using xenogeneic islets for transplantation is required in light of donor shortage and the large number of diabetic patients that qualify for islet transplantation. Until now, however, host immunoreactivity against the xenogeneic graft has been a major drawback for the use of porcine islets. Our study demonstrates the applicability of a novel immunoprotective membrane that allows successful xenotransplantation of rat islets in diabetic minipigs without immunosuppressive therapy. Rat pancreatic islets were encapsulated in highly purified alginate and integrated into a plastic macrochamber covered by a poly-membrane for subcutaneous transplantation. Diabetic Sinclair pigs were transplanted and followed for up to 90 days. We demonstrated a persistent graft function and restoration of normoglycemia without the need for immunosuppressive therapy. This concept could potentially offer an attractive strategy for a more widespread islet replacement therapy that would restore endogenous insulin secretion in diabetic patients without the need for immunosuppressive drugs and may even open up an avenue for safe utilization of xenogeneic islet donors."

Studies reveal that caprine islets exhibit glucose responsiveness similar to islets recovered from pigs, primates, and rodents <Paper corpusId=\"17066243\" paperTitle=\"(Hani et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. Importantly, goat islets elicit insulin responses under both basal and glucose-stimulated conditions, with insulin levels equivalent to those obtained with islets from pigs, cows, and dogs <Paper corpusId=\"17066243\" paperTitle=\"(Hani et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This research suggests that caprine islet cells can efficiently produce insulin, similar to human and porcine islet cells, maintaining euglycemia and glucose responsiveness in recipients.\n\nIt's worth noting that rodent islets secrete significantly more insulin than islets from human or porcine sources, both basally and under glucose stimulation <Paper corpusId=\"17066243\" paperTitle=\"(Hani et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"210919\" paperTitle=\"(Andrikopoulos et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper>. This physiological difference highlights the importance of considering species-specific insulin secretion profiles when evaluating xenotransplantation outcomes.\n\nIn minipig models, functional tests like the insulin secretion test have demonstrated strong correlations between acute insulin responses to glucose challenges and beta-cell mass <Paper corpusId=\"27085070\" paperTitle=\"(Larsen et al., 2003)\" isShortName></Paper>. These findings provide valuable insights for evaluating the functional capacity of transplanted islets across different animal models.\n\nRecent xenogeneic islet transplantation studies using porcine islets in non-human primates have consistently shown promising results for diabetes reversal <Paper corpusId=\"213778548\" paperTitle=\"(Chinnuswami et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"234473484\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"270249498\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Although more porcine islet cells are typically required to achieve adequate insulin secretion compared to human donor islets, some research suggests that porcine islets may actually outperform human islets in certain studies <Paper corpusId=\"270249498\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn xenogeneic transplantation models, dietary supplementation with chromium has been shown to improve glucose tolerance in pigs, possibly through decreasing hepatic extraction of insulin <Paper corpusId=\"4445845\" paperTitle=\"(Guan et al., 2000)\" isShortName></Paper>. This highlights how nutritional factors can influence the functional outcomes of islet transplantation experiments.\n\nTranslational development toward curative models has progressed with evidence of long-term islet survival in syngeneic large-animal models, as well as early function of xenogeneic porcine islets demonstrated by detectable serum C-peptide <Paper corpusId=\"257582418\" paperTitle=\"(Rojas-Canales et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Here, we report that pig islet grafts survived and maintained normoglycemia for >6 months in four of five consecutive immunosuppressed NHPs. Pig islets were isolated from designated pathogen\u2010free (DPF) miniature pigs and infused intraportally into streptozotocin\u2010induced diabetic rhesus monkeys under pretreatment with cobra venom factor (CVF), anti\u2010thymocyte globulin (ATG) induction and maintenance with anti\u2010CD154 monoclonal antibody and low\u2010dose sirolimus. Ex vivo expanded autologous regulatory T cells were adoptively transferred in three recipients. Blood glucose levels were promptly normalized in all five monkeys and normoglycemia (90\u2013110\u2009mg/dL) was maintained for >6 months in four cases, the longest currently up to 603 days. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests during the follow\u2010up period showed excellent glucose disposal capacity and porcine C\u2010peptide responses. Adoptive transfer of autologous regulatory T cells was likely to be associated with more stable and durable normoglycemia. Importantly, the recipients showed no serious adverse effects. Taken together, our results confirm the clinical feasibility of pig islet transplantation to treat T1D patients without the need for excessive immunosuppressive therapy."

                            "Xenotransplantation provides another alternative for the limited supply issue faced from the too few human islets available from donated human pancreases. In 2006, two groups reported long-term survival of porcine islets in non-human primates (Cardona et al., 2006)(Hering et al., 2006). Recently, Shin et al. demonstrated that pig islet grafts survived for greater than 6 months and were able to maintain normoglycemia for >6 months in four immunosuppressed non-human primates (Shin et al., 2015). Given issues of supply and demand, porcine islet xenotransplantation for T1D now appears to be a therapeutic consideration following extensive preclinical investigations, suggesting that clinical trials may be now justified. Two current reviews provide in-depth insight into the advances and shortcomings in this field (Ellis et al., 2015)(Park et al., 2015)."

In addition, caprine islets elicited an insulin response under both basal-and glucose-stimulated conditions, with insulin levels equivalent to those obtained with islets from other mammals such as pigs, cows, and dogs, but less than those obtained with rodent islets [39]. Rodent islets secrete much more insulin than islets from human or porcine sources, either basally or under glucose stimulation [40]. Caprine islet cells are efficient insulin-producing cells, similar to human and porcine islet cells, because they were able to maintain euglycemia and glucose responsiveness in recipients."

Mice were fed either chow or high-fat diet for 8 wk. Variables tested were fasting duration (0-, 3-, 6-, and 24-h and overnight fasting), route of administration (intraperitoneal vs. oral) load of glucose given (2, 1, or 0.5 g/kg and fixed 50-mg dose), and state of consciousness. Basal glucose concentrations were increased in high-fat- compared with chow-fed mice following 6 h of fasting (9.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/l P = 0.01). Glucose tolerance was most different and therefore significant (P = 0.001) in high-fat-fed mice after 6 h of fasting (1,973 +/- 96 vs. 1,248 +/- 83 mmol.l(-1).120 min(-1)). The difference in glucose tolerance was greater following an OGTT (142%), in contrast to an IPGTT, with a 127% difference between high fat and chow. We also found that administering 2 g/kg of glucose resulted in a greater level of significance (P = 0.0008) in glucose intolerance in high-fat- compared with chow-fed mice. A fixed dose of 50 mg glucose regardless of body weight was enough to show glucose intolerance in high-fat- vs. chow-fed mice. Finally, high-fat-fed mice showed glucose intolerance compared with their chow-fed counterparts whether they were tested under conscious or anesthetized conditions. We conclude that 2 g/kg glucose administered orally following 6 h of fasting is best to assess glucose tolerance in mice under these conditions."

                            "Knowledge about beta-cell mass and/or function could be of importance for the early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. However, measurement of beta-cell function as an estimate of beta-cell mass is currently the only method possible in humans. The present study was performed to investigate different functional tests as predictors of beta-cell mass in the G\u00f6ttingen minipig. beta-cell mass was reduced in the G\u00f6ttingen minipig with a combination of nicotinamide (100 [n = 6], 67 [n = 25], 20 [n = 2], or 0 mg/kg [n = 4]) and streptozotocin (125 mg/kg). Six normal pigs were included. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (n = 43) and insulin secretion test (n = 30) were performed and pancreata obtained for stereological determination of beta-cell mass. During OGTT, fasting glucose (r(2) = 0.1744, P < 0.01), area under the curve for glucose (r(2) = 0.2706, P < 0.001), maximum insulin secretion (r(2) = 0.2160, P < 0.01), and maximum C-peptide secretion (r(2) = 0.1992, P < 0.01) correlated with beta-cell mass. During the insulin secretion test, acute insulin response to 0.3 g/kg (r(2) = 0.6155, P < 0.0001) and 0.6 g/kg glucose (r(2) = 0.7321, P < 0.0001) and arginine (67 mg/kg) (r(2) = 0.7732, P < 0.0001) and maximum insulin secretion (r(2) = 0.8192, P < 0.0001) correlated with beta-cell mass. This study supports the use of functional tests to evaluate beta-cell mass in vivo and has established a validated basis for developing a mathematical method for estimation of beta-cell mass in vivo in the G\u00f6ttingen minipig."

                            "Alternative allogeneic stem cell-derived islet cell replacement therapy has been tested in in human clinical trial with inconsistent results 25. Paucity of human organ donors has led to the consideration of potential alternative sources of islet cells, with porcine islet cells being attractive candidates for cell therapy. Since porcine insulin has long been used and functions in humans to treat patients before recombinant human insulin became available due to high similarity in porcine insulin protein sequence with only one amino acid residue difference to human insulin, xenogeneic porcine islet cell therapy has long been proposed to treat T1D [26][27][28]. Porcine islet cell xenotransplantation has been investigated as a potential bridge or the ultimate treatment for T1D in decades with substantial progresses in both preclinical and clinical studies. Xenogeneic islet cell therapy could become a clinically applicable treatment with proper clinically applicable immunosuppression regimens or efficient biocompatible matrix encapsulation devices that permit diffusion of oxygen and nutrients and prevent transplanted islet cells from the host immune attacks 26,27. Preclinical pig-to-nonhuman primate transplantation models have been studied and the first long-term graft survival (>6 month) of pig islet cells in non-human primates (NHPs) has been demonstrated [29][30][31]. Subsequent study further confirmed reproducible curative potential in NHP model that pig islet grafts survived and maintained normoglycemia for >6 months with the longest up to 603 days 32. The clinical studies with xenogeneic porcine islet cells demonstrated the cell survival and function in the human body with no noted serious adverse events, but these clinical islet cell xenotransplantation trials have not shown to durably prevent severe hypoglycemia while maintaining tight glycemic control in T1D patients 28,33."

                            "Twenty Landrace x Yorkshire cross pigs (body wt, 47.9+/-2.9 kg) were used to evaluate effects of dietary high chromium (Cr) yeast supplementation on plasma kinetics of glucose, insulin and C-peptide. Pigs were provided free access to either a control diet (C) containing 204 microg Cr/kg or a diet supplemented with an additional 200 microg Cr/kg as high Cr yeast (CR) for between 23 and 30 d. After overnight food deprivation, dextrose (500 g/L) was infused through a jugular vein catheter at a dose of 0.5 g glucose/kg body weight with an infusion rate of 10 g glucose/min within 6 min. High Cr yeast supplementation did not affect body weight gain or food intake. There were no differences in fasting plasma concentrations of either glucose or C-peptide, although basal plasma concentration of insulin tended to be higher in pigs fed CR (P<0.10). Plasma glucose concentrations were lower (P<0.01) at postinfusion times 5, 10, 15 and 20 min in pigs fed CR. Plasma insulin concentrations in pigs fed CR were higher (P<0.05) at 2 and 0 min before the completion of dextrose infusion. However, the increase in plasma insulin concentrations was not accompanied by a comparable elevation in plasma C-peptide concentrations. The 30-min (postinfusion) area of plasma glucose concentrations tended to be lower (P<0.10) in pigs fed CR, but there were no differences in 30-min areas of either plasma insulin or plasma C-peptide concentrations between treatments. Plasma clearance rates of glucose, insulin and C-peptide were higher and their half-lives shorter (P<0.05) in pigs fed CR. In conclusion, dietary high Cr yeast supplementation improved glucose tolerance, possibly through a decrease in hepatic extraction of insulin."

This has been due to the use in the most part of wild type pig islets rather than purpose developed and bred transgenic pigs (55, 56). However, results from preclinical xeno-islet trials have shown great promise in improving glucose control in non-human-primates establishing it as a potential therapeutic modality for treating diabetic patients (Mohiuddin et al., 2023)."

These larger animal models have been extensively used to examine the efficacy of immunosuppressive regimens, including cyclosporine, in both islet allotransplantation and xenotransplantation <Paper corpusId=\"18223608\" paperTitle=\"(Sakata et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"9100146\" paperTitle=\"(Kumagai et al., 2002)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nNon-human primates (NHPs) represent the closest physiological match to humans and therefore provide critical translational insights before human clinical trials. However, surgical or streptozotocin-induced diabetic NHP models lack the autoimmunity characteristic of human type 1 diabetes, which is better replicated in NOD mice <Paper corpusId=\"6675589\" paperTitle=\"(Zhu et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This highlights the complementary nature of different animal models in comprehensively addressing the complexities of islet xenotransplantation.\n\nLarge animal models have also been instrumental in developing bioartificial pancreas technologies, particularly islet encapsulation strategies designed to protect transplanted islets from immune attack <Paper corpusId=\"18223608\" paperTitle=\"(Sakata et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"10027234\" paperTitle=\"(Monaco et al., 1991)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The autoimmunity of NOD mice is characterized by several abnormalities in the immune system including the presence of pancreasspecific autoantibodies, autoreactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and defects in T regulatory cells (Anderson et al., 2005)(Cabrera et al., 2012), which also appear in T1DM patients and rarely exist in surgical/STZ-induced NHP models of IDDM. In order to successfully perform clinical islet transplantation, it is essential to control the allo-, xeno-, and autoimmunity. The NOD mice represent the suitable models for dissecting tolerance mechanisms and assessing influences of different types of immunity in islet transplantation (Wang et al., 2014)(Deng et al., 2014)(Shi et al., 2004)(Thomas et al., 1995).

                            "Autoimmunity is a complex process that likely results from the summation of multiple defective tolerance mechanisms. The NOD mouse strain is an excellent model of autoimmune disease and an important tool for dissecting tolerance mechanisms. The strength of this mouse strain is that it develops spontaneous autoimmune diabetes, which shares many similarities to autoimmune or type 1a diabetes (T1D) in human subjects, including the presence of pancreas-specific autoantibodies, autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and genetic linkage to disease syntenic to that found in humans. During the past ten years, investigators have used a wide variety of tools to study these mice, including immunological reagents and transgenic and knockout strains; these tools have tremendously enhanced the study of the fundamental disease mechanisms. In addition, investigators have recently developed a number of therapeutic interventions in this animal model that have now been translated into human therapies. In this review, we summarize many of the important features of disease development and progression in the NOD strain, emphasizing the role of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms that affect diabetes in these mice. The information gained from this highly relevant model of human disease will lead to potential therapies that may alter the development of the disease and its progression in patients with T1D."

                            "Islet transplantation has great potential for curing type 1 diabetes; however, long-term islet survival using conventional immunosuppression remains elusive. We present a novel strategy for inducing long-lasting islet graft survival in diabetic NOD mice in the absence of posttransplant immunosuppression by initial treatment with antilymphocyte serum (ALS) followed by coadministration of donor pancreatic lymph node cells (PLNCs). When treated with ALS/PLNC, diabetic NOD mice become normoglycemic and tolerated minor antigen-disparate islet grafts for >100 days and syngeneic islet grafts indefinitely. Donor T-cells are required for graft prolongation, and tolerant hosts have long-term donor T-cell chimerism. Strikingly, host autoreactive T-cells from mice with long-surviving islet grafts predominantly produce interleukin-4, whereas autoreactive T-cells from mice that rejected their islet grafts predominantly produce interferon-gamma. We thus demonstrate a clinically relevant approach for ablation of recurrent autoimmunity in islet transplantation, involving donor lymphocyte-driven alteration of pathogenic autoreactive T-cells."

                            "We have previously reported the preparation of vascularized islet-kidneys (IKs) by transplantation of islets under the autologous kidney capsule. Here, we compare the efficacy of transplanting vascularized versus nonvascularized islets into diabetic allogeneic swine recipients. In the vascularized islet transplantation (5,000 islet equivalents [IE]/kg), recipients received minor-mismatched (n = 4) or fully-mismatched (n = 2) IKs after pancreatectomy, with a 12-day course of cyclosporine A (CyA) or FK506, respectively. For the nonvascularized islet transplantation (7,000 IE/kg), three recipients received minor-mismatched islets alone and two recipients received minor-mismatched donor islets placed in a donor kidney on the day of transplantation. All recipients of nonvascularized islets were treated with a 12-day course of CyA. With vascularized islet transplantation, pancreatectomized recipients were markedly hyperglycemic pretransplant (fasting blood glucose >300 mg/dl). After composite IK transplantation, all recipients developed and maintained normoglycemia (<120 mg/dl) and stable renal function indefinitely (>3 months), and insulin therapy was not required. Major histocompatibility complex-mismatched recipients demonstrated in vitro donor-specific unresponsiveness. In contrast, recipients of nonvascularized islets remained hyperglycemic. In conclusion, IK allografts cured surgically induced diabetes across allogeneic barriers, whereas nonvascularized islet transplants did not. These data indicate that prevascularization of islet allografts is crucial for their subsequent engraftment and that composite IKs may provide a strategy for successful islet transplantation."

                            "Previously the authors reported on a Hybrid Artificial Pancreas device that maintained patent vascular anastomoses in normal dogs and, when seeded with allogeneic canine islets, maintained normal fasting blood sugars (FBS) in diabetic pancreatectomized dogs. Eventual failure of these devices was believed to be related to loss of islet viability and/or insufficient islet mass. The current study evaluates the effect of increased islet mass produced by implantation of two islet-seeded devices in pancreatectomized dogs and compares the results with those from dogs that received a single device. Twelve of fifteen dogs receiving single devices showed initial function as determined by elimination or reduction of exogenous insulin requirement; four showed initial function and seven showed extended function (100 to 284 days). Excessive weight loss (more than 20%), despite normal FBS and insulin dependence, required that four animals in this latter group be killed. Devices seeded with xenogeneic islets have met with limited success. One dog that received two bovine islet-seeded devices achieved function for more than 100 days; the remaining bovine-seeded devices (n = 8) functioned for only 3 to 16 days. Porcine islet-seeded devices were assessed by intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT). Recipients of two devices seeded with allogeneic islets demonstrated improved IVGTT results when compared to those from pancreatectomized dogs and recipients of single devices but were abnormal when compared to intact animals. Histologic examination of device and autopsy material from all failed experiments was performed and showed no mononuclear cell infiltration of the islet chamber or vascular graft material, only a few incidence of device thrombosis, and varying degrees of islet viability as judged by morphologic and immunohistochemical evaluation. The authors believe they have demonstrated progress toward the development and clinical applicability of the Hybrid Artificial Pancreas."

Therefore, the establishment of alternative donor sources and engineered tissue which enables to produce appropriate insulin for controlling blood glucose is an important challenge. The adult pig is a promising and feasible donor source and materials for the engineered tissue for the clinical setting among various candidates. The recent progress of gene-editing technology contributes to possible clinical porcine xenotransplantation, including porcine islet xenotransplantation. For the success of future clinical porcine islet xenotransplantation, establishing an islet isolation technique for acquiring adequate, good quality porcine islets is equally important to use a gene-edited pig. However, the characteristics of porcine islets are different from other species; therefore, establishing a suitable technique for porcine islets is challenging."

                            "Purpose of review Human islet transplantation has proven to be a highly effective treatment for patients with labile type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can free patients from daily glucose monitoring and insulin injections. However, the shortage of islet donors limits its\u2019 broad application. Porcine islet xenotransplantation presents a solution to the donor shortage and recent advances in genetic modification and immunosuppressive regimens provide renewed enthusiasm for the potential of this treatment. Recent findings Advances in genetic editing technology are leading to multigene modified porcine islet donors with alterations in expression of known xenoantigens, modifications of their complement and coagulation systems, and modifications to gain improved immunological compatibility. Recent NHP-based trials of costimulation blockade using CD154 blockade show promising improvements in islet survival, whereas results targeting CD40 are less consistent. Furthermore, trials using IL-6 receptor antagonism have yet to demonstrate improvement in glucose control and suffer from poor graft revascularization. Summary This review will detail the current status of islet xenotransplantation as a potential treatment for type I diabetes mellitus, focusing on recent advances in porcine xenogeneic islet production, assessment in nonhuman primate preclinical models, the outcome of human clinical trials and review barriers to translation of xenoislets to the clinic."

We have examined the fate of islet xenografts in a recipient with direct relevance to man, the cynomolgus monkey. Rabbit islets were prepared by an intraductal collagenase technique and incubated in neat rabbit, human, or cynomolgus serum, with and without heat inactivation, for up to 6 days. Islets were analyzed by flow cytometry for IGG and IGM binding, and scored for viability by supravital staining. For in vivo studies, isolated islets were prepared from 4 New Zealand White rabbits (15-34 x 10(3) islets 70-85% purity) and transplanted beneath the kidney capsule of normal cynomolgus monkeys after aggregation in either a rabbit or monkey blood clot. The tissue was retrieved at various times up to 4 days after transplantation and processed for light and electron microscopy. The results showed that rabbit islets bind heterophile antibody of both IGG and IGM subtypes. There was slow loss of islet viability in vitro over 3 days of culture in neat human or cynomolgus serum. Destruction of islets in vivo was more rapid with visible damage within 6 hr associated with neutrophil infiltration. Subsequently, there was heavy mononuclear cell infiltration leading to total destruction within 4 days. The results suggest that immediate mechanisms of graft rejection, possibly compliment and neutrophil mediated, represent a major barrier to islet xenotransplantation in humans."

Researchers are addressing these obstacles through alternative transplantation sites, encapsulation technologies, growth factor supplementation, and genetic modification of donor islets.

                "text": "\nIslet xenotransplantation, particularly when using porcine islets in non-human primate (NHP) models, faces substantial immunological barriers. Transplanted porcine islets often encounter strong cellular and humoral rejection responses that necessitate potent immunosuppressants <Paper corpusId=\"270840253\" paperTitle=\"(Kim, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"226269971\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. These rejection responses are even more pronounced in discordant xenotransplantation (between distantly related species like pig-to-mouse) compared to concordant xenotransplantation (between closely related species like rat-to-mouse) <Paper corpusId=\"255021963\" paperTitle=\"(Ajima et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"21751183\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nOne of the primary challenges in clinical islet xenotransplantation is the Instant Blood-Mediated Inflammatory Response (IBMIR) that occurs when islets are transplanted into the portal vein. To avoid or minimize this response, researchers are investigating alternative anatomical sites where islets are not immediately exposed to blood <Paper corpusId=\"11249620\" paperTitle=\"(Windt et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. Several promising alternative sites include:\n\n1. The gastric submucosal space, which allows for endoscopic delivery and subsequent biopsies to monitor for rejection or apoptosis <Paper corpusId=\"11249620\" paperTitle=\"(Windt et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. Intramuscular transplantation, which has already reached the clinical stage for islet autotransplantation <Paper corpusId=\"11249620\" paperTitle=\"(Windt et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. Biodegradable scaffolds wrapped with omentum and placed between abdominal muscle layers, which have shown significant metabolic improvement in diabetic monkeys <Paper corpusId=\"11249620\" paperTitle=\"(Windt et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"205845365\" paperTitle=\"(Berman et al., 2008)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n4. Subcutaneous sites, though these face challenges with insufficient oxygen supply <Paper corpusId=\"255021963\" paperTitle=\"(Ajima et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"225105001\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nTo overcome the immunological barriers without requiring long-term immunosuppression, researchers have developed various encapsulation technologies. A notable example comes from Dresden, Germany, where researchers demonstrated restoration of normoglycemia without immunosuppression in a model of rat islet xenotransplantation into diabetic minipigs using a novel immunoprotective membrane <Paper corpusId=\"277904319\" paperTitle=\"(Bottino et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"404317\" paperTitle=\"(Neufeld et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach involved encapsulating rat pancreatic islets in highly purified alginate and integrating them into a plastic macrochamber covered by a poly-membrane for subcutaneous transplantation, resulting in persistent graft function <Paper corpusId=\"404317\" paperTitle=\"(Neufeld et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAnother innovative approach combines encapsulation with growth factor supplementation. Researchers have found that co-encapsulation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) with islets can enhance islet survival in hypoxic conditions and improve function after subcutaneous transplantation <Paper corpusId=\"255021963\" paperTitle=\"(Ajima et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"225105001\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach shows promise for addressing the oxygen supply challenge at subcutaneous transplantation sites.\n\nGenetic modification of donor islets represents another strategy to reduce xenogeneic immune responses. Researchers have generated tissue-engineered swine leucocyte antigen (SLA)-silenced islet cell clusters using lentiviral vectors, resulting in significantly decreased xenogeneic T cell immune responses, NK cell and antibody-mediated cellular-dependent immune responses <Paper corpusId=\"270840253\" paperTitle=\"(Kim, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"214644513\" paperTitle=\"(Oliveira et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn the realm of immunomodulation, research in rat-to-mouse islet xenotransplantation models has examined various combinations of immunotherapies. One promising approach combines temporal T-cell depletion (similar to clinically practiced anti-thymocyte-globulin therapy) with human alpha-1 antitrypsin (hAAT), which may promote islet xenograft acceptance <Paper corpusId=\"5613349\" paperTitle=\"(Ashkenazi et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests potential pathways for developing clinically applicable immunomodulatory strategies for pig-to-human islet xenotransplantation.\n\nBefore advancing to clinical trials with these novel technologies, validation in animal models is essential. While the diabetic NHP model provides the most clinically relevant validation, the high costs associated with these studies necessitate initial efficacy assessments in smaller animal models such as diabetic rats <Paper corpusId=\"270840253\" paperTitle=\"(Kim, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This staged approach to preclinical testing helps optimize technologies before moving to more expensive and resource-intensive NHP studies.",

This approach aims to advance diabetes treatment. Xenogeneic porcine pancreatic islet transplantation, particularly when performed via the portal vein in non-human primate (NHP) models, often encounters strong cellular and humoral rejection responses, necessitating potent immunosuppressants (Kim et al., 2020)",

However, considering the high costs associated with non-clinical trials in the diabetic NHP model, it is essential to precede efficacy assessments in a diabetic rat model."

                            "Transplantation of encapsulated porcine islets is proposed to treat type 1 diabetes. However, the envelopment of fibrous tissue and the infiltration of immune cells impair islet function and eventually cause implant failure. It is known that hemodialysis using an ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) membrane results in minor tissue responses. Therefore, we hypothesized that using a low\u2010adhesive EVOH membrane for encapsulation may prevent host cell accumulation and fibrous capsule formation. In this study, rat islets suspended in chitosan gel were encapsulated in bags made from highly porous EVOH membranes, and their in vitro insulin secretion function as well as in vivo performance was evaluated. The results showed that the EVOH bag did not affect islet survival or glucose\u2010stimulated insulin secretion. Whereas naked islets were dysfunctional after 7 days of culture in vitro, islets within the EVOH bag produced insulin continuously for 30 days. Streptozotocin\u2010induced diabetic mice were given islets\u2013chitosan gel\u2013EVOH implants intraperitoneally (650\u2013800 islets equivalent) and exhibited lower blood glucose levels and regained body weight during a 4\u2010week observation period. The transplanted mice had higher levels of serum insulin and C\u2010peptide, with an improved blood glucose disappearance rate. Retrieved implants had minor tissue adhesion, and histology showed a limited number of mononuclear cells and fibroblasts surrounding the implants. No invasion of host cells into the EVOH bags was noticed, and the encapsulated islets were intact and positive for insulin\u2013glucagon immunostaining. In conclusion, an EVOH bag can protect encapsulated islets, limit fibrous capsule formation, and extend graft function."

                            "Alternative anatomical sites for islet transplantation. Even though the pig could provide an unlimited supply of islets, the inefficiency of islet transplantation into the portal vein resulting from IBMIR remains an obstacle for applying islet xenotransplantation on a clinical scale. To avoid or minimize IBMIR, an alternative approach is to place the islets in a site where they are not immediately exposed to blood, and investigation in this area is ongoing. A number of sites have been investigated, some of which seem worthy of continued assessment. \n\nTransplantation into the gastric submucosal space can be achieved through endoscopy (Echeverri et al., 2009) and offers the advantage of possible endoscopic biopsy of the graft for investigation of rejection, apoptosis, or both (41). Intramuscular transplantation has already reached the clinical stage in islet autotransplantation (42). In diabetic monkeys, islets loaded onto a biodegradable scaffold, wrapped with omentum and placed between abdominal muscle layers, resulted in significant metabolic improvement in allotransplantation experiments (Berman et al., 2008)."

Here we report the successful engraftment of islets in diabetic cynomolgus monkeys when loaded on a synthetic biodegradable scaffold and placed in an omental pouch. One autologous and five allogeneic diabetic monkey transplants under the cover of steroid\u2010free immune suppression (SFIS) were undertaken. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and C\u2010peptide (CP), exogenous insulin requirements (EIR), intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), A1C and histopathology were used to assess islet engraftment and survival. All animals achieved CP levels > 1.0 ng/mL following transplant, a 66\u201392% posttransplant decrease in EIR and reduced A1C. Following graft removal, CP became negative and histopathological analysis of the explanted grafts demonstrated well\u2010granulated and well\u2010vascularized, insulin\u2010positive islets, surrounded by T\u2010cell subsets and macrophages. Compared to intrahepatic allogeneic islet transplants (n = 20), there was a delayed engraftment for omental pouch recipients but similar levels of CP production were ultimately achieved, with a broad range of IEQ/kg transplanted in both sites. Our results suggest this extrahepatic transplantation site has potential as an alternative site for clinical islet cell transplantation."

                            "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text. Background. Subcutaneous pouch is a potential site for islet transplantation. However, insufficient oxygen supply remains challenging. Pretreatment of neovascularization using basic fibroblast growth factor can solve this, but it needs 2\u00d7 operations. We developed a device that contains rat islets in chitosan gel packed in a bag made of highly biocompatible ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer porous membrane. This study investigated whether coencapsulation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) with islets in the device enables novel method of prevascularization-free primary subcutaneous transplantation. Methods. In vitro experiments examined slow release of HGF from the chitosan gel and islet-protection effect of HGF against hypoxia. In the latter, rat islets with/without HGF (200\u2009ng/mL) was cultured in 1% oxygen. In in vivo experiment, fabricated device with/without HGF (10 \u03bcg/device) containing rat islets was primarily transplanted to streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice subcutaneously. Results. In vitro experiments showed sustained release of HGF for 28 d and alleviating effect of HGF on cell death and glucose-responsive insulin release after hypoxic culture. Islet + HGF mice, but not islet-alone mice, showed decreased nonfasting blood glucose and regained body weight after transplantation. In intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, islet + HGF mice exhibited decreased fasting blood glucose (200 \u00b1 55\u2009mg/dL) and good blood glucose disappearance rate (K value) (0.817 \u00b1 0.101) comparing to normal mice (123 \u00b1 28\u2009mg/dL and 1.074 \u00b1 0.374, respectively). However, in islet-alone mice, fasting blood glucose was high (365 \u00b1 172\u2009mg/dL) and K value was indeterminable. Serum insulin in islet + HGF mice (1.58 \u00b1 0.94 \u03bcg/L) was close to normal mice (1.66 \u00b1 0.55 \u03bcg/L), whereas those in islet-alone mice (0.279 \u00b1 0.076 \u03bcg/L) and diabetic mice (0.165 \u00b1 0.079 \u03bcg/L) were low. Immunohistochemical examination showed intact insulin- and glucagon-positive islets in retrieved devices with HGF, but no intact islet was found in the device without HGF. Conclusions. HGF could enhance islet survival in hypoxia and enhance in vivo function of encapsulated islets after primary subcutaneous transplantation."

                            "Developing a device that protects xenogeneic islets to allow treatment and potentially cure of diabetes in large mammals has been a major challenge in the past decade. Using xenogeneic islets for transplantation is required in light of donor shortage and the large number of diabetic patients that qualify for islet transplantation. Until now, however, host immunoreactivity against the xenogeneic graft has been a major drawback for the use of porcine islets. Our study demonstrates the applicability of a novel immunoprotective membrane that allows successful xenotransplantation of rat islets in diabetic minipigs without immunosuppressive therapy. Rat pancreatic islets were encapsulated in highly purified alginate and integrated into a plastic macrochamber covered by a poly-membrane for subcutaneous transplantation. Diabetic Sinclair pigs were transplanted and followed for up to 90 days. We demonstrated a persistent graft function and restoration of normoglycemia without the need for immunosuppressive therapy. This concept could potentially offer an attractive strategy for a more widespread islet replacement therapy that would restore endogenous insulin secretion in diabetic patients without the need for immunosuppressive drugs and may even open up an avenue for safe utilization of xenogeneic islet donors."

To decrease xenogeneic immune responses, we generated tissue engineered swine leucocyte antigen (SLA)\u2010silenced islet cell clusters (ICC). Single\u2010cell suspensions from pancreatic islets were generated by enzymatic digestion of porcine ICCs. Cells were silenced for SLA class I and class II by lentiviral vectors encoding for short hairpin RNAs targeting beta2\u2010microglobulin or class II transactivator, respectively. SLA\u2010silenced ICCs\u2010derived cells were then used to form new ICCs in stirred bioreactors in the presence of collagen VI. SLA class I silencing was designed to reach a level of up to 89% and class II by up to 81% on ICCs\u2010derived cells. Xenogeneic T cell immune responses, NK cell and antibody\u2010mediated cellular\u2010dependent immune responses were significantly decreased in SLA\u2010silenced cells. In stirred bioreactors, tissue engineered islets showed the typical 3D structure and insulin production. These data show the feasibility to generate low immunogenic porcine ICCs after single\u2010cell engineering and post\u2010transduction islet reassembling that might serve as an alternative to allogeneic pancreatic islet cell transplantation."
