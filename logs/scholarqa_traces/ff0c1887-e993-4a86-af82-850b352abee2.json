These approaches employ extensive datasets comprising antibody sequences, structures, and functional properties to train predictive models that enable rational design. This review highlights the significant advancements in data acquisition and feature extraction, emphasizing the necessity of capturing both sequence and structural information. We illustrate how machine learning models, including protein language models, are used not only to enhance affinity but also to optimize other crucial therapeutic properties, such as specificity, stability, viscosity, and manufacturability. Furthermore, we provide practical examples and case studies to demonstrate how the synergy between experimental and computational approaches accelerates antibody engineering. Finally, this review discusses the remaining challenges in fully realizing the potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered antibody discovery pipelines to expedite therapeutic development.",

Different NGS platforms, such as Illumina [19], Ion Torrent [20], Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) [21], and Oxford Nanopore [22], offer unique advantages in terms of read length, accuracy, and throughput. These technologies have facilitated the identification of rare clones within antibody repertoires and enabled the study of antibody lineage evolution during affinity maturation [23][24][25][26]. Long-read sequencing is particularly important for capturing complete variable regions and characterizing complementarity determining regions (CDRs) with high precision [23]. Furthermore, optimized library preparation protocols, incorporating antibodyspecific amplification, target enrichment, and unique molecular identifiers, have significantly enhanced the efficiency of NGS for antibody analysis [24,26]. Coupled with the development of tailored bioinformatics methods [25], these advancements provide unprecedented depth of analysis, opening new avenues for understanding the complexities of antibody repertoires [27]. Specifically, BCR sequencing, a specialized application of NGS, allows for the detailed analysis of B-cell receptor diversity, including the identification of paired heavy and light chain sequences from individual B cells [23][24][25]. This information is crucial for understanding the antibody repertoire and identifying antibodies with specific binding properties, which can be further developed into therapeutics.",

These approaches employ extensive datasets comprising antibody sequences, structures, and functional properties to train predictive models that enable rational design. This review highlights the significant advancements in data acquisition and feature extraction, emphasizing the necessity of capturing both sequence and structural information. We illustrate how machine learning models, including protein language models, are used not only to enhance affinity but also to optimize other crucial therapeutic properties, such as specificity, stability, viscosity, and manufacturability. Furthermore, we provide practical examples and case studies to demonstrate how the synergy between experimental and computational approaches accelerates antibody engineering. Finally, this review discusses the remaining challenges in fully realizing the potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered antibody discovery pipelines to expedite therapeutic development.\n## Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized antibody repertoire analysis by enabling massive parallel high-throughput sequencing, providing a detailed view of diverse antibody repertoires [18]. Different NGS platforms, such as Illumina [19], Ion Torrent [20], Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) [21], and Oxford Nanopore [22], offer unique advantages in terms of read length, accuracy, and throughput. These technologies have facilitated the identification of rare clones within antibody repertoires and enabled the study of antibody lineage evolution during affinity maturation [23][24][25][26]. Long-read sequencing is particularly important for capturing complete variable regions and characterizing complementarity determining regions (CDRs) with high precision [23]. Furthermore, optimized library preparation protocols, incorporating antibodyspecific amplification, target enrichment, and unique molecular identifiers, have significantly enhanced the efficiency of NGS for antibody analysis [24,26]. Coupled with the development of tailored bioinformatics methods [25], these advancements provide unprecedented depth of analysis, opening new avenues for understanding the complexities of antibody repertoires [27]. Specifically, BCR sequencing, a specialized application of NGS, allows for the detailed analysis of B-cell receptor diversity, including the identification of paired heavy and light chain sequences from individual B cells [23][24][25]. This information is crucial for understanding the antibody repertoire and identifying antibodies with specific binding properties, which can be further developed into therapeutics.",

Our work provides insights into the limitations of lower throughput NGS. Compared to the traditional approach of Sanger sequencing, high-throughput sequencing strategies yield more valuable data on the compositional analysis of peptide pools. However, phage display researchers should be aware of the drawbacks of NGS platforms with lower depth, and the influence they might have on the analysis of phage display data. Lower sequencing depth can bear misleading information about the quality of unselected libraries and composition of biopanning outputs, which has substantial potential to misdirect further characterization of the in vitro selected peptides and final interpretations of phage display selection studies.

                    "text": "Peptide phage display relies on the identification of genuine target binders in the recovered phages obtained from biopanning. Analysis of the exact composition of phage display peptide libraries plays a valuable role in the discovery of ligands with strong binding affinities to different biological targets [21]. To achieve this purpose, a sequencing platform capable of rigorous characterization of the composition and diversity of the peptide pool is crucial. High-throughput sequencing has been found to be suited for the analysis of the sequence composition and inherent diversity of phage display libraries [20,31]. In the current work, we made a side-by-side comparison of the capacity of two NGS platforms with different depths of sequencing in characterizing the composition and diversity of a phage display peptide library. Rodi et al. introduced two concepts to define the library diversity: Technical diversity (completeness) which corresponds to the percentage of possible members of the library existing at any absolute frequency and functional diversity which takes into consideration the absolute frequency of each distinct peptide in the library [24]. Consistent with this, Makowski and Soares proposed an analytical expression of the library diversity in which diversity is not only dependent on the number of peptides but also on the relative abundance of each peptide within the library [32]. Here, we used the number of unique sequences as a measure of library diversity. This definition is commonly used to refer to the observed diversity of phage display peptide libraries [16,19,[25][26][27][28][29][30]. Our data indicated that sequencing depth has a vital impact on the ability to characterize the diversity of the library (Table 1 and Figure 1). A comparison of the two NGS modalities with LTP (720,000 absolute cleaned reads on average) and HTP (5,470,000 absolute cleaned reads on average) showed that the HTP platform can identify a significantly higher number of unique peptide sequences (unique cleaned reads in Table 1), thus revealing a much larger diversity of the library. It is worth mentioning that detecting the full diversity of phage display peptide libraries exceeds the capacity of current NGS platforms. The theoretical diversity of a 12-mer phage display peptide library can reach 4.1 \u00d7 10 15 .",

                    "text": "The definition of diversity as the number of unique sequences is a commonly accepted idea in phage display literature [16,19,[25][26][27][28][29][30], motivated by increasing number of NGSbased phage display works in recent years which allow for sampling of a larger sequence space. In the current study, we investigated the capacity of two sequencing depths (each on two different input volumes) of NGS to characterize the unselected Ph.D. TM -12 phage display peptide library. In a broad sense, low-throughput (LTP) sequencing refers to Sanger sequencing and high-throughput (HTP) sequencing refers to all the different types of NGS platforms. In this work, we denote LTP as the NGS platform with the lower throughput (MiSeq Reagent Kit v2) and HTP as the NGS platform with the higher throughput (NextSeq 500/550 Mid Output Kit v.2.5). The aim of the current study was to provide an evaluation of the impact of sequencing depth on the analysis of diversity, quality, and composition of an unselected phage display peptide library. Our findings indicated that a higher sequencing depth offers a more rigorous evaluation of the library diversity and quality, uncovers a more heterogeneous distribution of peptide frequencies, provides a comparatively higher capacity for the differentiation of peptide frequencies, and results in the detection of distinct amino acid and peptide compositions for the library compared to sequencing modality with the lower depth. Based on the results, we discuss how the sequencing depth can lead to different outcomes for the characteristics of the library, alter the direction of analyses, and make a major impact on the final conclusions drawn from phage display data.",

It is of interest to note that a larger percentage of singletons in the LTP datasets suggests a larger portion of the library to be dominated by peptides with the same frequency. This leads us to observe less heterogeneity in the library when using LTP sequencing. \n\nThe investigation of the distribution of frequencies demonstrated that the HTP platform can detect a broader range of frequencies as well as a greater percentage of peptides with higher frequencies compared to the lower throughput platform (Figure 2). These results indicate that HTP sequencing can reveal a more heterogeneous distribution of peptide frequencies within the library and that LTP sequencing underestimates the library heterogeneity. This pattern is quite explicit for peptides with higher frequencies. Highly frequent peptides are important for the analysis of both unselected libraries and biopanning outputs. In the former, they might represent propagation-related target-unrelated peptides (Pr-TUPs) that are enriched during biopanning in a target-unrelated manner. In the latter, they might represent specific binders enriched during biopanning in a target-dependent manner. Hence, a sequencing platform with higher depth can improve the identification of both non-specific and specific peptides in phage display selections. Comparing peptides present in both HTP and LTP datasets showed that peptides having the same frequency in LTP sequencing in some cases resulted in different frequencies in HTP sequencing (Table 2). Hence, HTP has a relatively higher capacity for distinguishing peptide frequencies. The frequency of peptides is used as a basis to define the rank of sequences in NGS datasets and rank is a highly important selection criterion for peptides enriched during biopan-ning. This indicates that a higher depth of sequencing can provide a relatively more exact determination of peptide ranks in library selections. \n\nThe analysis of amino acid positional frequencies can be used in the evaluation of the library quality and diversity [24,34]. Furthermore, it offers valuable insights into the position-dependent enrichment of sequences during library selection that can be used to find sequence motifs in the peptide pool recovered from biopanning [16,35].",

                    "text": "NGS allows researchers to analyze the composition of large peptide libraries on a deeper scale. This is valuable for monitoring, troubleshooting, and evaluating the design and construction of unselected na\u00efve libraries, gaining detailed insights into the impact of the selective pressure applied to the library, and obtaining a solid understanding of the evolution of peptide populations during library selection [15]. NGS has not only been performed on biopanning eluates [16][17][18] but has also been exploited to investigate unselected and amplified phage display libraries [13,14,[19][20][21]. A pivotal parameter for using NGS is the sequencing depth. Technically, depth (also referred to as depth of coverage) is defined as the number of times a given nucleotide has been read during the sequencing reaction [22]. In the context of peptide phage display, the depth of sequencing represents the number of reads that contain the displayed peptide-encoding sequence. Different factors influence the required depth of sequencing for the analysis of phage display peptide libraries. Nevertheless, the optimal sequencing depth is mainly dependent on the complexity of the peptide pool [13]. It is an accepted view that a higher sequencing depth provides a more representative coverage of the library and improves the accuracy by which the composition of the library can be characterized [23], thus leading to a more in-depth understanding of the library quality and the selection process. \n\nIn phage display experiments, the highest possible number of library members should be investigated. Hence, it is of particular importance to use a higher sequencing depth to characterize as much of the library diversity as possible as well as to evaluate the composition and quality of the library more accurately. Some statistical methods have been reported to measure the diversity of phage display peptide libraries [24]. These analyses have been conducted based on sampling a limited pool of the library by Sanger sequencing. Here, we used the number of unique sequences as an equivalent to diversity. The definition of diversity as the number of unique sequences is a commonly accepted idea in phage display literature [16,19,[25][26][27][28][29][30], motivated by increasing number of NGSbased phage display works in recent years which allow for sampling of a larger sequence space.",

B. Sloth, Babak Bakhshinejad, Camilla Stavnsbjerg, M. Rossing, A. Kjaer\n## Abstract\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) has raised a growing interest in phage display research. Sequencing depth is a pivotal parameter for using NGS. In the current study, we made a side-by-side comparison of two NGS platforms with different sequencing depths, denoted as lower-throughput (LTP) and higher-throughput (HTP). The capacity of these platforms for characterization of the composition, quality, and diversity of the unselected Ph.D.TM-12 Phage Display Peptide Library was investigated. Our results indicated that HTP sequencing detects a considerably higher number of unique sequences compared to the LTP platform, thus covering a broader diversity of the library. We found a larger percentage of singletons, a smaller percentage of repeated sequences, and a greater percentage of distinct sequences in the LTP datasets. These parameters suggest a higher library quality, resulting in potentially misleading information when using LTP sequencing for such assessment. Our observations showed that HTP reveals a broader distribution of peptide frequencies, thus revealing increased heterogeneity of the library by the HTP approach and offering a comparatively higher capacity for distinguishing peptides from each other. Our analyses suggested that LTP and HTP datasets show discrepancies in their peptide composition and position-specific distribution of amino acids within the library. Taken together, these findings lead us to the conclusion that a higher sequencing depth can yield more in-depth insights into the composition of the library and provide a more complete picture of the quality and diversity of phage display peptide libraries.\n## Introduction\nNGS allows researchers to analyze the composition of large peptide libraries on a deeper scale. This is valuable for monitoring, troubleshooting, and evaluating the design and construction of unselected na\u00efve libraries, gaining detailed insights into the impact of the selective pressure applied to the library, and obtaining a solid understanding of the evolution of peptide populations during library selection [15]. NGS has not only been performed on biopanning eluates [16][17][18] but has also been exploited to investigate unselected and amplified phage display libraries [13,14,[19][20][21]. A pivotal parameter for using NGS is the sequencing depth. Technically, depth (also referred to as depth of coverage) is defined as the number of times a given nucleotide has been read during the sequencing reaction [22]. In the context of peptide phage display, the depth of sequencing represents the number of reads that contain the displayed peptide-encoding sequence. Different factors influence the required depth of sequencing for the analysis of phage display peptide libraries. Nevertheless, the optimal sequencing depth is mainly dependent on the complexity of the peptide pool [13]. It is an accepted view that a higher sequencing depth provides a more representative coverage of the library and improves the accuracy by which the composition of the library can be characterized [23], thus leading to a more in-depth understanding of the library quality and the selection process. \n\nIn phage display experiments, the highest possible number of library members should be investigated. Hence, it is of particular importance to use a higher sequencing depth to characterize as much of the library diversity as possible as well as to evaluate the composition and quality of the library more accurately. Some statistical methods have been reported to measure the diversity of phage display peptide libraries [24]. These analyses have been conducted based on sampling a limited pool of the library by Sanger sequencing. Here, we used the number of unique sequences as an equivalent to diversity. The definition of diversity as the number of unique sequences is a commonly accepted idea in phage display literature [16,19,[25][26][27][28][29][30], motivated by increasing number of NGSbased phage display works in recent years which allow for sampling of a larger sequence space.\n...\nThe definition of diversity as the number of unique sequences is a commonly accepted idea in phage display literature [16,19,[25][26][27][28][29][30], motivated by increasing number of NGSbased phage display works in recent years which allow for sampling of a larger sequence space. In the current study, we investigated the capacity of two sequencing depths (each on two different input volumes) of NGS to characterize the unselected Ph.D. TM -12 phage display peptide library. In a broad sense, low-throughput (LTP) sequencing refers to Sanger sequencing and high-throughput (HTP) sequencing refers to all the different types of NGS platforms. In this work, we denote LTP as the NGS platform with the lower throughput (MiSeq Reagent Kit v2) and HTP as the NGS platform with the higher throughput (NextSeq 500/550 Mid Output Kit v.2.5). The aim of the current study was to provide an evaluation of the impact of sequencing depth on the analysis of diversity, quality, and composition of an unselected phage display peptide library. Our findings indicated that a higher sequencing depth offers a more rigorous evaluation of the library diversity and quality, uncovers a more heterogeneous distribution of peptide frequencies, provides a comparatively higher capacity for the differentiation of peptide frequencies, and results in the detection of distinct amino acid and peptide compositions for the library compared to sequencing modality with the lower depth. Based on the results, we discuss how the sequencing depth can lead to different outcomes for the characteristics of the library, alter the direction of analyses, and make a major impact on the final conclusions drawn from phage display data.\n\n## Discussion\nPeptide phage display relies on the identification of genuine target binders in the recovered phages obtained from biopanning. Analysis of the exact composition of phage display peptide libraries plays a valuable role in the discovery of ligands with strong binding affinities to different biological targets [21]. To achieve this purpose, a sequencing platform capable of rigorous characterization of the composition and diversity of the peptide pool is crucial. High-throughput sequencing has been found to be suited for the analysis of the sequence composition and inherent diversity of phage display libraries [20,31]. In the current work, we made a side-by-side comparison of the capacity of two NGS platforms with different depths of sequencing in characterizing the composition and diversity of a phage display peptide library. Rodi et al. introduced two concepts to define the library diversity: Technical diversity (completeness) which corresponds to the percentage of possible members of the library existing at any absolute frequency and functional diversity which takes into consideration the absolute frequency of each distinct peptide in the library [24]. Consistent with this, Makowski and Soares proposed an analytical expression of the library diversity in which diversity is not only dependent on the number of peptides but also on the relative abundance of each peptide within the library [32]. Here, we used the number of unique sequences as a measure of library diversity. This definition is commonly used to refer to the observed diversity of phage display peptide libraries [16,19,[25][26][27][28][29][30]. Our data indicated that sequencing depth has a vital impact on the ability to characterize the diversity of the library (Table 1 and Figure 1). A comparison of the two NGS modalities with LTP (720,000 absolute cleaned reads on average) and HTP (5,470,000 absolute cleaned reads on average) showed that the HTP platform can identify a significantly higher number of unique peptide sequences (unique cleaned reads in Table 1), thus revealing a much larger diversity of the library. It is worth mentioning that detecting the full diversity of phage display peptide libraries exceeds the capacity of current NGS platforms. The theoretical diversity of a 12-mer phage display peptide library can reach 4.1 \u00d7 10 15 .\n...\nThis highlights the pitfalls associated with applying Sanger sequencing for investigation of the library quality and analyzing the diversity of a representative pool of peptides after biopanning. It is of interest to note that a larger percentage of singletons in the LTP datasets suggests a larger portion of the library to be dominated by peptides with the same frequency. This leads us to observe less heterogeneity in the library when using LTP sequencing. \n\nThe investigation of the distribution of frequencies demonstrated that the HTP platform can detect a broader range of frequencies as well as a greater percentage of peptides with higher frequencies compared to the lower throughput platform (Figure 2). These results indicate that HTP sequencing can reveal a more heterogeneous distribution of peptide frequencies within the library and that LTP sequencing underestimates the library heterogeneity. This pattern is quite explicit for peptides with higher frequencies. Highly frequent peptides are important for the analysis of both unselected libraries and biopanning outputs. In the former, they might represent propagation-related target-unrelated peptides (Pr-TUPs) that are enriched during biopanning in a target-unrelated manner. In the latter, they might represent specific binders enriched during biopanning in a target-dependent manner. Hence, a sequencing platform with higher depth can improve the identification of both non-specific and specific peptides in phage display selections. Comparing peptides present in both HTP and LTP datasets showed that peptides having the same frequency in LTP sequencing in some cases resulted in different frequencies in HTP sequencing (Table 2). Hence, HTP has a relatively higher capacity for distinguishing peptide frequencies. The frequency of peptides is used as a basis to define the rank of sequences in NGS datasets and rank is a highly important selection criterion for peptides enriched during biopan-ning. This indicates that a higher depth of sequencing can provide a relatively more exact determination of peptide ranks in library selections. \n\nThe analysis of amino acid positional frequencies can be used in the evaluation of the library quality and diversity [24,34]. Furthermore, it offers valuable insights into the position-dependent enrichment of sequences during library selection that can be used to find sequence motifs in the peptide pool recovered from biopanning [16,35].\n\n## Conclusions\nOur findings suggest that the depth of the sequencing platform plays a pivotal role in the characterization of phage display peptide libraries. Our work provides insights into the limitations of lower throughput NGS. Compared to the traditional approach of Sanger sequencing, high-throughput sequencing strategies yield more valuable data on the compositional analysis of peptide pools. However, phage display researchers should be aware of the drawbacks of NGS platforms with lower depth, and the influence they might have on the analysis of phage display data. Lower sequencing depth can bear misleading information about the quality of unselected libraries and composition of biopanning outputs, which has substantial potential to misdirect further characterization of the in vitro selected peptides and final interpretations of phage display selection studies. We, therefore, recommend that phage display researchers thoroughly evaluate their experimental setup and draw particular attention to the constraints of the selected sequencing depth.",

However, their application in the past has been limited by time-consuming and expensive steps of discovery and production. The screening of antibody repertoires is a laborious step; however, the implementation of next-generation sequencing-guided screening of single-chain antibody fragments has now largely overcome this issue.

In our experience, the excision of variable fragments of interest by restriction enzymes (if useful sites are available) has to be preferred over PCR to avoid the loss of relative representativeness of clones and the potential polymerase errors that could generate artefactual sequences [61]. Indeed, although increasing the coverage allows to easily identify co-sequencing errors, the recognition of pre-sequencing polymerase errors that occurred during library preparation is a challenging task [63]. In addition, identification of truncated clones (bearing only VH, or VH with part of VL) has been reported in many studies, presumably due to their biological advantage (discussed in the next sections). To exclude these 'contaminant' clones from analysis, the introduction of a double step of enzymatic restriction to pull out VHs of interest only from full-length scFvs for fragment library preparation, is actually a routinely adopted, suitable option (Figure 2) [33,47]. As an alternative to enzymatic excision, a few nested ultra-high-fidelity PCR cycles can be implemented [57]. \n\nIn recent years, third-generation sequencing platforms (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies) have been developed to generate ultra-long reads from single molecules without the need for PCR amplification. While the use of these real-time sequencing platforms was initially disadvantaged by low-throughput and high error rate (>10%), chemically upgraded platforms (PacBio RS II and Sequel series) as well as bioinformatics algorithms (e.g., Nanopore's Bonito) have dramatically improved their output, allowing to obtain very long reads and a sharp reduction in the costs. The greatest breakthrough in third-generation sequencing was the development of circular consensus sequencing, by which a single molecule can be circularized and sequenced several times to radically reduce the error rate. These technical and bioinformatic improvements have led to obtaining ultralong (up to 25 kilobases) and increasingly accurate (99.9% for PacBio; 97% for Nanopore) reads [49,65].",

The most used NGS platforms in the antibody discovery field are MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), Roche 454 (now discontinued) and Ion Torrent (Life Technologies) (Waltham, MA, USA), which offer a good balance between the maximum read length and acceptable error rate (about 300 bp and 0.1%, 600-800 bp and 1%, and 400 bp and 1%, respectively). In any case, the whole sequence information of an scFv is split into smaller fragments corresponding to the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) regions [57][58][59][60]. Most of the sequencing strategies adopted so far have focused on sequencing only heavy chain complementary determining regions 3 (HCDR3) which is usually the one mostly contributing to binding, thereby disregarding information about other CDRs of heavy (HCDR1, HCDR2) and light (LCDR1, LCDR2, LCDR3) chain domains [57].

                    "text": "Many studies are continually developing methods to overcome these limitations and for high-throughput screening of display libraries. The link between the genotype (scFv coding sequence) and the phenotype (surface-displayed scFv) is the principle for the implementation of sequencing-guided screening of display libraries. Next-generation sequencing allows high-throughput interrogation of the selection steps to evaluate the relative enrichment of scFvs as indicative of their affinity for the target of interest, giving a far greater coverage compared to classical ELISA screening. This coverage also allows the identification of rare clones that, in some cases, can target sub-dominant epitopes with intriguing properties. Beyond the enrichment, high-throughput sequencing allows to discard a priori all those clones bearing non-valid inserts to restrict the analysis to potential binders. To further improve the confidence of binding prediction, we are implementing a database collecting predicted and validated binders to target-unrelated components of the biopanning. Refining the sequencing-guided screening, by applying these informatic scripts, grants dedicated wet step efforts to those scFvs with high-potential to be specific binders. Moreover, the characterization of these false-positive clones' sequences (target-unrelated and selection-unrelated), could lead to an increased understanding of how these clones arise to intervene in crucial selection steps for preventing or limiting this phenomenon. Although next-generation sequencing improved the quality of phage display, there are at least two key limitations: (1) the maximal read length of second-generation sequencing technologies (i.e., Illumina) allows to sequence only a portion of scFvs (e.g., VH), making the reconstruction of the entire antibody fragment challenging; (2) to physically fish out in silico-identified clones of interest, a laborious recovery step is necessary. Long reads obtainable from third-generation sequencing allow achieving quali-quantitative information of the entire scFvs. Not long ago, the relatively low-throughput, the high error rate, and the cost limited the exploitation of third-generation sequencing in display technologies. The circular consensus reads that the more widespread platforms' availability is making this paradigm shift overcome challenges with the higher sequencing error rate, and also leads to a reduction in sequencing costs [65].",

Zambrano, G. Froechlich, D. Lazarevi\u0107, M. Passariello, A. Nicosia, C. De Lorenzo, M. Morelli, E. Sasso\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Monoclonal antibodies are increasingly used for a broad range of diseases. Rising demand must face with time time-consuming and laborious processes to isolate novel monoclonal antibodies. Next-generation sequencing coupled to phage display provides timely and sustainable high throughput selection strategy to rapidly access novel target. Here, we describe the current NGS-guided strategies to identify potential binders from enriched sub-libraires by applying a user-friendly informatic pipeline to identify and discard false positive clones. Rescue step and strategies to boost mAb yield are also discussed to improve the limiting selection and screening steps. Abstract Monoclonal antibodies are among the most powerful therapeutics in modern medicine. Since the approval of the first therapeutic antibody in 1986, monoclonal antibodies keep holding great expectations for application in a range of clinical indications, highlighting the need to provide timely and sustainable access to powerful screening options. However, their application in the past has been limited by time-consuming and expensive steps of discovery and production. The screening of antibody repertoires is a laborious step; however, the implementation of next-generation sequencing-guided screening of single-chain antibody fragments has now largely overcome this issue. This review provides a detailed overview of the current strategies for the identification of monoclonal antibodies from phage display-based libraries. We also discuss the challenges and the possible solutions to improve the limiting selection and screening steps, in order to keep pace with the increasing demand for monoclonal antibodies.\n## Implementation of Next Generation Sequencing to Phage Display scFv Library Screening\nIn addition, clone enrichment can also reflect features not necessarily related to target affinity, including biological fitness and binding to non-target substrates (discussed in the next sections) reducing the isolation of true binders [52]. \n\nThe application of NGS to antibody display technologies (such as phage display, E. coli display, yeast display, ribosome display) allows us to deeply characterize the library composition, exploiting the physical linkage between phenotype (peptide or scFv protein) and genotype (coding sequence) of each phage genome present in the phage pool (Figure 2) [53,54]. Based on this concept, NGS was adopted for the screening of antibody libraries to identify potential binders by monitoring the enrichment of a given sequence during the selection cycles [55]. Parallel comparative screenings of antibody libraries by traditional ELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56]. \n\nELISA and NGS have demonstrated that, beyond top-ranking clones efficiently identified by both technologies, deep sequencing enables the discovery of many more specific binders among rare clones with potentially interesting features [38,56]. Strategies to analyze phage library by second-and third-generation sequencing. On the left, the workflow for extraction of variable fragments compatible with second-generation sequencing platforms (e.g., Illumina MiSeq) is shown. Full-length scFvs and VH fragments are extracted from dsDNA of phages from E. coli. On the right, the workflow for the application of third-generation sequencing of entire scFvs by circular consensus sequencing is represented. Molecular barcoding can be included in both strategies for multiplexing samples. The indicated pros (green font) and cons (red font) are referred to as the current state-of-the-art.\n\n## Sequencing-Guided Antibody Discovery: State-of-the-Art and Beyond\nThe principal drawback of high-throughput sequencing applied to antibody display libraries is related to the limited maximum read length attainable with classical NGS platforms, which is far from the average size of scFv and Fab formats (respectively 800 and 1500 bp). The most used NGS platforms in the antibody discovery field are MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), Roche 454 (now discontinued) and Ion Torrent (Life Technologies) (Waltham, MA, USA), which offer a good balance between the maximum read length and acceptable error rate (about 300 bp and 0.1%, 600-800 bp and 1%, and 400 bp and 1%, respectively). In any case, the whole sequence information of an scFv is split into smaller fragments corresponding to the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) regions [57][58][59][60]. Most of the sequencing strategies adopted so far have focused on sequencing only heavy chain complementary determining regions 3 (HCDR3) which is usually the one mostly contributing to binding, thereby disregarding information about other CDRs of heavy (HCDR1, HCDR2) and light (LCDR1, LCDR2, LCDR3) chain domains [57]. The paired-end reads, in part, compensate for the limited length of reads, allowing the Strategies to analyze phage library by second-and third-generation sequencing. On the left, the workflow for extraction of variable fragments compatible with second-generation sequencing platforms (e.g., Illumina MiSeq) is shown. Full-length scFvs and VH fragments are extracted from dsDNA of phages from E. coli. On the right, the workflow for the application of third-generation sequencing of entire scFvs by circular consensus sequencing is represented. Molecular barcoding can be included in both strategies for multiplexing samples. The indicated pros (green font) and cons (red font) are referred to as the current state-of-the-art.\n...\nThe crucial steps in the NGS-guided antibody discovery are the fragment generation and library preparation. In our experience, the excision of variable fragments of interest by restriction enzymes (if useful sites are available) has to be preferred over PCR to avoid the loss of relative representativeness of clones and the potential polymerase errors that could generate artefactual sequences [61]. Indeed, although increasing the coverage allows to easily identify co-sequencing errors, the recognition of pre-sequencing polymerase errors that occurred during library preparation is a challenging task [63]. In addition, identification of truncated clones (bearing only VH, or VH with part of VL) has been reported in many studies, presumably due to their biological advantage (discussed in the next sections). To exclude these 'contaminant' clones from analysis, the introduction of a double step of enzymatic restriction to pull out VHs of interest only from full-length scFvs for fragment library preparation, is actually a routinely adopted, suitable option (Figure 2) [33,47]. As an alternative to enzymatic excision, a few nested ultra-high-fidelity PCR cycles can be implemented [57]. \n\nIn recent years, third-generation sequencing platforms (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies) have been developed to generate ultra-long reads from single molecules without the need for PCR amplification. While the use of these real-time sequencing platforms was initially disadvantaged by low-throughput and high error rate (>10%), chemically upgraded platforms (PacBio RS II and Sequel series) as well as bioinformatics algorithms (e.g., Nanopore's Bonito) have dramatically improved their output, allowing to obtain very long reads and a sharp reduction in the costs. The greatest breakthrough in third-generation sequencing was the development of circular consensus sequencing, by which a single molecule can be circularized and sequenced several times to radically reduce the error rate. These technical and bioinformatic improvements have led to obtaining ultralong (up to 25 kilobases) and increasingly accurate (99.9% for PacBio; 97% for Nanopore) reads [49,65].\n\n## Conclusions\nMany studies are continually developing methods to overcome these limitations and for high-throughput screening of display libraries. The link between the genotype (scFv coding sequence) and the phenotype (surface-displayed scFv) is the principle for the implementation of sequencing-guided screening of display libraries. Next-generation sequencing allows high-throughput interrogation of the selection steps to evaluate the relative enrichment of scFvs as indicative of their affinity for the target of interest, giving a far greater coverage compared to classical ELISA screening. This coverage also allows the identification of rare clones that, in some cases, can target sub-dominant epitopes with intriguing properties. Beyond the enrichment, high-throughput sequencing allows to discard a priori all those clones bearing non-valid inserts to restrict the analysis to potential binders. To further improve the confidence of binding prediction, we are implementing a database collecting predicted and validated binders to target-unrelated components of the biopanning. Refining the sequencing-guided screening, by applying these informatic scripts, grants dedicated wet step efforts to those scFvs with high-potential to be specific binders. Moreover, the characterization of these false-positive clones' sequences (target-unrelated and selection-unrelated), could lead to an increased understanding of how these clones arise to intervene in crucial selection steps for preventing or limiting this phenomenon. Although next-generation sequencing improved the quality of phage display, there are at least two key limitations: (1) the maximal read length of second-generation sequencing technologies (i.e., Illumina) allows to sequence only a portion of scFvs (e.g., VH), making the reconstruction of the entire antibody fragment challenging; (2) to physically fish out in silico-identified clones of interest, a laborious recovery step is necessary. Long reads obtainable from third-generation sequencing allow achieving quali-quantitative information of the entire scFvs. Not long ago, the relatively low-throughput, the high error rate, and the cost limited the exploitation of third-generation sequencing in display technologies. The circular consensus reads that the more widespread platforms' availability is making this paradigm shift overcome challenges with the higher sequencing error rate, and also leads to a reduction in sequencing costs [65].",

While the technologies differ in their approach, both platforms sequence single molecules and are capable of producing sequences of tens of kilobases in length [17]. The ability to sequence long DNA molecules offers the ability to overcome the issues of microdiversity and or hypervariable regions found within phage genomes [14]. To date there have been limited studies using ONT sequencing for viromics. One of the first was able to acquire complete phage genomes from single ONT reads, utilising tangential flow filtration (TFF) of marine samples to obtain the significant amounts of DNA required for library preparation [18]. Extraction of such quantities of phage DNA is likely prohibitive from more viscous and heterogeneous environments where multiple displacement amplification (MDA) is already used to obtain enough DNA for library preparation for short read sequencing. While MDA provides a solution to the amount of input material, it does not come without problems. It has been well documented that MDA can introduce biases in metagenomic libraries, in particular over representation of ssDNA phages within samples [19][20][21]. To overcome the problem of library input requirements, MDA for ONT library preparation, combined with unamplified short read libraries for quantification have been utilised [22]. Alternatively, ONT sequencing (minION) of long-read linker amplified shotgun libraries (LASL), to sequence PCR products on a minION, combined with Illumina short reads were used in an approach dubbed virION [14,23]. Both approaches were successful in increasing the number and completeness of viral genomes. \n\nWhile the number of viromes that utilise ONT alone or in combination with Illumina sequencing is slowly increasing [14,[22][23][24][25], reports of utilising PacBio sequencing for viromes are scarce [26].",

Smith, Andrew Millard\n## Abstract\nViral metagenomics has fuelled a rapid change in our understanding of global viral diversity and ecology. Long-read sequencing and hybrid approaches that combine long and short read technologies are now being widely implemented in bacterial genomics and metagenomics. However, the use of long-read sequencing to investigate viral communities is still in its infancy. While Nanopore and PacBio technologies have been applied to viral metagenomics, it is not known to what extent different technologies will impact the reconstruction of the viral community. Thus, we constructed a mock phage community of previously sequenced phage genomes and sequenced using Illumina, Nanopore, and PacBio sequencing technologies and tested a number of different assembly approaches. When using a single sequencing technology, Illumina assemblies were the best at recovering phage genomes. Nanopore- and PacBio-only assemblies performed poorly in comparison to Illumina in both genome recovery and error rates, which both varied with the assembler used. The best Nanopore assembly had errors that manifested as SNPs and INDELs at frequencies ~4x and 120x higher than found in Illumina only assemblies respectively. While the best PacBio assemblies had SNPs at frequencies ~3.5 x and 12x higher than found in Illumina only assemblies respectively. Despite high read coverage, long-read only assemblies failed to recover a complete genome for any of the 15 phage, down sampling of reads did increase the proportion of a genome that could be assembled into a single contig. Overall the best approach was assembly by a combination of Illumina and Nanopore reads, which reduced error rates to levels comparable with short read only assemblies. When using a single technology, Illumina only was the best approach. The differences in genome recovery and error rates between technology and assembler had downstream impacts on gene prediction, viral prediction, and subsequent estimates of diversity within a sample. These findings will provide a starting point for others in the choice of reads and assembly algorithms for the analysis of viromes. Data Summary All reads from virome sequencing were submitted to the ENA under study PRJEB56639. The assemblies are provided via FigShare (https://figshare.com/s/2d9b5121eb421d370455). Author Notes Eight Supplementary Tables and nine Supplementary Figures are available with the online version of this article.\n## Introduction\nWhilst both of these approaches are beneficial, they are technologically challenging compared to more standard viromics workflows. \n\nRecent technological developments have led to the production of long read sequences by both Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) [16] and PacBio [17]. While the technologies differ in their approach, both platforms sequence single molecules and are capable of producing sequences of tens of kilobases in length [17]. The ability to sequence long DNA molecules offers the ability to overcome the issues of microdiversity and or hypervariable regions found within phage genomes [14]. To date there have been limited studies using ONT sequencing for viromics. One of the first was able to acquire complete phage genomes from single ONT reads, utilising tangential flow filtration (TFF) of marine samples to obtain the significant amounts of DNA required for library preparation [18]. Extraction of such quantities of phage DNA is likely prohibitive from more viscous and heterogeneous environments where multiple displacement amplification (MDA) is already used to obtain enough DNA for library preparation for short read sequencing. While MDA provides a solution to the amount of input material, it does not come without problems. It has been well documented that MDA can introduce biases in metagenomic libraries, in particular over representation of ssDNA phages within samples [19][20][21]. To overcome the problem of library input requirements, MDA for ONT library preparation, combined with unamplified short read libraries for quantification have been utilised [22]. Alternatively, ONT sequencing (minION) of long-read linker amplified shotgun libraries (LASL), to sequence PCR products on a minION, combined with Illumina short reads were used in an approach dubbed virION [14,23]. Both approaches were successful in increasing the number and completeness of viral genomes. \n\nWhile the number of viromes that utilise ONT alone or in combination with Illumina sequencing is slowly increasing [14,[22][23][24][25], reports of utilising PacBio sequencing for viromes are scarce [26].",

                    "text": "To date, well-established Illumina devices clearly dominate the field of immune repertoire sequencing, as they offer high-quality short-sequencing reads at unexcelled throughput. Deep resolution of the vast immune repertoire sequence space enables better insights into the diversity of unique BCR and TCR sequences (>10 13 in humans) and allows detection of shared clones across individuals, so called ''public clones'' (Soto et al., 2019;Briney et al., 2019;Greiff et al., 2017a;DeWitt et al., 2018). \n\nPaired-end sequencing on Illumina allows coverage of one variable region of immune receptors; however, for approaches that rely on complete immune receptor sequence coverage and hence require longer read lengths, an alternative platform is offered by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) (Eid et al., 2009). PacBio's sequencing technology is based on single-molecule sequencing. Each DNA template molecule gets isolated in a microwell, together with a single polymerase and fluorescently labeled nucleotides. Importantly, the DNA templates are circularized before sequencing, allowing for repeated readout by the polymerase. This allows for consensus reading, achieving read accuracies of over 99% with high-fidelity read lengths up to 15 kb (Wenger et al., 2019). With the recent introduction of the PacBio Sequel II system, sequencing depths of 4 million reads per run can be achieved. Hence, PacBio can be utilized for sequencing immune receptor repertoires where variable regions (e.g., variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL)) are physically linked in the context of single-cell sequencing (DeKosky et al., 2013;McDaniel et al., 2016). Moreover, longread sequencing is in particular valuable for in vitro screening platforms (e.g., phage display), which for instance utilize recombinant antibody fragment libraries known as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). Sequencing of full-length scFvs is important for covering both VH and VL diversity, which is critical in assessing quality of such libraries and their utility for drug discovery (Hemadou et al., 2017;Han et al., 2018).",

Ehling, Bastian Wagner, S. Reddy\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Platforms for Immune Repertoire Sequencing\nTo date, well-established Illumina devices clearly dominate the field of immune repertoire sequencing, as they offer high-quality short-sequencing reads at unexcelled throughput. Deep resolution of the vast immune repertoire sequence space enables better insights into the diversity of unique BCR and TCR sequences (>10 13 in humans) and allows detection of shared clones across individuals, so called ''public clones'' (Soto et al., 2019;Briney et al., 2019;Greiff et al., 2017a;DeWitt et al., 2018). \n\nPaired-end sequencing on Illumina allows coverage of one variable region of immune receptors; however, for approaches that rely on complete immune receptor sequence coverage and hence require longer read lengths, an alternative platform is offered by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) (Eid et al., 2009). PacBio's sequencing technology is based on single-molecule sequencing. Each DNA template molecule gets isolated in a microwell, together with a single polymerase and fluorescently labeled nucleotides. Importantly, the DNA templates are circularized before sequencing, allowing for repeated readout by the polymerase. This allows for consensus reading, achieving read accuracies of over 99% with high-fidelity read lengths up to 15 kb (Wenger et al., 2019). With the recent introduction of the PacBio Sequel II system, sequencing depths of 4 million reads per run can be achieved. Hence, PacBio can be utilized for sequencing immune receptor repertoires where variable regions (e.g., variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL)) are physically linked in the context of single-cell sequencing (DeKosky et al., 2013;McDaniel et al., 2016). Moreover, longread sequencing is in particular valuable for in vitro screening platforms (e.g., phage display), which for instance utilize recombinant antibody fragment libraries known as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). Sequencing of full-length scFvs is important for covering both VH and VL diversity, which is critical in assessing quality of such libraries and their utility for drug discovery (Hemadou et al., 2017;Han et al., 2018).",

Argyropoulos\n## Abstract\nThere has been significant progress made in the field of nanopore biosensor development and sequencing applications, which address previous limitations that restricted widespread nanopore use. These innovations, paired with the large-scale commercialization of biological nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, are making the platforms a mainstay in contemporary research laboratories. Equipped with the ability to provide long- and short read sequencing information, with quick turn-around times and simple sample preparation, nanopore sequencers are rapidly improving our understanding of unsolved genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic problems. However, there remain some key obstacles that have yet to be improved. In this review, we provide a general introduction to nanopore sequencing principles, discussing biological and solid-state nanopore developments, obstacles to single-base detection, and library preparation considerations. We present examples of important clinical applications to give perspective on the potential future of nanopore sequencing in the field of molecular diagnostics.\n## Introduction\nTo introduce this discussion, we will open with library preparation technologies and recent modifications to these protocols, which permit sequencing-complicated sample types. The clinical applications of nanopore sequencing will include: an investigation into how innovative sequencing approaches have permitted viral genome assemblies; and the identification of rare genotypes, biomarkers, and epigenetic phenomena associated with disease. We will then conclude with a discussion of sequencing platform comparisons, providing insight to the differences between commercially available sequencing tools, such as Illumina, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). We hope this review will introduce nanopore sequencing for the curious reader, while also providing perspective on the promise of this tool for progressing the field of molecular medicine.\n\n## Oxford Nanopore Technologies vs. Other NGS Platforms\nAs aforementioned, the commercialization of nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) in 2014 has made protein nanopores widely available for use in many research applications. They currently dominate the nanopore sequencing space, providing sequencers and library preparation kits for DNA and RNA nucleic acid sequencing. As the popularity of these platforms grows, we recognize that many researchers may be seeking comparative information between ONT and other available options. While a thorough comparison of these platforms is beyond the scope of this review, we wish to provide a brief perspective on this issue, focusing on differences between Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies.",

            "abstract": "Background: There is an unmet medical need to develop a vaccine targeting endemic coronaviruses. Antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are crucial for many assays to support vaccine development. Objective: In this study, we used the HuCal Fab phage display library with a diversity of 4.5 \u00d7 1010 to identify antibodies specific to the spike proteins of the four endemic coronaviruses: OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1. Methods: As proof of concept, we established a newly designed platform using a long-read NGS workflow for antibody discovery and compared the results against the traditional workflow using Sanger sequencing consisting of lengthy and laborious benchwork. Results: The long-read NGS workflow identified most of the antibodies seen from the Sanger sequencing workflow, and many more additional antigen-specific antibodies against the endemic coronaviruses. Overall efficiency improved up to three times, comparing the traditional workflow with the NGS workflow. Of the 113 NGS-derived mAbs isolated to bind the four endemic coronavirus spike proteins, 107/113 (94.7%) had potent ELISA binding affinities (EC50 < 150 ng/mL, or <1 nM), and 61/113 (54%) had extremely potent ELISA binding affinities (EC50 of <15 ng/mL, or <0.1 nM). Conclusions: We successfully developed and incorporated the long-read NGS workflow to generate target-specific antibodies with many antibodies at sub-nanomolar affinities that are likely missed by a traditional workflow. We identified strong neutralizing antibodies, proving that our endemic spike proteins are capable of generating antibodies that could offer protection against the endemic HCoVs.",

                    "text": "George P. Smith first developed phage display technology in 1985 [8], and the technology quickly advanced in the 1990s from peptide libraries [9] to recombinant antibody fragment libraries [10][11][12][13][14][15]. A major limitation of the traditional phage-panning platform is the laborious workflow and low throughput of obtaining antibody gene sequences relying on Sanger sequencing [16]. \n\nTo improve upon the traditional workflow and obtain a more diverse panel of sequences after panning, a commonly used next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform is MiSeq from Illumina. Paired-end MiSeq (2 \u00d7 300 bp) sequencing from Illumina covers segments of about 500 bp and has been successfully applied to the investigation of shorter antibody fragment libraries, such as nanobodies derived from the camelid's variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies [17,18], as well as the shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) [19]. Paired-end MiSeq can also read amplicons long enough to cover all CDRs in single-chain Fv (scFv) [20]. However, paired-end MiSeq is not sufficient to cover longer light and heavy chain-combined sequences (1.2-1.5 kb), which are linked together in Human Fab libraries [21,22]. \n\nThird-generation NGS technology such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) can bridge the shortcomings of current MiSeq sequencing [23], as it is possible to achieve long sequencing reads of 10 to 15 kb in length with single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) [24]. PacBio's NGS had been applied successfully to scFv fragment libraries [25,26]. In particular, Han et al. applied PacBio's platform to the deep sequencing of the immune rhesus macaque scFv phage library to identify additional unique antibody gene sequences previously not seen in their Sanger sequencing results [26]. \n\nIn this study, we used Bio-Rad's HuCAL PLATINUM Human Fab phage library with a diversity greater than 45 billion.",

Vora, Arthur Fridman, Zhifeng Chen\n## Abstract\nBackground: There is an unmet medical need to develop a vaccine targeting endemic coronaviruses. Antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are crucial for many assays to support vaccine development. Objective: In this study, we used the HuCal Fab phage display library with a diversity of 4.5 \u00d7 1010 to identify antibodies specific to the spike proteins of the four endemic coronaviruses: OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1. Methods: As proof of concept, we established a newly designed platform using a long-read NGS workflow for antibody discovery and compared the results against the traditional workflow using Sanger sequencing consisting of lengthy and laborious benchwork. Results: The long-read NGS workflow identified most of the antibodies seen from the Sanger sequencing workflow, and many more additional antigen-specific antibodies against the endemic coronaviruses. Overall efficiency improved up to three times, comparing the traditional workflow with the NGS workflow. Of the 113 NGS-derived mAbs isolated to bind the four endemic coronavirus spike proteins, 107/113 (94.7%) had potent ELISA binding affinities (EC50 < 150 ng/mL, or <1 nM), and 61/113 (54%) had extremely potent ELISA binding affinities (EC50 of <15 ng/mL, or <0.1 nM). Conclusions: We successfully developed and incorporated the long-read NGS workflow to generate target-specific antibodies with many antibodies at sub-nanomolar affinities that are likely missed by a traditional workflow. We identified strong neutralizing antibodies, proving that our endemic spike proteins are capable of generating antibodies that could offer protection against the endemic HCoVs.\n## Introduction\nGeorge P. Smith first developed phage display technology in 1985 [8], and the technology quickly advanced in the 1990s from peptide libraries [9] to recombinant antibody fragment libraries [10][11][12][13][14][15]. A major limitation of the traditional phage-panning platform is the laborious workflow and low throughput of obtaining antibody gene sequences relying on Sanger sequencing [16]. \n\nTo improve upon the traditional workflow and obtain a more diverse panel of sequences after panning, a commonly used next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform is MiSeq from Illumina. Paired-end MiSeq (2 \u00d7 300 bp) sequencing from Illumina covers segments of about 500 bp and has been successfully applied to the investigation of shorter antibody fragment libraries, such as nanobodies derived from the camelid's variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies [17,18], as well as the shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) [19]. Paired-end MiSeq can also read amplicons long enough to cover all CDRs in single-chain Fv (scFv) [20]. However, paired-end MiSeq is not sufficient to cover longer light and heavy chain-combined sequences (1.2-1.5 kb), which are linked together in Human Fab libraries [21,22]. \n\nThird-generation NGS technology such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) can bridge the shortcomings of current MiSeq sequencing [23], as it is possible to achieve long sequencing reads of 10 to 15 kb in length with single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) [24]. PacBio's NGS had been applied successfully to scFv fragment libraries [25,26]. In particular, Han et al. applied PacBio's platform to the deep sequencing of the immune rhesus macaque scFv phage library to identify additional unique antibody gene sequences previously not seen in their Sanger sequencing results [26]. \n\nIn this study, we used Bio-Rad's HuCAL PLATINUM Human Fab phage library with a diversity greater than 45 billion.",

Garcia-Calvo, Aina Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda, Santiago Rodr\u00edguez, Rosario Mart\u00edn, T. Garc\u00eda\n## Abstract\nDirected evolution is a pivotal strategy for new antibody discovery, which allowed the generation of high-affinity Fabs against gliadin from two antibody libraries in our previous studies. One of the libraries was exclusively derived from celiac patients\u2019 mRNA (immune library) while the other was obtained through a protein engineering approach (semi-immune library). Recent advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques are revolutionizing research across genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics. In the present work, an Oxford Nanopore in-lab sequencing device was used to comprehensively characterize the composition of the constructed libraries, both at the beginning and throughout the phage-mediated selection processes against gliadin. A customized analysis pipeline was used to select high-quality reads, annotate chain distribution, perform sequence analysis, and conduct statistical comparisons between the different selection rounds. Some immunological attributes of the most representative phage variants after the selection process were also determined. Sequencing results revealed the successful transfer of the celiac immune response features to the immune library and the antibodies derived from it, suggesting the crucial role of these features in guiding the selection of high-affinity recombinant Fabs against gliadin. In summary, high-throughput DNA sequencing has improved our understanding of the selection processes aimed at generating molecular binders against gliadin.\n## Introduction\nThe paradigm-shifting development of hybridoma technology revolutionized the field of antibody production with the discovery of monoclonal antibodies [1].In 2022, six out of the fifteen best-selling pharmaceuticals were monoclonal antibodies (even more if COVID-19 vaccines are not considered); these figures illustrate the magnitude of the impact that these molecules have had in research and medicine [2].Subsequently, the advent of recombinant protein production techniques and the application of directed evolution methodologies have further transformed the antibody discovery landscape [3].\n\nPhage display technology stands as the most prominent methodology for the development of recombinant antibodies in the context of the directed evolution of proteins.This method is based on the construction of antibody libraries derived from diverse sources with high variability [4].A characteristic feature of these libraries is that the antibodies are expressed fused to the coat proteins of bacteriophages, which facilitates their affinity selection through successive rounds against the target antigen (biopanning) [5].\n\nTraditionally, monitoring of the panning procedure has been performed by colony picking and Sanger sequencing since the 1990s.However, while these methods can be automated for the screening of thousands of different colonies, they only cover a small amount of the clones implied in the process.This problem may be solved by using nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) techniques [6].The in-depth analysis of phage libraries by NGS has proven to be an exceptionally effective approach for clone identification, including rare low-frequency variants that may not amplify adequately within the phage population [7].Moreover, NGS has facilitated the identification and reconstruction of complementarity-determining region (CDR) combinations of antibody fragments from phage selection outputs [8].Beyond antibody libraries, this transformative technique extends its applicability to the study of peptide libraries, essential for epitope mapping of antibodies [9].\n\nOxford Nanopore Technology offers many advantages that have revolutionized the field of DNA sequencing and genomic analysis.Firstly, the portable and compact sequencing devices provide unprecedented flexibility, enabling real-time, in situ, and rapid DNA sequencing in diverse environments, including field research and clinical settings.Secondly, the sequencing technology can read exceptionally long DNA fragments, allowing for improved genome assembly and structural variant detection.",

Illumina sequencing technology has been used extensively in numerous microbiome research projects (131)(132)(133), including the Human Microbiome Project (44). While both Ion Torrent and Illumina sequencers provide a number of advantages in terms of their cost and efficiency, the short read lengths they provide make them less appropriate for addressing a number of scientific questions, including detection of gene isoforms, methylation detection, and genome assembly (118). SMRT (single-molecule real-time) sequencing platforms offer approaches that are more suited for these research objectives. Since PacBiosequencing generates longer reads that provide longer scaffolds (134)(135)(136), it is well suited for denovo genome assembly. The commercial availability of MinION sequencers by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which resemble a USB flash drive in appearance, has also enabled applications that require long-read sequencing (137,138). The efficiency, long read lengths, and single-base sensitivity make nanopore sequencing technology a promising approach for highthroughput sequencing. The MinION system has been used for sequencing the genomes of infectious agents, including the analysis of bacterial antibiotic resistance islands (137), the influenza virus (139) and genome surveillance of the Ebola virus (140). The advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies now provide the opportunity to choose different sequencing platforms to conduct microbiome research.

While both Ion Torrent and Illumina sequencers provide a number of advantages in terms of their cost and efficiency, the short read lengths they provide make them less appropriate for addressing a number of scientific questions, including detection of gene isoforms, methylation detection, and genome assembly (118). SMRT (single-molecule real-time) sequencing platforms offer approaches that are more suited for these research objectives. Since PacBiosequencing generates longer reads that provide longer scaffolds (134)(135)(136), it is well suited for denovo genome assembly. The commercial availability of MinION sequencers by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which resemble a USB flash drive in appearance, has also enabled applications that require long-read sequencing (137,138). The efficiency, long read lengths, and single-base sensitivity make nanopore sequencing technology a promising approach for highthroughput sequencing. The MinION system has been used for sequencing the genomes of infectious agents, including the analysis of bacterial antibiotic resistance islands (137), the influenza virus (139) and genome surveillance of the Ebola virus (140). The advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies now provide the opportunity to choose different sequencing platforms to conduct microbiome research. In a comparative analysis of the Illumina MiSeq, Ion Torrent PGM, and 454 GS Junior sequencing platforms, Loman et al. (141) reported that Illumina provided the highest output per run",

Podophages characterized in this study were also found to share similarity in genome architecture and composition to other previously described P. mirabilis podophages (PM16 and PM75). In contrast, vB_PimP_RS51pmB showed morphology characteristic of the Myoviridae family, with no notable similarity to other phage genomes examined.

Existing solutions generally target expert users and often have unclear scope, making it challenging to critically evaluate their performance. There is a growing need for intuitive analytical tooling for researchers lacking specialist computing expertise and that is applicable in diverse experimental circumstances. Notable technical challenges have impeded progress; for example, fragments of viral genomes are typically orders of magnitude less abundant than those of host, bacteria, and/or other organisms in clinical and environmental metagenomes; observed viral genomes often deviate considerably from reference genomes demanding use of exhaustive alignment approaches; high intrapopulation viral diversity can lead to ambiguous sequence reconstruction; and finally, the relatively few documented viral reference genomes compared to the estimated number of distinct viral taxa renders classification problematic. Various software tools have been developed to accommodate the unique challenges and use cases associated with characterizing viral sequences; however, the quality of these tools varies, and their use often necessitates computing expertise or access to powerful computers, thus limiting their usefulness to many researchers. In this review, we consider the general and application-specific challenges posed by viral sequencing and analysis, outline the landscape of available tools and methodologies, and propose ways of overcoming the current barriers to effective analysis.",

The current market leader, Illumina, manufactures instruments capable of generating billions of 150 base pair (bp) paired end reads (see 'Glossary') per run, with read lengths of up to 300 bp. The Illumina short read platform is widely used for analyses of viral genomes and metagenomes, and, given sufficient sequencing coverage, enables sensitive characterization of lowfrequency variation within viral populations (e.g. HIV resistance mutations as low as 0.1% (Li et al. 2014)). Ion Torrent (ThermoFisher) is capable of generating longer reads than Illumina at the expense of reduced throughput and a higher rate of insertion and deletion (indel) error (Eid et al. 2009). Single molecule real-time sequencing commercialized by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) produces much longer (>10 kbp) reads from a single molecule without clonal amplification, which eliminates the errors introduced in this step. However, this platform has a high (10%) intrinsic error rate, and remains much more expensive than Illumina sequencing for equivalent throughput. The Nanopore platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which includes the pocket sized MinION sequencer, also implements long read single molecule sequencing, and permits truly real-time analysis of individual sequences as they are generated. Although more affordable than PacBio single molecule sequencing, the Nanopore platform also suffers from high error rates in comparison with Illumina (Reuter, Spacek, and Snyder 2015). However, the technology is maturing rapidly and has already demonstrated potential to revolutionize pathogen surveillance and discovery in the field, as well as enabling contiguous assembly of entire bacterial genomes at relatively low cost (Feng et al. 2015;Quick et al. 2015;Hoenen et al. 2016). Hybrid sequencing strategies using both long and short reads leverage the ability of long reads to resolve repetitive DNA regions while benefitting from the high accuracy of short reads, at the expense of additional sequencing, library preparation and data analysis (Madoui et al. 2015).",

Robertson, M. Prosperi\n## Abstract\nAbstract Genome sequencing technologies continue to develop with remarkable pace, yet analytical approaches for reconstructing and classifying viral genomes from mixed samples remain limited in their performance and usability. Existing solutions generally target expert users and often have unclear scope, making it challenging to critically evaluate their performance. There is a growing need for intuitive analytical tooling for researchers lacking specialist computing expertise and that is applicable in diverse experimental circumstances. Notable technical challenges have impeded progress; for example, fragments of viral genomes are typically orders of magnitude less abundant than those of host, bacteria, and/or other organisms in clinical and environmental metagenomes; observed viral genomes often deviate considerably from reference genomes demanding use of exhaustive alignment approaches; high intrapopulation viral diversity can lead to ambiguous sequence reconstruction; and finally, the relatively few documented viral reference genomes compared to the estimated number of distinct viral taxa renders classification problematic. Various software tools have been developed to accommodate the unique challenges and use cases associated with characterizing viral sequences; however, the quality of these tools varies, and their use often necessitates computing expertise or access to powerful computers, thus limiting their usefulness to many researchers. In this review, we consider the general and application-specific challenges posed by viral sequencing and analysis, outline the landscape of available tools and methodologies, and propose ways of overcoming the current barriers to effective analysis.\n## Choosing a sequencing platform\nThere are several sequencing technologies in widespread use that are capable of reading hundreds of thousands to billions of DNA sequences per run (Reuter, Spacek, and Snyder 2015). The current market leader, Illumina, manufactures instruments capable of generating billions of 150 base pair (bp) paired end reads (see 'Glossary') per run, with read lengths of up to 300 bp. The Illumina short read platform is widely used for analyses of viral genomes and metagenomes, and, given sufficient sequencing coverage, enables sensitive characterization of lowfrequency variation within viral populations (e.g. HIV resistance mutations as low as 0.1% (Li et al. 2014)). Ion Torrent (ThermoFisher) is capable of generating longer reads than Illumina at the expense of reduced throughput and a higher rate of insertion and deletion (indel) error (Eid et al. 2009). Single molecule real-time sequencing commercialized by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) produces much longer (>10 kbp) reads from a single molecule without clonal amplification, which eliminates the errors introduced in this step. However, this platform has a high (10%) intrinsic error rate, and remains much more expensive than Illumina sequencing for equivalent throughput. The Nanopore platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which includes the pocket sized MinION sequencer, also implements long read single molecule sequencing, and permits truly real-time analysis of individual sequences as they are generated. Although more affordable than PacBio single molecule sequencing, the Nanopore platform also suffers from high error rates in comparison with Illumina (Reuter, Spacek, and Snyder 2015). However, the technology is maturing rapidly and has already demonstrated potential to revolutionize pathogen surveillance and discovery in the field, as well as enabling contiguous assembly of entire bacterial genomes at relatively low cost (Feng et al. 2015;Quick et al. 2015;Hoenen et al. 2016). Hybrid sequencing strategies using both long and short reads leverage the ability of long reads to resolve repetitive DNA regions while benefitting from the high accuracy of short reads, at the expense of additional sequencing, library preparation and data analysis (Madoui et al. 2015).",

The Illumina sequencing technologies are frequently used to identify new phages and also to detect viruses from various habitats, but they are not optimized for enumeration.

Other limitations are due to loss of data during assembly of contigs, leading to underestimation of the number of phages in the sample. In addition, carryover of bacterial host DNA, lack of databases with reference phage genomes (Hatfull, 2008) and the mosaic nature of phage genomes makes viral WGS challenging as a method for enumeration and detection, unless the sequence is known beforehand (Dorscht et al., 2009).

Weirather, M. de Cesare, Yunhao Wang, P. Piazza, V. Sebastiano, Xiu-Jie Wang, D. Buck, K. Au\n## Abstract\nBackground: Given the demonstrated utility of Third Generation Sequencing [Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)] long reads in many studies, a comprehensive analysis and comparison of their data quality and applications is in high demand. Methods: Based on the transcriptome sequencing data from human embryonic stem cells, we analyzed multiple data features of PacBio and ONT, including error pattern, length, mappability and technical improvements over previous platforms. We also evaluated their application to transcriptome analyses, such as isoform identification and quantification and characterization of transcriptome complexity, by comparing the performance of size-selected PacBio, non-size-selected ONT and their corresponding Hybrid-Seq strategies (PacBio+Illumina and ONT+Illumina). Results: PacBio shows overall better data quality, while ONT provides a higher yield. As with data quality, PacBio performs marginally better than ONT in most aspects for both long reads only and Hybrid-Seq strategies in transcriptome analysis. In addition, Hybrid-Seq shows superior performance over long reads only in most transcriptome analyses. Conclusions: Both PacBio and ONT sequencing are suitable for full-length single-molecule transcriptome analysis. As this first use of ONT reads in a Hybrid-Seq analysis has shown, both PacBio and ONT can benefit from a combined Illumina strategy. The tools and analytical methods developed here provide a resource for future applications and evaluations of these rapidly-changing technologies.\n",

Its immense popularity is due in large part to the continuous efforts of the bioinformatics community to develop accurate and scalable computational tools to analyze the enormous amounts of transcriptomic data that it produces. RNA-seq analysis enables genes and their corresponding transcripts to be probed for a variety of purposes, such as detecting novel exons or whole transcripts, assessing expression of genes and alternative transcripts, and studying alternative splicing structure. It can be a challenge, however, to obtain meaningful biological signals from raw RNA-seq data because of the enormous scale of the data as well as the inherent limitations of different sequencing technologies, such as amplification bias or biases of library preparation. The need to overcome these technical challenges has pushed the rapid development of novel computational tools, which have evolved and diversified in accordance with technological advancements, leading to the current myriad of RNA-seq tools. These tools, combined with the diverse computational skill sets of biomedical researchers, help to unlock the full potential of RNA-seq.

Nanopore sequencing can produce short or long reads from native DNA and RNA fragments of any length. Nanopores are very small holes in a membrane that can be created by pore-forming proteins or by non-biological means. The Nanopore sequencing method simultaneously sends an ionic current and a single strand of DNA or RNA through a nanopore. As the ionic current passes through each nucleotide that successively occupies the nanopore, it undergoes disruptions that are unique to the nitrogenous base. The patterns of disruption in the current can be interpreted to identify each base in the DNA or RNA strand that passes through the nanopore. Whereas short-read sequencing technologies such as Illumina require chemical modification or PCR amplification, Nanopore technology is capable of sequencing DNA or RNA without these additional steps, making it a third-generation sequencing technology (Bharagava et al., 2019).\n\nPacBio sequencing, also known as SMRT (single-molecule, realtime) sequencing, was introduced in 2010 and generates full-length cDNA sequences (i.e., long reads) that characterize transcripts of targeted genes or across entire transcriptomes. Long reads generated by PacBio are accurate at the scale of a single molecule because they are generated by a process of circular consensus sequencing, in which the same cDNA is effectively read many times (Eid et al., 2009;Vierra et al., 2021). The comparatively high sensitivity of PacBio can be limited by external factors. For example, PacBio can produce full-length cDNA during the library preparation step; however, it can only generate high-quality reads if the target cDNA is short enough to be sequenced in multiple passes.\n\nEach sequencing technology has inherent advantages and limitations, so no technology is best suited for all types of RNA-seq analysis (Box 1).

Mangul\n## Abstract\nRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become an exemplary technology in modern biology and clinical science. Its immense popularity is due in large part to the continuous efforts of the bioinformatics community to develop accurate and scalable computational tools to analyze the enormous amounts of transcriptomic data that it produces. RNA-seq analysis enables genes and their corresponding transcripts to be probed for a variety of purposes, such as detecting novel exons or whole transcripts, assessing expression of genes and alternative transcripts, and studying alternative splicing structure. It can be a challenge, however, to obtain meaningful biological signals from raw RNA-seq data because of the enormous scale of the data as well as the inherent limitations of different sequencing technologies, such as amplification bias or biases of library preparation. The need to overcome these technical challenges has pushed the rapid development of novel computational tools, which have evolved and diversified in accordance with technological advancements, leading to the current myriad of RNA-seq tools. These tools, combined with the diverse computational skill sets of biomedical researchers, help to unlock the full potential of RNA-seq. The purpose of this review is to explain basic concepts in the computational analysis of RNA-seq data and define discipline-specific jargon.\n## High-throughput RNA-seq technologies\nNA fragments can be simultaneously determined in parallel using the Illumina platform, giving rise to higher sequencing throughput compared with other sequencing platforms (Morganti et al., 2019;Workflows for RNA Sequencing, 2023).\n\nNanopore sequencing, which serves as the basis for the MinION, GridIOn, and PromethION platforms, was first introduced in 2014 by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Nanopore sequencing can produce short or long reads from native DNA and RNA fragments of any length. Nanopores are very small holes in a membrane that can be created by pore-forming proteins or by non-biological means. The Nanopore sequencing method simultaneously sends an ionic current and a single strand of DNA or RNA through a nanopore. As the ionic current passes through each nucleotide that successively occupies the nanopore, it undergoes disruptions that are unique to the nitrogenous base. The patterns of disruption in the current can be interpreted to identify each base in the DNA or RNA strand that passes through the nanopore. Whereas short-read sequencing technologies such as Illumina require chemical modification or PCR amplification, Nanopore technology is capable of sequencing DNA or RNA without these additional steps, making it a third-generation sequencing technology (Bharagava et al., 2019).\n\nPacBio sequencing, also known as SMRT (single-molecule, realtime) sequencing, was introduced in 2010 and generates full-length cDNA sequences (i.e., long reads) that characterize transcripts of targeted genes or across entire transcriptomes. Long reads generated by PacBio are accurate at the scale of a single molecule because they are generated by a process of circular consensus sequencing, in which the same cDNA is effectively read many times (Eid et al., 2009;Vierra et al., 2021). The comparatively high sensitivity of PacBio can be limited by external factors. For example, PacBio can produce full-length cDNA during the library preparation step; however, it can only generate high-quality reads if the target cDNA is short enough to be sequenced in multiple passes.\n\nEach sequencing technology has inherent advantages and limitations, so no technology is best suited for all types of RNA-seq analysis (Box 1). Short-read technologies can generate data with a lower error rate and higher throughput than",

DNA metabarcoding of bulk samples is increasingly being implemented in ecosystem assessments and is more cost\u2010efficient and less time\u2010consuming than monitoring based on morphology. However, before raw sequences are obtained from bulk samples, a profound number of methodological choices must be made. Here, we critically review the recent methods used for metabarcoding of marine bulk samples (including benthic, plankton and diet samples) and indicate how potential biases can be introduced throughout sampling, preprocessing, DNA extraction, marker and primer selection, PCR amplification and sequencing. From a total of 64 studies evaluated, our recommendations for best practices include to (a) consider DESS as a fixative instead of ethanol, (b) use the DNeasy PowerSoil kit for any samples containing traces of sediment, (c) not limit the marker selection to COI only, but preferably include multiple markers for higher taxonomic resolution, (d) avoid touchdown PCR profiles, (e) use a fixed annealing temperature for each primer pair when comparing across studies or institutes, (f) use a minimum of three PCR replicates, and (g) include both negative and positive controls. Although the implementation of DNA metabarcoding still faces several technical complexities, we foresee wide\u2010ranging advances in the near future, including improved bioinformatics for taxonomic assignment, sequencing of longer fragments and the use of whole\u2010genome information. Despite the bulk of biases involved in metabarcoding of bulk samples, if appropriate controls are included along the data generation process, it is clear that DNA metabarcoding provides a valuable tool in ecosystem assessments.",

The PacBio platform allows for obtaining longer reads, such as the 658-bp COI Folmer fragment and beyond (Hebert et al., 2018). Very recently, nanopore sequencing using the Oxford sequencing technology has also become an interesting alternative sequencing platform. In contrast to the widely used Illumina sequencing platforms, nanopore sequencing is able to sequence DNA molecules of any length, and as such it can provide a better resolution as longer fragments can be analysed (Johnson et al., 2019). This would allow for the use of a complete 18S marker, or an amplicon combining both 12S and 16S as a single marker. \n\nObviously, for this to be efficient, primer pairs need to be developed that can cover such longer fragments. Compared to Illumina sequencing, the PacBio and Oxford Nanopore platforms both have a lower raw read accuracy. However, this lower read accuracy can be overcome by the longer fragment length, or by using bioinformatics approaches that generate a consensus sequence from multiple raw reads (Nijland et al, in prep).",

Nijland\n## Abstract\nWith the growing anthropogenic pressure on marine ecosystems, the need for efficient monitoring of biodiversity grows stronger. DNA metabarcoding of bulk samples is increasingly being implemented in ecosystem assessments and is more cost\u2010efficient and less time\u2010consuming than monitoring based on morphology. However, before raw sequences are obtained from bulk samples, a profound number of methodological choices must be made. Here, we critically review the recent methods used for metabarcoding of marine bulk samples (including benthic, plankton and diet samples) and indicate how potential biases can be introduced throughout sampling, preprocessing, DNA extraction, marker and primer selection, PCR amplification and sequencing. From a total of 64 studies evaluated, our recommendations for best practices include to (a) consider DESS as a fixative instead of ethanol, (b) use the DNeasy PowerSoil kit for any samples containing traces of sediment, (c) not limit the marker selection to COI only, but preferably include multiple markers for higher taxonomic resolution, (d) avoid touchdown PCR profiles, (e) use a fixed annealing temperature for each primer pair when comparing across studies or institutes, (f) use a minimum of three PCR replicates, and (g) include both negative and positive controls. Although the implementation of DNA metabarcoding still faces several technical complexities, we foresee wide\u2010ranging advances in the near future, including improved bioinformatics for taxonomic assignment, sequencing of longer fragments and the use of whole\u2010genome information. Despite the bulk of biases involved in metabarcoding of bulk samples, if appropriate controls are included along the data generation process, it is clear that DNA metabarcoding provides a valuable tool in ecosystem assessments.\n## | Sequencing\nThus, simply raising the sequencing depth to high levels comes at the cost of accurately characterizing the diversity and requires adjusting the bioinformatic processing to the correct level of sequencing depth. \n\nAlthough widely used, the above-mentioned platforms have a limited read length and, associated with that, a limited taxonomic resolving power. The PacBio platform allows for obtaining longer reads, such as the 658-bp COI Folmer fragment and beyond (Hebert et al., 2018). Very recently, nanopore sequencing using the Oxford sequencing technology has also become an interesting alternative sequencing platform. In contrast to the widely used Illumina sequencing platforms, nanopore sequencing is able to sequence DNA molecules of any length, and as such it can provide a better resolution as longer fragments can be analysed (Johnson et al., 2019). This would allow for the use of a complete 18S marker, or an amplicon combining both 12S and 16S as a single marker. \n\nObviously, for this to be efficient, primer pairs need to be developed that can cover such longer fragments. Compared to Illumina sequencing, the PacBio and Oxford Nanopore platforms both have a lower raw read accuracy. However, this lower read accuracy can be overcome by the longer fragment length, or by using bioinformatics approaches that generate a consensus sequence from multiple raw reads (Nijland et al, in prep).",

However, the current NGS methods employed for sequencing phage display libraries are limited by the short contiguous read lengths associated with second-generation sequencing platforms. Consequently, the identification of antibody sequences has conventionally been restricted to individual antibody domains or to the analysis of single domain binding moieties such as camelid VHH or cartilaginous fish IgNAR antibodies. In this study, we report the application of third-generation sequencing to address this limitation. We used single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing coupled with hairpin adaptor loop ligation to facilitate the accurate interrogation of full-length single-chain Fv (scFv) libraries. Our method facilitated the rapid isolation and testing of scFv antibodies enriched from phage display libraries within days following panning. Two libraries against CD160 and CD123 were panned and monitored by NGS. Analysis of NGS antibody data sets led to the isolation of several functional scFv antibodies that were not identified by conventional panning and screening strategies. Our approach, which combines phage display selection of immune libraries with the full-length interrogation of scFv fragments, is an easy method to discover functional antibodies, with a range of affinities and biophysical characteristics.",

Though metagenomic short-read sequencing has greatly improved our virus ecology toolkit\u2014 and revealed many critical ecosystem roles for viruses \u2014 microdiverse populations and fine-scale genomic traits are missed. Some of these microdiverse populations are abundant and the missed regions may be of interest for identifying selection pressures that underpin evolutionary constraints associated with hosts and environments. Though long-read sequencing promises complete virus genomes on single reads, it currently suffers from high DNA requirements and sequencing errors that limit accurate gene prediction. Here we introduce VirION2, an integrated short- and long-read metagenomic wet-lab and informatics pipeline that updates our previous method (VirION) to further enhance the utility of long-read viral metagenomics. Using a viral mock community, we first optimized laboratory protocols (polymerase choice, DNA shearing size, PCR cycling) to enable 76% longer reads (now median length of 6,965 bp) from 100-fold less input DNA (now 1 nanogram). Using a virome from a natural seawater sample, we compared viromes generated with VirION2 against other library preparation options (unamplified, original VirION, and short-read), and optimized downstream informatics for improved long-read error correction and assembly. VirION2 assemblies combined with short-read based data (\u2018enhanced\u2019viromes), provided significant improvements over VirION libraries in the recovery of longer and more complete viral genomes, and our optimized error-correction strategy using long- and short-read data achieved 99.97% accuracy. In the seawater virome, VirION2 assemblies captured 5,161 viral populations (including all of the virus populations observed in the other assemblies), 30% of which were uniquely assembled through inclusion of long-reads, and 22% of the top 10% most abundant virus populations derived from assembly of long-reads. Viral populations unique to VirION2 assemblies had significantly higher microdiversity, which may explain why short-read virome approaches failed to capture them. These findings suggest the VirION2 sample prep and workflow (updated at protocols.io) can help researchers better investigate the virosphere, even from challenging low-biomass samples. Our new protocols are available to the research community on protocols.io as a \u2018living document\u2019 to facilitate dissemination of updates to keep pace with the rapid evolution of long read sequencing technology. Taken together, the addition of long-reads uniquely enabled the recovery of 22% of the most abundant viruses\u2014that would have been missed in short-read only assemblies.",

Here we introduce VirION2, an integrated short- and long-read metagenomic wet-lab and informatics pipeline that updates our previous method (VirION) to further enhance the utility of long-read viral metagenomics. Using a viral mock community, we first optimized laboratory protocols (polymerase choice, DNA shearing size, PCR cycling) to enable 76% longer reads (now median length of 6,965 bp) from 100-fold less input DNA (now 1 nanogram). Using a virome from a natural seawater sample, we compared viromes generated with VirION2 against other library preparation options (unamplified, original VirION, and short-read), and optimized downstream informatics for improved long-read error correction and assembly. VirION2 assemblies combined with short-read based data (\u2018enhanced\u2019viromes), provided significant improvements over VirION libraries in the recovery of longer and more complete viral genomes, and our optimized error-correction strategy using long- and short-read data achieved 99.97% accuracy. In the seawater virome, VirION2 assemblies captured 5,161 viral populations (including all of the virus populations observed in the other assemblies), 30% of which were uniquely assembled through inclusion of long-reads, and 22% of the top 10% most abundant virus populations derived from assembly of long-reads. Viral populations unique to VirION2 assemblies had significantly higher microdiversity, which may explain why short-read virome approaches failed to capture them. These findings suggest the VirION2 sample prep and workflow (updated at protocols.io) can help researchers better investigate the virosphere, even from challenging low-biomass samples. Our new protocols are available to the research community on protocols.io as a \u2018living document\u2019 to facilitate dissemination of updates to keep pace with the rapid evolution of long read sequencing technology. Taken together, the addition of long-reads uniquely enabled the recovery of 22% of the most abundant viruses\u2014that would have been missed in short-read only assemblies.\n## Figure 1 Overview of wet lab optimization experiments and informatic benchmarking. (A)\nLaboratory optimization ('Experiment 1') in which a mock community of three phages was used to conduct three experiments aimed at producing longer reads from less input DNA. (B) Informatics benchmarking ('Experiment 2') in which a seawater virome was sequenced with short-reads (Illumina) and long-read sequencing (Oxford Nanopore). Three distinct long-read libraries were generated, error-corrected and assembled, and were compared to short-read assemblies to assess accuracy and assembly performance.\n\nFull-size DOI: 10.7717/peerj.11088/ fig-1",

Additionally, we amplify and sequence an aliquot of the unselected (na\u00efve) library to serve as a reference. We originally anticipated using already available translation software for the initial processing of our data, but found that the differences between the fastq files produced by the Illumina sequencer (already separated by barcode) and those of other deep sequencing systems (not yet separated by barcode) were not immediately compatible. Thus it became more expedient to facilitate processing and translation of the type of data files we had by writing our own code to take care of these steps and this was incorporated as part one of our software. We also sought to provide as much flexibility as possible in our software so that users could tailor it to their individual needs. Therefore, we made it possible to simply select that NEB libraries were used or to enter custom library settings, use peptides of any size, and include up to twenty screens using the GUI provided (or by mimicking our provided script, to include as many screens as desired).",

The application of genomics within the last 27 years has radically changed the way we understand the biology and evolution of these pathogens. In this review, we discuss how the short- (Illumina) and long-read (PacBio, Oxford Nanopore) sequencing technologies have shaped the discipline of bacterial pathogen genomics, in terms of fundamental research (i.e., evolution of pathogenicity), forensics, food safety, and routine clinical microbiology. We have mined and discuss some of the most prominent data/bioinformatics resources such as NCBI pathogens, PATRIC, and Pathogenwatch. Based on this mining, we present some of the most popular sequencing technologies, hybrid approaches, assemblers, and annotation pipelines. A small number of bacterial pathogens are of very high importance, and we also present the wealth of the genomic data for these species (i.e., which ones they are, the number of antimicrobial resistance genes per genome, the number of virulence factors). Finally, we discuss how this discipline will probably be transformed in the near future, especially by transitioning into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), thanks to long-read sequencing.",

These can achieve read length orders of magnitude higher than those produced by the short-read platforms. However, their initial error-rates were very high (10-15%) [20]. The latest PacBio Sequel IIe system generates reads of average length 10-15 kb, producing 500 Gb of data within 30 h of running [20]. The PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) can now generate high fidelity (HiFi) long-reads with an error-rate of less than 1% [21]. As a comparison, the Oxford Nanopore PromethION 48 generates reads with a maximum length of more than 4 Mb, producing 14 Tb of data within 72 h of running [20]. The new ONT R.10 chemistry allows for a mean consensus single molecule error-rate of less than 1%. These two technologies can sequence non-amplified input DNA, and tend to require simpler sequencing library preparation protocols that are quicker to perform (minimum time of 10 min for library construction) than those needed for short-read sequencing (several days) [22]. Oxford Nanopore devices are now also capable of displaying the generated sequence in real-time, enabling adaptive sampling of the reads being sequenced, in order to select (or reject) reads by their sequence properties as they transit through the nanopores. In addition, Oxford Nanopore devices have the advantage of being very portable, with a proven track record even in extreme environments such as the International Space Station [23]. However, current deficiencies in both base-calling accuracy and cost-efficiency, relative to short-read platforms, have meant that third-generation long-read sequencing has not yet overtaken short-read sequencing in popularity. \n\nThe relative strengths and weaknesses of the second-and third-generation sequencing technologies mean that one platform, or the other or even a hybrid approach, may be more suitable to a certain research project.",

Nikolaidis, A. Hesketh\n## Abstract\nThroughout the entirety of human history, bacterial pathogens have played an important role and even shaped the fate of civilizations. The application of genomics within the last 27 years has radically changed the way we understand the biology and evolution of these pathogens. In this review, we discuss how the short- (Illumina) and long-read (PacBio, Oxford Nanopore) sequencing technologies have shaped the discipline of bacterial pathogen genomics, in terms of fundamental research (i.e., evolution of pathogenicity), forensics, food safety, and routine clinical microbiology. We have mined and discuss some of the most prominent data/bioinformatics resources such as NCBI pathogens, PATRIC, and Pathogenwatch. Based on this mining, we present some of the most popular sequencing technologies, hybrid approaches, assemblers, and annotation pipelines. A small number of bacterial pathogens are of very high importance, and we also present the wealth of the genomic data for these species (i.e., which ones they are, the number of antimicrobial resistance genes per genome, the number of virulence factors). Finally, we discuss how this discipline will probably be transformed in the near future, especially by transitioning into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), thanks to long-read sequencing.\n## The Promise of Long-Read Sequencing Technologies and Hybrid Approaches\nOver the last decade, third-generation long-read sequencing technologies have emerged to address the limitations referred to above, most notably from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) [18] and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) [19]. These can achieve read length orders of magnitude higher than those produced by the short-read platforms. However, their initial error-rates were very high (10-15%) [20]. The latest PacBio Sequel IIe system generates reads of average length 10-15 kb, producing 500 Gb of data within 30 h of running [20]. The PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) can now generate high fidelity (HiFi) long-reads with an error-rate of less than 1% [21]. As a comparison, the Oxford Nanopore PromethION 48 generates reads with a maximum length of more than 4 Mb, producing 14 Tb of data within 72 h of running [20]. The new ONT R.10 chemistry allows for a mean consensus single molecule error-rate of less than 1%. These two technologies can sequence non-amplified input DNA, and tend to require simpler sequencing library preparation protocols that are quicker to perform (minimum time of 10 min for library construction) than those needed for short-read sequencing (several days) [22]. Oxford Nanopore devices are now also capable of displaying the generated sequence in real-time, enabling adaptive sampling of the reads being sequenced, in order to select (or reject) reads by their sequence properties as they transit through the nanopores. In addition, Oxford Nanopore devices have the advantage of being very portable, with a proven track record even in extreme environments such as the International Space Station [23]. However, current deficiencies in both base-calling accuracy and cost-efficiency, relative to short-read platforms, have meant that third-generation long-read sequencing has not yet overtaken short-read sequencing in popularity. \n\nThe relative strengths and weaknesses of the second-and third-generation sequencing technologies mean that one platform, or the other or even a hybrid approach, may be more suitable to a certain research project.\n...\nThe relative strengths and weaknesses of the second-and third-generation sequencing technologies mean that one platform, or the other or even a hybrid approach, may be more suitable to a certain research project.

Integrating highthroughput sequencing with computational approaches marks a pivotal advancement in antibody discovery, expanding the antibody space to explore. In this context, a major breakthrough has been the full-length sequencing of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) used in in vitro display libraries. However, few tools address the task of annotating the paired heavy and light chain variable domains (VH and VL), which is the primary advantage of full-scFv sequencing. To address this methodological gap, we introduce Seq2scFv, a novel open-source toolkit designed for analyzing in vitro display libraries from long-read sequencing platforms. Seq2scFv facilitates the identification and thorough characterization of V(D)J recombination in both VH and VL regions. In addition to providing annotated scFvs, translated sequences and numbered chains, Seq2scFv enables linker inference and characterization, sequence encoding with unique identifiers and quantification of identical sequences across selection rounds, thereby simplifying enrichment identification. With its versatile and standalone functionality, we anticipate that the implementation of Seq2scFv tools in antibody discovery pipelines will efficiently expedite the full characterization of display libraries and potentially facilitate the identification of high-affinity antibody candidates.",

                    "text": "6][7] Moreover, with the progress in high-throughput long-read sequencing, it is now possible to interrogate display libraries at an unparalleled depth coupled with unprecedented levels of detail. Indeed, sequencing of full-length scFv provides crucial VH-VL pairing information, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of each candidate's biophysical properties, germline gene usage, and structure. 3 While it's very unlikely to sequence 10,000 unique clones through clone picking alone, due to the overrepresentation of dominant clones, 31 NGS mining with Seq2scFv of phage display libraries generated by Nannini and colleagues (2020) 3 yielded more than 14,756 high-quality, fully annotated and validated unique scFv sequences. Notably, these libraries  were screened using a PacBio RS2 instrument, and new generation PacBio sequencers, such as the Sequel II, offer even greater accuracy and higher throughput, providing larger pools of scFvs to mine. \n\nAs the yield of full-length paired antibody data continues to increase, it is crucial for computational tools to keep pace and provide solutions for large-scale comprehensive characterization of scFvs. Seq2scFv addresses the challenges of characterizing both V-domains in a single read, by combining existing tools for the analysis of single domains (IgBLAST and AntPack) with custom scripts specifically developed to delimit and validate scFvs. Seq2scFv identified, characterized and validated 17,479 scFvs (representing 14,764 unique scFvs). The results, compiled in a single table, encapsulate the extensive characterization of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) with a wide array of attributes across several categories. This includes identifiers (such as amino acid and nucleotide SEGUIDs), sequence information (paired VH-VL sequences, scFv and linker start and end positions, translation frames, linker annotations), linker sequence evaluation, quality flags (indicating the validity and productivity of the sequences), and specific annotations for heavy and light chains (covering gene loci, stop codons, frameshifts, and germline alignments).",

R. Lykoskoufis, Ioannis Xenarios, Bulak Arpat\n## Abstract\nAntibodies have emerged as the leading class of biotherapeutics, yet traditional screening methods face significant time and resource challenges in identifying lead candidates. Integrating highthroughput sequencing with computational approaches marks a pivotal advancement in antibody discovery, expanding the antibody space to explore. In this context, a major breakthrough has been the full-length sequencing of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) used in in vitro display libraries. However, few tools address the task of annotating the paired heavy and light chain variable domains (VH and VL), which is the primary advantage of full-scFv sequencing. To address this methodological gap, we introduce Seq2scFv, a novel open-source toolkit designed for analyzing in vitro display libraries from long-read sequencing platforms. Seq2scFv facilitates the identification and thorough characterization of V(D)J recombination in both VH and VL regions. In addition to providing annotated scFvs, translated sequences and numbered chains, Seq2scFv enables linker inference and characterization, sequence encoding with unique identifiers and quantification of identical sequences across selection rounds, thereby simplifying enrichment identification. With its versatile and standalone functionality, we anticipate that the implementation of Seq2scFv tools in antibody discovery pipelines will efficiently expedite the full characterization of display libraries and potentially facilitate the identification of high-affinity antibody candidates.\n## Discussion\n6][7] Moreover, with the progress in high-throughput long-read sequencing, it is now possible to interrogate display libraries at an unparalleled depth coupled with unprecedented levels of detail. Indeed, sequencing of full-length scFv provides crucial VH-VL pairing information, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of each candidate's biophysical properties, germline gene usage, and structure. 3 While it's very unlikely to sequence 10,000 unique clones through clone picking alone, due to the overrepresentation of dominant clones, 31 NGS mining with Seq2scFv of phage display libraries generated by Nannini and colleagues (2020) 3 yielded more than 14,756 high-quality, fully annotated and validated unique scFv sequences. Notably, these libraries  were screened using a PacBio RS2 instrument, and new generation PacBio sequencers, such as the Sequel II, offer even greater accuracy and higher throughput, providing larger pools of scFvs to mine. \n\nAs the yield of full-length paired antibody data continues to increase, it is crucial for computational tools to keep pace and provide solutions for large-scale comprehensive characterization of scFvs. Seq2scFv addresses the challenges of characterizing both V-domains in a single read, by combining existing tools for the analysis of single domains (IgBLAST and AntPack) with custom scripts specifically developed to delimit and validate scFvs. Seq2scFv identified, characterized and validated 17,479 scFvs (representing 14,764 unique scFvs). The results, compiled in a single table, encapsulate the extensive characterization of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) with a wide array of attributes across several categories. This includes identifiers (such as amino acid and nucleotide SEGUIDs), sequence information (paired VH-VL sequences, scFv and linker start and end positions, translation frames, linker annotations), linker sequence evaluation, quality flags (indicating the validity and productivity of the sequences), and specific annotations for heavy and light chains (covering gene loci, stop codons, frameshifts, and germline alignments).",

                    "text": "The antibody display system includes the phage display, yeast display, bacterial surface display, and ribosome display [28][29][30]. Among these systems, a phage display antibody library is a collection of diverse antibody fragments genetically fused to coat proteins on the surface of bacteriophages, allowing for the display of a wide range of antibodies [31][32][33][34]. It serves as a versatile and widely used tool for engineering antibodies and drug discovery [35]. The diversity of the library plays a pivotal role in isolating antibodies with high specificity for a given target using phage display technology. In mammals, V(D)J recombination is a key process that contributes to the diversification of the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, which is capable of recognizing a wide range of antigens [36]. Additionally, random nucleotide deletions or insertions at the junction regions of gene segments contribute to the final diversity of the BCR repertoire [37]. For na\u00efve libraries constructed without any process of immunization, the theoretical diversity increases with the number of initially collected lymphocytes, enriching a more extensive range of potential binding specificities. Although it has been reported that a single donor is sufficient to produce a highly functional antibody library, recent studies of the B cell repertoire have suggested that individuals possess a unique immune system and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes [20,38]. Hence, multiple donors' blood samples are beneficial for expanding the antibody library's repertoire. Therefore, we assumed that the construction of phage display libraries using numerous lymphocytes collected from an increased number of different donors would enhance the diversity of the library, leading to the rapid discovery of diverse high-quality antibodies. \n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS), also known as high-throughput sequencing, is an emerging technology for rapidly sequencing DNA fragments in large-scale experiments [39]. In contrast to the traditional Sanger sequencing method, which has limitations, such as intensive labor, high cost, and the limited throughput of the number of DNA types that can be decoded at once, this high-throughput capability is especially valuable for the characterization and assessment of the quality of antibody libraries [40,41].",

In this study, we constructed a phage display library comprising single-domain antibodies (sdAbs; or \u201cVHHs\u201d), known for their small size and remarkable stability, using a total of 1.6 \u00d7 109 lymphocytes collected from 20 different alpacas, resulting in approximately 7.16 \u00d7 1010 colonies. To assess the quality of the constructed library, next-generation sequencing-based high-throughput profiling was performed, analyzing approximately 5.65 \u00d7 106 full-length VHH sequences, revealing 92% uniqueness and confirming the library\u2019s diverse composition. Systematic characterization of the library revealed multiple sdAbs with high affinity for three therapeutically relevant antigens. In conclusion, our alpaca sdAb phage display library provides a versatile resource for diagnostics and therapeutics. Furthermore, the library\u2019s vast natural VHH antibody repertoire offers insights for generating humanized synthetic sdAb libraries, further advancing sdAb-based therapeutics.\n## Introduction\nThe antibody display system includes the phage display, yeast display, bacterial surface display, and ribosome display [28][29][30]. Among these systems, a phage display antibody library is a collection of diverse antibody fragments genetically fused to coat proteins on the surface of bacteriophages, allowing for the display of a wide range of antibodies [31][32][33][34]. It serves as a versatile and widely used tool for engineering antibodies and drug discovery [35]. The diversity of the library plays a pivotal role in isolating antibodies with high specificity for a given target using phage display technology. In mammals, V(D)J recombination is a key process that contributes to the diversification of the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, which is capable of recognizing a wide range of antigens [36]. Additionally, random nucleotide deletions or insertions at the junction regions of gene segments contribute to the final diversity of the BCR repertoire [37]. For na\u00efve libraries constructed without any process of immunization, the theoretical diversity increases with the number of initially collected lymphocytes, enriching a more extensive range of potential binding specificities. Although it has been reported that a single donor is sufficient to produce a highly functional antibody library, recent studies of the B cell repertoire have suggested that individuals possess a unique immune system and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes [20,38]. Hence, multiple donors' blood samples are beneficial for expanding the antibody library's repertoire. Therefore, we assumed that the construction of phage display libraries using numerous lymphocytes collected from an increased number of different donors would enhance the diversity of the library, leading to the rapid discovery of diverse high-quality antibodies. \n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS), also known as high-throughput sequencing, is an emerging technology for rapidly sequencing DNA fragments in large-scale experiments [39]. In contrast to the traditional Sanger sequencing method, which has limitations, such as intensive labor, high cost, and the limited throughput of the number of DNA types that can be decoded at once, this high-throughput capability is especially valuable for the characterization and assessment of the quality of antibody libraries [40,41].",

To overcome the limitations, we developed a new high-throughput platform for the identification and retrieval of clones in the library, TrueRepertoire\u2122. TrueRepertoire\u2122 provides highly accurate sequences of the clones with linkage information between heavy and light chains of the antibody fragment. Additionally, the physical DNA of clones can be retrieved in high throughput based on the sequence information. We validated the high accuracy of the sequences and demonstrated that there is no platform-specific bias. Moreover, the applicability of TrueRepertoire\u2122 was demonstrated by a phage-displayed single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library targeting human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) protein.",

Also, clones with high binding activity to a target antigen can exist in a rare population in a library, due to the bias that results from the biopanning. 9 This was shown in our previous research, where certain rare clones in a library were retrieved and confirmed to have binding activity to a target antigen. 10 Thus, to retrieve these rare clones and exploit them, in-depth analysis of an antibody library is essential.\n\nImproving throughput enables in-depth analysis of a library because sampling depth is increased. Conventionally, in vitro screening has been used to identify and retrieve clones in a phage display library. 11 Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was introduced to improve the screening process in terms of sampling depth. 10,12,13 However, the two existing methodologies, in vitro screening and the NGS-based process, still have several technical limitations in identifying and retrieving rare clones in the library in high throughput. For in vitro screening, colony picking used for clone isolation is throughput-limited due to its labor intensiveness, unless a picking machine is used. Even when a picking machine is used, an additional cost for its operation is incurred, and a risk of cross-contamination still exists. Additionally, Sanger sequencing used in the genotyping step has throughput limitations derived from its laborious preparation step and high cost. Moreover, the process of genotyping after phenotyping causes the phenotype test to overlap with the same clones, which dramatically reduces the screening efficiency. Due to the low throughput and the limitations associated with the phenotypic screening capacity, few clones are identified and retrieved in most cases. 3,14,15 To overcome these limitations, methods using NGS were introduced. Through high-throughput sequencing of a phage display library by NGS, high-resolution information about the composition of phage display libraries could be obtained. Based on the high-resolution information, rare clones in the libraries can be detected and confirmed to have binding activity toward the target antigens. Additionally, the change in the order of the process, from genotyping after phenotyping to phenotyping after genotyping, eliminated the loss of screening capacity",

However, existing methods have several technical limitations such as low process throughput from laborious cloning process and waste of the phenotypic screening capacity from unnecessary repetitive tests on the dominant clones. To overcome the limitations, we developed a new high-throughput platform for the identification and retrieval of clones in the library, TrueRepertoire\u2122. TrueRepertoire\u2122 provides highly accurate sequences of the clones with linkage information between heavy and light chains of the antibody fragment. Additionally, the physical DNA of clones can be retrieved in high throughput based on the sequence information. We validated the high accuracy of the sequences and demonstrated that there is no platform-specific bias. Moreover, the applicability of TrueRepertoire\u2122 was demonstrated by a phage-displayed single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library targeting human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) protein.\n## Introduction\npool of clones relatively homogeneous. Clones with prominent properties can exist in rare populations, but can be lost due to technical limitations. Also, clones with high binding activity to a target antigen can exist in a rare population in a library, due to the bias that results from the biopanning. 9 This was shown in our previous research, where certain rare clones in a library were retrieved and confirmed to have binding activity to a target antigen. 10 Thus, to retrieve these rare clones and exploit them, in-depth analysis of an antibody library is essential.\n\nImproving throughput enables in-depth analysis of a library because sampling depth is increased. Conventionally, in vitro screening has been used to identify and retrieve clones in a phage display library. 11 Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was introduced to improve the screening process in terms of sampling depth. 10,12,13 However, the two existing methodologies, in vitro screening and the NGS-based process, still have several technical limitations in identifying and retrieving rare clones in the library in high throughput. For in vitro screening, colony picking used for clone isolation is throughput-limited due to its labor intensiveness, unless a picking machine is used. Even when a picking machine is used, an additional cost for its operation is incurred, and a risk of cross-contamination still exists. Additionally, Sanger sequencing used in the genotyping step has throughput limitations derived from its laborious preparation step and high cost. Moreover, the process of genotyping after phenotyping causes the phenotype test to overlap with the same clones, which dramatically reduces the screening efficiency. Due to the low throughput and the limitations associated with the phenotypic screening capacity, few clones are identified and retrieved in most cases. 3,14,15 To overcome these limitations, methods using NGS were introduced. Through high-throughput sequencing of a phage display library by NGS, high-resolution information about the composition of phage display libraries could be obtained. Based on the high-resolution information, rare clones in the libraries can be detected and confirmed to have binding activity toward the target antigens. Additionally, the change in the order of the process, from genotyping after phenotyping to phenotyping after genotyping, eliminated the loss of screening capacity",

Our work provides insights into the limitations of lower throughput NGS. Compared to the traditional approach of Sanger sequencing, high-throughput sequencing strategies yield more valuable data on the compositional analysis of peptide pools. However, phage display researchers should be aware of the drawbacks of NGS platforms with lower depth, and the influence they might have on the analysis of phage display data. Lower sequencing depth can bear misleading information about the quality of unselected libraries and composition of biopanning outputs, which has substantial potential to misdirect further characterization of the in vitro selected peptides and final interpretations of phage display selection studies. We, therefore, recommend that phage display researchers thoroughly evaluate their experimental setup and draw particular attention to the constraints of the selected sequencing depth.",

            "text": "Peptide phage display relies on the identification of genuine target binders in the recovered phages obtained from biopanning. Analysis of the exact composition of phage display peptide libraries plays a valuable role in the discovery of ligands with strong binding affinities to different biological targets [21]. To achieve this purpose, a sequencing platform capable of rigorous characterization of the composition and diversity of the peptide pool is crucial. High-throughput sequencing has been found to be suited for the analysis of the sequence composition and inherent diversity of phage display libraries [20,31]. In the current work, we made a side-by-side comparison of the capacity of two NGS platforms with different depths of sequencing in characterizing the composition and diversity of a phage display peptide library. Rodi et al. introduced two concepts to define the library diversity: Technical diversity (completeness) which corresponds to the percentage of possible members of the library existing at any absolute frequency and functional diversity which takes into consideration the absolute frequency of each distinct peptide in the library [24]. Consistent with this, Makowski and Soares proposed an analytical expression of the library diversity in which diversity is not only dependent on the number of peptides but also on the relative abundance of each peptide within the library [32]. Here, we used the number of unique sequences as a measure of library diversity. This definition is commonly used to refer to the observed diversity of phage display peptide libraries [16,19,[25][26][27][28][29][30]. Our data indicated that sequencing depth has a vital impact on the ability to characterize the diversity of the library (Table 1 and Figure 1). A comparison of the two NGS modalities with LTP (720,000 absolute cleaned reads on average) and HTP (5,470,000 absolute cleaned reads on average) showed that the HTP platform can identify a significantly higher number of unique peptide sequences (unique cleaned reads in Table 1), thus revealing a much larger diversity of the library. It is worth mentioning that detecting the full diversity of phage display peptide libraries exceeds the capacity of current NGS platforms. The theoretical diversity of a 12-mer phage display peptide library can reach 4.1 \u00d7 10 15 .",

            "text": "NGS allows researchers to analyze the composition of large peptide libraries on a deeper scale. This is valuable for monitoring, troubleshooting, and evaluating the design and construction of unselected na\u00efve libraries, gaining detailed insights into the impact of the selective pressure applied to the library, and obtaining a solid understanding of the evolution of peptide populations during library selection [15]. NGS has not only been performed on biopanning eluates [16][17][18] but has also been exploited to investigate unselected and amplified phage display libraries [13,14,[19][20][21]. A pivotal parameter for using NGS is the sequencing depth. Technically, depth (also referred to as depth of coverage) is defined as the number of times a given nucleotide has been read during the sequencing reaction [22]. In the context of peptide phage display, the depth of sequencing represents the number of reads that contain the displayed peptide-encoding sequence. Different factors influence the required depth of sequencing for the analysis of phage display peptide libraries. Nevertheless, the optimal sequencing depth is mainly dependent on the complexity of the peptide pool [13]. It is an accepted view that a higher sequencing depth provides a more representative coverage of the library and improves the accuracy by which the composition of the library can be characterized [23], thus leading to a more in-depth understanding of the library quality and the selection process. \n\nIn phage display experiments, the highest possible number of library members should be investigated. Hence, it is of particular importance to use a higher sequencing depth to characterize as much of the library diversity as possible as well as to evaluate the composition and quality of the library more accurately. Some statistical methods have been reported to measure the diversity of phage display peptide libraries [24]. These analyses have been conducted based on sampling a limited pool of the library by Sanger sequencing. Here, we used the number of unique sequences as an equivalent to diversity. The definition of diversity as the number of unique sequences is a commonly accepted idea in phage display literature [16,19,[25][26][27][28][29][30], motivated by increasing number of NGSbased phage display works in recent years which allow for sampling of a larger sequence space.",

            "text": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has raised a growing interest in phage display research. Sequencing depth is a pivotal parameter for using NGS. In the current study, we made a side-by-side comparison of two NGS platforms with different sequencing depths, denoted as lower-throughput (LTP) and higher-throughput (HTP). The capacity of these platforms for characterization of the composition, quality, and diversity of the unselected Ph.D.TM-12 Phage Display Peptide Library was investigated. Our results indicated that HTP sequencing detects a considerably higher number of unique sequences compared to the LTP platform, thus covering a broader diversity of the library. We found a larger percentage of singletons, a smaller percentage of repeated sequences, and a greater percentage of distinct sequences in the LTP datasets. These parameters suggest a higher library quality, resulting in potentially misleading information when using LTP sequencing for such assessment. Our observations showed that HTP reveals a broader distribution of peptide frequencies, thus revealing increased heterogeneity of the library by the HTP approach and offering a comparatively higher capacity for distinguishing peptides from each other. Our analyses suggested that LTP and HTP datasets show discrepancies in their peptide composition and position-specific distribution of amino acids within the library. Taken together, these findings lead us to the conclusion that a higher sequencing depth can yield more in-depth insights into the composition of the library and provide a more complete picture of the quality and diversity of phage display peptide libraries.",

            "text": "George P. Smith first developed phage display technology in 1985 [8], and the technology quickly advanced in the 1990s from peptide libraries [9] to recombinant antibody fragment libraries [10][11][12][13][14][15]. A major limitation of the traditional phage-panning platform is the laborious workflow and low throughput of obtaining antibody gene sequences relying on Sanger sequencing [16]. \n\nTo improve upon the traditional workflow and obtain a more diverse panel of sequences after panning, a commonly used next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform is MiSeq from Illumina. Paired-end MiSeq (2 \u00d7 300 bp) sequencing from Illumina covers segments of about 500 bp and has been successfully applied to the investigation of shorter antibody fragment libraries, such as nanobodies derived from the camelid's variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies [17,18], as well as the shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) [19]. Paired-end MiSeq can also read amplicons long enough to cover all CDRs in single-chain Fv (scFv) [20]. However, paired-end MiSeq is not sufficient to cover longer light and heavy chain-combined sequences (1.2-1.5 kb), which are linked together in Human Fab libraries [21,22]. \n\nThird-generation NGS technology such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) can bridge the shortcomings of current MiSeq sequencing [23], as it is possible to achieve long sequencing reads of 10 to 15 kb in length with single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) [24]. PacBio's NGS had been applied successfully to scFv fragment libraries [25,26]. In particular, Han et al. applied PacBio's platform to the deep sequencing of the immune rhesus macaque scFv phage library to identify additional unique antibody gene sequences previously not seen in their Sanger sequencing results [26]. \n\nIn this study, we used Bio-Rad's HuCAL PLATINUM Human Fab phage library with a diversity greater than 45 billion.",

            "text": "NGS technologies have been used in combination with phage display in a number of applications. 24,25 While NGS allows in-depth analysis of phage display libraries, its widespread use has been hampered by limitations in read length 26,27 and signal integrity 16 of several sequencing technologies. These limitations have meant that most sequencing applications have only covered a single variable domain within a library, showing the greatest utility in the sequencing of single domain antibody libraries. 28,29 Yang and colleagues recently described the use of phage display data obtained using MiSeq sequencing to isolate antibodies from scFv libraries that had undergone multiple rounds of panning. The data sets obtained had high sequence depth and allowed generation of antibodies against the target antigen of interest; however, a key limitation to the method was the use of limited read length within the sequencing data that required additional PCR amplification to retrieve the full sequence of the clones. 30 Here, we used the PacBio sequencing platform combined with SMRTbell technology to generate highly accurate full-length scFv sequence repertoires from immune libraries selected through conventional phage display biopanning targeting the cell surface antigens CD160 and CD123. Mining these two independent libraries enabled the identification of a large and diverse panel of high-quality antibodies.\n\nHemadou et al. demonstrated that the combination of SMRT sequencing with circular consensus adapter ligation allowed the identification of full-length scFvs from an enriched phage display library. By tracking a manually selected clone, they identified its presence in the top 100 of the pool of reads and they were able to determine an accuracy of >99.9% for complete sequences of inserts approaching 1,000 bp. Although this supports the robustness of the combinatorial method, it does not give insights on the functionality and diversity of the scFvs contained in the phage library. 13 Similarly, Han and colleagues used this approach to investigate phage display libraries that had shown high clonality using traditional screening methods and, although they identified several new clones, they did not investigate the specificity and functionality of the phage display-selected antibodies. 14 In our study, we used long-read sequencing to expand the screening of selected phage display libraries. This combination not only provides additional knowledge on the antibody repertoire of immunized animals but greatly enhances the screening power of",

Although current NGS platforms were not designed with antibody libraries in mind, the technologies are now at a stage where unique sequence insights into all stages of the selection process can be obtained. Moreover, with ongoing advances in sequencing technology, depth and read length is improving continuously: for instance, the PacBio Sequel system generates approximately seven times more sequences than the previous RS II system but maintains its long-read capability (Pacific Biosciences), while nanopore systems such as the MinIOn (Oxford Nanopore) offer the promise of real-time DNA sequencing in combination with ultra-long reads. We conclude that, with NGS technology evolving at a rapid pace, its importance in the sequence analyses of phage-and other antibody-display libraries is likely to continue to increase.",

            "text": "The definition of diversity as the number of unique sequences is a commonly accepted idea in phage display literature [16,19,[25][26][27][28][29][30], motivated by increasing number of NGSbased phage display works in recent years which allow for sampling of a larger sequence space. In the current study, we investigated the capacity of two sequencing depths (each on two different input volumes) of NGS to characterize the unselected Ph.D. TM -12 phage display peptide library. In a broad sense, low-throughput (LTP) sequencing refers to Sanger sequencing and high-throughput (HTP) sequencing refers to all the different types of NGS platforms. In this work, we denote LTP as the NGS platform with the lower throughput (MiSeq Reagent Kit v2) and HTP as the NGS platform with the higher throughput (NextSeq 500/550 Mid Output Kit v.2.5). The aim of the current study was to provide an evaluation of the impact of sequencing depth on the analysis of diversity, quality, and composition of an unselected phage display peptide library. Our findings indicated that a higher sequencing depth offers a more rigorous evaluation of the library diversity and quality, uncovers a more heterogeneous distribution of peptide frequencies, provides a comparatively higher capacity for the differentiation of peptide frequencies, and results in the detection of distinct amino acid and peptide compositions for the library compared to sequencing modality with the lower depth. Based on the results, we discuss how the sequencing depth can lead to different outcomes for the characteristics of the library, alter the direction of analyses, and make a major impact on the final conclusions drawn from phage display data.",

As 5% of the immunoglobulin repertoire in rodents expresses the lambda light chain, we have considered the kappa chain locus only. 31 We analyzed data from two immune libraries against CD160 and CD123 based on HCDR3 abundance within the enriched libraries, and selected clones either based on frequency or phylogenetic distance to allow the isolation of more diverse binders. An interesting observation was that not all clones enriched by phage display panning bound to target antigen, but we observed a success rate of 75% and 81% when we analyzed the most frequent clones prevalent after CD160 and CD123 selection, respectively. This strategy consists of conventional phage display biopanning followed by SMRT sequencing and open source NGS analysis to identify an expansive repertoire of antigen-specific antibody clones, with virtually no screening required. A disadvantage of the system deployed here, relative to second-generation systems such as the Illumina platform, is the far lower sequencing depth obtained. Typically yields of 80,000 reads for a 1 Kb sequence fragment can be generated, as compared to over 5 \u00d7 10 6 reads for Illumina Hiseq sequencing. Clearly, the read depths obtained in our experiments were insufficient to cover the theoretical diversity of a typical phage display library. It is possible to modify the sequencing protocol by sequencing the same prepared library on multiple SMRT cells of the sequencer. As library preparation and instrument run time are a substantial proportion of the sequencing cost, this approach could enable sequencing depth to be increased 10-fold with a modest increase in sequencing costs. For the purpose of this study and using an approach in which libraries are first enriched against target antigen, we surmise that depth of sequencing obtained in a single run is sufficient to sample our immune scFv phage display libraries, which typically have reduced diversity and clonal redundancy. This is clearly the case for libraries after multiple rounds of enrichment. However, for libraries on which limited enrichment have",

            "text": "The theoretical diversity of a 12-mer phage display peptide library can reach 4.1 \u00d7 10 15 . However, the maximum available diversity that can be experimentally achieved is 10 9 [33]. This is mainly caused by limitations in the transformation efficiency of E. coli cells. The available diversity is calculated by titration of amplified phages after electroporation of the library into the host bacterium. Our previous report indicated that the diversity of the library (used in the current work) can be even lower due to the presence of stop codons, frameshifts, and clones without insert in the na\u00efve library [20]. Consistent with this, the real diversity of phage display peptide libraries is expected to be within the range of 10 8 -10 9 . Given the restrictions of the current NGS platforms for determining the diversity of phage display peptide libraries, increased sequencing depth could provide a broader picture of the diversity and composition of the library. \n\nThe LTP datasets indicate that the library contains a bigger percentage of the singleton population compared to HTP datasets (Figure 1). Also, LTP sequencing indicates a greater percentage of distinct sequences (according to the information in Table 1). A larger percentage of singletons, a smaller percentage of repeated peptides, and a larger percentage of distinct sequences characterize a higher quality of the library [28]. Our data provide evidence for the fact that these parameters are extremely dependent on the sequencing depth since LTP datasets falsely indicate a higher quality that is not reflected in the HTP datasets even though the library is the same. Our observation is in line with the previous findings on the Ph.D. TM -7 library where different sequencing depths were applied and the percentage of distinct sequences was different (58 % in one study [13] and 81 % in another study [19]. Some of these differences can also be attributed to the biases that occur in the different steps of sample preparation for NGS. Consequently, relying on data from LTP sequencing can be misleading for the evaluation of the library quality. This highlights the pitfalls associated with applying Sanger sequencing for investigation of the library quality and analyzing the diversity of a representative pool of peptides after biopanning.",

            "text": "The paradigm-shifting development of hybridoma technology revolutionized the field of antibody production with the discovery of monoclonal antibodies [1].In 2022, six out of the fifteen best-selling pharmaceuticals were monoclonal antibodies (even more if COVID-19 vaccines are not considered); these figures illustrate the magnitude of the impact that these molecules have had in research and medicine [2].Subsequently, the advent of recombinant protein production techniques and the application of directed evolution methodologies have further transformed the antibody discovery landscape [3].\n\nPhage display technology stands as the most prominent methodology for the development of recombinant antibodies in the context of the directed evolution of proteins.This method is based on the construction of antibody libraries derived from diverse sources with high variability [4].A characteristic feature of these libraries is that the antibodies are expressed fused to the coat proteins of bacteriophages, which facilitates their affinity selection through successive rounds against the target antigen (biopanning) [5].\n\nTraditionally, monitoring of the panning procedure has been performed by colony picking and Sanger sequencing since the 1990s.However, while these methods can be automated for the screening of thousands of different colonies, they only cover a small amount of the clones implied in the process.This problem may be solved by using nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) techniques [6].The in-depth analysis of phage libraries by NGS has proven to be an exceptionally effective approach for clone identification, including rare low-frequency variants that may not amplify adequately within the phage population [7].Moreover, NGS has facilitated the identification and reconstruction of complementarity-determining region (CDR) combinations of antibody fragments from phage selection outputs [8].Beyond antibody libraries, this transformative technique extends its applicability to the study of peptide libraries, essential for epitope mapping of antibodies [9].\n\nOxford Nanopore Technology offers many advantages that have revolutionized the field of DNA sequencing and genomic analysis.Firstly, the portable and compact sequencing devices provide unprecedented flexibility, enabling real-time, in situ, and rapid DNA sequencing in diverse environments, including field research and clinical settings.Secondly, the sequencing technology can read exceptionally long DNA fragments, allowing for improved genome assembly and structural variant detection.",

Ion Torrent libraries were used on single 316 chips with 65 cycles generating mean read lengths of 112-124 bases in each run. PacBio sequencing was performed with an amplification-free workflow. The genome sequencing was done with SMRT DNA sequencing [80] using a PacBio RSII sequencer. Standard Pac-Bio libraries contained inserts with an average of 2 kb. The libraries were run individually over multiple SMRT cells using C1 chemistry. For each genome, \u226520x sequence coverage data was obtained (GATC, Konstanz, Germany).\n\nNanopore sequencing libraries were prepared with one \u03bcg genomic DNA using the 1d 2 kit (SQK-LSK308). DNA was not sheared before library preparation and was endrepaired and dA-tailed. An individual R9.5 flow-cell was used for each sample, providing \u226530x sequence coverage data for each genome. The technical specifications of the platform were summarized in Table 1.",

            "text": "Deep sequencing is now routinely used to evaluate the output of selections from phage display and other display constructs 12,[28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38] . However, the characterization of na\u00efve libraries by deep-sequencing has not been extensively conducted and is difficult for several reasons: (i) na\u00efve libraries cover a large sequence space and thus contain a large number of low-copy-number reads; (ii) if libraries are constructed to have complete sequence coverage, then every sequence in such a library would be within Hamming distance (h = 1) of several sequences in the same library. (The Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions where the corresponding symbols are different: For example, two sequences GATTACA and CATTACA are separated by one substitution, and the Hamming distance between them is 1, h = 1). Unfortunately, point mutations caused by sequencing and PCR errors give rise to sequences within h = 1 and these mistakes cannot be distinguished from true reads; (iii) systematic biases imposed by improper sequencing methods or analysis can lead to the severe inflation or deflation of library diversity 39 . Similar problems have often been encountered in the evaluation of metagenomes and bacterial populations 40 . The concept of a \"species\" in metagenomic analysis is similar to the concept of \"unique sequences\" in peptide libraries. For example, the number of \"species\" reported in early metagenomic studies was grossly overestimated, compared to when the same samples were re-sequenced and analyzed with higher scrutiny and fidelity 41 . Techniques such as Primer ID 42 have been developed in metagenomic studies to detect false \"species\" (i.e., sequence differences) that arise from errors in sample preparation and processing. Here, we applied the same technique in the analysis of phage libraries. \n\nThe majority of display platforms operate with libraries of 10 9 or higher diversity, but this level of diversity cannot be effectively covered using currently available sequencing tools.",

Methods We conducted three rounds of duplicate serial amplification of two different lots of the Ph.D.\u2122-12 phage display library. DNA from the samples was subjected to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) using an Illumina platform. The NGS datasets underwent a variety of bioinformatic analyses using Python and MATLAB scripts. Results We observed substantial heterogeneity in the sequence composition of the two lots indicated by differences in the enhanced percentage of wildtype clones, reduced diversity (number of unique sequences), and increased enrichment factors (EFs) during amplification as well as by observing no common sequence between lots and decreased number of common sequences between the na\u00efve library and the consecutive rounds of amplification for each lot. We also found potential propagation-related target-unrelated peptides (TUPs) with the highest EFs in the two lots, which were displayed by the fastest-propagating phage clones. Furthermore, motif analysis of the most enriched subpopulation of amplified libraries led to the identification of some motifs hypothesized to contribute to the increased amplification rates of the respective phage clones. Conclusion Our results highlight tremendous heterogeneity in the peptide composition of different lots of the same type of na\u00efve phage display library, and the divergent evolution of their compositional features during amplification rounds at the amino acid, peptide, and motif levels. Our findings can be instrumental for phage display researchers by bringing fundamental insights into the vast extent of non-uniformity between phage display libraries and by providing a clear picture of how these discrepancies can lead to different evolutionary fates for the peptide composition of phage pools, which can have profound impacts on the outcome of phage display selections through biopanning.

Targeted RNA libraries for AGLR2, ROCR2, ROCR3 were also sequenced with Nanopore and/or PacBio long-read sequencing, following previously published protocols 21,50 (Fig. 1b). Whole transcriptome RNA libraries were prepared with four methods: 1) rRNA depletion and 2) poly(A) selection libraries were sequenced with Illumina short-read sequencing, 3) PacBio WTS libraries were sequenced with the PacBio long-read sequencing, and 4) Nanopore Direct RNA libraries were sequenced with Nanopore long-read sequencing (Fig. 1b). Four DNA library replicates were made for Sample A, Sample C (or Sample D for panel ROCR1 instead), and Sample B, for each of the four panels, and four short-read RNA-seq library replicates were made for Samples A, B, C, D, and E, for each of the eight panels (Fig. 1c). Targeted RNA libraries were also made with three panels for Sample A, B, and C, after which each library was split into fractions (F1, F1 + 2, or F3) of different cDNA fragment length distributions. Fractions F1, F1 + 2, and F3 had incrementally greater median fragment lengths. The captured cDNA products were checked on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to confirm their quality and length distribution. In general, the sequencing reads exhibited read length distributions similar to those measured by Bioanalyzer, and PacBio reads were generally longer than Nanopore reads for the same cDNA products. Fractions F1 and F3 for panels ROCR3 and AGLR2 were sequenced with both Nanopore and PacBio longread sequencing platforms, while F1 and F1 + 2 for panel ROCR2 were sequenced with the Nanopore long-read sequencing platform only (Fig. 1d).",

            "text": "Background The newest generation of DNA sequencing technology is highlighted by the ability to sequence reads hundreds of kilobases in length, and the increased availability of long read data has democratized the genome sequencing and assembly process. PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have pioneered competitive long read platforms, with more recent work focused on improving sequencing throughput and per-base accuracy. Released in 2019, the PacBio Sequel II platform advertises substantial enhancements over previous PacBio systems. Results We used whole-genome sequencing data produced by two PacBio platforms (Sequel II and RS II) and two ONT protocols (Rapid Sequencing and Ligation Sequencing) to compare assemblies of the bacteria Escherichia coli and the fruit fly Drosophila ananassae. Sequel II assemblies had higher contiguity and consensus accuracy relative to other methods, even after accounting for differences in sequencing throughput. ONT RAPID libraries had the fewest chimeric reads in addition to superior quantification of E. coli plasmids versus ligation-based libraries. The quality of assemblies can be enhanced by adopting hybrid approaches using Illumina libraries for bacterial genome assemblies or combined ONT and Sequel II libraries for eukaryotic genome assemblies. Genome-wide DNA methylation could be detected using both technologies, however ONT libraries enabled the identification of a broader range of known E. coli methyltransferase recognition motifs in addition to undocumented D. ananassae motifs. Conclusions The ideal choice of long read technology may depend on several factors including the question or hypothesis under examination. No single technology outperformed others in all metrics examined.",

The PacBio platform allows for obtaining longer reads, such as the 658-bp COI Folmer fragment and beyond (Hebert et al., 2018). Very recently, nanopore sequencing using the Oxford sequencing technology has also become an interesting alternative sequencing platform. In contrast to the widely used Illumina sequencing platforms, nanopore sequencing is able to sequence DNA molecules of any length, and as such it can provide a better resolution as longer fragments can be analysed (Johnson et al., 2019). This would allow for the use of a complete 18S marker, or an amplicon combining both 12S and 16S as a single marker. \n\nObviously, for this to be efficient, primer pairs need to be developed that can cover such longer fragments. Compared to Illumina sequencing, the PacBio and Oxford Nanopore platforms both have a lower raw read accuracy. However, this lower read accuracy can be overcome by the longer fragment length, or by using bioinformatics approaches that generate a consensus sequence from multiple raw reads (Nijland et al, in prep).",

            "text": "Next-generation sequencing using 454 or Illumina technologies is powerful in covering the totality of the metasecretome library inserts. However, due to the short lengths of templates required for these sequencing technologies and a PCR amplification step that is necessary in order to produce the sequencing library, sequence information is disconnected from the physical recombinant clones from which it was derived (Ciric et al., 2014), making it impossible to form a clone library without the standard Sanger sequencing. This issue, however, can be overcome by using novel sequencing technologies, like PACBio, which use long templates (Fichot and Norman, 2013;Wang et al., 2015) and could, in principle, be used in an approach that would allow tracking of a sequence to the template. This approach for sequencing could be combined with subtractive or normalization methods to enrich the library for the rare recombinant sequences (Gagic et al., 2015), and to build a balanced metasecretome clone bank that can be used as a resource for expression and purification of large number of secretome proteins from a microbial community, by virtue of their display on PPs. \n\nA shot-gun metagenomic phage display libraries in Ff and T7 have potential to provide the widest possible coverage of SecYEG-dependent and -independent secretome proteins for affinity selection against complex or simple targets of interest to identify adhesins, secreted virulence factors or enzymes, whereas the metasecretome libraries provide a good source of data for large scale identification of immunogenic peptides. Amenability of phage display to large-scale, highthroughput screening using NGS and emerging phage display-based methods for enrichment of target genes in metagenomes, indicate that this is just a beginning of wider use of phage display to accelerate target gene discovery in metagenomics.",

Genome sequencing was performed using Illumina short-read and nanopore long-read sequencing as previously described [41][42][43]. We performed Illumina sequencing using the NextSeq 500 platform at the Australian Centre for Ecogenomics (University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia). DNA libraries were prepared with the Nextera XT Library Preparation Kit and indexed with the Nextera XT Index Kit (both from Illumina). Sequencing generated 150 bp paired-end reads. The Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing libraries were prepared using 400-600 ng of genomic DNA, according to the rapid barcoding sequencing kit (catalogue number SQK-RBK004, 12 barcodes mixed in equal volume) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The entire library was loaded onto an R9.4 flow cell and run on a MinION device for approximately 48 h (using MinKNOW v1.10.16). The reads generated from the MinION sequencing run were basecalled and binned using the ONT Guppy basecalling suite v3.1.5 -Guppy basecaller and Guppy barcoder, respectively. Further details of methods including nanopore read quality control, Illumina read quality control and genome assembly are available in the Supplementary Materials.",

Native barcoding of end-primed samples was carried out with EXP-NBD104(ONT). Finally, the equimolar concentration of the barcode sample was ligated with a sequencing adaptor, purified with AMPure beads, and eluted in 15 \u03bcL of elution buffer. Raw reads obtained from Illumina and nanopore sequencing were de-multiplexed using Bcl2Fastq software v2.20 1 and guppy-v2.3.4  (Wick et al., 2019), respectively. Trimgalore-v0.4.02 tool and Commander v2.0.203 were used in Illumina sequencing, and Porechop-v0.2.34 and Nanofilt-v2.8.0 5 were used in Nanopore sequencing for trimming the raw reads and to assess their quality. The long read obtained from Nanopore sequencing and the short read obtained from Illumina were assembled using Unicycler v0.4.8. A hybrid sequencing approach was carried out for de novo assembly.

            "text": "The selection of any of the above mentioned platforms, however, should be mainly dependent on the aim, design, and purpose of the study. Illumina sequencing technology has made tremendous advances in data output and cost efficiency over the past few years and as a result, presently dominates the NGS market (129,130). Illumina sequencing technology has been used extensively in numerous microbiome research projects (131)(132)(133), including the Human Microbiome Project (44). While both Ion Torrent and Illumina sequencers provide a number of advantages in terms of their cost and efficiency, the short read lengths they provide make them less appropriate for addressing a number of scientific questions, including detection of gene isoforms, methylation detection, and genome assembly (118). SMRT (single-molecule real-time) sequencing platforms offer approaches that are more suited for these research objectives. Since PacBiosequencing generates longer reads that provide longer scaffolds (134)(135)(136), it is well suited for denovo genome assembly. The commercial availability of MinION sequencers by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which resemble a USB flash drive in appearance, has also enabled applications that require long-read sequencing (137,138). The efficiency, long read lengths, and single-base sensitivity make nanopore sequencing technology a promising approach for highthroughput sequencing. The MinION system has been used for sequencing the genomes of infectious agents, including the analysis of bacterial antibiotic resistance islands (137), the influenza virus (139) and genome surveillance of the Ebola virus (140). The advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies now provide the opportunity to choose different sequencing platforms to conduct microbiome research. In a comparative analysis of the Illumina MiSeq, Ion Torrent PGM, and 454 GS Junior sequencing platforms, Loman et al. (141) reported that Illumina provided the highest output per run",

            "text": "against target antigen, we surmise that depth of sequencing obtained in a single run is sufficient to sample our immune scFv phage display libraries, which typically have reduced diversity and clonal redundancy. This is clearly the case for libraries after multiple rounds of enrichment. However, for libraries on which limited enrichment have been performed or where a broader view of an immune repertoire is desired, the depth of sequencing may become limiting.\n\nIncreasingly, antibody discovery has become a high throughput empiric endeavor. Antibodies with desired properties, such as receptor agonism or the appropriate binding kinetics, within a population may be rare. Thus, it is often necessary to sample highly diverse populations in order to obtain the antibody of interest. Our library sequencing approach allows the isolation of large numbers of antibodies that have been affinity matured in-vivo and are thus likely to retain excellent specificity and biophysical properties. 32 Single cell screening technologies such as SLAM 33 and microfluidic-based 34 platforms similarly offer an excellent source of in-vivo matured antibodies, but themselves suffer limitations. In B cell binding strategies, screening of the antibody repertoire often requires live cells to be manipulated and sorted for antigen binding, limiting the antibody repertoire to memory B cells that express surface IgG. Microfluidic-based platforms allow the real-time interrogation of plasma cells that secrete IgG, but these technologies are technically complex and require specialized instrumentation. The strategy that we describe is relatively low cost, simple and easily adoptable by most labs while offering a depth and diversity of antigen specific antibodies similar to single cell methods. Single B cell methods have a clear advantage in the native pairing of heavy and light chains, but they are limited to a small numbers of antigen-specific B cell that can be efficiently sorted and recovered before the sequence identification. 15,35 Here we have described a simple method using SMRT sequencing to interrogate diversity from enriched phage display libraries to identify antigen-specific scFvs. The interrogation of the full-length sequences of each clone provides the advantageous information of functionally paired VH-VL selected during the phage display biopanning rounds. A logical next step for this technology will be to incorporate techniques such as single cell emulsion PCR 36 at the library generation stage. Combining these methods will enable the generation and full screening of natively paired heavy and light",

            "text": "The bacterial DNA from four blood cultures and six fresh grown isolates (three K. pneumoniae and three E. coli) was isolated and the libraries for Nanopore sequencing were constructed according to previously published protocols [19,20]. In brief, purified DNA was barcoded using the Rapid Barcoding Sequencing kit SQK-RBK004 (Oxford Nanopore, Oxford, UK) and further purified using an Agencourt AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Sequencing, data collection and base calling (high accuracy mode) were performed using MinION flow cells (R9.4.1 FLO-MIN106, Oxford Nanopore), MinKNOW software v3.6.5 and Guppy basecaller v3 (ONT), respectively. Human data were discarded, and reads were categorized based on the read quality score as pass (\u22655) or fail (<5) by the basecaller. DNA libraries for Illumina sequencing were prepared using Illumina Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Illumina libraries were sequenced in pair-end mode (2 \u00d7 300 bp) using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Illumina reads were quality checked using FastQC (v0.11.8 for Linux) [21], adapters were removed, and low-quality reads (Phred < 25) were filtered out using Trimmomatic with default parameters [22], integrated into OmicsBox (v1.4.11 for Linux) [23]. For MinION reads, adapter and barcode trimming were performed using Porechop (v0.2.4 for Linux) with default settings [11]. Long and high-quality reads were collected using Filtlong (v0.2.0 for Linux) with default parameters [24]. Before downstream analyses, basic quality and statistics of long reads were checked using NanoPlot [25].",

            "text": "Whilst both of these approaches are beneficial, they are technologically challenging compared to more standard viromics workflows. \n\nRecent technological developments have led to the production of long read sequences by both Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) [16] and PacBio [17]. While the technologies differ in their approach, both platforms sequence single molecules and are capable of producing sequences of tens of kilobases in length [17]. The ability to sequence long DNA molecules offers the ability to overcome the issues of microdiversity and or hypervariable regions found within phage genomes [14]. To date there have been limited studies using ONT sequencing for viromics. One of the first was able to acquire complete phage genomes from single ONT reads, utilising tangential flow filtration (TFF) of marine samples to obtain the significant amounts of DNA required for library preparation [18]. Extraction of such quantities of phage DNA is likely prohibitive from more viscous and heterogeneous environments where multiple displacement amplification (MDA) is already used to obtain enough DNA for library preparation for short read sequencing. While MDA provides a solution to the amount of input material, it does not come without problems. It has been well documented that MDA can introduce biases in metagenomic libraries, in particular over representation of ssDNA phages within samples [19][20][21]. To overcome the problem of library input requirements, MDA for ONT library preparation, combined with unamplified short read libraries for quantification have been utilised [22]. Alternatively, ONT sequencing (minION) of long-read linker amplified shotgun libraries (LASL), to sequence PCR products on a minION, combined with Illumina short reads were used in an approach dubbed virION [14,23]. Both approaches were successful in increasing the number and completeness of viral genomes. \n\nWhile the number of viromes that utilise ONT alone or in combination with Illumina sequencing is slowly increasing [14,[22][23][24][25], reports of utilising PacBio sequencing for viromes are scarce [26].",

            "text": "Phage display is a widely used technology for generating, identifying and engineering fully human antibodies, and it has delivered numerous antibodies for research and clinical applications (1). A typical antibody phage display experiment consists of three major steps: (i) generation and display of an antibody library, such as antigen-binding fragment (Fab) library or single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library; (ii) enrichment of antigen-binding antibodies by multiple rounds of binding selection and amplification and (iii) recovery of antigen-specific antibodies from phage selection pools (2). Sanger sequencing is commonly used at each of these steps to decode sequences of antibody fragments recovered from phage pools. It requires the isolation of individual phagemids from phage pools and is practically limited to sequencing a few hundred clones routinely. Since each selection round in phage display gives an output of up to \u223c10 6 sequences, the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) becomes necessary if one must capture and interrogate the entire sequence diversity present in phage selection outputs. With NGS, entire phage pools can be subjected to sequencing (isolation of individual phagemids is not required) and \u223c10 6 -10 9 sequences can be readily obtained (3,4). Up to ten NGS platforms exist, each with its own advantages and preferred applications, with primary variables being read length, data quality and quantity, time and cost (5,6). Three commonly used NGS platforms in the antibody field include 454 (Roche), MiSeq (Illumina) and Ion Torrent (Life Technologies).\n\nThe Fischer lab was the first to use NGS in antibody phage display (2). They used the Illumina platform to sequence the complementarity-determining region H3 (CDRH3) from a multiple-framework synthetic scFv li-brary. NGS analysis was used to assess the quality of the library and to follow changes in heavy chain germline usage and CDRH3 length distribution over three rounds of selection. They also developed a strategy to rescue rare scFv clones from phage pools using fragment assembly (2). The Fischer lab used the same approach to sequence the CDRH3 region of semi-synthetic scFv libraries and to rescue rare scFv clones from ph",

Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have pioneered competitive long read platforms, with more recent work focused on improving sequencing throughput and per-base accuracy. We used whole-genome sequencing data produced by three PacBio protocols (Sequel II CLR, Sequel II HiFi, RS II) and two ONT protocols (Rapid Sequencing and Ligation Sequencing) to compare assemblies of the bacteria Escherichia coli and the fruit fly Drosophila ananassae. In both organisms tested, Sequel II assemblies had the highest consensus accuracy, even after accounting for differences in sequencing throughput. ONT and PacBio CLR had the longest reads sequenced compared to PacBio RS II and HiFi, and genome contiguity was highest when assembling these datasets. ONT Rapid Sequencing libraries had the fewest chimeric reads in addition to superior quantification of E. coli plasmids versus ligation-based libraries. The quality of assemblies can be enhanced by adopting hybrid approaches using Illumina libraries for bacterial genome assembly or polishing eukaryotic genome assemblies, and an ONT-Illumina hybrid approach would be more cost-effective for many users. Genome-wide DNA methylation could be detected using both technologies, however ONT libraries enabled the identification of a broader range of known E. coli methyltransferase recognition motifs in addition to undocumented D. ananassae motifs. The ideal choice of long read technology may depend on several factors including the question or hypothesis under examination. No single technology outperformed others in all metrics examined.",

Because individual B-cell receptors are recombined and diversified somatically, genomic comparisons are limited, and distinguishing rare variants from sequencing errors is a major challenge. Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION is a highly portable and cost-effective third-generation sequencing instrument, but has not been used for Ab repertoire sequencing due to its high error rate (approximately 1/10 bases). Here, we applied nanopore sequencing to single-domain Ab (sdAb) repertoires and phage-displayed sdAb libraries. We show that despite low overall data fidelity, sdAb sequences could be reconstructed above a frequency threshold (\u223c100 copies); however, distinguishing clonal sdAb variants was not always possible. The data quality was sufficient to enable rapid identification of antigen-specific sdAb sequences enriched during panning of phage display libraries, obviating the need for screening single clones.",

            "text": "challenge, it seems likely that alternatives or supplements to conventional small molecule antimicrobials will become an important feature of strategies to address this problem (Zimmer et al., 2002). Phages are well suited to form an important part of this solution, particularly with regard to biofilm-associated infections, and approaches to help identify the most promising phages for pharmaceutical or biotechnological exploitation will be vital to the realization of more effective phage-based products.\n\nCurrently, the selection of phages to be used for the development of therapeutic applications is understandably driven by phenotypic characterization and activity against target pathogens, with genetic characterization often a secondary activity primarily used to screen for undesirable genes such as toxins. However, the generation of phage genome sequences is now accessible and affordable, and the increasing range of tools available for analyzing these data mean this aspect of phage characterization should now be viewed as a primary process in the selection of candidate phage for the development of therapeutic products, or other biotechnological applications. Although next generation sequencing technologies generating short reads (such as Illumina platform sequencing) can pose challenges in the correct assembly of some phage genomes, such approaches can still provide useful information regarding phage gene content and broader evolutionary relationships. However, technologies such as single molecule nanopore sequencing can potentially generate genome length reads, and we demonstrate here some of their potential to address many of the current limitations of next generation sequencing for phage genome analysis, related to read length. Furthermore, platforms such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION require no specialist genomics facilities or support to operate, offering the possibility for genome characterization of newly isolated phages to become a much more routine aspect of phage characterization.",

            "text": "Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) allows sequencing and assembly of complete phage genomes by bioinformatic analysis, without prior isolation. The Illumina sequencing technologies are frequently used to identify new phages and also to detect viruses from various habitats, but they are not optimized for enumeration. Yet, some information about abundance may be withdrawn from the number of assembled contigs, providing semi-quantitative data. Other limitations are due to loss of data during assembly of contigs, leading to underestimation of the number of phages in the sample. In addition, carryover of bacterial host DNA, lack of databases with reference phage genomes (Hatfull, 2008) and the mosaic nature of phage genomes makes viral WGS challenging as a method for enumeration and detection, unless the sequence is known beforehand (Dorscht et al., 2009). Recently, single molecule sequencing approaches (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore) with reads spanning the entire phage genome have become more broadly available (Klumpp et al., 2012). Oxford Nanopore offers compact, high-throughput machines and rapid runtime that may make this method the standard choice for both sequencing of purified single phage as well as phage enumeration and detection. MinION TM , a portable sequencer of Oxford Nanopore was used to detect RNA (MS2) and DNA (PhiX174) phages from water samples. Both phages were successfully detected even at low concentrations, 155 PFU/mL and 1 to 2 PFU/mL for MS2 and PhiX174, respectively. Authors explained the difference in detection threshold with disparity in recovery rate between the two bacteriophages, as RNA is more prone to nucleic acid degradation (Ji et al., 2020).",

Nanopore sequencing can produce short or long reads from native DNA and RNA fragments of any length. Nanopores are very small holes in a membrane that can be created by pore-forming proteins or by non-biological means. The Nanopore sequencing method simultaneously sends an ionic current and a single strand of DNA or RNA through a nanopore. As the ionic current passes through each nucleotide that successively occupies the nanopore, it undergoes disruptions that are unique to the nitrogenous base. The patterns of disruption in the current can be interpreted to identify each base in the DNA or RNA strand that passes through the nanopore. Whereas short-read sequencing technologies such as Illumina require chemical modification or PCR amplification, Nanopore technology is capable of sequencing DNA or RNA without these additional steps, making it a third-generation sequencing technology (Bharagava et al., 2019).\n\nPacBio sequencing, also known as SMRT (single-molecule, realtime) sequencing, was introduced in 2010 and generates full-length cDNA sequences (i.e., long reads) that characterize transcripts of targeted genes or across entire transcriptomes. Long reads generated by PacBio are accurate at the scale of a single molecule because they are generated by a process of circular consensus sequencing, in which the same cDNA is effectively read many times (Eid et al., 2009;Vierra et al., 2021). The comparatively high sensitivity of PacBio can be limited by external factors. For example, PacBio can produce full-length cDNA during the library preparation step; however, it can only generate high-quality reads if the target cDNA is short enough to be sequenced in multiple passes.\n\nEach sequencing technology has inherent advantages and limitations, so no technology is best suited for all types of RNA-seq analysis (Box 1).

For Illumina sequencing of the CBS7118 genome, two libraries were constructed with average insertion sizes of 187 bases and 1.9 kb (jumping library). For the fragment library, 100 ng of genomic DNA was sheared to \u03f3250 bp using a Covaris LE instrument and was prepared for sequencing as previously described (81). The \u03f32-kb jumping library was prepared using a 2-to-5-kb-insertion Illumina mate-pair library prep kit (V2; Illumina) as previously described (82). These libraries were sequenced by the use of the Broad Institute Genomics Platform on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system to generate paired 101-base reads. The genome of DSM27421 was sequenced from a small (\u03f3350-bp)-insertion-size library on a HiSeq 2500 system to generate 151 base reads. For PacBio sequencing, large (15-to-20-kb)-insertion-size libraries were generated and run on a PacBio RS II or Sequel (2.0 chemistry) system(s) (see Table S1 at https://figshare.com/s/80a83fe2c088854e7dee). PacBio sequencing and Illumina sequencing of DSM27421 were performed at the Sequencing and Genomic Technologies Core Facility of the Duke Center for Genomic and Computational Biology. Nanopore sequencing was performed per the manufacturer's guidelines. Libraries were prepared by the use of a SQK-LSK108 one-dimensional (1D) ligation sequencing kit and were run for 48 h in R9 flow cells (FLO-MN106) using a MinION system.

The Illumina sequencing results have been reported in our previous work [9]. A 20 Kb insert DNA library was constructed according to PacBio's standard protocol (Pacific Biosciences, CA, USA). Briefly, a total amount of 2 \u00b5g DNA was used for the DNA library preparations. The genomic DNA sample was cut by g-TUBEs (Covaris, MA, USA) according to the expected fragment size for the library. Single-strand overhangs were then removed and DNA fragments were damage-repaired, end-polished, and ligated with the stem-loop adaptor for PacBio sequencing. Link-failed fragments were further removed by an exonuclease and target fragments were screened by the BluePippin (Sage Science, MA, USA). The SMRTbell library was then purified using AMPure PB. Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent technologies, CA, USA) was used to detect the size of library fragments. Sequencing was performed on a PacBio Sequel II instrument with Sequel II Sequencing Kit 2.0 on Nextomics Biosciences (Wuhan, China). \n\nRaw sequencing data produced by Pacific Bioscience Sequel were processed following the quality control protocol through the SMRT Link v8.0 to remove low-quality reads and adapters resulting in subreads. After obtaining the subreads, the genome was assembled de novo into contigs by using an OLC (overlap-layout-consensus) with Falcon. The completeness of genome assembly was assessed using BUSCO v4.0.5 (Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Orthologs, EZlab, Geneva, Switzerland) and CEGMA v2.5 (Core Eukaryotic Gene Mapping Approach.

            "text": "The most widely used platform in DMS studies has been the Illumina HiSeq platforms for their relatively lower error rates compared to the third-generation sequencing platforms (PacBio or Nanopore sequencing) and the higher cost-effectiveness (cost/base pair) compared to Illumina MiSeq (Shendure et al., 2017;Pfeiffer et al., 2018). However, the HiSeq platforms have a sequencing read length limitation to 300 nt. This makes the identification of long-range epistatic interactions challenging if the mutated region exceeds the length limit. To overcome this, barcoding genetic variants can be applied, first to associate genetic variants with barcodes using Miseq or PacBio sequencing (Puchta et al., 2016;Starr et al., 2020;Wu et al., 2022) and then to perform deep sequencing of the barcodes using HiSeq. \n\nRecently, UMI-based Nanopore sequencing (Zurek et al., 2020) and new circular consensus sequencing (CCS) method using PacBio (Wenger et al., 2019) were developed to increase the accuracies of long-read sequencing platforms to >99.5% (Zurek et al., 2020;Karst et al., 2021). This suggests that Nanopore or PacBio may completely substitute HiSeq for DMS studies in the future. \n\nExperiment design and library preparation for sequencing are utterly important to obtain high-quality data, regardless of the sequencing platforms used. One should always 1) start with a sufficient number of molecules per variant in each mutant library; 2) have multiple independent biological replicates; and 3) avoid experimental bottlenecks, over-sequencing or under-sequencing. Especially, it is essential not to over-sequence as that would impactfully hinder accurate prediction of the variant frequencies (Faure et al., 2020). Read-depths should not be more than that of total expected molecule numbers before generating sequencing libraries but also need to be sufficiently bigger than the expected unique counts of genetic variants.",

            "text": "Reconstruction of complete bacterial genomes is a vital aspect of microbial research, as it provides complex information about genetic content, gene ontology, and regulation. It has become a domain of 3rd generation, long-read sequencing platforms, as short-read technologies can deliver mainly fragmented genomes. PacBio platform can provide high-quality complete genomes, yet remains one of the most expensive sequencing strategies. Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) offers the advantage of producing the longest reads, being at the same time the most cost-effective option in terms of platform costs, as well as library preparation, and sequencing. However, ONTs error rate, although significantly reduced lately, still holds a certain level of distrust in the scientific community. In recent years, hybrid assembly of Nanopore and Illumina data has been used to solve ONTs issue with error rate and has yielded the best results in terms of genome completeness, quality, and price. However, the latest advancements in Nanopore technology, including new flow cells (R10.4.1), new library preparation chemistry (V14) and duplex-mode, updated basecallers (Dorado v0.4.1), and the realization that sequencing in dark mode results in significantly increased throughput, have had a significant impact on the quality of generated data and, thus, the recovery of complete genomes by ONT sequencing alone. In this study, we compared the data generated by ONT using three sequencing strategies (Native barcoding, RAPID barcoding, and custom-developed: BARSEQ) against PacBio and Illumina (NextSeq) as well as Illumina-ONT hybrid data. For this purpose, we employed three strains of the actinobacteria Propionibacterium freudenreichii, whose genomes have been proven difficult to reconstruct due to high GC content, regions of repeated sequences and massive genome rearrangements. Our data indicate that DNA libraries prepared with the native barcoding kit, sequenced with V14 chemistry on R10.4.1 flow cell, and assembled with Flye resulted in the reconstruction of complete genomes of overall quality highly similar to that of genomes reconstructed with PacBio. The highest level of quality can be achieved by hybrid assembly of data from the Native barco",

Sequencing libraries were prepared using the PCR-free KAPA HyperPrep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Pairedend sequencing of 125 nucleotides was performed with an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer. For Nanopore sequencing, the library was prepared using the Ligation Sequencing kit 108 (SQK-LSK108, Oxford Nanopore Technology, Oxford, UK) and sequenced using the Min-ION (1D R9.3) platform. Basecalling was carried out using Albacore. Quality control for all reads was performed with FastQC (version 0.11.3) [25]. The reads were trimmed stringently using the following Trimmomatic [26] parameters: SLIDINGWINDOW:4:30, LEADING:10, TRAILING:10, HEADCROP:6, and MINLEN:36. This left 38.60% of paired reads and an additional 23.71% and 5.18% of forward-and reverse-only reads, respectively. Thus, 32.51% of the original 67,187,531 read pairs were discarded. We benchmarked different assemblers available at the time: Velvet [27] and SOAPdenovo2 (version 2.04) [28] for the Illumina reads (with a range of different kmer sizes, from 17 to 73), Canu (version 1.7) [29], and Flye (release 2.3.3) [30] for the Nanopore reads. Velvet and SOAPdenovo2 assembled the genome in the lowest amount of contigs. For Velvet, we followed the tutorial by Thomas Otto [31]. At kmer size 55, we had the best results in terms of contig number and N50. On this assembly, 95.07% of the trimmomatic-filtered single reads were mapped, as were 73.49% of the paired reads. The best mapping result with SOAPdenovo2 was at kmer size 17, with 79.66% and 32.34% mapping for single and paired reads, respectively.",

Purified gp8-specific amplicons were shipped to the Massachusetts General Hospital Next Generation Sequencing (MGH NGS) core facility (Cambridge, MA, USA) for construction of sequencing libraries, quality control checks, and massively parallel sequencing. Unique barcodes and adapters for Illumina NGS platforms were added to each sample using the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Final amplicon libraries with multiplex adapters to identify different phage populations within each tissue, were analyzed for purity, fragment size, and concentration using a high sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape run on a Tapestation 4200 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Ten multiplexed, gp8-specific amplicon libraries were pooled into a single lane with a 15% Phi-X control library to increase the low sequence diversity expected at the initiation of the sequencing run. Pooled samples were sequenced via 150 bp, single-end (SE) sequencing run on a MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) instrument using a 150 bp MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (Illumina). Raw, demultiplexed FASTQ files were obtained from MGH via file transfer protocol (FTP) server for bioinformatics analysis. Raw single-end sequence data in FASTQ format was deposited and made publicly available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) Short Read Archive (SRA) database with links available from the NCBI BioProject database via accession number PRJNA576688. \n\nA gp8-targeted NGS bioinformatics workflow was developed to isolate and analyze the nucleotide fusion sequences introduced into p8-type phage display libraries, as summarized in Figure 2.

            "text": "The crucial steps in the NGS-guided antibody discovery are the fragment generation and library preparation. In our experience, the excision of variable fragments of interest by restriction enzymes (if useful sites are available) has to be preferred over PCR to avoid the loss of relative representativeness of clones and the potential polymerase errors that could generate artefactual sequences [61]. Indeed, although increasing the coverage allows to easily identify co-sequencing errors, the recognition of pre-sequencing polymerase errors that occurred during library preparation is a challenging task [63]. In addition, identification of truncated clones (bearing only VH, or VH with part of VL) has been reported in many studies, presumably due to their biological advantage (discussed in the next sections). To exclude these 'contaminant' clones from analysis, the introduction of a double step of enzymatic restriction to pull out VHs of interest only from full-length scFvs for fragment library preparation, is actually a routinely adopted, suitable option (Figure 2) [33,47]. As an alternative to enzymatic excision, a few nested ultra-high-fidelity PCR cycles can be implemented [57]. \n\nIn recent years, third-generation sequencing platforms (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies) have been developed to generate ultra-long reads from single molecules without the need for PCR amplification. While the use of these real-time sequencing platforms was initially disadvantaged by low-throughput and high error rate (>10%), chemically upgraded platforms (PacBio RS II and Sequel series) as well as bioinformatics algorithms (e.g., Nanopore's Bonito) have dramatically improved their output, allowing to obtain very long reads and a sharp reduction in the costs. The greatest breakthrough in third-generation sequencing was the development of circular consensus sequencing, by which a single molecule can be circularized and sequenced several times to radically reduce the error rate. These technical and bioinformatic improvements have led to obtaining ultralong (up to 25 kilobases) and increasingly accurate (99.9% for PacBio; 97% for Nanopore) reads [49,65].",

DNA was also sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq X Ten sequencing platform using a paired-end library with an average insert size of 350-bp followed by 2 \u00d7 150-bp sequencing. The Illumina paired-end sequencing data were evaluated using FastQC v0.11.9 and then adjusted using the Trimmomatic v0.39 program by filtering out adapters and reads of less than a Phred score of 30. In parallel, the Oxford Nanopore data were evaluated using the NanoPlot v1.32.1 software and then adjusted using the NanoFilt v2.8.0 and Porechop v0.2.4 programs, filtering out reads of less than Q10, a read length fewer than 1000 bases, and removing the adapters, respectively. Finally, the hybrid assembly was performed using the Unicycler v0.4.8 program; additional finalization of the assembly was done using the tool FinisherSC v2.0 [64] and quickmerge v0.3 [65] to close the genome before and after Pilon v1.23 polishing [66].",

            "text": "the same amplification efficiency is not achieved for these sequences as for other microorganism sequences during library construction. Even under PCR-free secondgeneration sequencing library construction, due to the exis-tence of special structures, preferences will arise in steps such as the addition of adapters. This is not the case for full-length rRNA third-generation sequencing because rRNA is quite conserved. When building a library for third-generation sequencing, the universal rRNA sequencing primers that are used are also fixed and conserved. Most of the rRNA sequences of different bacteria are the same, and only the sequences of variable regions are different. Therefore, compared with second-generation sequencing, it is easier to obtain consistent amplification efficiency under this method. The result of PacBio sequencing is a full-length sequence of the 16S rRNA gene, while the reads of Illumina sequencing are only 150 bp in length, meaning that long DNA strands are interrupted. After sequencing is complete, splicing and assembly are performed, which may also cause errors. It is worth mentioning that to obtain results in the shortest amount of time, the reads used in the current commercial and clinical trials of mNGS for clinical microbiological detection are generally only 50-75 bp in length, which is much shorter than the 150 bp reads used in this study. All of these factors may limit the sensitivity of Illumina sequencing for pathogen detection, resulting in differences in the microbial species and contents identified between Illumina and PacBio sequencing results. PacBio sequencing does not require the interruption of the genome and can produce longer reads [9], while second-generation sequencing interrupts long DNA strands during library construction, and after sequencing, the reads need to be spliced and assembled. At present, the reads generated by mainstream second-generation sequencers are generally 50-150 bp in length [7]. Nanopore sequencers are another third-generation long-read technology that can identify DNA or RNA sequences by detecting the characteristics of current signals caused by charged biomolecules (such as DNA or RNA) through nanopores [34], among which the MinION platform is most commonly used. Compared with PacBio and Illumina sequencing, the accuracy of Nanopore sequencing is much lower, the overall error rate prior to correction is about",

Recent advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques are revolutionizing research across genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics. In the present work, an Oxford Nanopore in-lab sequencing device was used to comprehensively characterize the composition of the constructed libraries, both at the beginning and throughout the phage-mediated selection processes against gliadin. A customized analysis pipeline was used to select high-quality reads, annotate chain distribution, perform sequence analysis, and conduct statistical comparisons between the different selection rounds. Some immunological attributes of the most representative phage variants after the selection process were also determined. Sequencing results revealed the successful transfer of the celiac immune response features to the immune library and the antibodies derived from it, suggesting the crucial role of these features in guiding the selection of high-affinity recombinant Fabs against gliadin. In summary, high-throughput DNA sequencing has improved our understanding of the selection processes aimed at generating molecular binders against gliadin.",

Briefly, size-selection (10-50 kb) was initially performed using $10 lg of gDNA by a BluePippin pulsed-field gel apparatus (Sage Science, USA). After damage and end repairs, adenines were added at the ends of DNA segments and then adapters were ligated to finish the construction of the nanopore library. After testing using a Qubit V R 3.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen), the library was sequenced on R9.4 Flowcell using a PromethION sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) at NextOmics Bioscience Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China). Then the ONT software Albacore v1.2.665 was used for base calling on fast5 files, and reads passed the filtration were considered as high-quality data, which were used for further analyses. \n\nThe Illumina library, which was used for polishing of the assembled nanopore genome, was constructed using a Truseq Nano DNA HT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, the genomic DNA was fragmented by sonication into short segments with a size of 350 bp. Then DNA segments were end polished, A-tailed, ligated with Illumina sequencing adapters and amplified through PCR. After purification (using the AMPure XP system) of PCR amplicons, the library was analyzed for size distribution using an Agilent2100 Bioanalyzer and quantified through real-time PCR. Finally, the library was sequenced by an Illumina NovaSeq platform at NextOmics Bioscience Co., Ltd (Wuhan) though 150 bp paired-end sequencing. \n\nThe Hi-C library was prepared according to a previously reported procedure 66 with slight modifications. Firstly, $100 mg of muscle sample was shattered and treated with nuclei isolation buffer supplemented with 2% formaldehyde to induce crosslinking. Secondly, 2.5 M glycine was added to stop the crosslinking reaction.",

            "text": "These adapters also provide priming sites for amplification after ligation, priming sites during isothermal bridge amplification inside flow cells and at the sequencing step. Enhanced library preparation, such as Nextera XT and Accel-NGS \u00ae 1S DNA library kits, have allowed for quicker and more efficient sequencing from limited amounts of the DNA/cDNA starting material. Prior to library preparation, the proper type and amount input material is essential, for example Nextera XT requires dsDNA input so any sample with a potential DNA/RNA heteroduplex will require additional treatment. Once the library has been prepared, sequencing using a NGS-specific platform, such as Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq, is performed and the results are then analysed. \n\nThe sequencing depth of the samples is also something that needs to be considered prior to selecting the sequencing platform as different platforms offer varying length (bp), throughput and number of reads and can often dramatically range in cost per gigabyte (Gb) [68]. For example, considering short-read NGS using Illumina with long-read NGS by Oxford Nanopore (MinION), there are notable difference in length (25-300 bp vs. up to 200 kb, respectively), throughput (2-900 Gb vs. up to 1.5 Gb, respectively) and number of reads (10 M-4 B vs. >100 k, respectively) and these factors need to be addressed in order to select the best platform for the specific study. The majority of studies examined in this review used Illumina (usually either HiSeq or MiSeq) as the preferred sequencing platform. \n\nA study by Castro-Mej\u00eda et al. attempted to optimise the extraction and purification of phages from human faecal samples prior to metagenomic analysis [69]. They separated the process into two parts; the pre-processing, which included the spiking of three phages, and the purification which included PEG, TFF and an adapted method from the literature. Despite the fact these protocols were found to be highly efficient in the purification of DNA phages prior to high-throughput sequencing for phage-metavirome studies, their efficacy at recovering RNA viruses from such samples is yet to be tested.",

            "text": "There are several sequencing technologies in widespread use that are capable of reading hundreds of thousands to billions of DNA sequences per run (Reuter, Spacek, and Snyder 2015). The current market leader, Illumina, manufactures instruments capable of generating billions of 150 base pair (bp) paired end reads (see 'Glossary') per run, with read lengths of up to 300 bp. The Illumina short read platform is widely used for analyses of viral genomes and metagenomes, and, given sufficient sequencing coverage, enables sensitive characterization of lowfrequency variation within viral populations (e.g. HIV resistance mutations as low as 0.1% (Li et al. 2014)). Ion Torrent (ThermoFisher) is capable of generating longer reads than Illumina at the expense of reduced throughput and a higher rate of insertion and deletion (indel) error (Eid et al. 2009). Single molecule real-time sequencing commercialized by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) produces much longer (>10 kbp) reads from a single molecule without clonal amplification, which eliminates the errors introduced in this step. However, this platform has a high (10%) intrinsic error rate, and remains much more expensive than Illumina sequencing for equivalent throughput. The Nanopore platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which includes the pocket sized MinION sequencer, also implements long read single molecule sequencing, and permits truly real-time analysis of individual sequences as they are generated. Although more affordable than PacBio single molecule sequencing, the Nanopore platform also suffers from high error rates in comparison with Illumina (Reuter, Spacek, and Snyder 2015). However, the technology is maturing rapidly and has already demonstrated potential to revolutionize pathogen surveillance and discovery in the field, as well as enabling contiguous assembly of entire bacterial genomes at relatively low cost (Feng et al. 2015;Quick et al. 2015;Hoenen et al. 2016). Hybrid sequencing strategies using both long and short reads leverage the ability of long reads to resolve repetitive DNA regions while benefitting from the high accuracy of short reads, at the expense of additional sequencing, library preparation and data analysis (Madoui et al. 2015).",

A sequencing library for the PacBio platform was constructed using an Accel-NGS XL Library Kit (Swift Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. DNA fragments with sizes ranging between 17 and 50 kbp were collected with the BluePippin instrument (Saga Science). The final library was run on a PacBio RSII sequencer with SMRT cell v3 and P6-C4v2 chemistry, generating a total of 166,556 reads (2.34 Gbp). The assembly of PacBio reads was performed with an HGAP3 assembler with the default settings. A paired-end library for the Illumina platform was prepared using a TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Prep Kit (Illumina). Fragments of approximately 600 bp were excised from an agarose gel using a Zymoclean Large Fragment DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research). The sequencing library was run on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer with a read length of 250 bp. Illumina read sequences comprising 4,870,746 reads (1.22 Gbp) were used to improve draft sequences by applying Pilon v1.22 and were assembled using Platanus v1.2.4 for the detection and sequence verification of plasmids. The complete genome sequence was automatically annotated using the DDBJ Fast Annotation and Submission Tool (DFAST) (Tanizawa et al., 2018).",

SGS platforms generate short-read data, typically ranging from ~50 to 300 base pairs in length and varying in sequencing depth (Ranjan et al., 2016;Johnson et al., 2019). Common third-generation sequencing (TGS) platforms include Helicos Single Molecule Sequencing (SMS), Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) (Schadt et al., 2010;Koren and Phillippy, 2015;Athanasopoulou et al., 2021). SMS enables single-molecule detection without the need for amplification and was one of the early TGS technologies that had potential applications in studying complex microbial communities (Pushkarev et al., 2009). PacBio sequencing is a single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology that offers long-read sequence technology, where long-read data can range from 1,000-20,000 bases or more (Udaondo et al., 2021). This feature is beneficial for resolving complex microbial communities and detecting novel microorganisms. PacBio's Sequel and Sequel II systems have been utilized in various metagenomic studies. ONT sequencing is based on nanopore technology, where DNA molecules pass through a nanopore, generating electrical signals that correspond to the nucleotide sequence. The MinION and PromethION devices from ONT have been used for real-time sequencing of microbial DNA, providing long-read lengths, portability, and potential for direct RNA sequencing. ONT sequencing also produces long-read data, where the read lengths can vary from several thousand base pairs to over a hundred thousand base pairs (Jain et al., 2016;Schmidt et al., 2017).",

            "text": "A quantitative evaluation of the sequence complexity of antibody libraries is critical to verify their quality and eligibility for screening purposes. Next generation sequencing is dramatically changing how antibody quality and complexity are estimated. We present here a PCR-free NGS sequencing strategy associated with the DEAL software, to compensate for technical errors, which allows to determine the minimal functional complexity of an antibody library. The PCR-free library preparation avoids PCR-induced errors, sacrificing the convenience to selectively amplify the regions of interest in such manner as to minimize sequencing error on those key regions albeit losing all the information on the other areas of the antibody. The main advantage of the proposed method over current approaches is the definition of a \"unique\" biologically relevant sequence, filtering out as best as possible technical errors from all the sequences that do not match any primer. The name of the primers is a shorter version of the original name listed in Supporting Information (Primer used for library construction). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0177574.g005 the sequencing data. In fact, we found that Phred quality score generated by the sequencer alone is not sufficient to identify an error. Indeed, when comparing Phred quality to the error rate data extracted from the control phage DNA, it is clear that both parameters have to be taken into consideration. \n\nIn fact, Phred score is a pinpoint (both single sequence and single base) quality assessment, while the control phage DNA error rate can only be a per tile sequence quality assessment. Thus, it is not possible to substitute the Phred score with the error rate and both are required for the analysis. In addition, to define the origin of an error we need to discriminate between pre-sequencing and sequencing errors. While sequencing errors need to be identified and removed (or limited), dealing with pre-sequencing errors is more complicated. In particular, some presequencing errors are introduced by the nucleic acid handling step during library construction (cDNA, V regions amplification). These errors are acceptable, sometimes deliberate [42], since they improve the diversity of the library.",

            "text": "To date, well-established Illumina devices clearly dominate the field of immune repertoire sequencing, as they offer high-quality short-sequencing reads at unexcelled throughput. Deep resolution of the vast immune repertoire sequence space enables better insights into the diversity of unique BCR and TCR sequences (>10 13 in humans) and allows detection of shared clones across individuals, so called ''public clones'' (Soto et al., 2019;Briney et al., 2019;Greiff et al., 2017a;DeWitt et al., 2018). \n\nPaired-end sequencing on Illumina allows coverage of one variable region of immune receptors; however, for approaches that rely on complete immune receptor sequence coverage and hence require longer read lengths, an alternative platform is offered by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) (Eid et al., 2009). PacBio's sequencing technology is based on single-molecule sequencing. Each DNA template molecule gets isolated in a microwell, together with a single polymerase and fluorescently labeled nucleotides. Importantly, the DNA templates are circularized before sequencing, allowing for repeated readout by the polymerase. This allows for consensus reading, achieving read accuracies of over 99% with high-fidelity read lengths up to 15 kb (Wenger et al., 2019). With the recent introduction of the PacBio Sequel II system, sequencing depths of 4 million reads per run can be achieved. Hence, PacBio can be utilized for sequencing immune receptor repertoires where variable regions (e.g., variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL)) are physically linked in the context of single-cell sequencing (DeKosky et al., 2013;McDaniel et al., 2016). Moreover, longread sequencing is in particular valuable for in vitro screening platforms (e.g., phage display), which for instance utilize recombinant antibody fragment libraries known as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). Sequencing of full-length scFvs is important for covering both VH and VL diversity, which is critical in assessing quality of such libraries and their utility for drug discovery (Hemadou et al., 2017;Han et al., 2018).",

            "text": "The principal drawback of high-throughput sequencing applied to antibody display libraries is related to the limited maximum read length attainable with classical NGS platforms, which is far from the average size of scFv and Fab formats (respectively 800 and 1500 bp). The most used NGS platforms in the antibody discovery field are MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), Roche 454 (now discontinued) and Ion Torrent (Life Technologies) (Waltham, MA, USA), which offer a good balance between the maximum read length and acceptable error rate (about 300 bp and 0.1%, 600-800 bp and 1%, and 400 bp and 1%, respectively). In any case, the whole sequence information of an scFv is split into smaller fragments corresponding to the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) regions [57][58][59][60]. Most of the sequencing strategies adopted so far have focused on sequencing only heavy chain complementary determining regions 3 (HCDR3) which is usually the one mostly contributing to binding, thereby disregarding information about other CDRs of heavy (HCDR1, HCDR2) and light (LCDR1, LCDR2, LCDR3) chain domains [57]. The paired-end reads, in part, compensate for the limited length of reads, allowing the Strategies to analyze phage library by second-and third-generation sequencing. On the left, the workflow for extraction of variable fragments compatible with second-generation sequencing platforms (e.g., Illumina MiSeq) is shown. Full-length scFvs and VH fragments are extracted from dsDNA of phages from E. coli. On the right, the workflow for the application of third-generation sequencing of entire scFvs by circular consensus sequencing is represented. Molecular barcoding can be included in both strategies for multiplexing samples. The indicated pros (green font) and cons (red font) are referred to as the current state-of-the-art.",

            "text": "New sequencer machines appeared in 2011, proposing single-molecule sequencing technologies able to sequence over 10 kb of length. These long-read sequencings offer great advantages, including the ability to resolve repeats sequences [19]. \n\nTwo technologies currently dominate the long-read sequencing space: 'Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA)) single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequences [20] and 'Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK)) nanopore sequencing (Company history n.d.) which were commercially released in 2011 and 2014, respectively. The SMRT PacBio (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) was the first long-read sequencer to be widely used. It is able to detect a single DNA molecule in real-time [21]. SMRT is based on DNA replication, utilizing the detection of released fluorophores as each nucleotide is added in the sequencing process. PacBio's SMRT (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) sequencing enables the real-time detection of nucleotide incorporation events during the elongation of the replicated strand from the non-amplified single-stranded template. The Nanopore from ONT (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) appeared later in 2014, and the Min-Ion (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) model was the first portable sequencer with a weight of only 100 g. The principle is based on a membrane including nanopores (transmembrane proteins), to which a low voltage is applied. The membrane detects the translocation signals, i.e., it acts as a nucleic acid counter by detecting the interruption to the current as they pass through the pore. Nanopore is less expensive than PacBio (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA). On the other hand, PacBio (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) retains the advantage of better sequencing quality. \n\nThis third-generation sequencing has opened exciting avenues in genomics and has become suitable for an increasing number of applications.",

Terminal sequences of the phage genome were determined by a previously described modified statistical method [20]. Sequence annotation was performed using the RAST Serve [21]. Sequence alignments were performed and visualized using Easyfig v.2.0 [22]. Phylogenetic trees were generated using MEGAX with 1000 Bootstrap replications [23]. \n\nOxford Nanopore sequencing (ONT) in combination with the Illumina sequencing was performed to generate the complete genome sequence of the MRSA lysogenic strain SA14 + .

            "text": "Both platforms are capable of generating sequencing reads of a few hundred thousand base pairs. Pacbio applies a single molecule real time approach (SMRT) in which a DNA molecule is attached to an immobilized polymerase molecule at the bottom of a nano-tube [76]. The setting allows such a sensitive recording of the light emission during sequencing that even methylations can be differentiated. Oxford Nanopore uses a different approach utilizing a Nanopore attached to a membrane. If single DNA molecules are pulled through this pore by auxiliary proteins, electric pulses allow the identification of each base [75]. The long reads generated by both 3rd generation platforms can subsequently be merged with shorter Illumina based reads; currently, 150 bp are the standard for Illumina HiSeq/NextSeq or 250/300 bp on the Illumina MiSeq platform. MiSeq reads with 300 bp read length demand a critical consideration, as personal experience showed that the read quality generally drops dramatically well before 250 bp. Both 3rd generation sequencing platforms still exhibit a large sequencing error rate of +/\u221210 percent. This demands either higher sequence coverage or complementary sequenced Illumina short reads for a correction. This hybrid sequencing approach, already being used in genomics, would eliminate several errors that occur in the assembly process, and the longer reads would improve the overall quality of transcriptome and downstream analyses (see the next paragraph). An RNA based library preparation for long read sequencing would probably demand some protocol adaptations to normalize read abundance and to prevent too many identical long reads for overexpressed transcripts. A downside is that both 3rd generation sequencing platforms are still noticeably more expensive compared to Ilumina based sequencing. After retrieving the raw data from the sequencer all reads need to be pre-processed before they can be assembled to contigs (consensus transcript sequences from overlapping and merged reads). This preprocessing (or trimming) clips and excludes read parts that contain technical or contaminant sequences such as adapters from the cDNA library. In addition, sequence parts towards the 5 and 3 ends with low quality base calling, also referred to as phred values (reflecting an accepted error rate of wrong nucleotides [31]), are excluded. Generally, the 3 end shows higher proportions of low quality.",

            "text": "The majority of display platforms operate with libraries of 10 9 or higher diversity, but this level of diversity cannot be effectively covered using currently available sequencing tools. In this report, we produced three types of small tetrapeptide libraries that have a maximum diversity of 10 5 -10 6 , which is easily accessible to routine Illumina sequencing and data processing: (i) an N-terminally displayed library with the sequence Ser-X-Cys-XXX-Cys, where X is any one of 19 trinucleotide codons (\"allowed\" codons, cysteine excluded), termed NT-TriNuc 43 ; (ii) an N-terminally displayed library encoded by conventional NNK randomization with the sequence Ser-XXXX, termed NT-SX4 44 ; (iii) a library encoded by NNK randomization and expressed between N1 and N2 domains of phage coat protein pIII, termed ID-SX4 45 . We also developed a paired-end processing program tailored for the analysis of phage-displayed libraries. NT-TriNuc and NT-SX4 libraries were characterized by paired-end deep sequencing at every step of library production. Although paired-end processing pipelines are common in the literature, we sought to build on published concepts 22,46 and re-implement the processing as an open-source MATLAB code. To track mutations caused by PCR, we used the Primer ID technology on the synthetic NT-TriNuc library. In addition, we also characterized biases arising from chemical post-translational modification (cPTM) through N-terminal oxime ligation 12,47 and dichloro-oxime-mediated cyclization 11,12 .",

The library for Nanopore sequencing was prepared using a one-dimensional (1D) ligation sequencing kit (SQK-LSK109) from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Library preparation was a two-step process that included end-prep and adapter ligation. Endprep was performed to convert the overhangs into blunt ends and to adenylate the 39 ends of the DNA, followed by cleanup. Adapter ligation, specific for the R9.4.1 flow cell chemistry run, was performed by adding the adapter mix and the T4 ligation kit from the 1D ligation sequencing kit to the dA-tailed DNA, followed by another cleanup. The DNA library was mixed with sequencing buffer and loading beads immediately before loading. The sample was loaded gently, in a dropwise fashion, into the SpotON sample port in the flow cell prepared for sequencing and sequenced using the MinION device. The sequencing was initiated and run for an hour with high-accuracy base calling using the MinKNOW software. Guppy was used for base calling to obtain the final sequence output in the Fastq format.\n\nGenome assembly and annotation. Nanopore reads were assembled using Canu, which performs three operations, correction, trimming, and assembly, in a sequential manner to generate the final assembled contigs. The Nanopore assembly functioned as a scaffold for the Illumina assembly. Both the Nanopore assembly and the Illumina short reads were uploaded into the Galaxy web platform, and a final assembly was done using SPAdes (version 3.12.0) in the Galaxy Center for Phage Technology (CPT) server (https://cpt.tamu.edu/galaxy-pub) (39,40). Multiple contigs were created, but only one had appropriate coverage, which, after PCR confirmation, was considered the true AM.P2 phage genome. Annotation was done in the Galaxy CPT interface using the PAP structural workflow 10.v8 and PAP functional workflow v8.16. Briefly, possible genes were identified using Glimmer3 (41)(42)(43), MetaGeneAnnotator (44",

Sequencing reads were collected using PACBIO and Illumina platforms. PACBIO and Illumina reads were sequenced at the HudsonAlpha Institute in Huntsville, Alabama. PACBIO reads were sequenced using the SEQUEL II platform and Illumina reads were sequenced using the Illumina NovoSeq 6000 platform. For the PACBIO sequencing of Line8, 3 SMRT cells using V2 chemistry produced a total raw sequence yield of 199.3 Gb, with a total coverage of 76.59 \u00d7 (Supplementary Table 5).

            "text": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized antibody repertoire analysis by enabling massive parallel high-throughput sequencing, providing a detailed view of diverse antibody repertoires [18]. Different NGS platforms, such as Illumina [19], Ion Torrent [20], Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) [21], and Oxford Nanopore [22], offer unique advantages in terms of read length, accuracy, and throughput. These technologies have facilitated the identification of rare clones within antibody repertoires and enabled the study of antibody lineage evolution during affinity maturation [23][24][25][26]. Long-read sequencing is particularly important for capturing complete variable regions and characterizing complementarity determining regions (CDRs) with high precision [23]. Furthermore, optimized library preparation protocols, incorporating antibodyspecific amplification, target enrichment, and unique molecular identifiers, have significantly enhanced the efficiency of NGS for antibody analysis [24,26]. Coupled with the development of tailored bioinformatics methods [25], these advancements provide unprecedented depth of analysis, opening new avenues for understanding the complexities of antibody repertoires [27]. Specifically, BCR sequencing, a specialized application of NGS, allows for the detailed analysis of B-cell receptor diversity, including the identification of paired heavy and light chain sequences from individual B cells [23][24][25]. This information is crucial for understanding the antibody repertoire and identifying antibodies with specific binding properties, which can be further developed into therapeutics.",

Studies requiring whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of a large number of related strains can benefit from the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of short-read sequencing [17,24], but can additionally include a long-read platform to gap-close if the aim is to also produce more complete genome sequences or analyse the plasmid content [25]. According to the metadata that we mined from PATRIC (March 2022; Figure 1), the most frequently used platform when sequencing a bacterial pathogen with only one technology is Illumina (~91% of sequenced strains), followed by PacBio (5%). For hybrid assemblies (short and long reads), the most common combination is Illumina with PacBio (72% of hybrid assemblies), followed by Illumina with Oxford Nanopore (13% of hybrid assemblies). These figures are likely to change in the near future as the uptake of third-generation platforms increases. strains), followed by PacBio (5%).

Further DNA fragmentation and selection of DNA fragments with the size of 10-50 kb were conducted using the Blue-pippin system (Sage Science, MA, USA). For sequencing library preparation, we used the 1D ligation kit (SQK-LSK109) and then performed the sequencing on a PromethION Flow Cell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK). Base calling was conducted using Guppy v3.2.2 18 with default parameters. The high-quality reads (Q-score \u2265 7) were obtained for the mitogenome assembly. \n\nFor Illumina sequencing, the sequencing libraries were prepared using a Truseq Nano DNA HT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the DNA sample of the same line (ss-01) was fragmented to an average length of 350 bp by sonication, end polished, and ligated with the adapter for PCR amplification. Further PCR amplicons were purified using the AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA) and the size distribution of PCR amplicons was analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Finally, libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform and 150 bp paired-end reads were obtained. The above steps of sequencing were conducted at Grandomics Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China). \n\nFor RNA sequencing, the rRNAs in the total RNA were depleted via a Ribo-Zero\u2122 Magnetic Kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI, USA). The rRNA-depleted sequencing library was constructed using a VAHTS Universal V8 RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) following the manufacturer's recommendations.

            "text": "This highlights the pitfalls associated with applying Sanger sequencing for investigation of the library quality and analyzing the diversity of a representative pool of peptides after biopanning. It is of interest to note that a larger percentage of singletons in the LTP datasets suggests a larger portion of the library to be dominated by peptides with the same frequency. This leads us to observe less heterogeneity in the library when using LTP sequencing. \n\nThe investigation of the distribution of frequencies demonstrated that the HTP platform can detect a broader range of frequencies as well as a greater percentage of peptides with higher frequencies compared to the lower throughput platform (Figure 2). These results indicate that HTP sequencing can reveal a more heterogeneous distribution of peptide frequencies within the library and that LTP sequencing underestimates the library heterogeneity. This pattern is quite explicit for peptides with higher frequencies. Highly frequent peptides are important for the analysis of both unselected libraries and biopanning outputs. In the former, they might represent propagation-related target-unrelated peptides (Pr-TUPs) that are enriched during biopanning in a target-unrelated manner. In the latter, they might represent specific binders enriched during biopanning in a target-dependent manner. Hence, a sequencing platform with higher depth can improve the identification of both non-specific and specific peptides in phage display selections. Comparing peptides present in both HTP and LTP datasets showed that peptides having the same frequency in LTP sequencing in some cases resulted in different frequencies in HTP sequencing (Table 2). Hence, HTP has a relatively higher capacity for distinguishing peptide frequencies. The frequency of peptides is used as a basis to define the rank of sequences in NGS datasets and rank is a highly important selection criterion for peptides enriched during biopan-ning. This indicates that a higher depth of sequencing can provide a relatively more exact determination of peptide ranks in library selections. \n\nThe analysis of amino acid positional frequencies can be used in the evaluation of the library quality and diversity [24,34]. Furthermore, it offers valuable insights into the position-dependent enrichment of sequences during library selection that can be used to find sequence motifs in the peptide pool recovered from biopanning [16,35].",

When approaching the latter two, it is important to make them aware of the possibility of terminal redundancies and query the use of Nextera (or other ''tagmentation'') kits for library preparations, which can result in loss of the genome termini (https://phagesdb.org/blog/posts/26). 8,9 If one has chosen to employ Illumina, Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT), or PacBio sequencing, we recommend aiming for between 25 and 100 \u2022 coverage. 0][11][12] In comparison to Illumina, there are relatively few reports of phages sequenced solely by ONT or PacBio sequencing. However both ONT and PacBio could be applied for the detection of modified nucleotides or for phages shown to be refractory to conventional sequencing approaches. 13 nlike bacterial genomes, where a reference-based assembly can be employed, phage genomes are best assembled de novo. A variety of genome assembly software is available for this purpose. In our experience, SPAdes 14 or Shovill (https://github.com/tseemann/shovill) performs well with de novo assembly of phage genomes (with Shovill an Illumina-optimized wrapper for SPAdes that includes subsampling procedures). Command-line instructions for the use of SPAdes are provided by Shen and Millard (supplementary protocol). Alternatively, the commercial programs SeqMan from DNASTAR Ultra (Madison, WI) and CLC Workbench (QIAgen) also work well. \n\nAll of these programs can also incorporate longer reads from PacBio and ONT sequencing to generate hybrid assemblies; however, for the majority of bacteriophages, longread technologies and hybrid assemblies will not be required to assemble the complete genome.",

The resulting assemblies were first polished with Nanopore reads using Nanopolish v0.14.0 (Loman et al., 2015). Additional Illumina polishing using Medaka v1.6.0 was performed on assemblies for wVulC and wVulM strains after assessing the quality of Illumina reads with FastQC v0.11.9 (Andrews, 2010) and removing adapters and quality filtering using Fastp v0.21.0 (Chen et al., 2018).",

In this report, we analyzed diversity of amplified libraries using Illumina and observed a collapse of diversity in phage-displayed libraries after a single round of growth in bacteria. The collapse of the 10 6 -scale library to a few hundred abundant sequences would not be visible in small-scale Sanger sequencing [17,20,21]; it could also have been difficult to detect with smaller-throughput 454 Sequencing. \n\nCharacterization of sequence diversity is important for phage display technology, which has been used in over 5000 publications and patents in the past 20 years. It has enabled the discovery of ligands for hundreds of targets, yet the literature still contains several poorly-explained observations: (1) identical sequences could emerge from unrelated screens for unrelated target [22,23], and (2) screens that should yield a large number of diverse ligand often yield only one sequence motif (reviewed in [16]). The nearly complete sequence coverage of libraries illuminates the origin of these observations. It highlights that the collapse of diversity in amplification might be one of the major limitations of phage-display technology. Deep-sequencing analysis will make it possible to bypass problems originating from the unwanted collapse of diversity [11]. \n\nLarge-scale analysis could also help developing methods that preserve diversity of peptide libraries [24,25]. It can be used to enable discoveries of ligands that previously have been lost in phage display screens.",

            "text": "Viral metagenomics has fuelled a rapid change in our understanding of global viral diversity and ecology. Long-read sequencing and hybrid assembly approaches that combine long- and short-read technologies are now being widely implemented in bacterial genomics and metagenomics. However, the use of long-read sequencing to investigate viral communities is still in its infancy. While Nanopore and PacBio technologies have been applied to viral metagenomics, it is not known to what extent different technologies will impact the reconstruction of the viral community. Thus, we constructed a mock bacteriophage community of previously sequenced phage genomes and sequenced them using Illumina, Nanopore and PacBio sequencing technologies and tested a number of different assembly approaches. When using a single sequencing technology, Illumina assemblies were the best at recovering phage genomes. Nanopore- and PacBio-only assemblies performed poorly in comparison to Illumina in both genome recovery and error rates, which both varied with the assembler used. The best Nanopore assembly had errors that manifested as SNPs and INDELs at frequencies 41 and 157\u200a% higher than found in Illumina only assemblies, respectively. While the best PacBio assemblies had SNPs at frequencies 12 and 78\u200a% higher than found in Illumina-only assemblies, respectively. Despite high-read coverage, long-read-only assemblies recovered a maximum of one complete genome from any assembly, unless reads were down-sampled prior to assembly. Overall the best approach was assembly by a combination of Illumina and Nanopore reads, which reduced error rates to levels comparable with short-read-only assemblies. When using a single technology, Illumina only was the best approach. The differences in genome recovery and error rates between technology and assembler had downstream impacts on gene prediction, viral prediction, and subsequent estimates of diversity within a sample. These findings will provide a starting point for others in the choice of reads and assembly algorithms for the analysis of viromes.",

            "text": "pool of clones relatively homogeneous. Clones with prominent properties can exist in rare populations, but can be lost due to technical limitations. Also, clones with high binding activity to a target antigen can exist in a rare population in a library, due to the bias that results from the biopanning. 9 This was shown in our previous research, where certain rare clones in a library were retrieved and confirmed to have binding activity to a target antigen. 10 Thus, to retrieve these rare clones and exploit them, in-depth analysis of an antibody library is essential.\n\nImproving throughput enables in-depth analysis of a library because sampling depth is increased. Conventionally, in vitro screening has been used to identify and retrieve clones in a phage display library. 11 Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was introduced to improve the screening process in terms of sampling depth. 10,12,13 However, the two existing methodologies, in vitro screening and the NGS-based process, still have several technical limitations in identifying and retrieving rare clones in the library in high throughput. For in vitro screening, colony picking used for clone isolation is throughput-limited due to its labor intensiveness, unless a picking machine is used. Even when a picking machine is used, an additional cost for its operation is incurred, and a risk of cross-contamination still exists. Additionally, Sanger sequencing used in the genotyping step has throughput limitations derived from its laborious preparation step and high cost. Moreover, the process of genotyping after phenotyping causes the phenotype test to overlap with the same clones, which dramatically reduces the screening efficiency. Due to the low throughput and the limitations associated with the phenotypic screening capacity, few clones are identified and retrieved in most cases. 3,14,15 To overcome these limitations, methods using NGS were introduced. Through high-throughput sequencing of a phage display library by NGS, high-resolution information about the composition of phage display libraries could be obtained. Based on the high-resolution information, rare clones in the libraries can be detected and confirmed to have binding activity toward the target antigens. Additionally, the change in the order of the process, from genotyping after phenotyping to phenotyping after genotyping, eliminated the loss of screening capacity",

On one hand, a long-read NGS technology such as PacBio will allow the sequencing of both variable chains, but with a relatively low number of reads (up to $ 8 \u00c2 10 4 ) 18 .\n\nDespite being sufficient to sample high frequency (and likely, high-affinity) clones near the top of the dataset, low-depth sequencing will not allow the capturing of less-frequent rarer clones, which often show equivalent or sometimes higher affinities. 19 This is also incompatible with the deep inspection of motifs and patterns within the dataset. 2 On the other hand, the highdepth NGS platforms available do not have the read length necessary to cover both variable chains, which means the analysis of phage-displayed Fab/scFv libraries or selection outputs is usually restricted to V L or V H in those cases.\n\nIn this regard, Barreto et al. achieved high depths and V L :V H pairing by successfully coupling Ion Torrent sequencing with Kunkel mutagenesis to physically concatenate CDRs in vitro and remove unwanted segments between CDRs. 19 While effective, this approach may increase the accumulation of errors that stem from extensive PCR-based manipulations and increases the experimental load as higher amounts of DNA are required to fulfill the PCR, electrophoresis and purification steps. Both these drawbacks are exacerbated when working in antibody library and phage-display settings, where diversity, throughput and quality-control are adamant. 20,21 It is also likely that this strategy works best in defined-single frameworks, and that more complex samples with multiple V-families may difficult the site-directed mutagenesis process even more.\n\nInversely, our approach leverages existing data related to cluster mapping from Illumina's sequencing files to match forward and reverse reads and concatenate V L and V H in",

            "text": "A key feature of these new platforms is their speed. Decreasing run time has clear advantages particularly within the clinical sequencing arena, but poses challenges in itself. Whilst manufacturers may state library prep times on the order of a couple of hours, these times don't include upfront QC and library QC and quantification. Also, typical library prep times quoted usually apply to processing of only one sample; i.e., pipetting time is largely ignored. Purchasers of sequencing instruments will want to keep them running at full utilization, in order to maximize their investment and will also want to pool multiple samples on single runs for economic reasons. To obtain maximum throughput, users must consider the whole process, potentially investing in ancillary equipment and robotics to create an automated pipeline for the preparation of large numbers of samples. To process large numbers of samples quickly, a facility's instrument base must be large enough to avoid sample backlogs. With this in mind, manufacturers are seeking to develop more streamlined sample-prep protocols that will facilitate timely sample loading. Here we have tested two such developments: enzymatic fragmentation and the Nextera technique. We conclude that these methods can be very useful, but users must carefully evaluate the methods they use for their particular applications and for use with genomes of extreme base composition to avoid bias.\n\nWhilst the data generated using the Ion Torrent PGM platform has a higher raw error rate (~1.8%) than Illumina data (<0.4%), provided there is sufficient coverage, the representation and ability to call SNPs is quite closely matched between these technologies with more true positives being called from PGM data but far less false positives from the Illumina data. Detection of SNPs using PacBio data was not as accurate; the use of singlemolecule sequencing to detect low level variants and quasispecies within populations remains unproven. We have found PacBio's long reads useful for scaffolding de novo assemblies, though our experience suggests that this is currently not fully optimized and extensive method development is still required. Interestingly, the mappability didn't increase significantly with longer reads, although a beneficial effect was obtained from having mate-pair information. Current PacBio protocols favor the preferential loading of smaller constructs, resulting in average subread lengths",

            "text": "Viral metagenomics has fuelled a rapid change in our understanding of global viral diversity and ecology. Long-read sequencing and hybrid approaches that combine long and short read technologies are now being widely implemented in bacterial genomics and metagenomics. However, the use of long-read sequencing to investigate viral communities is still in its infancy. While Nanopore and PacBio technologies have been applied to viral metagenomics, it is not known to what extent different technologies will impact the reconstruction of the viral community. Thus, we constructed a mock phage community of previously sequenced phage genomes and sequenced using Illumina, Nanopore, and PacBio sequencing technologies and tested a number of different assembly approaches. When using a single sequencing technology, Illumina assemblies were the best at recovering phage genomes. Nanopore- and PacBio-only assemblies performed poorly in comparison to Illumina in both genome recovery and error rates, which both varied with the assembler used. The best Nanopore assembly had errors that manifested as SNPs and INDELs at frequencies ~4x and 120x higher than found in Illumina only assemblies respectively. While the best PacBio assemblies had SNPs at frequencies ~3.5 x and 12x higher than found in Illumina only assemblies respectively. Despite high read coverage, long-read only assemblies failed to recover a complete genome for any of the 15 phage, down sampling of reads did increase the proportion of a genome that could be assembled into a single contig. Overall the best approach was assembly by a combination of Illumina and Nanopore reads, which reduced error rates to levels comparable with short read only assemblies. When using a single technology, Illumina only was the best approach. The differences in genome recovery and error rates between technology and assembler had downstream impacts on gene prediction, viral prediction, and subsequent estimates of diversity within a sample. These findings will provide a starting point for others in the choice of reads and assembly algorithms for the analysis of viromes.

            "text": "Over the last decade, third-generation long-read sequencing technologies have emerged to address the limitations referred to above, most notably from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) [18] and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) [19]. These can achieve read length orders of magnitude higher than those produced by the short-read platforms. However, their initial error-rates were very high (10-15%) [20]. The latest PacBio Sequel IIe system generates reads of average length 10-15 kb, producing 500 Gb of data within 30 h of running [20]. The PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) can now generate high fidelity (HiFi) long-reads with an error-rate of less than 1% [21]. As a comparison, the Oxford Nanopore PromethION 48 generates reads with a maximum length of more than 4 Mb, producing 14 Tb of data within 72 h of running [20]. The new ONT R.10 chemistry allows for a mean consensus single molecule error-rate of less than 1%. These two technologies can sequence non-amplified input DNA, and tend to require simpler sequencing library preparation protocols that are quicker to perform (minimum time of 10 min for library construction) than those needed for short-read sequencing (several days) [22]. Oxford Nanopore devices are now also capable of displaying the generated sequence in real-time, enabling adaptive sampling of the reads being sequenced, in order to select (or reject) reads by their sequence properties as they transit through the nanopores. In addition, Oxford Nanopore devices have the advantage of being very portable, with a proven track record even in extreme environments such as the International Space Station [23]. However, current deficiencies in both base-calling accuracy and cost-efficiency, relative to short-read platforms, have meant that third-generation long-read sequencing has not yet overtaken short-read sequencing in popularity. \n\nThe relative strengths and weaknesses of the second-and third-generation sequencing technologies mean that one platform, or the other or even a hybrid approach, may be more suitable to a certain research project.",

Although they are applicable to sequencing of CDR3, they are not applicable to full-length sequencing of variable regions of VH or VL.

            "text": "Our findings suggest that the commercial combinatorial Ph.D. TM -12 peptide phage display library has decreased diversity due to reduced titer, high frequency of wild-type clones, a significant number of potential fast-propagating clones, and compositional bias in the displayed sequences. Some part of this bias is inherent and arises from the phagebacterium crosstalk. This crosstalk refers to the interaction between the phage and the host bacterium and includes all stages of the phage life cycle. In this context, phage binding to the pilus of the host bacterium, ribosomal translation of the phage capsid proteins, insertion of the synthesized proteins into the inner membrane of the host cell, signal peptide cleavage of the fusion phage proteins, assembly of the phage virions, and secretion of the phage particles from the infected bacterial cell are steps in which bias might happen. Peptides that are incompatible with the different steps of the phage life cycle are more likely to be censored. In contrast, peptides that improve the evolutionary fitness of phages during viral morphogenesis tend to be retained in the library. However, some part of this bias results from technical errors happening during library construction Therefore, some corrections in the methodology of oligonucleotide synthesis, cloning of library inserts, transformation of library members into the host bacterium, and the use of efficient suppressor strains can reduce such bias in pIII-based phage display systems. The quality control assays performed by NEB are mostly based on Sanger sequencing of 100 plaques from each lot (personal communications with NEB) which is not sufficient to detect underlying problems within the library. Hence, we wish to inform other phage display researchers of the potential pitfalls of the commercial phage display peptide libraries to reduce the risk of identification of false-positive hits. We highly recommend characterization of the na\u00efve library prior to biopanning experiments as different lots of the library might constitute different levels of bias, leading to a distinct set of peptide sequences.",

Two genomic DNA libraries of 500-1000 bp insert size were prepared using the TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Sample Preparation Kit, as per the manufacturer's guidelines. To realize sequence variation and high genome coverage (length), two separate Mate-Pair (MP) libraries of 3 kb and 7 kb insert size were prepared using Nextera Mate-Pair Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Both the Illumina PE and MP libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeqX Ten platform and produced 16.09 Gb and 42.3 Gb of (2X150 bp) sequencing data respectively (Supplementary Table S1). \n\nFor 10X Genomics sequencing, a total of 8 Gemcode libraries were prepared from high-quality DNA fragments longer than 50 kb, using the Chromium instrument (Chromium Genome v1, PN-120229). Sequencing of these libraries was performed on Illumina, HiSeq X Ten platform, generating 2 \u00d7 150 bp reads, resulting in a total of 92.767 Gb of 10X Genomics linked read raw sequencing data (Supplementary Table S1). \n\nFor long-read Nanopore sequencing, genomic DNA was size-selected using BluePippin BLF7510 cassette (Sage Science) and high-pass mode (> 20 kb) and library was prepared using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) standard ligation sequencing kit SQK-LSK109 following the SQK-MAP005 PromethION protocol. Two libraries were prepared and sequenced using PromethION. A total of 50.64 Gb of Nanopore sequencing data was generated. \n\nAs a result, we generated a total of 201.8 Gb raw sequencing data corresponding to 366.73X genomic coverage (depth), of cluster bean genome (543.22 Mb estimated genome size using k-mer frequency distribution analysis).",

Collectively, these peptides tile the entire human proteome including all known isoforms (as of 2016) with 25-amino acid overlaps. Of the phage library, 1 ml was incubated with 1 \u03bcl of human serum overnight at 4 \u00b0C and immunoprecipitated with 25 \u03bcl of 1:1 mixed protein A and protein G magnetic beads (10008D and 10009D, Thermo Fisher). These beads were than washed, and the remaining phage-antibody complexes were eluted in 1 ml of Escherichia coli (BLT5403, EMD Millipore) at 0.5-0.7 OD and amplified by growing in a 37 \u00b0C incubator. This new phage library was then re-incubated with the serum from the same individual and the previously described protocol was repeated. DNA was then extracted from the final phage library, barcoded, PCR amplified and Illumina adaptors were added. Next-generation sequencing was performed using an Illumina sequencer (Illumina) to a read depth of approximately 1 million per sample.",

            "text": "Samples from Ang in 2015 yielded low quantities of DNA, poor PCR performance and ultimately very few sequencing reads, especially in the long-amplicon library, where only one sample produced more than 100 reads (Figure S5). Consequently, Ang samples were excluded from spatial analysis, although they were retained for denoising, phylogenetic reconstruction, taxonomic assignment and all nonspatial analyses. Spatial analyses were based on the remaining 34 samples for Illumina and 30 samples each for the PacBio long and short amplicons. \n\nThe number of sequencing reads and ASVs at each stage in the bioinformatics pipeline differed between sequencing strategies (Table S2). Sequencing with PacBio yielded more than twice as many raw reads for long amplicons as for short amplicons, with approximately 125 thousand and 50 thousand reads, respectively. Ion Torrent and Illumina yielded substantially more reads, with 20.7 million and 10.8 million, respectively. PacBio sequencing of the short-amplicon library yielded the highest fraction of high-quality reads (\u22641 expected error), followed by Illumina, with Ion Torrent yielding the lowest quality (Figure S6b). Although the per-base read quality of the long-amplicon PacBio sequences was similar to that of Illumina (Figure S6a), this translated to a greater number of expected errors per read due to the amplicon length (Figure S6b). Demultiplexing, primer trimming and quality filtering reduced the read totals by 64% for PacBio long amplicons, but only by 21% for PacBio short amplicons, resulting in a similar number of filtered reads for the two strategies. Losses in demultiplexing, trimming and quality filtering were intermediate for Ion Torrent and Illumina, with 41% and 28% loss, respectively. Extraction of only the ITS2 region before quality filtering (Figure S6c) reduced the loss of long-amplicon PacBio reads to only 29%, comparable to Illumina. Application of TZARA resulted in 708 reconstructed long-amplicon ASVs, representing 97% of denoised ITS2 reads from the long-amplicon PacBio data set.",

            "text": "Following the three generations, a new type of sequencer was recently developed, represented by the PacBio sequencer and Nanopore sequencer, known as fourth-generation sequencing [27]. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) introduced two new TGS systems, MinION, PromethION, and GridION, in 2012, enabling the direct electronic study of DNA, RNA, proteins, and single molecules. This method uses nanopores and an exonucleasebased \"deconstruction sequencing\" approach. In 2014-2015, the MinIONs were distributed to selected laboratories for beta testing. Nanopore technology can provide real-time sequencing of single molecules for as little as USD 25-40 per Gb of sequence data. The data processing is simpler than the short-read sequencers because alignment and assembly are more straightforward using nanopore technology. GridION has tested up to five MinION Flow Cells simultaneously; it is a simplified benchtop infrastructure. It is ideal for labs with various applications that require the benefits of nanopore sequencing, such as facile library preparation, real-time analysis, and lengthy reads. PromethION is meant for HT and employs the same chemistry as MinION and GridION, which are intended for real-time usage. However, based on the number of samples, it has a high fidelity for DNA and RNA sequencing. It is a rapid sequencing method, and nanopore technology may represent the future of sequencing.\n\nHigh-throughput approaches have tremendously aided research in obtaining genomic information for various species. The NGS platform's current version supports directed readings and pathogen detection [28]. Several zoonotic pathogens are detected using the Illumina NGS platform. For example, the Illumina HiScan and MiSeq technologies have been utilized to broadly detect viral quasi species in the capsid gene area as evidence of positive selection allowing cell-tropism [29]. The ngs.plot algorithm visualizes the enrichment patterns of DNA-interacting proteins in functionally essential locations using NGS data; therefore, it is a helpful tool for bridging the gap between massive datasets and functionally important genomic information [30].",

            "text": "Many studies are continually developing methods to overcome these limitations and for high-throughput screening of display libraries. The link between the genotype (scFv coding sequence) and the phenotype (surface-displayed scFv) is the principle for the implementation of sequencing-guided screening of display libraries. Next-generation sequencing allows high-throughput interrogation of the selection steps to evaluate the relative enrichment of scFvs as indicative of their affinity for the target of interest, giving a far greater coverage compared to classical ELISA screening. This coverage also allows the identification of rare clones that, in some cases, can target sub-dominant epitopes with intriguing properties. Beyond the enrichment, high-throughput sequencing allows to discard a priori all those clones bearing non-valid inserts to restrict the analysis to potential binders. To further improve the confidence of binding prediction, we are implementing a database collecting predicted and validated binders to target-unrelated components of the biopanning. Refining the sequencing-guided screening, by applying these informatic scripts, grants dedicated wet step efforts to those scFvs with high-potential to be specific binders. Moreover, the characterization of these false-positive clones' sequences (target-unrelated and selection-unrelated), could lead to an increased understanding of how these clones arise to intervene in crucial selection steps for preventing or limiting this phenomenon. Although next-generation sequencing improved the quality of phage display, there are at least two key limitations: (1) the maximal read length of second-generation sequencing technologies (i.e., Illumina) allows to sequence only a portion of scFvs (e.g., VH), making the reconstruction of the entire antibody fragment challenging; (2) to physically fish out in silico-identified clones of interest, a laborious recovery step is necessary. Long reads obtainable from third-generation sequencing allow achieving quali-quantitative information of the entire scFvs. Not long ago, the relatively low-throughput, the high error rate, and the cost limited the exploitation of third-generation sequencing in display technologies. The circular consensus reads that the more widespread platforms' availability is making this paradigm shift overcome challenges with the higher sequencing error rate, and also leads to a reduction in sequencing costs [65].",

This study aims to compare the performance of PacBio and ONT platforms for transcriptomic analysis by utilizing transcriptome data from three different tissues (hepatopancreas, intestine, and gonads) of the juvenile black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon. We compared three important features: (i) main characteristics of the sequencing libraries and their alignment with the reference genome, (ii) transcript assembly features and isoform identification, and (iii) correlation of the quantification of gene expression levels for both platforms. Our analyses suggest that read-length bias and differences in sequencing throughput are highly influential factors when using long reads in transcriptome studies. These comparisons can provide a guideline when designing a transcriptome study utilizing these two long-read sequencing technologies.",

DNA purifications steps were performed using SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter), with bead resuspension carried out at higher than usual temperatures (50 \u00b0C after end repair and 37 \u00b0C after adapter ligation) to promote efficient elution of high molecular weight DNA into solution. The final library containing 3.75 \u03bcg of DNA was loaded onto an ONT MinION instrument with a FLO-MIN107 (R9.5) flow cell and run for 48 h as per the manufacturer's instructions. Live base-calling was not performed during the run. \n\nSingle Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing was conducted at the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics at the University of New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) using a PacBio RSII instrument (Pacific Biosystems).",

Post-sequencing quality control (QC), adapter trimming, and demultiplexing of samples was performed using bcl-convert (v3.9.3). Following QC and trimming, FastQ files from each paired-end library were subsampled using the Randomly Subsample Reads-v1.0.2 function in KBase [36] to achieve approximately 30\u00d7 coverage of each phage genome. Subsampled read-sets were assembled using SPAdes v3.15.3 [37] with this process being repeated iteratively if necessary to obtain the desired sequencing coverage. FastA nucleotide sequences for each phage were annotated using PROKKA and deposited in NCBI/Genbank. BLASTN analysis of each nucleotide sequence was performed to assign each phage to the correct family. The assembled genomes were screened for the presence of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes using the CARD and VFDB databases, respectively [38,39]. The lifecycle of each phage (lytic, temperate) and DNA packaging were determined using PhaBOX [40], and PhageTerm [41], respectively.",

Approximately 50ng (about 200 fmol) of probe enriched Illumina library was used for Nanopore library construction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each sample was labelled with a unique barcode provided in the EXP-NBD114 kit. Libraries were then sequenced on the MinION platform using R9 flow cells for up to 48 h. were removed using bowtie2 v 2.3.5 22 and samtools v 1.9 23 . The remaining reads were taxonomically classified by centrifuge v 1.0.4 24 against the viral genomes or NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT database, 98 GB). These reads were also mapped against the curated RVDB viral sequence database 25 using bowtie2 (v2.3.5). For some specific species, their reference sequences were manually downloaded from NCBI genome and sequencing reads were mapped against them. Genome alignments and coverage were visualized using Tablet (v19.09.03) 26 . Major statistics such as the numbers of filtered reads, the number of reads aligned to the species-specific sequence, the number of mapped reads per million filtered reads, genome coverage (%) and coverage depth (average and maximum) were collected. \n\nFor Nanopore sequencing data, raw FAST5 files from the MinION instrument were basecalled by Guppy (v 3.2.4). Basecalled FASTQ files were processed by filtlong software (v0.2.0) for removal of low-quality (q > 7) and short (less than 100). Demultiplexing the Nanopore sequence was done using porechop (https://github. com/rrwick/Porechop) in two rounds. The first round uses the default adapter sequences for the Nanopore SQK-LSK109 kit. In the second round, Illumina adapter sequences were demultiplexed by editing the adapters. py script in the software.",

Illumina libraries were prepared following the standard TruSeq protocol with mechanical shearing (Covaris S220), end-repair, A-tailing and adapter ligation followed by PCR amplification. Illumina libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq500 platform (paired end 2 \u00c2 75 bp). For nanopore sequencing library preparation the SQK-NSK007 kit from ONT was used with the corresponding protocol. DNA was sheared using Covaris g-TUBEs to generate approximately 8 kb fragments followed by the optional DNA repair step, end-repair, and adapter ligation. The resulting library was loaded onto a MinION flow cell version 7.3 and sequenced on a MinION Mk1B sequencer. The ONT run generated 28 194 \"2D\" reads ($137 Mb). Base calling was performed using the Oxford Nanopore base callers (Metrichor). Canu was used for correction, trimming, and assembly of reads to produce one assembly of three contigs (3,555,866, 298,933, and 5,987 pb) (Koren et al. 2017). Pilon was used for assembly polishing with the Illumina sequences described above. We performed six rounds with \"bases\" mode correction and one final round with \"all\" mode correction (Walker et al. 2014).",

            "text": "Currently, literature routinely reports on libraries of up to 10 10 unique sequences [4]. In reality, when biopanning, perfect sequence coverage is hardly ever reached. As library complexity increases and larger randomized stretches are expressed, complete library exploration becomes difficult to achieve due to practical limitations, as scientists would rapidly be dealing with volumes and cell numbers unfeasible for even industrial scale laboratories. However, it has been observed by Munoz and Deem that higher affinity antibodies are found through exploration of large high complexity libraries with lower sequence coverage, rather than thorough exploration of low complexity libraries with high sequence coverage [23]. This suggests efforts should be poured into increasing library sequence length (up to a reasonable limit) rather than ensuring that statistically all sequences should be present in a screen, paying the price of reduced sequence length. A critical aspect of sparse exploration of high complexity libraries is that the expressed sequences must be truly random and not skewed to one area of library space. A typical source of skew of a phage display library is enrichment or under-representation of DNA bases at certain positions in the sequence. In a truly randomized library there should be no enrichment for bases globally or at specific positions [24]. This is an important aspect which is not routinely checked in phage display workflows. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool which can be used to read sequences contained within a sample of a phage display library, typically reporting in the order of 10 6 sequences. It is critical to note that this random sample containing a fraction of the phage display library is assumed to be representative of the entire library [25]. This sample of the library population does however contain enough information to profile DNA base and peptide residue propensities at each position which could be used to ensure the absence of skew in DNA base distribution. \n\nDuring our work developing new aspects of phage display technologies, we found no available software which could check and report on potential sources of skew present in NGS reads of phage display libraries. Whilst a multitude of software (commercial and open source) is available to assess the read accuracy of NGS runs, quantifying the accuracy of sequences recovered, no program was available for the task of ensuring that randomized stretches of phage display libraries were truly random.",

The extracted phage genomic DNA was sequenced by AUGCT (Beijing, China). The phage genomic DNA was first randomly broken into small fragments of approximately 350 bp, then DNA fragments of the desired length were collected, and specific connectors were selected using the NEB standard library building kit. Library preparation was performed on this sample, library fragment size was detected using aglent 2100, and qPCR detected the library concentration. After passing the library check, PE 2 \u00d7 150 sequencing was performed using Illumina NovaSeq, and library-built splice sequences were removed using a cut adapter software. Quality control was performed using FastQC to obtain available reads, Spades was used for sequence splicing, and assembled sequences were evaluated using the PhageTerm software to perform software correction and find features for assembled sequences [67,68]. \n\nThe genomic DNA of Pseudomonas strains was extracted by using a genomic DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA was checked for purity on Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and DNA concentrations were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For long-read sequencing, the libraries were prepared using the SQK-LSK109 ligation kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The purified library was loaded onto R9.4 FLO-PRO002 flow cells and sequenced using a PromethION sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) with 48 h runs at Wuhan Benagen Technology Company Limited (Wuhan, China). A base calling analysis of raw data was performed using the Oxford Nanopore GUPPY software (v5.0.16). Reads with a quality score lower than 7 were discarded. The reads were aligned to the bacterial strain reference genome, using minimap2 (v.2.24) and Samtools (v.1.9)",

            "text": "Deep sequencing techniques have led to a fulsome characterization of the diversity and biases present in phage display libraries and heightened the potential of phage-display combinatorial libraries by addressing many of the weaknesses of the traditional technique. The advent of these large sets of sequencing data has led to many approaches to finding targeted motifs and consensus sequences. Yet, for cell or tissue screening and applications related to targeted drug delivery or imaging where the peptide will be eventually used systemically, researchers are interested not only in finding a peptide that targets a specific cell or tissue type, but also in finding a peptide that does not bind sites outside of their target-of-interest. Herein, we add to the repertoire of available analysis tools by presenting an approach and analysis software for finding highly selective sequences. \n\nOur system starts with biopanning of a target-of-interest, for example a certain cell type, which is considered the positive screen. Multiple independent positive screens are carried out in order to account for the inherent variability in the phage screening process and increase the rate of successful candidate peptide identification. Biopanning of all negative targets, such as other cell types physiologically relevant to the positive target cell type, is also completed. Additionally, we amplify and sequence an aliquot of the unselected (na\u00efve) library to serve as a reference. We originally anticipated using already available translation software for the initial processing of our data, but found that the differences between the fastq files produced by the Illumina sequencer (already separated by barcode) and those of other deep sequencing systems (not yet separated by barcode) were not immediately compatible. Thus it became more expedient to facilitate processing and translation of the type of data files we had by writing our own code to take care of these steps and this was incorporated as part one of our software. We also sought to provide as much flexibility as possible in our software so that users could tailor it to their individual needs. Therefore, we made it possible to simply select that NEB libraries were used or to enter custom library settings, use peptides of any size, and include up to twenty screens using the GUI provided (or by mimicking our provided script, to include as many screens as desired).",

Sequencing of each library was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 system following the standard manufacturer's protocol (San Diego, USA) (table S2). The reads from the Illumina platform were quality filtered using the following strategy: (i) Reads from short-insert libraries were trimmed of four low-quality bases at both ends, while reads from long-insert libraries were trimmed of three low-quality bases; (ii) for long-insert libraries, duplicated reads were filtered out; (iii) reads with 10 or more Ns were discarded; and (iv) reads with more than 10-bp aligning to adapter sequences were filtered out. The quality-filtered reads were used for genome size estimation by the K-mer method ( fig. S1 and table S3). For PacBio sequencing, genomic DNA of each sample was sheared to an average size of 20 kb using a g-TUBE device (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA). The sheared DNA was purified and end repaired using polishing enzymes and then a blunt end ligation reaction followed by exonuclease treatment was applied to create a SMRTbell template according to the PacBio 20-kb template preparation protocol. A BluePippin device (Sage Science, Beverly, USA) was used to size-select the SMRTbell template and enrich large (>10 kbp) fragments. Single-molecule sequencing was then conducted on PacBio Sequel platform to generate long-read data. For Nanopore sequencing, libraries were constructed and sequenced on R9.4 Flow Cells using the MinION sequencer (ONT, UK) (table S4). In addition, paired-end sequencing libraries with an insert size of 350 bp were prepared for resequencing from two other male common seadragon individuals (Sample ID: Phtae_M2 and Phtae_M3). These libraries were sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. All sequencing was performed by BioMarker Technologies Company (Beijing, China).",

A Library for Illumina sequencing was prepared using the TruSeqTM DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina Inc., CA, USA) following the manufacturer's recommendation. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was quantified by the Qubit dsDNA BR Assay kit (Life Invitrogen) and was sheared into ~300-500 bp fragments using Covaris M220 instrument (Covaris, MA, USA). A paired-end library with ~350-bp insertion fragments was then constructed for bridge PCR amplification using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina Inc., CA, USA). Sequencing reactions were carried out on a HiSeq using Truseq SBS Kit v3-HS. In total, 10,071,010 paired-end reads were produced. Using Trimmomatic v0.36 [13], raw reads with the adaptor sequences and low quality tails were trimmed and filtered according to the following criteria: average quality score of 20; the tailed bases with minimum quality score of 20; read length of 50 bp. After quality control, 9,642,261 high-accuracy short reads were retained for correcting the long-read sequences. For PacBio sequencing, gDNA was sheared into ~10 kb fragments using a Covaris G-tube (Covaris, MA, USA). After purification of fragmented gDNA, a SMRTbell library was then constructed using PacBio SMRTbell template Prep Kit 1 (Pacific Biosciences, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The resulting library was sequenced using P6-C4 chemistry on a PacBio RS II machine (Pacific Biosciences, CA, USA). The PacBio sequencing generated 36,843 long reads with a mean read length of 12.5 kb. According to the algorithm previously described [14], the long reads were subject to a hybrid error correction by mapping short reads to them and then assembled by Celera Assembler 8.0 [15].",

For 23 bacterial and 3 archaeal species, the PacBio complete 16S rRNA gene sequences showed less ambiguous classifications than the Illumina V4 16S rRNA gene sequences [56], demonstrating it to be a powerful tool for detecting more marine microbial species at the genus and species levels [57]. Oxford nanopore technology, another third-generation platform for singlemolecule real-time sequencing, depends on a single base of nucleic acids and a protein nanopore reader. It does not employ PCR amplification or chemical labeling, leaving no theoretical limit on the reading length of DNA or RNA fragments [58]. It has been applied to decode the longer sequences of 16S rRNA, 18S rRNA, and internal transcribed spacer loci, achieving comprehensive taxonomic profiling and high-resolution mapping results for the genera and species of bacteria, protists, and fungi thriving on marine plastic debris and seawater [59,60]. Taking advantage of its scalability and portability, a mobile Min-ION sequencer and nanopore flow cell were incorporated into an in situ field sequencing setup (Figure 4a), where 32 samples were sequenced simultaneously for DNA barcoding and species identification onboard [61]. In a novel MICRObial life-detection platform (Figure 4b), 39 microbial isolates and an active L-serine metabolism community were identified by cryo-iPlate and a microbial activity microassay, which were further analyzed by Min-ION for biosignature characterizations and validated by Illumina MiSeq results.",

            "text": "6][7] Moreover, with the progress in high-throughput long-read sequencing, it is now possible to interrogate display libraries at an unparalleled depth coupled with unprecedented levels of detail. Indeed, sequencing of full-length scFv provides crucial VH-VL pairing information, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of each candidate's biophysical properties, germline gene usage, and structure. 3 While it's very unlikely to sequence 10,000 unique clones through clone picking alone, due to the overrepresentation of dominant clones, 31 NGS mining with Seq2scFv of phage display libraries generated by Nannini and colleagues (2020) 3 yielded more than 14,756 high-quality, fully annotated and validated unique scFv sequences. Notably, these libraries  were screened using a PacBio RS2 instrument, and new generation PacBio sequencers, such as the Sequel II, offer even greater accuracy and higher throughput, providing larger pools of scFvs to mine. \n\nAs the yield of full-length paired antibody data continues to increase, it is crucial for computational tools to keep pace and provide solutions for large-scale comprehensive characterization of scFvs. Seq2scFv addresses the challenges of characterizing both V-domains in a single read, by combining existing tools for the analysis of single domains (IgBLAST and AntPack) with custom scripts specifically developed to delimit and validate scFvs. Seq2scFv identified, characterized and validated 17,479 scFvs (representing 14,764 unique scFvs). The results, compiled in a single table, encapsulate the extensive characterization of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) with a wide array of attributes across several categories. This includes identifiers (such as amino acid and nucleotide SEGUIDs), sequence information (paired VH-VL sequences, scFv and linker start and end positions, translation frames, linker annotations), linker sequence evaluation, quality flags (indicating the validity and productivity of the sequences), and specific annotations for heavy and light chains (covering gene loci, stop codons, frameshifts, and germline alignments).",

            "text": "From a sheer data volume point of view this seems to strongly favor Illumina sequencing which resulted in 50 and 61 million sequence reads for metagenomic and capture-based sequencing while Nanopore sequencing resulted in 5.2 million sequencing reads for the metagenomic approach. However, to achieve 5x coverage of the complete viral genome not that much data is necessary and for a limited number of samples the amount of reads generated with an Illumina run may be excessive. Previously, a coverage of 400x was determined to be sufficient to perform minor variant analysis [27] showing the excess of coverage with Illumina sequencing in our experiment, which resulted in up to 200 times more coverage. Nanopore has the benefit of generating much longer reads, which means that with the same number of reads more nucleotides can be covered. This can be seen by comparing the difference in mapped read counts with the difference in mapped nucleotides between Illumina and Nanopore. At Ct25, metagenomic Illumina sequencing on a Miseq produced 15 times more reads on average than metagenomic Nanopore, but the total number of sequenced nucleotides was only 5 times larger. \n\nTo make Illumina sequencing more cost effective more samples can be pooled in a single run, however the different sequencing approaches are also influenced by the pooling strategy. Even though samples were pooled equimolarly, there was a discrepancy in the number of sequence reads generated at different viral loads in the metagenomic Nanopore and capture-based Illumina sequencing approaches. The difference between the highest and the lowest viral load samples for the two approaches were up to 2-and 35-fold respectively. For metagenomic Nanopore the difference were the result of pooling, which is challenging due to the varying sequence lengths in the sequencing library and small pipetting errors, and therefore a 2-fold difference is generally seen as acceptable. With capture-based Illumina sequencing, the difference is mainly an effect of capturing viral DNA after pooling of the sequencing libraries.",

The sophistication of commercial MS instrumentation is considerable, and the quantity of data generated necessitates its automated handling. However, when differences between experimental outcomes arise at the level of sequenced peptides, sound conclusions cannot be made without reference to the underlying data. As discussed, a reliable means of inferring sample complexity from primary MS data would be helpful, and should ideally supplement de novo sequencing. Additionally, analytical standards and metrics tailored specifically for de novo sequencing may help to standardize results across laboratories. \n\nAn optimal affinity selection would recover all of the binders present in a library, with high enrichment. The enrichment for MDM2 binders obtained here is in-line with expectation from phage display (~ 10 4 ), but lower than a recent application of synthetic libraries (binders comprised 1% or 12% of total sequenced peptides after single stage selection here, compared to 40% previously). At the same time, many more sequenced binders were recovered here (up to 73 from a single stage selection, compared to only 2 previously). Optimizing selection performance in systems where the frequency of binders is measurable will be essential before applying the method in new contexts, especially where binders are less frequent. In our view, an optimized procedure will likely involve two sequential selections.",

However, the ONT sequencing interface is not sufficient to explore the quality of sequencing data in depth and existing tools do not take full advantage of real-time data streaming. We present BoardION, an interactive web application, dedicated to sequencing platforms, for real-time monitoring of all ONT sequencing devices (MinION, Mk1C, GridION and PromethION). BoardION allows users to easily explore sequencing metrics and optimize the quantity and the quality of the generated data during the experiment. It also enables the comparison of several flowcells to evaluate the library preparation protocols or the quality of input samples.

For Illumina sequencing, the extracted genomic DNA was fragmented by sonication using a Covaris M220 (Covaris, Woburn, MA, United States). The sheared DNA was then used to prepare a WGS library with an average insert size of 550 bp using a TruSeq Nano DNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina). The library was sequenced on a MiSeq platform with the 300 bp paired-end sequencing mode. Sequencing data were processed to remove low-quality bases and adapter sequences with the optimized settings (LEADING:10 TRAILING:10 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:200) using Trimmomatic v0.39 (Bolger et al., 2014). Subsequently, to remove phiX control (Illumina) from pre-assembled data, trimmed sequences were aligned against the phiX genome with bowtie2 v2.3.5.1 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) with the default options and filtered out by SAMtools v1.9 (Li et al., 2009). For Nanopore sequencing, a MinION sequencing library was prepared using the Nanopore Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK110; Oxford Nanopore Technologies). The library was sequenced with an R9.4.1 MinION flow cell (Flongle; Oxford Nanopore Technologies) for a 24 h run using MinKNOW (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) with the default settings in the MinKNOW core 5.0.0 and Guppy 6.0.6.

            "text": "The antibody display system includes the phage display, yeast display, bacterial surface display, and ribosome display [28][29][30]. Among these systems, a phage display antibody library is a collection of diverse antibody fragments genetically fused to coat proteins on the surface of bacteriophages, allowing for the display of a wide range of antibodies [31][32][33][34]. It serves as a versatile and widely used tool for engineering antibodies and drug discovery [35]. The diversity of the library plays a pivotal role in isolating antibodies with high specificity for a given target using phage display technology. In mammals, V(D)J recombination is a key process that contributes to the diversification of the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, which is capable of recognizing a wide range of antigens [36]. Additionally, random nucleotide deletions or insertions at the junction regions of gene segments contribute to the final diversity of the BCR repertoire [37]. For na\u00efve libraries constructed without any process of immunization, the theoretical diversity increases with the number of initially collected lymphocytes, enriching a more extensive range of potential binding specificities. Although it has been reported that a single donor is sufficient to produce a highly functional antibody library, recent studies of the B cell repertoire have suggested that individuals possess a unique immune system and do not extensively share common B cell clonotypes [20,38]. Hence, multiple donors' blood samples are beneficial for expanding the antibody library's repertoire. Therefore, we assumed that the construction of phage display libraries using numerous lymphocytes collected from an increased number of different donors would enhance the diversity of the library, leading to the rapid discovery of diverse high-quality antibodies. \n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS), also known as high-throughput sequencing, is an emerging technology for rapidly sequencing DNA fragments in large-scale experiments [39]. In contrast to the traditional Sanger sequencing method, which has limitations, such as intensive labor, high cost, and the limited throughput of the number of DNA types that can be decoded at once, this high-throughput capability is especially valuable for the characterization and assessment of the quality of antibody libraries [40,41].",

We excluded the DNase or protease treatments that are sometimes suggested for phage DNA extraction (46,48). Each sample was sent to SeqCenter, a sequencing laboratory located in Pittsburgh, PA, for individual library preparation and short-read sequencing using their Illumina Whole Genome Sequencing 200Mbp service. At SeqCenter each sample was prepared for sequencing using tagmentation-based Illumina DNA library preparation and IDT 10bp UDI indices. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina NextSeq 2000 which generated 2 x 151 basepair reads. SeqCenter performed demultiplexing, quality control, and adapter trimming using bcl-convert version 3.9.3 (proprietary Illumina software). After these steps, the average total reads from the paired sequencing (R1+R2) for each sample was 2.6 million base pairs and >92% of base pairs in each sample had a quality score of Q30. The high-quality fasta files provided by SeqCenter were used for downstream analysis. \n\nIsolated phage species genome assembly-To generate full genomes from isolated phage species we first trimmed the fastq files produced by the Illumina sequencing using Sickle (https://github.com/najoshi/sickle). Full genome-sized contigs were then assembled using SPAdes version 3.15.0 (49) with default parameters, but using only the first 400,000 lines of the fasta files, since excessive coverage leads to problems with assembly (50). We verified the assembly of a single contig through Bandage and got an average of 40X coverage per phage genome.",

            "text": "). This was true regardless of kingdom, or classification method (Fig. 3). One implication of this is that a simple way to improve Nanopore classification accuracy is to impose minimum read lengths. This can be achieved by performing size selection during library preparation or during computational analyses. Additionally, these results indicate that recall for PacBio reads is consistently higher than Nanopore, and also rapidly surpasses that of Illumina. Like Nanopore reads, this was true regardless of kingdom, or classification methods.\n\nAt first glance, then, there appears to be a clear trade-off between short read Illumina and long read sequencing for metagenomic analyses. While both PacBio and Nanopore allow higher recall at long read lengths, this advantage is offset by the fact that Illumina generally provides more reads per run. This consideration is most significant for PacBio sequencing, which (while having greater accuracy than Nanopore due to the vast majority of reads being CCS), provides considerably less sequencing throughput (at most, approximately two million short reads short (e.g. < 4 Kbp) per 8 M SMRT cell). This contrasts with Nanopore PromethION throughput, which can yield well in excess of 20 million 4 Kbp reads per run. Even MinION throughput is easily in excess of 2 million reads per run for short 2Kbp reads.\n\nThe more critical question is whether the higher recall makes up for this deficit in read number. At most, recall for Nanopore improves recall 50% beyond 300 bp Illumina reads, while classification success is similar (using BLAST). Thus, if the read capacity of Illumina runs is 50% or more than Nanopore (or Pacbio), the number of correctly classified reads will be maximised using Illumina technology -on a per sequencing run basis. However, for many researchers the more relevant metric is cost per read, or in many cases, time, which may change this cost calculation. Given this, we find no clear advantage in using Illumina over Nanopore given the observed classification accuracy for long inaccurate Nanopore reads. However, the low number of PacBio reads, despite their high accuracy, may limit the effectiveness of this platform for metagenomic analyses.",

To generate the genomic sequences, three Pacbio and one Illumina run were performed. Library preparations followed manufacturer instructions. For the Pacbio sequencing, appropriately sized double-stranded DNA fragments were generated by random shearing of DNA. Then, the template single molecule real-time sequencing (SMRTbell) library was produced by ligating universal hairpin adapters onto double-stranded DNA fragments. At the end of the protocol, the hairpin dimers formed during this process were removed using a magnetic bead purification step with size-selective conditions and adapter dimers were efficiently removed using PacBio's MagBead kit. Finally, failed ligation products were removed using exonucleases. For the sequencing, after the exonuclease and AMPure PB purification steps, sequencing primers were annealed to the SMRTbell templates, followed by binding of the sequence polymerase to the annealed templates 37 . \n\nFor the Illumina run, a TruSeq DNA PCR-free library (https://emea.illumina.com/products/by-type/ sequencing-kits/library-prep-kits/truseq-dna-pcr-free.html) was generated using manufacturer instructions, generating a library with a 350 bp insert.

These methods are characterized by two main features: 1) no PCR prior to sequencing (limiting artifacts) and 2) sequences are recorded in real-time (i.e., during the polymerase reaction or depolymerization). These methods can each yield very long reads (.5 Kb and up to 13-14 Kb for PacBio) making them useful in de novo genome sequencing efforts. Short reads from the PacBio SMRT technology can be highly accurate since the platform has the ability to resequence the circularized molecule repeatedly until base confidences are high; however, long reads have a very high endemic error rate (ca. 15%). Approaches are being developed to correct the SMRT data using large quantities of accurate but short-read Illumina data (English et al. 2012;Koren et al. 2012). The Nanopore technology is currently not widely available, so much is still unknown concerning its performance. Moreover, although SMRT methods provide much longer reads than earlier NGS approaches with considerable simplification of library preparation, neither is currently well supported by common NGS bioinformatics tools.",

            "text": "Due to the growing popularity of phage display for peptide discovery, commercial phage display libraries have gained considerable attention for the discovery of translational peptides. Since M13KE-based Ph.D. libraries are extensively used in phage display research, identifying the origin of white plaques observed upon working with these libraries is crucial. Our findings provide clear evidence for the fact that white clones might derive from the library, and not every white plaque should be viewed as environmental contamination. In the case of endogenous origin of white clones, all manufacturer's recommendations to remove these plaques from biopanned phage pools, such as sterilization of equipment and reagents, are not helpful. Upon finding white plaques during library selection, we highly recommend determining their genetic identity. This genotypic characterization can be easily conducted by picking out a number of white plaques and sequencing them. Sequencing can be performed by using (\u221296 gIII and \u221228 gIII primers) provided in the Ph.D. TM -7 library kit or any type of custom-made primers, which target genomic regions able to show nucleotide differences between environment-derived WT-M13 and libraryderived M13KE. Since mutations giving rise to propagation advantage may prevent the enrichment of true target binding clones, this work highly emphasizes the importance of identifying and genetically characterizing these mutants to avoid their misidentification as target-specific binders.",

            "text": "As a consequence of the library preparation protocol each sequence carries Illumina adapters on the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. These adapter sequences allow the amplification of the library, but can interfere with the assembly. Further, PCR induced fusions can lead to chimeric molecules which are connected by an adapter sequence. To avoid interference of the Illumina adapter sequences with the assembly process and chimeric molecules we remove adapters prior to sequence assembly. As the quality of the MinION 2D pass reads was lower than the quality of the PacBio RoI data, we applied read correction of adapter curated molecules and a final contig polishing step of the Oxford Nanopore data assembly. Our pipeline is therefore composed of the following steps: adapter trimming, chimeric read filtering, long read correction, long read assembly and contig polishing steps (Fig. 3). \n\nTrimming and chimeric read filtering reduced the number of MinION 2D pass reads from 193,850 to 193,724 reads and the number of PacBio RoI from 101,331 to 100,958 (Table 2). The published PacBio RSII dataset was assembled using the commercial software Geneious and hand-curated with Illumina MiSeq 250 bp PE data [11]. For the assembly of lower accuracy MinION sequencing data we used Canu, which is based on the Celera Assembler [19] and adapted for long and less accurate reads [20,21]. We also assembled the adapter trimmed PacBio RoI with Canu. The Canu pipeline is based on three different steps: (1) Detection of overlaps in low-accuracy sequences and generation of a corrected sequence consensus, (2) quality trimming of the corrected reads, (3) assembly of the trimmed sequences [20]. \n\nTo assemble the MinION 2D pass reads we used the Canu correction and quality trimming function (hereafter corrected MinION 2D pass reads), for the PacBio RoI we did not include this step due to the high sequence accuracy of RoI reads. After Canu correction and trimming of the MinION 2D pass reads we retained 114,027 2D reads, 304 Mb of data, which compares well to 100,958 PacBio RSII RoI (337 Mb data) (Table 2).",

            "text": "In the future, the integrated approach presented here may eventually be chosen for use with alternative high-throughput sequencing approaches other than the one developed by 454-Roche. \n\nThe large sequence dataset presented here has covered over 90% of the phage diversity of all human tissues we investigated and has provided a high-confidence list of tissue-specific ligands. Sets of high-confidence tissue-specific peptides along with improved statistical analysis of longer motifs can be undertaken after the sequencing of phage DNA recovered from a large number of tissues, as well as from specific tissue samples recovered by micro-dissection from paraffin-embedded tissues. In fact, largescale sequencing of na\u0131 \u00a8ve (unselected and unamplified) libraries may--for the first time--provide an accurate measurement of their size (i.e., number of unique sequences), a result allowing the empiric (rather than theoretical) demonstration of the true randomness of insert sequences. In this study, it should be noted that we used targeting peptides for validation, but there is no reason that antibodies would not be as effective. Indeed, one might speculate that the DNA-based approaches introduced in this study will eliminate the need for ''helper'' phage for phage antibodydisplay selection, and finally enable its in vivo application. \n\nOne technical aspect merits an additional brief commentary. Next-generation sequencing approaches are being improved constantly, and the newest chemistry platforms [such as SOLiD TM (Applied Biosystems) or Illumina Genome Analyzer (Illumina, Inc.)] may actually permit the generation of .100 million sequencing ''reads'' per run without the inherent challenge of homopolymer sequencing of this pyrosequencing platform. For both sequencing technologies, a major limitation is the short length of possible DNA analytes (,100 nucleotides), which may prove suitable for combinatorial phage libraries (displaying small peptides). Nevertheless, because the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of such methods has not been vetted, it remains to be determined whether other massive sequencing platforms may eventually replace the platform used here. \n\nTechnological advances have already brought about a new era for genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptome studies.",

            "text": "Background: Given the demonstrated utility of Third Generation Sequencing [Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)] long reads in many studies, a comprehensive analysis and comparison of their data quality and applications is in high demand. Methods: Based on the transcriptome sequencing data from human embryonic stem cells, we analyzed multiple data features of PacBio and ONT, including error pattern, length, mappability and technical improvements over previous platforms. We also evaluated their application to transcriptome analyses, such as isoform identification and quantification and characterization of transcriptome complexity, by comparing the performance of size-selected PacBio, non-size-selected ONT and their corresponding Hybrid-Seq strategies (PacBio+Illumina and ONT+Illumina). Results: PacBio shows overall better data quality, while ONT provides a higher yield. As with data quality, PacBio performs marginally better than ONT in most aspects for both long reads only and Hybrid-Seq strategies in transcriptome analysis. In addition, Hybrid-Seq shows superior performance over long reads only in most transcriptome analyses. Conclusions: Both PacBio and ONT sequencing are suitable for full-length single-molecule transcriptome analysis. As this first use of ONT reads in a Hybrid-Seq analysis has shown, both PacBio and ONT can benefit from a combined Illumina strategy. The tools and analytical methods developed here provide a resource for future applications and evaluations of these rapidly-changing technologies.",

The PacBio platform allows for obtaining longer reads, such as the 658-bp COI Folmer fragment and beyond (Hebert et al., 2017). Very recently, nanopore sequencing using the Oxford sequencing technology has also become an interesting alternative sequencing platform. In contrast to the widely used Illumina sequencing platforms, nanopore sequencing is able to sequence DNA molecules of any length, and as such it can provide a better resolution as longer fragments can be analysed (Johnson et al., 2019)...Compared to Illumina sequencing, the PacBio and Oxford Nanopore platforms both have a lower raw read accuracy. However, this lower read accuracy can be overcome by the longer fragment length, or by using bioinformatics approaches that generate a consensus sequence from multiple raw reads (Nijland et al, in prep).",

However, high-throughput sequencing of the full gene has only recently become a realistic prospect. Here, we use in silico and sequence-based experiments to critically re-evaluate the potential of the 16S gene to provide taxonomic resolution at species and strain level. We demonstrate that targeting of 16S variable regions with short-read sequencing platforms cannot achieve the taxonomic resolution afforded by sequencing the entire (~1500\u2009bp) gene. We further demonstrate that full-length sequencing platforms are sufficiently accurate to resolve subtle nucleotide substitutions (but not insertions/deletions) that exist between intragenomic copies of the 16S gene. In consequence, we argue that modern analysis approaches must necessarily account for intragenomic variation between 16S gene copies. In particular, we demonstrate that appropriate treatment of full-length 16S intragenomic copy variants has the potential to provide taxonomic resolution of bacterial communities at species and strain level. Here, the authors explore the potential of the 16S gene for discriminating bacterial taxa and show that full-length sequencing combined with appropriate clustering of intragenomic sequence variation can provide accurate representation of bacterial species in microbiome datasets.",

SMRT and Sanger sequences were very similar, but SMRT sequencing provided more complete coverage, especially for amplicons with homopolymer tracts. Because it can characterize amplicon pools from 10,000 DNA extracts in a single run, the SEQUEL can reduce greatly reduce sequencing costs in comparison to first (Sanger) and second generation platforms (Illumina, Ion).ConclusionsSMRT analysis generates high-fidelity sequences from amplicons with varying GC content and is resilient to homopolymer tracts. Analytical costs are low, substantially less than those for first or second generation sequencers. When implemented on the SEQUEL platform, SMRT analysis enables massive amplicon characterization because each instrument can recover sequences from more than 5 million DNA extracts a year."

Deep resolution of the vast immune repertoire sequence space enables better insights into the diversity of unique BCR and TCR sequences (>10 13 in humans) and allows detection of shared clones across individuals, so called ''public clones'' (Soto et al., 2019;Briney et al., 2019;Greiff et al., 2017a;DeWitt et al., 2018).\n\nPaired-end sequencing on Illumina allows coverage of one variable region of immune receptors; however, for approaches that rely on complete immune receptor sequence coverage and hence require longer read lengths, an alternative platform is offered by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) (Eid et al., 2009). PacBio's sequencing technology is based on single-molecule sequencing. Each DNA template molecule gets isolated in a microwell, together with a single polymerase and fluorescently labeled nucleotides. Importantly, the DNA templates are circularized before sequencing, allowing for repeated readout by the polymerase. This allows for consensus reading, achieving read accuracies of over 99% with high-fidelity read lengths up to 15 kb (Wenger et al., 2019). With the recent introduction of the PacBio Sequel II system, sequencing depths of 4 million reads per run can be achieved. Hence, PacBio can be utilized for sequencing immune receptor repertoires where variable regions (e.g., variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL)) are physically linked in the context of single-cell sequencing (DeKosky et al., 2013;McDaniel et al., 2016). Moreover, longread sequencing is in particular valuable for in vitro screening platforms (e.g., phage display), which for instance utilize recombinant antibody fragment libraries known as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs).

The diversity of the naive antibody repertoire in humans is estimated to be at least 1012 unique antibodies2. Because the number of peripheral blood B cells in a healthy adult human is on the order of 5 \u00d7 109, the circulating B cell population samples only a small fraction of this diversity.

Here we examine the circulating B cell populations of ten human subjects and present what is, to our knowledge, the largest single collection of adaptive immune receptor sequences described to date, comprising almost 3 billion antibody heavy-chain sequences. This dataset enables genetic study of the baseline human antibody repertoire at an unprecedented depth and granularity, which reveals largely unique repertoires for each individual studied, a subpopulation of universally shared antibody clonotypes, and an exceptional overall diversity of the antibody repertoire.

These limitations have meant that most sequencing applications have only covered a single variable domain within a library, showing the greatest utility in the sequencing of single domain antibody libraries. (Miyazaki et al., 2015)(Deschaght et al., 2017) Yang and colleagues recently described the use of phage display data obtained using MiSeq sequencing to isolate antibodies from scFv libraries that had undergone multiple rounds of panning. The data sets obtained had high sequence depth and allowed generation of antibodies against the target antigen of interest; however, a key limitation to the method was the use of limited read length within the sequencing data that required additional PCR amplification to retrieve the full sequence of the clones.

In this work, we constructed a cDNA library of single domain antibodies from a llama immunized with staphylococcal enterotoxin B. The resulting library was sequenced, resulting in approximately 8.5 million sequences with 5.4 million representing intact, useful sequences. The sequenced library was interrogated using sequences of known SEB-binding single domain antibodies from the library obtained through phage display panning methods in a previous study. New antibodies were identified, produced, and characterized, and were shown to have affinities and melting temperatures comparable to those obtained by traditional panning methods. This demonstrates the utility of using NGS as a complementary tool to phage-displayed biopanning as a means for rapidly obtaining additional antibodies from an immune library. It also shows that phage display, using a library of high diversity, is able to select high quality antibodies even when they are low in frequency.",

We used NGS to mine the functional nanobody repertoire from a phage-displayed camelid immune library directed to the recepteur d\u2019origine nantais (RON) receptor kinase. Challenges to this application of NGS include accurate removal of read errors, correct identification of related sequences, and establishing meaningful inclusion criteria for sequences-of-interest. To this end, a sequence identity threshold was defined to separate unrelated full-length sequence clusters by exploring a large diverse set of publicly available nanobody sequences. When combined with majority-rule consensus building, applying this elegant clustering approach to the NGS data set revealed a wealth of >5,000-enriched candidate RON binders. The huge binding potential predicted by the NGS approach was explored through a set of randomly selected candidates: 90% were confirmed as RON binders, 50% of which functionally blocked RON in an ERK phosphorylation assay. Additional validation came from the correct prediction of all 35 RON binding nanobodies which were identified by a conventional screening campaign of the same immune library. More detailed characterization of a subset of RON binders revealed excellent functional potencies and a promising epitope diversity. In summary, our approach exposes the functional diversity and quality of the outbred camelid heavy chain-only immune response and confirms the power of NGS to identify large numbers of promising nanobodies.",

In addition to long-lived antibody secreting plasma cells residing in the bone marrow, memory B cells are a latent source of antigen-experienced, long-term immunity that can be found at low frequencies in circulating PBMCs. Assessing the genotype, clonal frequency, quality, and function of antibodies resulting from an individual\u2019s persistent memory B cell repertoire can help inform the success or failure of immune protection. We have applied ELISPOT cell culture methods to functionally expand the memory repertoire from PBMCs and clonally map monoclonal antibodies from this population.

To establish the isolation process of antigen-specific VHH, a VHH phage library was constructed with a diversity of 8.4 \u00d7 10(7) from cDNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of an alpaca (Lama pacos) immunized with a fragment of IZUMO1 (IZUMO1PFF) as a model antigen. By conventional biopanning, 13 antigen-specific VHHs were isolated. The amino acid sequences of these VHHs, designated as N-group VHHs, were very similar to each other (>93% identity). To find more diverse antibodies, we performed high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of VHH genes. By comparing the frequencies of each sequence between before and after biopanning, we found the sequences whose frequencies were increased by biopanning. The top 100 sequences of them were supplied for phylogenic tree analysis. In total 75% of them belonged to N-group VHHs, but the other were phylogenically apart from N-group VHHs (Non N-group). Two of three VHHs selected from non N-group VHHs showed sufficient antigen binding ability. These results suggested that biopanning followed by HTS provided a useful method for finding minor and diverse antigen-specific clones that could not be identified by conventional biopanning.",

It has been adopted as a critical technology in the development of therapeutic antibodies. However, a major drawback of phage display technology is that because the degree of the enrichment cannot be controlled during the bio-panning process, it frequently results in a limited number of clones. In this study, we applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) to screen clones from a library and determine whether a greater number of clones can be identified using NGS than using conventional methods. Three chicken immune single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries were subjected to bio-panning on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Phagemid DNA prepared from the original libraries as well as from the Escherichia coli pool after each round of bio-panning was analyzed using NGS, and the heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences of the scFv clones were determined. Subsequently, through two-step linker PCR and cloning, the entire scFv gene was retrieved and analyzed for its reactivity to PSA in a phage enzyme immunoassay. After four rounds of bio-panning, the conventional colony screening method was performed for comparison. The scFv clones retrieved from NGS analysis included all clones identified by the conventional colony screening method as well as many additional clones. The enrichment of the HCDR3 sequence throughout the bio-panning process was a positive predictive factor for the selection of PSA-reactive scFv clones.",

The limited library sequence diversity together with excessive redundancy and labour-consuming procedure for candidate identification are two major obstacles to widespread adoption of this technology. We hereby describe a novel library generation and screening approach to address the problems. The approach started with the targeted diversification of multiple complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a humanized anti-ErbB2 antibody, HuA21, with a small perturbation mutagenesis strategy. A combination of three degenerate codons, NWG, NWC, and NSG, were chosen for amino acid saturation mutagenesis without introducing cysteine and stop residues. In total, 7,749 degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized on two microchips and released to construct five single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) gene libraries with 4 x 106 DNA sequences. Deep sequencing of the unselected and selected phage libraries using the Illumina platform allowed for an in-depth evaluation of the enrichment landscapes in CDR sequences and amino acid substitutions. Potent candidates were identified according to their high frequencies using NGS analysis, by-passing the need for the primary screening of target-binding clones. Furthermore, a subsequent library by recombination of the 10 most abundant variants from four CDRs was constructed and screened, and a mutant with 158-fold increased affinity (Kd = 25.5 pM) was obtained. These results suggest the potential application of the developed methodology for optimizing the binding properties of other antibodies and biomolecules."

These can achieve read length orders of magnitude higher than those produced by the short-read platforms. However, their initial error-rates were very high (10-15%) (Athanasopoulou et al., 2021). The latest PacBio Sequel IIe system generates reads of average length 10-15 kb, producing 500 Gb of data within 30 h of running (Athanasopoulou et al., 2021). The PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) can now generate high fidelity (HiFi) long-reads with an error-rate of less than 1% (Wenger et al., 2019). As a comparison, the Oxford Nanopore PromethION 48 generates reads with a maximum length of more than 4 Mb, producing 14 Tb of data within 72 h of running (Athanasopoulou et al., 2021). The new ONT R.10 chemistry allows for a mean consensus single molecule error-rate of less than 1%. These two technologies can sequence non-amplified input DNA, and tend to require simpler sequencing library preparation protocols that are quicker to perform (minimum time of 10 min for library construction) than those needed for short-read sequencing (several days) (Quick et al., 2015). Oxford Nanopore devices are now also capable of displaying the generated sequence in real-time, enabling adaptive sampling of the reads being sequenced, in order to select (or reject) reads by their sequence properties as they transit through the nanopores. In addition, Oxford Nanopore devices have the advantage of being very portable, with a proven track record even in extreme environments such as the International Space Station [23].

We recently detected a large outbreak of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis phage type 14b affecting more than 30 patients in our hospital. This outbreak was linked to community, national and European-wide cases. Hospital patients with Salmonella are at high risk, and require a rapid response. We initially investigated this outbreak by whole-genome sequencing using a novel rapid protocol on the Illumina MiSeq; we then integrated these data with whole-genome data from surveillance sequencing, thereby placing the outbreak in a national context. Additionally, we investigated the potential of a newly released sequencing technology, the MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, in the management of a hospital outbreak of Salmonella. We demonstrate that rapid MiSeq sequencing can reduce the time to answer compared to the standard sequencing protocol with no impact on the results. We show, for the first time, that the MinION can acquire clinically relevant information in real time and within minutes of a DNA library being loaded. MinION sequencing permits confident assignment to species level within 20 min. Using a novel streaming phylogenetic placement method samples can be assigned to a serotype in 40 min and determined to be part of the outbreak in less than 2 h. Both approaches yielded reliable and actionable clinical information on the Salmonella outbreak in less than half a day. The rapid availability of such information may facilitate more informed epidemiological investigations and influence infection control practices.",

In the early 2010s, the introduction of a novel set of sequencing methodologies, presented by two platforms, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONT), gave birth to third-generation sequencing (TGS). The innovative long-read technologies turn genome sequencing into an ease-of-handle procedure by greatly reducing the average time of library construction workflows and simplifying the process of de novo genome assembly due to the generation of long reads. Long sequencing reads produced by both TGS methodologies have already facilitated the decipherment of transcriptional profiling since they enable the identification of full-length transcripts without the need for assembly or the use of sophisticated bioinformatics tools. Long-read technologies have also provided new insights into the field of epitranscriptomics, by allowing the direct detection of RNA modifications on native RNA molecules. This review highlights the advantageous features of the newly introduced TGS technologies, discusses their limitations and provides an in-depth comparison regarding their scientific background and available protocols as well as their potential utility in research and clinical applications."

However, the current NGS methods employed for sequencing phage display libraries are limited by the short contiguous read lengths associated with second-generation sequencing platforms. Consequently, the identification of antibody sequences has conventionally been restricted to individual antibody domains or to the analysis of single domain binding moieties such as camelid VHH or cartilaginous fish IgNAR antibodies. In this study, we report the application of third-generation sequencing to address this limitation. We used single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing coupled with hairpin adaptor loop ligation to facilitate the accurate interrogation of full-length single-chain Fv (scFv) libraries. Our method facilitated the rapid isolation and testing of scFv antibodies enriched from phage display libraries within days following panning. Two libraries against CD160 and CD123 were panned and monitored by NGS. Analysis of NGS antibody data sets led to the isolation of several functional scFv antibodies that were not identified by conventional panning and screening strategies. Our approach, which combines phage display selection of immune libraries with the full-length interrogation of scFv fragments, is an easy method to discover functional antibodies, with a range of affinities and biophysical characteristics.",

Due to limitations in attainable read and amplicon lengths, NGS analysis of Fab libraries and selection outputs is usually restricted to either VH or VL. Since this information alone is not sufficient for high-throughput reconstruction of Fabs, we developed a rapid and simple method for linking and sequencing all diversified CDRs in phage Fab pools. Our method resulted in a reliable and straightforward platform for converting NGS information into Fab clones. We used our NGS-assisted Fab reconstruction method to recover low-frequency rare clones from phage selection outputs. While previous studies chose rare clones for rescue based on their relative frequencies in sequencing outputs, we chose rare clones for reconstruction from less-frequent CDRH3 lengths. In some cases, reconstructed rare clones (frequency \u223c0.1%) showed higher affinity and better specificity than high-frequency top clones identified by Sanger sequencing, highlighting the significance of NGS-based approaches in synthetic antibody discovery.",

Despite many recent technical advances, determining the VH:VL or TCRb:a repertoire with high accuracy and throughput remains challenging. We discovered that the recently engineered xenopolymerase, RTX, is exceptionally resistant to cell lysate inhibition in single-cell emulsion droplets. We capitalized on the characteristics of this enzyme to develop a simple, rapid, and inexpensive in-droplet overlap extension reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method for NPS not requiring microfluidics or other specialized equipment.

In vivo, 20\u201350% of peripheral B cells undergo a process of receptor editing, which modifies the variable and junctional regions of light chains to delete auto-reactive clones. However, in vitro antibody evolution relies primarily on interaction with antigen, with no in-built checkpoints to ensure that the selected antibodies have not acquired additional specificities or biophysical liabilities during the optimization process. We had previously observed an enrichment of positive charge in the complementarity-determining regions of an anti-IL-21 R antibody during affinity optimization, which correlated with more potent IL-21 neutralization, but poor in vivo pharmacokinetics (PK). There is an emerging body of data that has correlated antibody nonspecificity with poor PK in vivo, and established a series of screening assays that are predictive of this behavior. In this study we revisit the challenge of developing an anti-IL-21 R antibody that can effectively compete with IL-21 for its highly negatively charged paratope while maintaining favorable biophysical properties. In vitro deselection methods that included an excess of negatively charged membrane preparations, or deoxyribonucleic acid, during phage selection of optimization libraries were unsuccessful in avoiding enrichment of highly charged, nonspecific antibody variants. However, a combination of structure-guided rational library design, next-generation sequencing of library outputs and application of linear regression models resulted in the identification of an antibody that maintained high affinity for IL-21 R and exhibited a desirable stability and biophysical profile."

The transition to new technologies has provided more quantitative information at the expense of taxonomic resolution with implications for inferring metabolic traits in various ecosystems. We applied single-molecule real-time sequencing for microbial community profiling, generating full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences at high throughput, which we propose to name PhyloTags. We benchmarked and validated this approach using a defined microbial community. When further applied to samples from the water column of meromictic Sakinaw Lake, we show that while community structures at the phylum level are comparable between PhyloTags and Illumina V4 16S rRNA gene sequences (iTags), variance increases with community complexity at greater water depths. PhyloTags moreover allowed less ambiguous classification. Last, a platform-independent comparison of PhyloTags and in silico generated partial 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated significant differences in community structure and phylogenetic resolution across multiple taxonomic levels, including a severe underestimation in the abundance of specific microbial genera involved in nitrogen and methane cycling across the Lake\u2019s water column.

Here, we report the findings of a large evaluation of the Next Gen Diagnostics (NGD) automated bioinformatics analysis tool to predict the phenotypic resistance of MRSA. Methods MRSA-positive patients were identified in a clinical microbiology laboratory in England between January and November 2018. One MRSA isolate per patient together with all blood culture isolates (total n\u2009=\u2009778) were sequenced on the Illumina MiniSeq instrument in batches of 21 clinical MRSA isolates and three controls. Results The NGD system activated post-sequencing and processed the sequences to determine susceptible/resistant predictions for 11 antibiotics, taking around 11\u2009minutes to analyse 24 isolates sequenced on a single sequencing run. NGD results were compared with phenotypic susceptibility testing performed by the clinical laboratory using the disc diffusion method and EUCAST breakpoints. Following retesting of discrepant results, concordance between phenotypic results and NGD genetic predictions was 99.69%. Further investigation of 22 isolate genomes associated with persistent discrepancies revealed a range of reasons in 12 cases, but no cause could be found for the remainder. Genetic predictions generated by the NGD tool were compared with predictions generated by an independent research-based informatics approach, which demonstrated an overall concordance between the two methods of 99.97%. Conclusions We conclude that the NGD system provides rapid and accurate prediction of the antibiotic susceptibility of MRSA.",

However, second-generation sequencing metagenomics (mostly Illumina) suffers from limitations, particularly in the assembly of microbes with high microdiversity and retrieval of the flexible (adaptive) fraction of prokaryotic genomes. Here, we have used a third-generation technique to study the metagenome of a well-known marine sample from the mixed epipelagic water column of the winter Mediterranean. We have compared PacBio Sequel II with the classical approach using Illumina Nextseq short reads followed by assembly to study the metagenome. Long reads allow for efficient direct retrieval of complete genes avoiding the bias of the assembly step. Besides, the application of long reads on metagenomic assembly allows for the reconstruction of much more complete metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), particularly from microbes with high microdiversity such as Pelagibacterales. The flexible genome of reconstructed MAGs was much more complete containing many adaptive genes (some with biotechnological potential). PacBio Sequel II CCS appears particularly suitable for cellular metagenomics due to its low error rate. For most applications of metagenomics, from community structure analysis to ecosystem functioning, long reads should be applied whenever possible. Specifically, for in silico screening of biotechnologically useful genes, or population genomics, long-read metagenomics appears presently as a very fruitful approach and can be analyzed from raw reads before a computationally demanding (and potentially artifactual) assembly step.",

Estimating the microbial richness and specificity of a marine biofilm community is a challenging task due to the high complexity in comparison with seawater. Here, we compared the resolution of full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing technique of a PacBio platform for microbe identification in marine biofilms with the results of partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of traditional Illumina PE250 platform. At the same time, the microbial richness, diversity, and composition of adjacent seawater communities in the same batch of samples were analyzed. Both techniques revealed higher species richness, as reflected by the Chao1 index, in the biofilms than that in the seawater communities. Moreover, compared with Illumina sequencing, PacBio sequencing detected more specific species for biofilms and less specific species for seawater. Members of Vibrio, Arcobacter, Photobacterium, Pseudoalteromonas, and Thalassomonas were significantly enriched in the biofilms, which is consistent with the previous understanding of species adapted to a surface-associated lifestyle and validates the taxonomic analyses in the current study. To conclude, the full-length sequencing of 16S rRNA genes has probably a stronger ability to analyze more complex microbial communities, such as marine biofilms, the species richness of which has probably been under-estimated in previous studies."

In this work, we developed an NGS-assisted antibody discovery platform by integrating phage-displayed, single-framework, synthetic Fab libraries. Due to limitations in attainable read and amplicon lengths, NGS analysis of Fab libraries and selection outputs is usually restricted to either VH or VL. Since this information alone is not sufficient for high-throughput reconstruction of Fabs, we developed a rapid and simple method for linking and sequencing all diversified CDRs in phage Fab pools. Our method resulted in a reliable and straightforward platform for converting NGS information into Fab clones. We used our NGS-assisted Fab reconstruction method to recover low-frequency rare clones from phage selection outputs. While previous studies chose rare clones for rescue based on their relative frequencies in sequencing outputs, we chose rare clones for reconstruction from less-frequent CDRH3 lengths. In some cases, reconstructed rare clones (frequency \u223c0.1%) showed higher affinity and better specificity than high-frequency top clones identified by Sanger sequencing, highlighting the significance of NGS-based approaches in synthetic antibody discovery.",

After sequencing in vitro selected populations, clones are binned into identical or similar groups and ordered by abundance, allowing identification of those that are most enriched. However, the greatest strength of deep sequencing is also its greatest weakness: clones are easily identified by their DNA sequences, but are not physically available for testing without a laborious multistep process involving several rounds of polymerization chain reaction (PCR), assembly and cloning. Here, using the isolation of antibody genes from a phage and yeast display selection as an example, we show the power of a rapid and simple inverse PCR-based method to easily isolate clones identified by deep sequencing. Once primers have been received, clone isolation can be carried out in a single day, rather than two days. Furthermore the reduced number of PCRs required will reduce PCR mutations correspondingly. We have observed a 100% success rate in amplifying clones with an abundance as low as 0.5% in a polyclonal population. This approach allows us to obtain full-length clones even when an incomplete sequence is available, and greatly simplifies the subcloning process. Moreover, rarer, but functional clones missed by traditional screening can be easily isolated using this method, and the approach can be extended to any selected library (scFv, cDNA, libraries based on scaffold proteins) where a unique sequence signature for the desired clones of interest is available."

However, the current NGS methods employed for sequencing phage display libraries are limited by the short contiguous read lengths associated with second-generation sequencing platforms. Consequently, the identification of antibody sequences has conventionally been restricted to individual antibody domains or to the analysis of single domain binding moieties such as camelid VHH or cartilaginous fish IgNAR antibodies. In this study, we report the application of third-generation sequencing to address this limitation. We used single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing coupled with hairpin adaptor loop ligation to facilitate the accurate interrogation of full-length single-chain Fv (scFv) libraries. Our method facilitated the rapid isolation and testing of scFv antibodies enriched from phage display libraries within days following panning. Two libraries against CD160 and CD123 were panned and monitored by NGS. Analysis of NGS antibody data sets led to the isolation of several functional scFv antibodies that were not identified by conventional panning and screening strategies. Our approach, which combines phage display selection of immune libraries with the full-length interrogation of scFv fragments, is an easy method to discover functional antibodies, with a range of affinities and biophysical characteristics.",

Paired-end MiSeq (2 \u00d7 300 bp) sequencing from Illumina covers segments of about 500 bp and has been successfully applied to the investigation of shorter antibody fragment libraries, such as nanobodies derived from the camelid's variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies [17,18], as well as the shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) [19]. Paired-end MiSeq can also read amplicons long enough to cover all CDRs in single-chain Fv (scFv) [20]. However, paired-end MiSeq is not sufficient to cover longer light and heavy chain-combined sequences (1.2-1.5 kb), which are linked together in Human Fab libraries [21,22].\n\nThird-generation NGS technology such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) can bridge the shortcomings of current MiSeq sequencing [23], as it is possible to achieve long sequencing reads of 10 to 15 kb in length with single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) [24]. PacBio's NGS had been applied successfully to scFv fragment libraries [25,26]. In particular, Han et al. applied PacBio's platform to the deep sequencing of the immune rhesus macaque scFv phage library to identify additional unique antibody gene sequences previously not seen in their Sanger sequencing results [26].",

We have previously reported the construction of a phage display library from a SIV-infected rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) using oligonucleotide primers based on human IG gene sequences. Our previous screening relied on Sanger sequencing, which was inefficient and generated only a few dozen sequences. Here, we re-analyzed this library using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform to generate thousands of highly accurate circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads corresponding to full length single chain fragment variable. CCS data were then analyzed through the international ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae (IMGT\u00ae)/HighV-QUEST (www.imgt.org) to identify variable genes and perform statistical analyses. Overall the library was very diverse, with 2,569 different IMGT clonotypes called for the 5,238 IGHV sequences assigned to an IMGT clonotype. Within the library, SIV-specific antibodies represented a relatively limited number of clones, with only 135 different IMGT clonotypes called from 4,594 IGHV-assigned sequences. Our data did confirm that the IGHV4 and IGHV3 gene usage was the most abundant within the rhesus antibodies screened, and that these genes were even more enriched among SIV gp140-specific antibodies. Although a broad range of VH CDR3 amino acid (AA) lengths was observed in the unpanned library, the vast majority of SIV gp140-specific antibodies demonstrated a more uniform VH CDR3 length (20 AA). This uniformity was far less apparent when VH CDR3 were classified according to their clonotype (range: 9\u201325 AA), which we believe is more relevant for specific antibody identification. Only 174 IGKV and 588 IGLV clonotypes were identified within the VL sequences associated with SIV gp140-specific VH. Together, these data strongly suggest that the combination of SMRT sequencing with the IMGT/HighV-QUEST querying tool will facilitate and expedite our understanding of polyclonal antibody responses during SIV infection and may serve to rapidly expand the known scope of macaque V genes utilized during these responses.",

The sequenced library was interrogated using sequences of known SEB-binding single domain antibodies from the library obtained through phage display panning methods in a previous study. New antibodies were identified, produced, and characterized, and were shown to have affinities and melting temperatures comparable to those obtained by traditional panning methods. This demonstrates the utility of using NGS as a complementary tool to phage-displayed biopanning as a means for rapidly obtaining additional antibodies from an immune library.

Challenges to this application of NGS include accurate removal of read errors, correct identification of related sequences, and establishing meaningful inclusion criteria for sequences-of-interest. To this end, a sequence identity threshold was defined to separate unrelated full-length sequence clusters by exploring a large diverse set of publicly available nanobody sequences. When combined with majority-rule consensus building, applying this elegant clustering approach to the NGS data set revealed a wealth of >5,000-enriched candidate RON binders. The huge binding potential predicted by the NGS approach was explored through a set of randomly selected candidates: 90% were confirmed as RON binders, 50% of which functionally blocked RON in an ERK phosphorylation assay. Additional validation came from the correct prediction of all 35 RON binding nanobodies which were identified by a conventional screening campaign of the same immune library. More detailed characterization of a subset of RON binders revealed excellent functional potencies and a promising epitope diversity. In summary, our approach exposes the functional diversity and quality of the outbred camelid heavy chain-only immune response and confirms the power of NGS to identify large numbers of promising nanobodies.",

The framework regions are fixed and the diversified CDRs were designed based on a systematic analysis of a large set of rearranged human antibody sequences. Care was taken to minimize the occurrence of potential posttranslational modification sites within the CDRs.

Here, we investigated a VNAR selection method that combined panning with various selection pressures and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses to obtain additional candidates. Drawing inspiration from the physiological conditions of sharks and the physicochemical properties of VNARs, we examined the effects of NaCl and urea concentrations, low temperature, and preheating at the binding step of panning. VNAR phage libraries generated from Japanese topeshark (Hemitriakis japanica) were enriched under these conditions. We then performed NGS analysis and attempted to select clones that were specifically enriched under each panning condition. The identified VNARs exhibited higher reactivity than those obtained by panning without selection pressure. Additionally, they possess physicochemical properties that reflect their respective selection pressures. These results can greatly enhance our understanding of VNAR properties and offer guidance for the screening of high-quality VNAR clones that are present at low frequencies.",

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently emerged as a new method for the high throughput characterization of IG and T cell receptor (TR) immune repertoires both in vivo and in vitro. However, challenges remain for the NGS sequencing of scFv from combinatorial libraries owing to the scFv length (>800\u2009bp) and the presence of two variable domains [variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) for IG] associated by a peptide linker in a single chain. Here, we show that single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing with the Pacific Biosciences RS II platform allows for the generation of full-length scFv reads obtained from an in vivo selection of scFv-phages in an animal model of atherosclerosis. We first amplified the DNA of the phagemid inserts from scFv-phages eluted from an aortic section at the third round of the in vivo selection. From this amplified DNA, 450,558 reads were obtained from 15 SMRT cells. Highly accurate circular consensus sequences from these reads were generated, filtered by quality and then analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST with the functionality for scFv. Full-length scFv were identified and characterized in 348,659 reads. Full-length scFv sequencing is an absolute requirement for analyzing the associated VH and VL domains enriched during the in vivo panning rounds. In order to further validate the ability of SMRT sequencing to provide high quality, full-length scFv sequences, we tracked the reads of an scFv-phage clone P3 previously identified by biological assays and Sanger sequencing. Sixty P3 reads showed 100% identity with the full-length scFv of 767\u2009bp, 53 of them covering the whole insert of 977\u2009bp, which encompassed the primer sequences. The remaining seven reads were identical over a shortened length of 939\u2009bp that excludes the vicinity of primers at both ends. Interestingly these reads were obtained from each of the 15 SMRT cells. Thus, the SMRT sequencing method and the IMGT/HighV-QUEST functionality for scFv provides a straightforward protocol for characterization of full-length scFv from combinatorial phage libraries."

Paired-end MiSeq (2 \u00d7 300 bp) sequencing from Illumina covers segments of about 500 bp and has been successfully applied to the investigation of shorter antibody fragment libraries, such as nanobodies derived from the camelid's variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies [17,18], as well as the shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) [19]. Paired-end MiSeq can also read amplicons long enough to cover all CDRs in single-chain Fv (scFv) [20]. However, paired-end MiSeq is not sufficient to cover longer light and heavy chain-combined sequences (1.2-1.5 kb), which are linked together in Human Fab libraries [21,22].\n\nThird-generation NGS technology such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) can bridge the shortcomings of current MiSeq sequencing [23], as it is possible to achieve long sequencing reads of 10 to 15 kb in length with single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) [24]. PacBio's NGS had been applied successfully to scFv fragment libraries [25,26]. In particular, Han et al. applied PacBio's platform to the deep sequencing of the immune rhesus macaque scFv phage library to identify additional unique antibody gene sequences previously not seen in their Sanger sequencing results [26]."

We further developed a single-molecule barcoding strategy to reduce PCR-based amplification noise. Lastly, we evaluated several new PGM technologies in the context of antibody sequencing.

Although very useful, the commonly used Illumina NGS platform cannot handle the entire sequence of scFv or Fab in a single read, usually focusing on specific CDRs or resorting to sequencing VH and VL variable domains separately, thus limiting its utility in comprehensive monitoring of selection dynamics. Here we present a simple and robust method for deep sequencing repertoires of full length scFv, Fab and Fv antibody sequences. This process utilizes standard molecular procedures and unique molecular identifiers (UMI) to pair separately sequenced VH and VL. We show that UMI assisted VH-VL matching allows for a comprehensive and highly accurate mapping of full length Fv clonal dynamics in large highly homologous antibody libraries, as well as identification of rare variants. In addition to its utility in synthetic antibody discovery processes, our method can be instrumental in generating large datasets for machine learning (ML) applications, which in the field of antibody engineering has been hampered by conspicuous paucity of large scale full length Fv data.",

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technology enabled the sequencing of whole T-cell receptors (TCRs) and B-cell receptors (BCRs)/immunoglobulins (Igs) in the tumor microenvironment. Since BCRs/Igs in tumor tissues have high affinities for tumor-specific antigens, the patterns of their amino acid sequences and other sequence-independent features such as the number of somatic hypermutations (SHMs) may differ between the normal and tumor microenvironments. However, given the high diversity of BCRs/Igs and the rarity of recurrent sequences among individuals, it is far more difficult to capture such differences in BCR/Ig sequences than in TCR sequences. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of discriminating BCRs/Igs in tumor and in normal tissues, by capturing these differences using supervised machine learning methods applied to RNA sequences of BCRs/Igs. RNA sequences of BCRs/Igs were obtained from matched normal and tumor specimens from 90 gastric cancer patients. BCR/Ig-features obtained in Rep-Seq were used to classify individual BCR/Ig sequences into normal or tumor classes. Different machine learning models using various features were constructed as well as gradient boosting machine (GBM) classifier combining these models. The results demonstrated that BCR/Ig sequences between normal and tumor microenvironments exhibit their differences. Next, by using a GBM trained to classify individual BCR/Ig sequences, we tried to classify sets of BCR/Ig sequences into normal or tumor classes. As a result, an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.826 was achieved, suggesting that BCR/Ig repertoires have distinct sequence-level features in normal and tumor tissues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that BCR/Ig sequences derived from tumor and normal tissues have globally distinct patterns, and that these tissues can be effectively differentiated using BCR/Ig repertoires."

The Illumina short read platform is widely used for analyses of viral genomes and metagenomes, and, given sufficient sequencing coverage, enables sensitive characterization of lowfrequency variation within viral populations (e.g. HIV resistance mutations as low as 0.1% (Li et al., 2014)). Ion Torrent (ThermoFisher) is capable of generating longer reads than Illumina at the expense of reduced throughput and a higher rate of insertion and deletion (indel) error (Korlach et al., 2010)). Single molecule real-time sequencing commercialized by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) produces much longer (>10 kbp) reads from a single molecule without clonal amplification, which eliminates the errors introduced in this step. However, this platform has a high (10%) intrinsic error rate, and remains much more expensive than Illumina sequencing for equivalent throughput. The Nanopore platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which includes the pocket sized MinION sequencer, also implements long read single molecule sequencing, and permits truly real-time analysis of individual sequences as they are generated. Although more affordable than PacBio single molecule sequencing, the Nanopore platform also suffers from high error rates in comparison with Illumina (Reuter, Spacek, and Snyder 2015). However, the technology is maturing rapidly and has already demonstrated potential to revolutionize pathogen surveillance and discovery in the field, as well as enabling contiguous assembly of entire bacterial genomes at relatively low cost (Feng et al., 2015)(Quick et al., 2015)Hoenen et al. 2016).",

This outbreak was linked to community, national and European-wide cases. Hospital patients with Salmonella are at high risk, and require a rapid response. We initially investigated this outbreak by whole-genome sequencing using a novel rapid protocol on the Illumina MiSeq; we then integrated these data with whole-genome data from surveillance sequencing, thereby placing the outbreak in a national context. Additionally, we investigated the potential of a newly released sequencing technology, the MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, in the management of a hospital outbreak of Salmonella. We demonstrate that rapid MiSeq sequencing can reduce the time to answer compared to the standard sequencing protocol with no impact on the results. We show, for the first time, that the MinION can acquire clinically relevant information in real time and within minutes of a DNA library being loaded. MinION sequencing permits confident assignment to species level within 20 min. Using a novel streaming phylogenetic placement method samples can be assigned to a serotype in 40 min and determined to be part of the outbreak in less than 2 h.

Illumina sequencing offers greater throughput than 454, but sequence analysis tools for viral sequencing are needed. We evaluated Illumina and 454 for the detection of HIV-1 raltegravir-resistant MVs. Methods A5262 was a single-arm study of raltegravir and darunavir/ritonavir in treatment-na\u00efve patients. Pre-treatment plasma was obtained from 5 participants with raltegravir resistance at the time of virologic failure. A control library was created by pooling integrase clones at predefined proportions. Multiplexed sequencing was performed with Illumina and 454 platforms at comparable costs. Illumina sequence analysis was performed with the novel snp-assess tool and 454 sequencing was analyzed with V-Phaser. Results Illumina sequencing resulted in significantly higher sequence coverage and a 0.095% limit of detection. Illumina accurately detected all MVs in the control library at \u22650.5% and 7/10 MVs expected at 0.1%. 454 sequencing failed to detect any MVs at 0.1% with 5 false positive calls. For MVs detected in the patient samples by both 454 and Illumina, the correlation in the detected variant frequencies was high (R2\u200a=\u200a0.92, P<0.001). Illumina sequencing detected 2.4-fold greater nucleotide MVs and 2.9-fold greater amino acid MVs compared to 454. The only raltegravir-resistant MV detected was an E138K mutation in one participant by Illumina sequencing, but not by 454. Conclusions In participants of A5262 with raltegravir resistance at virologic failure, baseline raltegravir-resistant MVs were rarely detected. At comparable costs to 454 sequencing, Illumina demonstrated greater depth of coverage, increased sensitivity for detecting HIV MVs, and fewer false positive variant calls."

The Illumina short read platform is widely used for analyses of viral genomes and metagenomes, and, given sufficient sequencing coverage, enables sensitive characterization of lowfrequency variation within viral populations (e.g. HIV resistance mutations as low as 0.1% (Li et al., 2014)). Ion Torrent (ThermoFisher) is capable of generating longer reads than Illumina at the expense of reduced throughput and a higher rate of insertion and deletion (indel) error (Korlach et al., 2010)). Single molecule real-time sequencing commercialized by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) produces much longer (>10 kbp) reads from a single molecule without clonal amplification, which eliminates the errors introduced in this step. However, this platform has a high (10%) intrinsic error rate, and remains much more expensive than Illumina sequencing for equivalent throughput. The Nanopore platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which includes the pocket sized MinION sequencer, also implements long read single molecule sequencing, and permits truly real-time analysis of individual sequences as they are generated. Although more affordable than PacBio single molecule sequencing, the Nanopore platform also suffers from high error rates in comparison with Illumina (Reuter, Spacek, and Snyder 2015). However, the technology is maturing rapidly and has already demonstrated potential to revolutionize pathogen surveillance and discovery in the field, as well as enabling contiguous assembly of entire bacterial genomes at relatively low cost (Feng et al., 2015)(Quick et al., 2015)Hoenen et al. 2016)."

Illumina sequencing technology has made tremendous advances in data output and cost efficiency over the past few years and as a result, presently dominates the NGS market (Dohm et al., 2008)(Reuter et al., 2015). Illumina sequencing technology has been used extensively in numerous microbiome research projects (Evans et al., 2014)(Lambeth et al., 2015)(Yasir et al., 2015), including the Human Microbiome Project (Huttenhower et al., 2012). While both Ion Torrent and Illumina sequencers provide a number of advantages in terms of their cost and efficiency, the short read lengths they provide make them less appropriate for addressing a number of scientific questions, including detection of gene isoforms, methylation detection, and genome assembly (Rothberg et al., 2011). SMRT (single-molecule real-time) sequencing platforms offer approaches that are more suited for these research objectives. Since PacBiosequencing generates longer reads that provide longer scaffolds (Travers et al., 2010)(Carneiro et al., 2012)(Rhoads et al., 2015), it is well suited for denovo genome assembly. The commercial availability of MinION sequencers by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which resemble a USB flash drive in appearance, has also enabled applications that require long-read sequencing (Ashton et al., 2014)(Jain et al., 2015). The efficiency, long read lengths, and single-base sensitivity make nanopore sequencing technology a promising approach for highthroughput sequencing.",

Exercise (Ex) is effective in preventing obesity, but whether Ex alters the gut microbiota during development with high fat (HF) feeding is unknown. Objective Determine the effects of voluntary Ex on the gastrointestinal microbiota in LF-fed mice and in HF-DIO. Methods Male C57BL/6 littermates (5 weeks) were distributed equally into 4 groups: low fat (LF) sedentary (Sed) LF/Sed, LF/Ex, HF/Sed and HF/Ex. Mice were individually housed and LF/Ex and HF/Ex cages were equipped with a wheel and odometer to record Ex. Fecal samples were collected at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks and used for bacterial DNA isolation. DNA was subjected both to quantitative PCR using primers specific to the 16S rRNA encoding genes for Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and to sequencing for lower taxonomic identification using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Data were analyzed using a one or two-way ANOVA or Pearson correlation. Results HF diet resulted in significantly greater body weight and adiposity as well as decreased glucose tolerance that were prevented by voluntary Ex (p<0.05). Visualization of Unifrac distance data with principal coordinates analysis indicated clustering by both diet and Ex at week 12. Sequencing demonstrated Ex-induced changes in the percentage of major bacterial phyla at 12 weeks. A correlation between total Ex distance and the \u0394Ct Bacteroidetes: \u0394Ct Firmicutes ratio from qPCR demonstrated a significant inverse correlation (r2\u200a=\u200a0.35, p\u200a=\u200a0.043). Conclusion Ex induces a unique shift in the gut microbiota that is different from dietary effects. Microbiota changes may play a role in Ex prevention of HF-DIO.",

These technologies are likely to revolutionize genetics and biomedical research, but a thorough characterization of the ultra-short read output is necessary. We generated and analyzed two Illumina 1G ultra-short read data sets, i.e. 2.8 million 27mer reads from a Beta vulgaris genomic clone and 12.3 million 36mers from the Helicobacter acinonychis genome. We found that error rates range from 0.3% at the beginning of reads to 3.8% at the end of reads. Wrong base calls are frequently preceded by base G. Base substitution error frequencies vary by 10- to 11-fold, with A > C transversion being among the most frequent and C > G transversions among the least frequent substitution errors. Insertions and deletions of single bases occur at very low rates. When simulating re-sequencing we found a 20-fold sequencing coverage to be sufficient to compensate errors by correct reads. The read coverage of the sequenced regions is biased; the highest read density was found in intervals with elevated GC content. High Solexa quality scores are over-optimistic and low scores underestimate the data quality. Our results show different types of biases and ways to detect them. Such biases have implications on the use and interpretation of Solexa data, for de novo sequencing, re-sequencing, the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms and DNA methylation sites, as well as for transcriptome analysis.",

We evaluated the Pacific Biosciences technology for SNP discovery in medical resequencing projects using the Genome Analysis Toolkit, observing high sensitivity and specificity for calling differences in amplicons containing known true or false SNPs. We assessed data quality: most errors were indels (~14%) with few apparent miscalls (~1%). In this work, we define a custom data processing pipeline for Pacific Biosciences data for human data analysis.

Illumina sequencing technology has made tremendous advances in data output and cost efficiency over the past few years and as a result, presently dominates the NGS market (Dohm et al., 2008)(Reuter et al., 2015). Illumina sequencing technology has been used extensively in numerous microbiome research projects (Evans et al., 2014)(Lambeth et al., 2015)(Yasir et al., 2015), including the Human Microbiome Project (Huttenhower et al., 2012). While both Ion Torrent and Illumina sequencers provide a number of advantages in terms of their cost and efficiency, the short read lengths they provide make them less appropriate for addressing a number of scientific questions, including detection of gene isoforms, methylation detection, and genome assembly (Rothberg et al., 2011). SMRT (single-molecule real-time) sequencing platforms offer approaches that are more suited for these research objectives. Since PacBiosequencing generates longer reads that provide longer scaffolds (Travers et al., 2010)(Carneiro et al., 2012)(Rhoads et al., 2015), it is well suited for denovo genome assembly. The commercial availability of MinION sequencers by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which resemble a USB flash drive in appearance, has also enabled applications that require long-read sequencing (Ashton et al., 2014)(Jain et al., 2015). The efficiency, long read lengths, and single-base sensitivity make nanopore sequencing technology a promising approach for highthroughput sequencing."

It has been adopted as a critical technology in the development of therapeutic antibodies. However, a major drawback of phage display technology is that because the degree of the enrichment cannot be controlled during the bio-panning process, it frequently results in a limited number of clones. In this study, we applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) to screen clones from a library and determine whether a greater number of clones can be identified using NGS than using conventional methods. Three chicken immune single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries were subjected to bio-panning on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Phagemid DNA prepared from the original libraries as well as from the Escherichia coli pool after each round of bio-panning was analyzed using NGS, and the heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences of the scFv clones were determined. Subsequently, through two-step linker PCR and cloning, the entire scFv gene was retrieved and analyzed for its reactivity to PSA in a phage enzyme immunoassay. After four rounds of bio-panning, the conventional colony screening method was performed for comparison. The scFv clones retrieved from NGS analysis included all clones identified by the conventional colony screening method as well as many additional clones. The enrichment of the HCDR3 sequence throughout the bio-panning process was a positive predictive factor for the selection of PSA-reactive scFv clones.",

This approach allowed for in depth analysis of the library\u2019s diversity, provided sequence information on virtually all scFv during selection for binding to two targets and a global view of these enrichment processes. Using the most frequent heavy chain CDR3 sequences, primers were designed to rescue scFv from the third selection round. Identification, based on sequence frequency, retrieved the most potent scFv and valuable candidates that were missed using classical in vitro screening. Thus, by combining NGS with display technologies, laborious and time consuming upfront screening can be by-passed or complemented and valuable insights into the selection process can be obtained to improve library design and understanding of antibody repertoires."

                            "Currently, the selection of phages to be used for the development of therapeutic applications is understandably driven by phenotypic characterization and activity against target pathogens, with genetic characterization often a secondary activity primarily used to screen for undesirable genes such as toxins. However, the generation of phage genome sequences is now accessible and affordable, and the increasing range of tools available for analyzing these data mean this aspect of phage characterization should now be viewed as a primary process in the selection of candidate phage for the development of therapeutic products, or other biotechnological applications. Although next generation sequencing technologies generating short reads (such as Illumina platform sequencing) can pose challenges in the correct assembly of some phage genomes, such approaches can still provide useful information regarding phage gene content and broader evolutionary relationships. However, technologies such as single molecule nanopore sequencing can potentially generate genome length reads, and we demonstrate here some of their potential to address many of the current limitations of next generation sequencing for phage genome analysis, related to read length."

                            "The current market leader, Illumina, manufactures instruments capable of generating billions of 150 base pair (bp) paired end reads (see 'Glossary') per run, with read lengths of up to 300 bp. The Illumina short read platform is widely used for analyses of viral genomes and metagenomes, and, given sufficient sequencing coverage, enables sensitive characterization of lowfrequency variation within viral populations (e.g. HIV resistance mutations as low as 0.1% (Li et al., 2014)). Ion Torrent (ThermoFisher) is capable of generating longer reads than Illumina at the expense of reduced throughput and a higher rate of insertion and deletion (indel) error (Korlach et al., 2010)). Single molecule real-time sequencing commercialized by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) produces much longer (>10 kbp) reads from a single molecule without clonal amplification, which eliminates the errors introduced in this step. However, this platform has a high (10%) intrinsic error rate, and remains much more expensive than Illumina sequencing for equivalent throughput. The Nanopore platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which includes the pocket sized MinION sequencer, also implements long read single molecule sequencing, and permits truly real-time analysis of individual sequences as they are generated. Although more affordable than PacBio single molecule sequencing, the Nanopore platform also suffers from high error rates in comparison with Illumina (Reuter, Spacek, and Snyder 2015). However, the technology is maturing rapidly and has already demonstrated potential to revolutionize pathogen surveillance and discovery in the field, as well as enabling contiguous assembly of entire bacterial genomes at relatively low cost (Feng et al., 2015)(Quick et al., 2015)Hoenen et al. 2016)."

Illumina sequencing technology has made tremendous advances in data output and cost efficiency over the past few years and as a result, presently dominates the NGS market (Dohm et al., 2008)(Reuter et al., 2015). Illumina sequencing technology has been used extensively in numerous microbiome research projects (Evans et al., 2014)(Lambeth et al., 2015)(Yasir et al., 2015), including the Human Microbiome Project (Huttenhower et al., 2012). While both Ion Torrent and Illumina sequencers provide a number of advantages in terms of their cost and efficiency, the short read lengths they provide make them less appropriate for addressing a number of scientific questions, including detection of gene isoforms, methylation detection, and genome assembly (Rothberg et al., 2011). SMRT (single-molecule real-time) sequencing platforms offer approaches that are more suited for these research objectives. Since PacBiosequencing generates longer reads that provide longer scaffolds (Travers et al., 2010)(Carneiro et al., 2012)(Rhoads et al., 2015), it is well suited for denovo genome assembly. The commercial availability of MinION sequencers by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which resemble a USB flash drive in appearance, has also enabled applications that require long-read sequencing (Ashton et al., 2014)(Jain et al., 2015). The efficiency, long read lengths, and single-base sensitivity make nanopore sequencing technology a promising approach for highthroughput sequencing."

                            "Novel sequencing technologies permit the rapid production of large sequence data sets. These technologies are likely to revolutionize genetics and biomedical research, but a thorough characterization of the ultra-short read output is necessary. We generated and analyzed two Illumina 1G ultra-short read data sets, i.e. 2.8 million 27mer reads from a Beta vulgaris genomic clone and 12.3 million 36mers from the Helicobacter acinonychis genome. We found that error rates range from 0.3% at the beginning of reads to 3.8% at the end of reads. Wrong base calls are frequently preceded by base G. Base substitution error frequencies vary by 10- to 11-fold, with A > C transversion being among the most frequent and C > G transversions among the least frequent substitution errors. Insertions and deletions of single bases occur at very low rates. When simulating re-sequencing we found a 20-fold sequencing coverage to be sufficient to compensate errors by correct reads. The read coverage of the sequenced regions is biased; the highest read density was found in intervals with elevated GC content. High Solexa quality scores are over-optimistic and low scores underestimate the data quality. Our results show different types of biases and ways to detect them. Such biases have implications on the use and interpretation of Solexa data, for de novo sequencing, re-sequencing, the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms and DNA methylation sites, as well as for transcriptome analysis."

                            "To date, well-established Illumina devices clearly dominate the field of immune repertoire sequencing, as they offer high-quality short-sequencing reads at unexcelled throughput. Deep resolution of the vast immune repertoire sequence space enables better insights into the diversity of unique BCR and TCR sequences (>10 13 in humans) and allows detection of shared clones across individuals, so called ''public clones'' (Soto et al., 2019;Briney et al., 2019;Greiff et al., 2017a;DeWitt et al., 2018).\n\nPaired-end sequencing on Illumina allows coverage of one variable region of immune receptors; however, for approaches that rely on complete immune receptor sequence coverage and hence require longer read lengths, an alternative platform is offered by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) (Eid et al., 2009). PacBio's sequencing technology is based on single-molecule sequencing. Each DNA template molecule gets isolated in a microwell, together with a single polymerase and fluorescently labeled nucleotides. Importantly, the DNA templates are circularized before sequencing, allowing for repeated readout by the polymerase. This allows for consensus reading, achieving read accuracies of over 99% with high-fidelity read lengths up to 15 kb (Wenger et al., 2019). With the recent introduction of the PacBio Sequel II system, sequencing depths of 4 million reads per run can be achieved. Hence, PacBio can be utilized for sequencing immune receptor repertoires where variable regions (e.g., variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL)) are physically linked in the context of single-cell sequencing (DeKosky et al., 2013;McDaniel et al., 2016). Moreover, longread sequencing is in particular valuable for in vitro screening platforms (e.g., phage display), which for instance utilize recombinant antibody fragment libraries known as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). Sequencing of full-length scFvs is important for covering both VH and VL diversity, which is critical in assessing quality of such libraries and their utility for drug discovery (Hemadou et al., 2017;Han et al., 2018)."

                            "The principal drawback of high-throughput sequencing applied to antibody display libraries is related to the limited maximum read length attainable with classical NGS platforms, which is far from the average size of scFv and Fab formats (respectively 800 and 1500 bp). The most used NGS platforms in the antibody discovery field are MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), Roche 454 (now discontinued) and Ion Torrent (Life Technologies) (Waltham, MA, USA), which offer a good balance between the maximum read length and acceptable error rate (about 300 bp and 0.1%, 600-800 bp and 1%, and 400 bp and 1%, respectively). In any case, the whole sequence information of an scFv is split into smaller fragments corresponding to the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) regions (Rouet et al., 2018)[58][59][60]",
                            ".In recent years, third-generation sequencing platforms (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies) have been developed to generate ultra-long reads from single molecules without the need for PCR amplification. While the use of these real-time sequencing platforms was initially disadvantaged by low-throughput and high error rate (>10%), chemically upgraded platforms (PacBio RS II and Sequel series) as well as bioinformatics algorithms (e.g., Nanopore's Bonito) have dramatically improved their output, allowing to obtain very long reads and a sharp reduction in the costs. The greatest breakthrough in third-generation sequencing was the development of circular consensus sequencing, by which a single molecule can be circularized and sequenced several times to radically reduce the error rate. These technical and bioinformatic improvements have led to obtaining ultralong (up to 25 kilobases) and increasingly accurate (99.9% for PacBio; 97% for Nanopore) reads [49]65]."

                            "Over the last decade, third-generation long-read sequencing technologies have emerged to address the limitations referred to above, most notably from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) (Korlach et al., 2010) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) [19]. These can achieve read length orders of magnitude higher than those produced by the short-read platforms. However, their initial error-rates were very high (10-15%) (Athanasopoulou et al., 2021). The latest PacBio Sequel IIe system generates reads of average length 10-15 kb, producing 500 Gb of data within 30 h of running (Athanasopoulou et al., 2021). The PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) can now generate high fidelity (HiFi) long-reads with an error-rate of less than 1% (Wenger et al., 2019). As a comparison, the Oxford Nanopore PromethION 48 generates reads with a maximum length of more than 4 Mb, producing 14 Tb of data within 72 h of running (Athanasopoulou et al., 2021). The new ONT R.10 chemistry allows for a mean consensus single molecule error-rate of less than 1%. These two technologies can sequence non-amplified input DNA, and tend to require simpler sequencing library preparation protocols that are quicker to perform (minimum time of 10 min for library construction) than those needed for short-read sequencing (several days) (Quick et al., 2015). Oxford Nanopore devices are now also capable of displaying the generated sequence in real-time, enabling adaptive sampling of the reads being sequenced, in order to select (or reject) reads by their sequence properties as they transit through the nanopores. In addition, Oxford Nanopore devices have the advantage of being very portable, with a proven track record even in extreme environments such as the International Space Station [23]. However, current deficiencies in both base-calling accuracy and cost-efficiency, relative to short-read platforms, have meant that third-generation long-read sequencing has not yet overtaken short-read sequencing in popularity."

                            "The DNA sequencing technologies in use today produce either highly accurate short reads or less-accurate long reads. We report the optimization of circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to improve the accuracy of single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (PacBio) and generate highly accurate (99.8%) long high-fidelity (HiFi) reads with an average length of 13.5\u2009kilobases (kb). We applied our approach to sequence the well-characterized human HG002/NA24385 genome and obtained precision and recall rates of at least 99.91% for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 95.98% for insertions and deletions <50 bp (indels) and 95.99% for structural variants. Our CCS method matches or exceeds the ability of short-read sequencing to detect small variants and structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the \u2018genome in a bottle\u2019 (GIAB) benchmark set. Nearly all (99.64%) variants can be phased into haplotypes, further improving variant detection. De novo genome assembly using CCS reads alone produced a contiguous and accurate genome with a contig N50 of >15\u2009megabases (Mb) and concordance of 99.997%, substantially outperforming assembly with less-accurate long reads. High-fidelity reads improve variant detection and genome assembly on the PacBio platform."

For 23 bacterial and 3 archaeal species, the PacBio complete 16S rRNA gene sequences showed less ambiguous classifications than the Illumina V4 16S rRNA gene sequences (Singer et al., 2016), demonstrating it to be a powerful tool for detecting more marine microbial species at the genus and species levels (Wang et al., 2022). Oxford nanopore technology, another third-generation platform for singlemolecule real-time sequencing, depends on a single base of nucleic acids and a protein nanopore reader.

Very recently, nanopore sequencing using the Oxford sequencing technology has also become an interesting alternative sequencing platform.

Oxford Nanopore offers compact, high-throughput machines and rapid runtime that may make this method the standard choice for both sequencing of purified single phage as well as phage enumeration and detection. MinION TM , a portable sequencer of Oxford Nanopore was used to detect RNA (MS2) and DNA (PhiX174) phages from water samples. Both phages were successfully detected even at low concentrations, 155 PFU/mL and 1 to 2 PFU/mL for MS2 and PhiX174, respectively.

We recently detected a large outbreak of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis phage type 14b affecting more than 30 patients in our hospital. This outbreak was linked to community, national and European-wide cases. Hospital patients with Salmonella are at high risk, and require a rapid response. We initially investigated this outbreak by whole-genome sequencing using a novel rapid protocol on the Illumina MiSeq; we then integrated these data with whole-genome data from surveillance sequencing, thereby placing the outbreak in a national context. Additionally, we investigated the potential of a newly released sequencing technology, the MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, in the management of a hospital outbreak of Salmonella. We demonstrate that rapid MiSeq sequencing can reduce the time to answer compared to the standard sequencing protocol with no impact on the results. We show, for the first time, that the MinION can acquire clinically relevant information in real time and within minutes of a DNA library being loaded. MinION sequencing permits confident assignment to species level within 20 min. Using a novel streaming phylogenetic placement method samples can be assigned to a serotype in 40 min and determined to be part of the outbreak in less than 2 h. Both approaches yielded reliable and actionable clinical information on the Salmonella outbreak in less than half a day. The rapid availability of such information may facilitate more informed epidemiological investigations and influence infection control practices."

                "tldr": "Sequencing platform selection for antibody phage display libraries involves critical tradeoffs between read length and depth, with each technology offering distinct advantages. While Illumina excels at deep repertoire analysis, PacBio and Nanopore technologies have emerged as valuable tools for full-length antibody fragment sequencing despite their historically lower throughput. (12 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe application of next-generation sequencing to antibody phage display libraries presents unique challenges due to the length and complexity of antibody gene fragments. Illumina platforms, with their high throughput and accuracy, have dominated immune repertoire sequencing but face significant limitations when applied to full-length antibody fragments. While Illumina can produce hundreds of millions of reads at relatively low cost, its short read lengths (up to 150-300bp) restrict its utility mainly to CDR3 sequencing or individual variable regions rather than complete antibody fragments <Paper corpusId=\"199451388\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This limitation forces researchers to analyze VH and VL regions separately, losing crucial pairing information <Paper corpusId=\"249254439\" paperTitle=\"(Moura-Sampaio et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor antibody display libraries containing single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), which typically range from 800-1500bp, complete sequence information requires platforms capable of longer reads. This challenge is even more pronounced with Fab fragments, which are too long to be captured in a single read by short-read technologies <Paper corpusId=\"247312322\" paperTitle=\"(Zambrano et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. The PacBio platform has emerged as a particularly valuable solution for sequencing full-length scFvs and paired VH:VL libraries, enabling coverage of both variable regions in a single read <Paper corpusId=\"221406320\" paperTitle=\"(Csepregi et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This capability is critical for assessing library quality and utility in drug discovery <Paper corpusId=\"221406320\" paperTitle=\"(Csepregi et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"58546088\" paperTitle=\"(Briney et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe third-generation sequencing platforms have addressed a significant limitation in antibody phage display technology. Nannini and colleagues demonstrated that SMRT sequencing coupled with hairpin adaptor loop ligation facilitates accurate interrogation of full-length scFv libraries, allowing rapid isolation and testing of enriched antibodies within days following panning <Paper corpusId=\"229940603\" paperTitle=\"(Nannini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Their approach led to the identification of functional antibodies that were not detected by conventional screening methods <Paper corpusId=\"229940603\" paperTitle=\"(Nannini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This advantage has been further enhanced with newer PacBio instruments like the Sequel II, which offers greater accuracy and higher throughput than previous models <Paper corpusId=\"271114246\" paperTitle=\"(Salvy et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHowever, researchers face a critical tradeoff between read length and sequencing depth. While long-read technologies like PacBio can sequence complete antibody fragments, they provide relatively low numbers of reads (typically up to 8\u00d710\u2074) compared to Illumina <Paper corpusId=\"249254439\" paperTitle=\"(Moura-Sampaio et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This limitation potentially misses rare clones that may have equivalent or sometimes higher affinities than the more frequent ones <Paper corpusId=\"249254439\" paperTitle=\"(Moura-Sampaio et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"264516597\" paperTitle=\"(Erasmus et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. For accurate repertoire analysis, high base quality is essential to distinguish true diversity from sequencing errors, which has historically favored Illumina platforms for certain applications despite their read length limitations <Paper corpusId=\"199451388\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nDifferent types of antibody libraries have varying sequencing requirements. For nanobody libraries derived from camelid heavy chain-only antibodies or shark variable new antigen receptors (VNARs), which are shorter, Illumina's paired-end MiSeq (2 \u00d7 300 bp) can provide sufficient coverage <Paper corpusId=\"277414495\" paperTitle=\"(Pan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15659069\" paperTitle=\"(Turner et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"15881717\" paperTitle=\"(Deschaght et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. Long-read capabilities become especially critical for larger constructs like Human Fab libraries with linked heavy and light chains (1.2-1.5 kb) <Paper corpusId=\"277414495\" paperTitle=\"(Pan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nWith ongoing improvements in long-read sequencing technology, the field continues to evolve. Researchers have developed innovative approaches like using unique molecular identifiers to pair separately sequenced VH and VL regions, allowing comprehensive mapping of full-length Fv clonal dynamics even with shorter-read technologies <Paper corpusId=\"257922737\" paperTitle=\"(Levin et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. As these technologies advance, they promise to enhance our ability to thoroughly characterize antibody phage display libraries for diverse applications.",

However, these short-read technologies (up to 150 bp) are of limited use. Although they are applicable to sequencing of CDR3, they are not applicable to full-length sequencing of variable regions of VH or VL. In order to sequence full-length variable regions, ranging from 400-600 bp, of VH and VL separately, MiSeq is the best platform as it is capable of producing reads of length 2 \u00d7 300 bp. However, its throughput is only up to 25M. Oxford Nanopore sequencing and Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing of PacBio are suitable for long gDNA library and VH:VL pairing library in principle. However, they are rarely applied to repertoire sequencing because bases of high quality are indispensable to discriminate true diversity from errors."

While the widespread use of single-cell technologies has allowed V L :V H pairings to be retrieved from in vivo campaigns, 16,17 the issue has only been partially tackled for the commonly-used phage-display technique. Here, researchers are required to chose between read length and sequencing depth. On one hand, a long-read NGS technology such as PacBio will allow the sequencing of both variable chains, but with a relatively low number of reads (up to $ 8 \u00c2 10 4 ) 18 . Despite being sufficient to sample high frequency (and likely, high-affinity) clones near the top of the dataset, low-depth sequencing will not allow the capturing of less-frequent rarer clones, which often show equivalent or sometimes higher affinities. 19 This is also incompatible with the deep inspection of motifs and patterns within the dataset. 2 On the other hand, the highdepth NGS platforms available do not have the read length necessary to cover both variable chains, which means the analysis of phage-displayed Fab/scFv libraries or selection outputs is usually restricted to V L or V H in those cases."

                            "The principal drawback of high-throughput sequencing applied to antibody display libraries is related to the limited maximum read length attainable with classical NGS platforms, which is far from the average size of scFv and Fab formats (respectively 800 and 1500 bp). The most used NGS platforms in the antibody discovery field are MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), Roche 454 (now discontinued) and Ion Torrent (Life Technologies) (Waltham, MA, USA), which offer a good balance between the maximum read length and acceptable error rate (about 300 bp and 0.1%, 600-800 bp and 1%, and 400 bp and 1%, respectively). In any case, the whole sequence information of an scFv is split into smaller fragments corresponding to the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) regions (Rouet et al., 2018)[58][59][60]",
                            ".In recent years, third-generation sequencing platforms (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies) have been developed to generate ultra-long reads from single molecules without the need for PCR amplification. While the use of these real-time sequencing platforms was initially disadvantaged by low-throughput and high error rate (>10%), chemically upgraded platforms (PacBio RS II and Sequel series) as well as bioinformatics algorithms (e.g., Nanopore's Bonito) have dramatically improved their output, allowing to obtain very long reads and a sharp reduction in the costs. The greatest breakthrough in third-generation sequencing was the development of circular consensus sequencing, by which a single molecule can be circularized and sequenced several times to radically reduce the error rate. These technical and bioinformatic improvements have led to obtaining ultralong (up to 25 kilobases) and increasingly accurate (99.9% for PacBio; 97% for Nanopore) reads [49]65]."

                            "To date, well-established Illumina devices clearly dominate the field of immune repertoire sequencing, as they offer high-quality short-sequencing reads at unexcelled throughput. Deep resolution of the vast immune repertoire sequence space enables better insights into the diversity of unique BCR and TCR sequences (>10 13 in humans) and allows detection of shared clones across individuals, so called ''public clones'' (Soto et al., 2019;Briney et al., 2019;Greiff et al., 2017a;DeWitt et al., 2018).\n\nPaired-end sequencing on Illumina allows coverage of one variable region of immune receptors; however, for approaches that rely on complete immune receptor sequence coverage and hence require longer read lengths, an alternative platform is offered by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) (Eid et al., 2009). PacBio's sequencing technology is based on single-molecule sequencing. Each DNA template molecule gets isolated in a microwell, together with a single polymerase and fluorescently labeled nucleotides. Importantly, the DNA templates are circularized before sequencing, allowing for repeated readout by the polymerase. This allows for consensus reading, achieving read accuracies of over 99% with high-fidelity read lengths up to 15 kb (Wenger et al., 2019). With the recent introduction of the PacBio Sequel II system, sequencing depths of 4 million reads per run can be achieved. Hence, PacBio can be utilized for sequencing immune receptor repertoires where variable regions (e.g., variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL)) are physically linked in the context of single-cell sequencing (DeKosky et al., 2013;McDaniel et al., 2016). Moreover, longread sequencing is in particular valuable for in vitro screening platforms (e.g., phage display), which for instance utilize recombinant antibody fragment libraries known as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). Sequencing of full-length scFvs is important for covering both VH and VL diversity, which is critical in assessing quality of such libraries and their utility for drug discovery (Hemadou et al., 2017;Han et al., 2018)."

                            "In principle, humans can produce an antibody response to any non-self-antigen molecule in the appropriate context. This flexibility is achieved by the presence of a large repertoire of naive antibodies, the diversity of which is expanded by somatic hypermutation following antigen exposure1. The diversity of the naive antibody repertoire in humans is estimated to be at least 1012 unique antibodies2. Because the number of peripheral blood B cells in a healthy adult human is on the order of 5 \u00d7 109, the circulating B cell population samples only a small fraction of this diversity. Full-scale analyses of human antibody repertoires have been prohibitively difficult, primarily owing to their massive size. The amount of information encoded by all of the rearranged antibody and T cell receptor genes in one person\u2014the \u2018genome\u2019 of the adaptive immune system\u2014exceeds the size of the human genome by more than four orders of magnitude. Furthermore, because much of the B lymphocyte population is localized in organs or tissues that cannot be comprehensively sampled from living subjects, human repertoire studies have focused on circulating B cells3. Here we examine the circulating B cell populations of ten human subjects and present what is, to our knowledge, the largest single collection of adaptive immune receptor sequences described to date, comprising almost 3 billion antibody heavy-chain sequences. This dataset enables genetic study of the baseline human antibody repertoire at an unprecedented depth and granularity, which reveals largely unique repertoires for each individual studied, a subpopulation of universally shared antibody clonotypes, and an exceptional overall diversity of the antibody repertoire. A genetic study of the baseline human antibody repertoire, based on the circulating B cell populations of ten subjects, reveals universally shared antibody clonotypes within repertoires that are largely unique to the individual."

                            "NGS technologies have been used in combination with phage display in a number of applications. (Hu et al., 2015)(Turner et al., 2016) While NGS allows in-depth analysis of phage display libraries, its widespread use has been hampered by limitations in read length (Matochko et al., 2012)27 and signal integrity (Waltari et al., 2019) of several sequencing technologies. These limitations have meant that most sequencing applications have only covered a single variable domain within a library, showing the greatest utility in the sequencing of single domain antibody libraries. (Miyazaki et al., 2015)(Deschaght et al., 2017) Yang and colleagues recently described the use of phage display data obtained using MiSeq sequencing to isolate antibodies from scFv libraries that had undergone multiple rounds of panning. The data sets obtained had high sequence depth and allowed generation of antibodies against the target antigen of interest; however, a key limitation to the method was the use of limited read length within the sequencing data that required additional PCR amplification to retrieve the full sequence of the clones. (Yang et al., 2017) Here, we used the PacBio sequencing platform combined with SMRTbell technology to generate highly accurate full-length scFv sequence repertoires from immune libraries selected through conventional phage display biopanning targeting the cell surface antigens CD160 and CD123."

                            "Therapeutic antibody discovery often relies on in-vitro display methods to identify lead candidates. Assessing selected output diversity traditionally involves random colony picking and Sanger sequencing, which has limitations. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers a cost-effective solution with increased read depth, allowing a comprehensive understanding of diversity. Our study establishes NGS guidelines for antibody drug discovery, demonstrating its advantages in expanding the number of unique HCDR3 clusters, broadening the number of high affinity antibodies, expanding the total number of antibodies recognizing different epitopes, and improving lead prioritization. Surprisingly, our investigation into the correlation between NGS-derived frequencies of CDRs and affinity revealed a lack of association, although this limitation could be moderately mitigated by leveraging NGS clustering, enrichment and/or relative abundance across different regions to enhance lead prioritization. This study highlights NGS benefits, offering insights, recommendations, and the most effective approach to leverage NGS in therapeutic antibody discovery."

                            "A major limitation of the traditional phage-panning platform is the laborious workflow and low throughput of obtaining antibody gene sequences relying on Sanger sequencing [16].\n\nTo improve upon the traditional workflow and obtain a more diverse panel of sequences after panning, a commonly used next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform is MiSeq from Illumina. Paired-end MiSeq (2 \u00d7 300 bp) sequencing from Illumina covers segments of about 500 bp and has been successfully applied to the investigation of shorter antibody fragment libraries, such as nanobodies derived from the camelid's variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies [17,18], as well as the shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) [19]. Paired-end MiSeq can also read amplicons long enough to cover all CDRs in single-chain Fv (scFv) [20]. However, paired-end MiSeq is not sufficient to cover longer light and heavy chain-combined sequences (1.2-1.5 kb), which are linked together in Human Fab libraries [21,22].\n\nThird-generation NGS technology such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) can bridge the shortcomings of current MiSeq sequencing [23], as it is possible to achieve long sequencing reads of 10 to 15 kb in length with single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) [24]. PacBio's NGS had been applied successfully to scFv fragment libraries [25,26]. In particular, Han et al. applied PacBio's platform to the deep sequencing of the immune rhesus macaque scFv phage library to identify additional unique antibody gene sequences previously not seen in their Sanger sequencing results [26]."

                            "Next-Generation Sequencing and bioinformatics are powerful tools for analyzing the large number of DNA sequences present in an immune library. In this work, we constructed a cDNA library of single domain antibodies from a llama immunized with staphylococcal enterotoxin B. The resulting library was sequenced, resulting in approximately 8.5 million sequences with 5.4 million representing intact, useful sequences. The sequenced library was interrogated using sequences of known SEB-binding single domain antibodies from the library obtained through phage display panning methods in a previous study. New antibodies were identified, produced, and characterized, and were shown to have affinities and melting temperatures comparable to those obtained by traditional panning methods. This demonstrates the utility of using NGS as a complementary tool to phage-displayed biopanning as a means for rapidly obtaining additional antibodies from an immune library. It also shows that phage display, using a library of high diversity, is able to select high quality antibodies even when they are low in frequency."

                            "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been applied successfully to the field of therapeutic antibody discovery, often outperforming conventional screening campaigns which tend to identify only the more abundant selective antibody sequences. We used NGS to mine the functional nanobody repertoire from a phage-displayed camelid immune library directed to the recepteur d\u2019origine nantais (RON) receptor kinase. Challenges to this application of NGS include accurate removal of read errors, correct identification of related sequences, and establishing meaningful inclusion criteria for sequences-of-interest. To this end, a sequence identity threshold was defined to separate unrelated full-length sequence clusters by exploring a large diverse set of publicly available nanobody sequences. When combined with majority-rule consensus building, applying this elegant clustering approach to the NGS data set revealed a wealth of >5,000-enriched candidate RON binders. The huge binding potential predicted by the NGS approach was explored through a set of randomly selected candidates: 90% were confirmed as RON binders, 50% of which functionally blocked RON in an ERK phosphorylation assay. Additional validation came from the correct prediction of all 35 RON binding nanobodies which were identified by a conventional screening campaign of the same immune library. More detailed characterization of a subset of RON binders revealed excellent functional potencies and a promising epitope diversity. In summary, our approach exposes the functional diversity and quality of the outbred camelid heavy chain-only immune response and confirms the power of NGS to identify large numbers of promising nanobodies."

                            "Abstract Deep parallel sequencing (NGS) is a viable tool for monitoring scFv and Fab library dynamics in many antibody engineering high-throughput screening efforts. Although very useful, the commonly used Illumina NGS platform cannot handle the entire sequence of scFv or Fab in a single read, usually focusing on specific CDRs or resorting to sequencing VH and VL variable domains separately, thus limiting its utility in comprehensive monitoring of selection dynamics. Here we present a simple and robust method for deep sequencing repertoires of full length scFv, Fab and Fv antibody sequences. This process utilizes standard molecular procedures and unique molecular identifiers (UMI) to pair separately sequenced VH and VL. We show that UMI assisted VH-VL matching allows for a comprehensive and highly accurate mapping of full length Fv clonal dynamics in large highly homologous antibody libraries, as well as identification of rare variants. In addition to its utility in synthetic antibody discovery processes, our method can be instrumental in generating large datasets for machine learning (ML) applications, which in the field of antibody engineering has been hampered by conspicuous paucity of large scale full length Fv data."

While Illumina's high throughput enables comprehensive diversity assessment, Nanopore technology offers advantages for identifying enriched peptide sequences despite lower accuracy. (6 sources)",
                "text": "\nPeptide phage display libraries present unique sequencing challenges and opportunities compared to antibody libraries, particularly regarding the assessment of library diversity and quality. The significantly shorter length of displayed peptides (typically 7-20 amino acids) makes them amenable to complete coverage even with short-read technologies, shifting the primary concern from read length to sequencing depth. For peptide libraries, capturing the maximum possible number of library members is crucial for accurate diversity assessment and quality evaluation. High sequencing depth allows researchers to characterize library composition more comprehensively and measure diversity with greater precision <Paper corpusId=\"257516339\" paperTitle=\"(Sloth et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe application of high-throughput sequencing to peptide libraries has revealed critical insights that were impossible to detect with traditional sequencing methods. Matochko and colleagues demonstrated that phage-displayed peptide libraries can undergo a dramatic collapse in diversity after just a single round of growth in bacteria, with a library theoretically containing millions of sequences collapsing to just a few hundred abundant sequences. This phenomenon would have remained undetectable using small-scale Sanger sequencing and would have been difficult to observe even with lower-throughput technologies like 454 sequencing <Paper corpusId=\"4632668\" paperTitle=\"(Matochko et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nNext-generation sequencing has significantly improved the screening process for peptide phage display libraries by increasing sampling depth compared to conventional in vitro screening methods. The high-resolution information provided by NGS enables detection of rare clones that would otherwise be missed by traditional screening approaches <Paper corpusId=\"73444750\" paperTitle=\"(Noh et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"2340454\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This capability is particularly valuable for peptide libraries where identifying low-abundance sequences with high binding affinity can be crucial for successful outcomes.\n\nWhile Illumina sequencing remains the most widely used platform for peptide library analysis due to its exceptional throughput and accuracy, Oxford Nanopore technology has also demonstrated utility in this application. Despite its historically higher error rate, Nanopore sequencing has been successfully applied to single-domain antibody repertoires and phage-displayed libraries. Lowden and colleagues showed that although the overall data fidelity was lower than Illumina, sequences could be reconstructed above a frequency threshold of approximately 100 copies. The data quality proved sufficient to enable rapid identification of antigen-specific sequences enriched during panning of phage display libraries, potentially eliminating the need for screening individual clones <Paper corpusId=\"53791733\" paperTitle=\"(Lowden et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor peptide library sequencing, the choice between platforms involves considering the tradeoff between error rates and throughput versus cost and turnaround time. Illumina's high accuracy makes it particularly suitable for distinguishing true sequence diversity from errors, while Nanopore's rapid library preparation and sequencing time offer advantages for time-sensitive applications. The combination of NGS with phage display technologies has transformed the field by allowing researchers to bypass or complement laborious screening processes while gaining valuable insights into selection dynamics and library design <Paper corpusId=\"2900474\" paperTitle=\"(Ravn et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "In phage display experiments, the highest possible number of library members should be investigated. Hence, it is of particular importance to use a higher sequencing depth to characterize as much of the library diversity as possible as well as to evaluate the composition and quality of the library more accurately. Some statistical methods have been reported to measure the diversity of phage display peptide libraries (Rodi et al., 2002). These analyses have been conducted based on sampling a limited pool of the library by Sanger sequencing. Here, we used the number of unique sequences as an equivalent to diversity. The definition of diversity as the number of unique sequences is a commonly accepted idea in phage display literature [16,19,[25][26][27][28][29][30], motivated by increasing number of NGSbased phage display works in recent years which allow for sampling of a larger sequence space."

                            "Phage display technology provides a powerful tool to screen a library for a binding molecule via an enrichment process. It has been adopted as a critical technology in the development of therapeutic antibodies. However, a major drawback of phage display technology is that because the degree of the enrichment cannot be controlled during the bio-panning process, it frequently results in a limited number of clones. In this study, we applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) to screen clones from a library and determine whether a greater number of clones can be identified using NGS than using conventional methods. Three chicken immune single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries were subjected to bio-panning on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Phagemid DNA prepared from the original libraries as well as from the Escherichia coli pool after each round of bio-panning was analyzed using NGS, and the heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) sequences of the scFv clones were determined. Subsequently, through two-step linker PCR and cloning, the entire scFv gene was retrieved and analyzed for its reactivity to PSA in a phage enzyme immunoassay. After four rounds of bio-panning, the conventional colony screening method was performed for comparison. The scFv clones retrieved from NGS analysis included all clones identified by the conventional colony screening method as well as many additional clones. The enrichment of the HCDR3 sequence throughout the bio-panning process was a positive predictive factor for the selection of PSA-reactive scFv clones."

Here, we applied nanopore sequencing to single-domain Ab (sdAb) repertoires and phage-displayed sdAb libraries. We show that despite low overall data fidelity, sdAb sequences could be reconstructed above a frequency threshold (\u223c100 copies); however, distinguishing clonal sdAb variants was not always possible. The data quality was sufficient to enable rapid identification of antigen-specific sdAb sequences enriched during panning of phage display libraries, obviating the need for screening single clones."

This approach allowed for in depth analysis of the library\u2019s diversity, provided sequence information on virtually all scFv during selection for binding to two targets and a global view of these enrichment processes. Using the most frequent heavy chain CDR3 sequences, primers were designed to rescue scFv from the third selection round. Identification, based on sequence frequency, retrieved the most potent scFv and valuable candidates that were missed using classical in vitro screening. Thus, by combining NGS with display technologies, laborious and time consuming upfront screening can be by-passed or complemented and valuable insights into the selection process can be obtained to improve library design and understanding of antibody repertoires."

                            "Capturing information on V L and V H fragments is instrumental for reconstructing full antibody sequences after an antibody discovery campaign, in both in vivo and in vitro settings. While the widespread use of single-cell technologies has allowed V L :V H pairings to be retrieved from in vivo campaigns, 16,17 the issue has only been partially tackled for the commonly-used phage-display technique. Here, researchers are required to chose between read length and sequencing depth. On one hand, a long-read NGS technology such as PacBio will allow the sequencing of both variable chains, but with a relatively low number of reads (up to $ 8 \u00c2 10 4 ) 18 . Despite being sufficient to sample high frequency (and likely, high-affinity) clones near the top of the dataset, low-depth sequencing will not allow the capturing of less-frequent rarer clones, which often show equivalent or sometimes higher affinities. 19 This is also incompatible with the deep inspection of motifs and patterns within the dataset. 2 On the other hand, the highdepth NGS platforms available do not have the read length necessary to cover both variable chains, which means the analysis of phage-displayed Fab/scFv libraries or selection outputs is usually restricted to V L or V H in those cases."

                            "A major limitation of the traditional phage-panning platform is the laborious workflow and low throughput of obtaining antibody gene sequences relying on Sanger sequencing [16].\n\nTo improve upon the traditional workflow and obtain a more diverse panel of sequences after panning, a commonly used next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform is MiSeq from Illumina. Paired-end MiSeq (2 \u00d7 300 bp) sequencing from Illumina covers segments of about 500 bp and has been successfully applied to the investigation of shorter antibody fragment libraries, such as nanobodies derived from the camelid's variable domain of heavy-chain-only antibodies [17,18], as well as the shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) [19]. Paired-end MiSeq can also read amplicons long enough to cover all CDRs in single-chain Fv (scFv) [20]. However, paired-end MiSeq is not sufficient to cover longer light and heavy chain-combined sequences (1.2-1.5 kb), which are linked together in Human Fab libraries [21,22].\n\nThird-generation NGS technology such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) can bridge the shortcomings of current MiSeq sequencing [23], as it is possible to achieve long sequencing reads of 10 to 15 kb in length with single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) [24]. PacBio's NGS had been applied successfully to scFv fragment libraries [25,26]. In particular, Han et al. applied PacBio's platform to the deep sequencing of the immune rhesus macaque scFv phage library to identify additional unique antibody gene sequences previously not seen in their Sanger sequencing results [26]."

                            "To date, well-established Illumina devices clearly dominate the field of immune repertoire sequencing, as they offer high-quality short-sequencing reads at unexcelled throughput. Deep resolution of the vast immune repertoire sequence space enables better insights into the diversity of unique BCR and TCR sequences (>10 13 in humans) and allows detection of shared clones across individuals, so called ''public clones'' (Soto et al., 2019;Briney et al., 2019;Greiff et al., 2017a;DeWitt et al., 2018).\n\nPaired-end sequencing on Illumina allows coverage of one variable region of immune receptors; however, for approaches that rely on complete immune receptor sequence coverage and hence require longer read lengths, an alternative platform is offered by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) (Eid et al., 2009). PacBio's sequencing technology is based on single-molecule sequencing. Each DNA template molecule gets isolated in a microwell, together with a single polymerase and fluorescently labeled nucleotides. Importantly, the DNA templates are circularized before sequencing, allowing for repeated readout by the polymerase. This allows for consensus reading, achieving read accuracies of over 99% with high-fidelity read lengths up to 15 kb (Wenger et al., 2019). With the recent introduction of the PacBio Sequel II system, sequencing depths of 4 million reads per run can be achieved. Hence, PacBio can be utilized for sequencing immune receptor repertoires where variable regions (e.g., variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL)) are physically linked in the context of single-cell sequencing (DeKosky et al., 2013;McDaniel et al., 2016). Moreover, longread sequencing is in particular valuable for in vitro screening platforms (e.g., phage display), which for instance utilize recombinant antibody fragment libraries known as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). Sequencing of full-length scFvs is important for covering both VH and VL diversity, which is critical in assessing quality of such libraries and their utility for drug discovery (Hemadou et al., 2017;Han et al., 2018)."

These can achieve read length orders of magnitude higher than those produced by the short-read platforms. However, their initial error-rates were very high (10-15%) (Athanasopoulou et al., 2021). The latest PacBio Sequel IIe system generates reads of average length 10-15 kb, producing 500 Gb of data within 30 h of running (Athanasopoulou et al., 2021). The PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) can now generate high fidelity (HiFi) long-reads with an error-rate of less than 1% (Wenger et al., 2019). As a comparison, the Oxford Nanopore PromethION 48 generates reads with a maximum length of more than 4 Mb, producing 14 Tb of data within 72 h of running (Athanasopoulou et al., 2021). The new ONT R.10 chemistry allows for a mean consensus single molecule error-rate of less than 1%. These two technologies can sequence non-amplified input DNA, and tend to require simpler sequencing library preparation protocols that are quicker to perform (minimum time of 10 min for library construction) than those needed for short-read sequencing (several days) (Quick et al., 2015). Oxford Nanopore devices are now also capable of displaying the generated sequence in real-time, enabling adaptive sampling of the reads being sequenced, in order to select (or reject) reads by their sequence properties as they transit through the nanopores. In addition, Oxford Nanopore devices have the advantage of being very portable, with a proven track record even in extreme environments such as the International Space Station [23]. However, current deficiencies in both base-calling accuracy and cost-efficiency, relative to short-read platforms, have meant that third-generation long-read sequencing has not yet overtaken short-read sequencing in popularity."

                            "The DNA sequencing technologies in use today produce either highly accurate short reads or less-accurate long reads. We report the optimization of circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to improve the accuracy of single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (PacBio) and generate highly accurate (99.8%) long high-fidelity (HiFi) reads with an average length of 13.5\u2009kilobases (kb). We applied our approach to sequence the well-characterized human HG002/NA24385 genome and obtained precision and recall rates of at least 99.91% for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 95.98% for insertions and deletions <50 bp (indels) and 95.99% for structural variants. Our CCS method matches or exceeds the ability of short-read sequencing to detect small variants and structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the \u2018genome in a bottle\u2019 (GIAB) benchmark set. Nearly all (99.64%) variants can be phased into haplotypes, further improving variant detection. De novo genome assembly using CCS reads alone produced a contiguous and accurate genome with a contig N50 of >15\u2009megabases (Mb) and concordance of 99.997%, substantially outperforming assembly with less-accurate long reads. High-fidelity reads improve variant detection and genome assembly on the PacBio platform."

                            "Foodborne outbreaks of Salmonella remain a pressing public health concern. We recently detected a large outbreak of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis phage type 14b affecting more than 30 patients in our hospital. This outbreak was linked to community, national and European-wide cases. Hospital patients with Salmonella are at high risk, and require a rapid response. We initially investigated this outbreak by whole-genome sequencing using a novel rapid protocol on the Illumina MiSeq; we then integrated these data with whole-genome data from surveillance sequencing, thereby placing the outbreak in a national context. Additionally, we investigated the potential of a newly released sequencing technology, the MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, in the management of a hospital outbreak of Salmonella. We demonstrate that rapid MiSeq sequencing can reduce the time to answer compared to the standard sequencing protocol with no impact on the results. We show, for the first time, that the MinION can acquire clinically relevant information in real time and within minutes of a DNA library being loaded. MinION sequencing permits confident assignment to species level within 20 min. Using a novel streaming phylogenetic placement method samples can be assigned to a serotype in 40 min and determined to be part of the outbreak in less than 2 h. Both approaches yielded reliable and actionable clinical information on the Salmonella outbreak in less than half a day. The rapid availability of such information may facilitate more informed epidemiological investigations and influence infection control practices."

                            "Phage-display selection of immunoglobulin (IG) or antibody single chain Fragment variable (scFv) from combinatorial libraries is widely used for identifying new antibodies for novel targets. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has recently emerged as a new method for the high throughput characterization of IG and T cell receptor (TR) immune repertoires both in vivo and in vitro. However, challenges remain for the NGS sequencing of scFv from combinatorial libraries owing to the scFv length (>800\u2009bp) and the presence of two variable domains [variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) for IG] associated by a peptide linker in a single chain. Here, we show that single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing with the Pacific Biosciences RS II platform allows for the generation of full-length scFv reads obtained from an in vivo selection of scFv-phages in an animal model of atherosclerosis. We first amplified the DNA of the phagemid inserts from scFv-phages eluted from an aortic section at the third round of the in vivo selection. From this amplified DNA, 450,558 reads were obtained from 15 SMRT cells. Highly accurate circular consensus sequences from these reads were generated, filtered by quality and then analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST with the functionality for scFv. Full-length scFv were identified and characterized in 348,659 reads. Full-length scFv sequencing is an absolute requirement for analyzing the associated VH and VL domains enriched during the in vivo panning rounds. In order to further validate the ability of SMRT sequencing to provide high quality, full-length scFv sequences, we tracked the reads of an scFv-phage clone P3 previously identified by biological assays and Sanger sequencing. Sixty P3 reads showed 100% identity with the full-length scFv of 767\u2009bp, 53 of them covering the whole insert of 977\u2009bp, which encompassed the primer sequences. The remaining seven reads were identical over a shortened length of 939\u2009bp that excludes the vicinity of primers at both ends. Interestingly these reads were obtained from each of the 15 SMRT cells. Thus, the SMRT sequencing method and the IMGT/HighV-QUEST functionality for scFv provides a straightforward protocol for characterization of full-length scFv from combinatorial phage libraries."

                            "The simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/macaque model of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pathogenesis is critical for furthering our understanding of the role of antibody responses in the prevention of HIV infection, and will only increase in importance as macaque immunoglobulin (IG) gene databases are expanded. We have previously reported the construction of a phage display library from a SIV-infected rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) using oligonucleotide primers based on human IG gene sequences. Our previous screening relied on Sanger sequencing, which was inefficient and generated only a few dozen sequences. Here, we re-analyzed this library using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform to generate thousands of highly accurate circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads corresponding to full length single chain fragment variable. CCS data were then analyzed through the international ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae (IMGT\u00ae)/HighV-QUEST (www.imgt.org) to identify variable genes and perform statistical analyses. Overall the library was very diverse, with 2,569 different IMGT clonotypes called for the 5,238 IGHV sequences assigned to an IMGT clonotype. Within the library, SIV-specific antibodies represented a relatively limited number of clones, with only 135 different IMGT clonotypes called from 4,594 IGHV-assigned sequences. Our data did confirm that the IGHV4 and IGHV3 gene usage was the most abundant within the rhesus antibodies screened, and that these genes were even more enriched among SIV gp140-specific antibodies. Although a broad range of VH CDR3 amino acid (AA) lengths was observed in the unpanned library, the vast majority of SIV gp140-specific antibodies demonstrated a more uniform VH CDR3 length (20 AA). This uniformity was far less apparent when VH CDR3 were classified according to their clonotype (range: 9\u201325 AA), which we believe is more relevant for specific antibody identification. Only 174 IGKV and 588 IGLV clonotypes were identified within the VL sequences associated with SIV gp140-specific VH. Together, these data strongly suggest that the combination of SMRT sequencing with the IMGT/HighV-QUEST querying tool will facilitate and expedite our understanding of polyclonal antibody responses during SIV infection and may serve to rapidly expand the known scope of macaque V genes utilized during these responses."

The PacBio platform allows for obtaining longer reads, such as the 658-bp COI Folmer fragment and beyond (Hebert et al., 2017). Very recently, nanopore sequencing using the Oxford sequencing technology has also become an interesting alternative sequencing platform. In contrast to the widely used Illumina sequencing platforms, nanopore sequencing is able to sequence DNA molecules of any length, and as such it can provide a better resolution as longer fragments can be analysed (Johnson et al., 2019)",

Although current NGS platforms were not designed with antibody libraries in mind, the technologies are now at a stage where unique sequence insights into all stages of the selection process can be obtained. Moreover, with ongoing advances in sequencing technology, depth and read length is improving continuously: for instance, the PacBio Sequel system generates approximately seven times more sequences than the previous RS II system but maintains its long-read capability (Pacific Biosciences), while nanopore systems such as the MinIOn (Oxford Nanopore) offer the promise of real-time DNA sequencing in combination with ultra-long reads."

Oxford Nanopore offers compact, high-throughput machines and rapid runtime that may make this method the standard choice for both sequencing of purified single phage as well as phage enumeration and detection. MinION TM , a portable sequencer of Oxford Nanopore was used to detect RNA (MS2) and DNA (PhiX174) phages from water samples. Both phages were successfully detected even at low concentrations, 155 PFU/mL and 1 to 2 PFU/mL for MS2 and PhiX174, respectively. Authors explained the difference in detection threshold with disparity in recovery rate between the two bacteriophages, as RNA is more prone to nucleic acid degradation (Ji et al., 2019)."

                            "Long read sequencing and hybrid approaches that combine long and short read technologies are now being widely implemented in bacterial genomics and metagenomics. However, the use of long-read sequencing to investigate viral communities is still in its infancy. While Nanopore and PacBio technologies have been applied to viral metagenomics, it is not known to what extent different technologies will impact the reconstruction of the viral community. Thus, we constructed a mock phage community of previously sequenced phage genomes and sequenced using Illumina, Nanopore, and PacBio sequencing technologies and tested a number of different assembly approaches. When using a single sequencing technology, Illumina assemblies were the best at recovering phage genomes. Nanopore- and PacBio-only assemblies performed poorly in comparison to Illumina in both genome recovery and error rates, which both varied with the assembler used. The best Nanopore assembly had errors that manifested as SNPs and INDELs at frequencies ~4x and 120x higher than found in Illumina only assemblies respectively. While the best PacBio assemblies had SNPs at frequencies ~3.5 x and 12x higher than found in Illumina only assemblies respectively. Despite high read coverage, long-read only assemblies failed to recover a complete genome for any of the 15 phage, down sampling of reads did increase the proportion of a genome that could be assembled into a single contig. Overall the best approach was assembly by a combination of Illumina and Nanopore reads, which reduced error rates to levels comparable with short read only assemblies. When using a single technology, Illumina only was the best approach."

                            "The current market leader, Illumina, manufactures instruments capable of generating billions of 150 base pair (bp) paired end reads (see 'Glossary') per run, with read lengths of up to 300 bp. The Illumina short read platform is widely used for analyses of viral genomes and metagenomes, and, given sufficient sequencing coverage, enables sensitive characterization of lowfrequency variation within viral populations (e.g. HIV resistance mutations as low as 0.1% (Li et al., 2014)). Ion Torrent (ThermoFisher) is capable of generating longer reads than Illumina at the expense of reduced throughput and a higher rate of insertion and deletion (indel) error (Korlach et al., 2010)). Single molecule real-time sequencing commercialized by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) produces much longer (>10 kbp) reads from a single molecule without clonal amplification, which eliminates the errors introduced in this step. However, this platform has a high (10%) intrinsic error rate, and remains much more expensive than Illumina sequencing for equivalent throughput. The Nanopore platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which includes the pocket sized MinION sequencer, also implements long read single molecule sequencing, and permits truly real-time analysis of individual sequences as they are generated. Although more affordable than PacBio single molecule sequencing, the Nanopore platform also suffers from high error rates in comparison with Illumina (Reuter, Spacek, and Snyder 2015). However, the technology is maturing rapidly and has already demonstrated potential to revolutionize pathogen surveillance and discovery in the field, as well as enabling contiguous assembly of entire bacterial genomes at relatively low cost (Feng et al., 2015)(Quick et al., 2015)Hoenen et al. 2016)."

The choice of sequencing platform significantly impacts characterization outcomes, with each technology offering distinct advantages for different applications within antibody and peptide library analysis. (14 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe impact of sequencing platform selection on phage display library characterization has proven profound, with different technologies enabling unique insights into library composition, diversity, and selection dynamics. Deep sequencing techniques have revolutionized phage display library characterization by addressing many traditional weaknesses and enabling more comprehensive analysis of diversity and biases present in these libraries <Paper corpusId=\"18622192\" paperTitle=\"(Brinton et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This transformation has been particularly evident in the assessment of library quality and composition, where next-generation sequencing has revealed critical insights that were impossible to detect with traditional methods.\n\nOne of the most striking revelations from high-throughput sequencing of peptide libraries has been the discovery of dramatic diversity collapses during amplification. Matochko and colleagues demonstrated that phage-displayed peptide libraries can experience a collapse from theoretically millions of sequences to just a few hundred abundant sequences after a single round of growth in bacteria - a phenomenon that would have remained undetectable using small-scale Sanger sequencing <Paper corpusId=\"4632668\" paperTitle=\"(Matochko et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. This insight has fundamentally changed our understanding of library quality and amplification dynamics.\n\nThe selection of sequencing platform significantly impacts characterization outcomes for antibody libraries. For comprehensive repertoire analysis, Illumina platforms remain optimal due to their ability to produce hundreds of millions of reads at relatively low cost. However, their application is limited to sequencing individual variable domains or CDR3 regions rather than full-length antibody fragments <Paper corpusId=\"199451388\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This limitation restricts the information that can be obtained about paired VH:VL domains, which is crucial for assessing library quality and utility in drug discovery <Paper corpusId=\"221406320\" paperTitle=\"(Csepregi et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor full-length characterization of antibody fragments, long-read technologies have demonstrated unique value despite their historically lower throughput. PacBio sequencing coupled with SMRTbell technology has enabled the generation of highly accurate full-length scFv sequence repertoires, facilitating rapid isolation and testing of antibodies enriched from phage display libraries within days following panning <Paper corpusId=\"229940603\" paperTitle=\"(Nannini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This capability has led to the identification of functional antibodies that were not detected by conventional screening methods, demonstrating the complementary value of comprehensive sequencing to traditional panning approaches.\n\nA critical consideration for library characterization is the balance between sequencing depth and read length. While long-read technologies like PacBio can sequence complete antibody fragments, they typically provide relatively low numbers of reads (up to 8\u00d710\u2074) compared to Illumina <Paper corpusId=\"249254439\" paperTitle=\"(Moura-Sampaio et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This limitation potentially misses rare clones that may have equivalent or sometimes higher affinities than the more frequent ones <Paper corpusId=\"249254439\" paperTitle=\"(Moura-Sampaio et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"73444750\" paperTitle=\"(Noh et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. For peptide libraries, where capturing the maximum number of library members is crucial for accurate diversity assessment, high-throughput platforms are particularly valuable <Paper corpusId=\"257516339\" paperTitle=\"(Sloth et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nNewer sequencing technologies continue to improve the characterization capabilities for phage display libraries. The PacBio Sequel II system offers greater accuracy and higher throughput than previous models, providing larger pools of scFvs for analysis <Paper corpusId=\"271114246\" paperTitle=\"(Salvy et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. These advancements are enabling more comprehensive characterization of antibody libraries, with recent approaches yielding more than 14,700 high-quality, fully annotated unique scFv sequences from a single library <Paper corpusId=\"271114246\" paperTitle=\"(Salvy et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"229940603\" paperTitle=\"(Nannini et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nOxford Nanopore technology has also demonstrated utility for phage display library characterization despite its historically higher error rate. Lowden and colleagues showed that while overall data fidelity was lower than Illumina, sequences could be reliably reconstructed when present above approximately 100 copies. This capability proved sufficient for rapid identification of antigen-specific sequences enriched during panning, potentially eliminating the need for screening individual clones <Paper corpusId=\"53791733\" paperTitle=\"(Lowden et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor applications requiring both long reads and high accuracy, hybrid approaches combining multiple sequencing technologies have shown promise. Cook and colleagues demonstrated that combining Illumina and Nanopore reads reduced error rates to levels comparable with short-read-only assemblies, providing more comprehensive insights than any single platform <Paper corpusId=\"268359948\" paperTitle=\"(Cook et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. These hybrid approaches can be particularly valuable for capturing both the depth and length information needed for comprehensive library characterization.\n\nAs sequencing technologies continue to advance, they are enabling increasingly sophisticated analyses of phage display libraries. Long-read sequencing has become particularly important for capturing complete variable regions and characterizing complementarity determining regions with high precision <Paper corpusId=\"278454176\" paperTitle=\"(Matsunaga et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"17021690\" paperTitle=\"(He et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, innovative approaches like using unique molecular identifiers to pair separately sequenced VH and VL regions are allowing comprehensive mapping of full-length antibody clonal dynamics even with shorter-read technologies <Paper corpusId=\"257922737\" paperTitle=\"(Levin et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. These technological advances continue to enhance our ability to thoroughly characterize phage display libraries for diverse applications.",

                            "As HiSeq and NovaSeq of Illumina can easily produce a few hundreds of millions (M) of reads at less than a thousand dollars, these platforms are optimal to investigate comprehensiveness of repertoire. However, these short-read technologies (up to 150 bp) are of limited use. Although they are applicable to sequencing of CDR3, they are not applicable to full-length sequencing of variable regions of VH or VL. In order to sequence full-length variable regions, ranging from 400-600 bp, of VH and VL separately, MiSeq is the best platform as it is capable of producing reads of length 2 \u00d7 300 bp. However, its throughput is only up to 25M. Oxford Nanopore sequencing and Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing of PacBio are suitable for long gDNA library and VH:VL pairing library in principle. However, they are rarely applied to repertoire sequencing because bases of high quality are indispensable to discriminate true diversity from errors."

                            "To date, well-established Illumina devices clearly dominate the field of immune repertoire sequencing, as they offer high-quality short-sequencing reads at unexcelled throughput. Deep resolution of the vast immune repertoire sequence space enables better insights into the diversity of unique BCR and TCR sequences (>10 13 in humans) and allows detection of shared clones across individuals, so called ''public clones'' (Soto et al., 2019;Briney et al., 2019;Greiff et al., 2017a;DeWitt et al., 2018).\n\nPaired-end sequencing on Illumina allows coverage of one variable region of immune receptors; however, for approaches that rely on complete immune receptor sequence coverage and hence require longer read lengths, an alternative platform is offered by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) (Eid et al., 2009). PacBio's sequencing technology is based on single-molecule sequencing. Each DNA template molecule gets isolated in a microwell, together with a single polymerase and fluorescently labeled nucleotides. Importantly, the DNA templates are circularized before sequencing, allowing for repeated readout by the polymerase. This allows for consensus reading, achieving read accuracies of over 99% with high-fidelity read lengths up to 15 kb (Wenger et al., 2019). With the recent introduction of the PacBio Sequel II system, sequencing depths of 4 million reads per run can be achieved. Hence, PacBio can be utilized for sequencing immune receptor repertoires where variable regions (e.g., variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL)) are physically linked in the context of single-cell sequencing (DeKosky et al., 2013;McDaniel et al., 2016). Moreover, longread sequencing is in particular valuable for in vitro screening platforms (e.g., phage display), which for instance utilize recombinant antibody fragment libraries known as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). Sequencing of full-length scFvs is important for covering both VH and VL diversity, which is critical in assessing quality of such libraries and their utility for drug discovery (Hemadou et al., 2017;Han et al., 2018)."

(Hu et al., 2015)(Turner et al., 2016) While NGS allows in-depth analysis of phage display libraries, its widespread use has been hampered by limitations in read length (Matochko et al., 2012)27 and signal integrity (Waltari et al., 2019) of several sequencing technologies. These limitations have meant that most sequencing applications have only covered a single variable domain within a library, showing the greatest utility in the sequencing of single domain antibody libraries. (Miyazaki et al., 2015)(Deschaght et al., 2017) Yang and colleagues recently described the use of phage display data obtained using MiSeq sequencing to isolate antibodies from scFv libraries that had undergone multiple rounds of panning. The data sets obtained had high sequence depth and allowed generation of antibodies against the target antigen of interest; however, a key limitation to the method was the use of limited read length within the sequencing data that required additional PCR amplification to retrieve the full sequence of the clones. (Yang et al., 2017) Here, we used the PacBio sequencing platform combined with SMRTbell technology to generate highly accurate full-length scFv sequence repertoires from immune libraries selected through conventional phage display biopanning targeting the cell surface antigens CD160 and CD123."

While the widespread use of single-cell technologies has allowed V L :V H pairings to be retrieved from in vivo campaigns, 16,17 the issue has only been partially tackled for the commonly-used phage-display technique. Here, researchers are required to chose between read length and sequencing depth. On one hand, a long-read NGS technology such as PacBio will allow the sequencing of both variable chains, but with a relatively low number of reads (up to $ 8 \u00c2 10 4 ) 18 . Despite being sufficient to sample high frequency (and likely, high-affinity) clones near the top of the dataset, low-depth sequencing will not allow the capturing of less-frequent rarer clones, which often show equivalent or sometimes higher affinities. 19 This is also incompatible with the deep inspection of motifs and patterns within the dataset. 2 On the other hand, the highdepth NGS platforms available do not have the read length necessary to cover both variable chains, which means the analysis of phage-displayed Fab/scFv libraries or selection outputs is usually restricted to V L or V H in those cases."

Hence, it is of particular importance to use a higher sequencing depth to characterize as much of the library diversity as possible as well as to evaluate the composition and quality of the library more accurately. Some statistical methods have been reported to measure the diversity of phage display peptide libraries (Rodi et al., 2002). These analyses have been conducted based on sampling a limited pool of the library by Sanger sequencing. Here, we used the number of unique sequences as an equivalent to diversity. The definition of diversity as the number of unique sequences is a commonly accepted idea in phage display literature [16,19,[25][26][27][28][29][30], motivated by increasing number of NGSbased phage display works in recent years which allow for sampling of a larger sequence space."

Indeed, sequencing of full-length scFv provides crucial VH-VL pairing information, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of each candidate's biophysical properties, germline gene usage, and structure. 3 While it's very unlikely to sequence 10,000 unique clones through clone picking alone, due to the overrepresentation of dominant clones, 31 NGS mining with Seq2scFv of phage display libraries generated by Nannini and colleagues (2020) 3 yielded more than 14,756 high-quality, fully annotated and validated unique scFv sequences. Notably, these libraries were screened using a PacBio RS2 instrument, and new generation PacBio sequencers, such as the Sequel II, offer even greater accuracy and higher throughput, providing larger pools of scFvs to mine."

Here, we applied nanopore sequencing to single-domain Ab (sdAb) repertoires and phage-displayed sdAb libraries. We show that despite low overall data fidelity, sdAb sequences could be reconstructed above a frequency threshold (\u223c100 copies); however, distinguishing clonal sdAb variants was not always possible. The data quality was sufficient to enable rapid identification of antigen-specific sdAb sequences enriched during panning of phage display libraries, obviating the need for screening single clones."

                            "Long read sequencing and hybrid approaches that combine long and short read technologies are now being widely implemented in bacterial genomics and metagenomics. However, the use of long-read sequencing to investigate viral communities is still in its infancy. While Nanopore and PacBio technologies have been applied to viral metagenomics, it is not known to what extent different technologies will impact the reconstruction of the viral community. Thus, we constructed a mock phage community of previously sequenced phage genomes and sequenced using Illumina, Nanopore, and PacBio sequencing technologies and tested a number of different assembly approaches. When using a single sequencing technology, Illumina assemblies were the best at recovering phage genomes. Nanopore- and PacBio-only assemblies performed poorly in comparison to Illumina in both genome recovery and error rates, which both varied with the assembler used. The best Nanopore assembly had errors that manifested as SNPs and INDELs at frequencies ~4x and 120x higher than found in Illumina only assemblies respectively. While the best PacBio assemblies had SNPs at frequencies ~3.5 x and 12x higher than found in Illumina only assemblies respectively. Despite high read coverage, long-read only assemblies failed to recover a complete genome for any of the 15 phage, down sampling of reads did increase the proportion of a genome that could be assembled into a single contig. Overall the best approach was assembly by a combination of Illumina and Nanopore reads, which reduced error rates to levels comparable with short read only assemblies. When using a single technology, Illumina only was the best approach."

However, key obstacles such as low throughput, short read length, high error rate and undetermined bias of multiplex PCR method have hindered broader application of this technology. In this study, we report several technical advances in antibody repertoire sequencing. We first demonstrated the ability to sequence antibody variable domains using the Ion Torrent PGM platform. As a test case, we analyzed the PGT121 class of antibodies from IAVI donor 17, an HIV-1-infected individual. We then obtained \"unbiased\" antibody repertoires by sequencing the 5\u2032-RACE PCR products of B-cell transcripts from IAVI donor 17 and two HIV-1-uninfected individuals. We also quantified the bias of previously published gene-specific primers by comparing the repertoires generated by 5\u2032-RACE PCR and multiplex PCR. We further developed a single-molecule barcoding strategy to reduce PCR-based amplification noise. Lastly, we evaluated several new PGM technologies in the context of antibody sequencing. We expect that, based upon long-read and high-fidelity next-generation sequencing technologies, the unbiased analysis will provide a more accurate view of the overall antibody repertoire while the barcoding strategy will facilitate high-resolution analysis of individual antibody families."

                            "Abstract Deep parallel sequencing (NGS) is a viable tool for monitoring scFv and Fab library dynamics in many antibody engineering high-throughput screening efforts. Although very useful, the commonly used Illumina NGS platform cannot handle the entire sequence of scFv or Fab in a single read, usually focusing on specific CDRs or resorting to sequencing VH and VL variable domains separately, thus limiting its utility in comprehensive monitoring of selection dynamics. Here we present a simple and robust method for deep sequencing repertoires of full length scFv, Fab and Fv antibody sequences. This process utilizes standard molecular procedures and unique molecular identifiers (UMI) to pair separately sequenced VH and VL. We show that UMI assisted VH-VL matching allows for a comprehensive and highly accurate mapping of full length Fv clonal dynamics in large highly homologous antibody libraries, as well as identification of rare variants. In addition to its utility in synthetic antibody discovery processes, our method can be instrumental in generating large datasets for machine learning (ML) applications, which in the field of antibody engineering has been hampered by conspicuous paucity of large scale full length Fv data."
