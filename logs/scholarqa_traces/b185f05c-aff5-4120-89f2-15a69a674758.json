            "abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently the most commonly used non-viral gene delivery system. Their physiochemical attributes, encompassing size, charge and surface modifications, significantly affect their behaviors both in vivo and in vitro. Nevertheless, the effects of these properties on the transfection and distribution of LNPs after intramuscular injection remain elusive. In this study, LNPs with varying sizes, lipid-based charges and PEGylated lipids were formulated to study their transfection and in vivo distribution. Luciferase mRNA (mLuc) was entraped in LNPs as a model nucleic acid molecule. Results indicated that smaller-sized LNPs and those with neutral potential presented superior transfection efficiency after intramuscular injection. Surprisingly, the sizes and charges did not exert a notable influence on the in vivo distribution of the LNPs. Furthermore, PEGylated lipids with shorter acyl chains contributed to enhanced transfection efficiency due to their superior cellular uptake and lysosomal escape capabilities. Notably, the mechanisms underlying cellular uptake differed among LNPs containing various types of PEGylated lipids, which was primarily attributed to the length of their acyl chain. Together, these insights underscore the pivotal role of nanoparticle characteristics and PEGylated lipids in the intramuscular route. This study not only fills crucial knowledge gaps but also provides significant directions for the effective delivery of mRNA via LNPs.

Previous study has shown that LNPs containing mRNA encoding fibroblast activation protein (FAP) antibodies can achieve in vivo CAR-T therapy to treat cardiac injury [17], which further emphasized the importance of LNP-mRNA therapy. \n\nLNPs are composed of four distinct lipid classes, including ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids [6. 8]. The particle size, charge, and lipid composition of nanoparticles have been shown to significantly influence their transfection capabilities and biodistribution following intravenous administration [12,18,19]. Physiochemical properties and PEGylated lipids are recognized as critical determinants in the functional performance of LNPs, influencing key processes such as transfection and systemic distribution [20]. LNPs with positive charges preferentially localize to the lungs following intravenous injection, whereas those with negative charges are more likely to accumulate in the spleen [21]. The primary mechanism underlying the distinct in vivo distribution patterns of charged LNPs is attributed to variations in the protein corona adsorbed onto the nanoparticles, which significantly affects cellular uptake [22]. Moreover, PEGylated lipids also play essential roles in LNPs for mRNA delivery [23,24]. PEGylated lipids contribute to the evasion of macrophage capture, thereby enhancing nanoparticle stability and prolonging their efficacy in vivo [25,26]. The presence of PEGylated lipids in LNPs extends their circulation time in vivo, which is particularly advantageous for intravenous injection [1,27]. Upon entering the circulation, PEGylated lipids facilitate the interaction of LNPs with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in serum, promoting subsequent binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which is primarily located in the liver [24,28]. However, studies on the impact of composition on the biofunctions of LNPs post-intramuscular administration are still lacking.",

Their physiochemical attributes, encompassing size, charge and surface modifications, significantly affect their behaviors both in vivo and in vitro. Nevertheless, the effects of these properties on the transfection and distribution of LNPs after intramuscular injection remain elusive. In this study, LNPs with varying sizes, lipid-based charges and PEGylated lipids were formulated to study their transfection and in vivo distribution. Luciferase mRNA (mLuc) was entraped in LNPs as a model nucleic acid molecule. Results indicated that smaller-sized LNPs and those with neutral potential presented superior transfection efficiency after intramuscular injection. Surprisingly, the sizes and charges did not exert a notable influence on the in vivo distribution of the LNPs. Furthermore, PEGylated lipids with shorter acyl chains contributed to enhanced transfection efficiency due to their superior cellular uptake and lysosomal escape capabilities. Notably, the mechanisms underlying cellular uptake differed among LNPs containing various types of PEGylated lipids, which was primarily attributed to the length of their acyl chain. Together, these insights underscore the pivotal role of nanoparticle characteristics and PEGylated lipids in the intramuscular route. This study not only fills crucial knowledge gaps but also provides significant directions for the effective delivery of mRNA via LNPs. Graphical Abstract Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12951-024-02812-x.\n## Introduction\nFurthermore, LNPs containing mRNA have been utilized into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy [15,16]. Previous study has shown that LNPs containing mRNA encoding fibroblast activation protein (FAP) antibodies can achieve in vivo CAR-T therapy to treat cardiac injury [17], which further emphasized the importance of LNP-mRNA therapy. \n\nLNPs are composed of four distinct lipid classes, including ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids [6. 8]. The particle size, charge, and lipid composition of nanoparticles have been shown to significantly influence their transfection capabilities and biodistribution following intravenous administration [12,18,19]. Physiochemical properties and PEGylated lipids are recognized as critical determinants in the functional performance of LNPs, influencing key processes such as transfection and systemic distribution [20]. LNPs with positive charges preferentially localize to the lungs following intravenous injection, whereas those with negative charges are more likely to accumulate in the spleen [21]. The primary mechanism underlying the distinct in vivo distribution patterns of charged LNPs is attributed to variations in the protein corona adsorbed onto the nanoparticles, which significantly affects cellular uptake [22]. Moreover, PEGylated lipids also play essential roles in LNPs for mRNA delivery [23,24]. PEGylated lipids contribute to the evasion of macrophage capture, thereby enhancing nanoparticle stability and prolonging their efficacy in vivo [25,26]. The presence of PEGylated lipids in LNPs extends their circulation time in vivo, which is particularly advantageous for intravenous injection [1,27]. Upon entering the circulation, PEGylated lipids facilitate the interaction of LNPs with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in serum, promoting subsequent binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which is primarily located in the liver [24,28]. However, studies on the impact of composition on the biofunctions of LNPs post-intramuscular administration are still lacking.",

Therefore, developing strategies for enhancing LNPs' ability to target diverse organs is of great clinical significance. On one hand, following systemic administration, LNPs interact with specific proteins and biomolecules in the bloodstream, forming a layer of adsorbed ''protein corona'' on their surface. 25 The composition of this protein corona varies based on the type and properties of LNPs, including factors, such as composition, charge, size, surface chemistry, etc., predominantly affecting cellular uptake and biodistribution. 26 On the other hand, LNPs modified with ligands (small molecules, peptides, antibodies, etc.) are widely employed as active targeting strategies. In this section, we summarize organ-targeted LNPs developed for nucleic acid delivery and discuss specific targeting strategies, providing readers with a contemporary overview of the development of targeted LNPs.",

Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

Thus, ApoE-rich protein corona can be used to target hepatocytes. 141,142 Lung targeting of LNPs can be achieved by introducing sequences of lipid molecules that can alter the composition of the protein corona, and the unique protein corona formed promotes the interaction of LNPs with specific cellular receptors that are highly expressed in the lung. 47 It has been shown that LNPs containing lipid molecules with quaternary ammonium head groups (SORT) can be applied to gene editing of endothelial, epithelial, and immune cells in the lung. 47,48 In addition, lipid molecules characterized by cationic quaternary sulfonamide-amino lipids, amphoteric amino lipids, and doped amide bonds are also capable of delivering nucleic acids to the lungs in a better way. 35,143 Targeting of lymphoid tissues can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of lipid molecules to form protein corona.

The iPhos with 9-12 and 13-16 carbon chain lengths deliver mRNA to the liver and the spleen, respectively. 47 The possible underlying mechanism for only small difference in structure to cause such astonishing organ specificity may be the result of a specific protein or the synergistic action of several proteins, but further research is still needed. Once injected into the bloodstream, LNPs can selectively control the adsorption of specific plasma proteins, acting as targeted ligands to direct LNPs to selected organs. Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver. In addition, the zeta potential of the two LNP S did not differ significantly, and both showed a slightly negative surface charge, suggesting that surface charge may not be the only factor influencing the interaction between NPs and proteins in biological fluids. 35 verall, the ionization of lipid structure can be driven by the type of organs and cells.",

Therefore, developing strategies for enhancing LNPs' ability to target diverse organs is of great clinical significance. On one hand, following systemic administration, LNPs interact with specific proteins and biomolecules in the bloodstream, forming a layer of adsorbed ''protein corona'' on their surface. 25 The composition of this protein corona varies based on the type and properties of LNPs, including factors, such as composition, charge, size, surface chemistry, etc., predominantly affecting cellular uptake and biodistribution. 26 On the other hand, LNPs modified with ligands (small molecules, peptides, antibodies, etc.) are widely employed as active targeting strategies. In this section, we summarize organ-targeted LNPs developed for nucleic acid delivery and discuss specific targeting strategies, providing readers with a contemporary overview of the development of targeted LNPs.\n\n## Chemical structures of key lipids\nBy simply adjusting the head structure of N-series LNPs, different subpopulations of lung cells can be targeted. The doping LNPs with lipids containing quaternary ammonium groups can selectively deliver mRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 for specific lung diseases in the lungs. 47 Similarly, both zwitterionic amino lipids and cationic quaternary sulfonamide amino lipids have permanent cationic quaternary ammonium functional groups and can also be used to design lung-targeted LNPs. 25 The more detailed LNPs compositions for extrahepatic delivery are summarized by Dilliard S.A. and Siegwart D.J. 20 Furthermore, the length of the alkyl chain on the phosphate side determines organ selectivity. The iPhos with 9-12 and 13-16 carbon chain lengths deliver mRNA to the liver and the spleen, respectively. 47 The possible underlying mechanism for only small difference in structure to cause such astonishing organ specificity may be the result of a specific protein or the synergistic action of several proteins, but further research is still needed. Once injected into the bloodstream, LNPs can selectively control the adsorption of specific plasma proteins, acting as targeted ligands to direct LNPs to selected organs. Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver. In addition, the zeta potential of the two LNP S did not differ significantly, and both showed a slightly negative surface charge, suggesting that surface charge may not be the only factor influencing the interaction between NPs and proteins in biological fluids. 35 verall, the ionization of lipid structure can be driven by the type of organs and cells.\n\n## DELIVERY MECHANISMS OF ORGAN-SELECTIVE LNPs IN VIVO\nChanges in the surface properties of LNPs may compromise the stability of RNA-LNPs through corona. 25 It has been demonstrated that by designing novel ionizable lipids (ILs) and optimizing LNPs formulations, the type of proteins adsorbed onto the LNPs surface can be influenced, thereby achieving organ-specific delivery. 137 However, although targeting strategies designed via formulation optimization often result in preferential uptake by certain organs, achieving a high level of target cell specificity is rarely realized. Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140\n...\nRecent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140 Understanding the components of LNPs and the nature of the protein coronas will be more useful in understanding the subsequent fate of LNPs in vivo and in designing organ-targeted LNPs for treating specific diseases. 122 ince apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is involved in endogenous cholesterol transport, it binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) overexpressed in hepatocytes and enters the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Thus, ApoE-rich protein corona can be used to target hepatocytes. 141,142 Lung targeting of LNPs can be achieved by introducing sequences of lipid molecules that can alter the composition of the protein corona, and the unique protein corona formed promotes the interaction of LNPs with specific cellular receptors that are highly expressed in the lung. 47 It has been shown that LNPs containing lipid molecules with quaternary ammonium head groups (SORT) can be applied to gene editing of endothelial, epithelial, and immune cells in the lung. 47,48 In addition, lipid molecules characterized by cationic quaternary sulfonamide-amino lipids, amphoteric amino lipids, and doped amide bonds are also capable of delivering nucleic acids to the lungs in a better way. 35,143 Targeting of lymphoid tissues can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of lipid molecules to form protein corona. Protein corona formation by LNPs combined with anionic phospholipids such as b2-glycoprotein I enables gene editing of B and T cells in the splenic region. 42 or endogenous targeting, various novel technologies can be used to characterize the formation of protein coronas, identify the organ targeting results required for protein corona combinations, and associate them with nanoparticles, which is crucial for fully utilizing this targeting mechanism. 144,145",

            "abstract": "In terms of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) engineering, the relationship between particle composition, delivery efficacy, and the composition of the biocoronas that form around LNPs, is poorly understood. To explore this we analyze naturally efficacious biocorona compositions using an unbiased screening workflow. First, LNPs are complexed with plasma samples, from individual lean or obese male rats, and then functionally evaluated in vitro.

Understanding the complex interactions among the protein corona, LNPs, and receptors is crucial for harnessing its potential.

Safety assessments are essential to ensure suitability for human use, compliance with regulatory standards, and rigorous quality control in manufacturing. This transformative workflow requires collaborative efforts, expanding our foundational knowledge and translating advancements from the laboratory to clinical reality.

                    "text": "In recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs. These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. 24 Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands. 25 ur research group has successfully provided direct evidence of targeted delivery of NPs by coating a cationic liposome with a protein corona enriched in vitronectin. 26 This plasma protein bestowed the liposome with the remarkable ability to selectively target and bind to cancer cells that exhibit an elevated level of expression of the vitronectin receptor. A recent scientific hypothesis has suggested that the high liver tropism and transfection potency exhibited by Onpattro may be attributed to the formation of a protein corona enriched with Apo-E. 2 This protein corona, in turn, enables the recognition of hepatocytes through the LDL receptor, potentially contributing to its liver-targeting capabilities. \n\nIn the context of vaccination, the translation of LNP vaccines into clinical practice faces challenges due to our limited understanding of their protein corona, which may influence the tissue accumulation of particles in physiological environments. Upon ID, LNP vaccines are exposed to the dermal interstitial fluid (DIF) 27 leading to the formation of a protein corona. Given that the protein source is a key determinant in shaping the composition of the protein corona, 28 we assert that conducting a thorough investigation of LNPs in the DIF is an essential and decisive step in advancing our comprehension of their mechanism of action upon intradermal injection.",

Amici, D. Pozzi, C. Marchini, G. Caracciolo\n## Abstract\nThe integration of the lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-protein corona as a pioneering approach for the development of vaccines against the present and future SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern marks a significant shift in the field. This concept holds great promise, offering a universal platform that can be adaptable to combat future pandemics caused by unknown viruses. Understanding the complex interactions among the protein corona, LNPs, and receptors is crucial for harnessing its potential. This knowledge will allow optimal vaccine formulations and improve their effectiveness. Safety assessments are essential to ensure suitability for human use, compliance with regulatory standards, and rigorous quality control in manufacturing. This transformative workflow requires collaborative efforts, expanding our foundational knowledge and translating advancements from the laboratory to clinical reality. The LNP-protein corona approach represents a paradigmatic shift with far-reaching implications. Its principles and insights can be leveraged beyond specific applications against SARS-CoV-2, enabling a universal platform for addressing viral threats, cancer, and genetic diseases.\n## body\nIn recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs. These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. 24 Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands. 25 ur research group has successfully provided direct evidence of targeted delivery of NPs by coating a cationic liposome with a protein corona enriched in vitronectin. 26 This plasma protein bestowed the liposome with the remarkable ability to selectively target and bind to cancer cells that exhibit an elevated level of expression of the vitronectin receptor. A recent scientific hypothesis has suggested that the high liver tropism and transfection potency exhibited by Onpattro may be attributed to the formation of a protein corona enriched with Apo-E. 2 This protein corona, in turn, enables the recognition of hepatocytes through the LDL receptor, potentially contributing to its liver-targeting capabilities. \n\nIn the context of vaccination, the translation of LNP vaccines into clinical practice faces challenges due to our limited understanding of their protein corona, which may influence the tissue accumulation of particles in physiological environments. Upon ID, LNP vaccines are exposed to the dermal interstitial fluid (DIF) 27 leading to the formation of a protein corona. Given that the protein source is a key determinant in shaping the composition of the protein corona, 28 we assert that conducting a thorough investigation of LNPs in the DIF is an essential and decisive step in advancing our comprehension of their mechanism of action upon intradermal injection.",

            "abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown promise as a delivery system for nucleic acid-based therapeutics, including DNA, siRNA, and mRNA vaccines. The immune system plays a critical role in the response to these nanocarriers, with innate immune cells initiating an early response and adaptive immune cells mediating a more specific reaction, sometimes leading to potential adverse effects. Recent studies have shown that the innate immune response to LNPs is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize the lipid components of the nanoparticles. This recognition can trigger the activation of inflammatory pathways and the production of cytokines and chemokines, leading to potential adverse effects such as fever, inflammation, and pain at the injection site. On the other hand, the adaptive immune response to LNPs appears to be primarily directed against the protein encoded by the mRNA cargo, with little evidence of an ongoing adaptive immune response to the components of the LNP itself. Understanding the relationship between LNPs and the immune system is critical for the development of safe and effective nucleic acid-based delivery systems. In fact, targeting the immune system is essential to develop effective vaccines, as well as therapies against cancer or infections. There is a lack of research in the literature that has systematically studied the factors that influence the interaction between LNPs and the immune system and further research is needed to better elucidate the mechanisms underlying the immune response to LNPs. In this review, we discuss LNPs\u2019 composition, physico-chemical properties, such as size, shape, and surface charge, and the protein corona formation which can affect the reactivity of the immune system, thus providing a guide for the research on new formulations that could gain a favorable efficacy/safety profile.",

This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

Catenacci, Rachele Rossi, Francesca Sechi, Daniela Buonocore, Milena Sorrenti, S. Perteghella, Marco Peviani, M. Bonferoni\n## Abstract\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown promise as a delivery system for nucleic acid-based therapeutics, including DNA, siRNA, and mRNA vaccines. The immune system plays a critical role in the response to these nanocarriers, with innate immune cells initiating an early response and adaptive immune cells mediating a more specific reaction, sometimes leading to potential adverse effects. Recent studies have shown that the innate immune response to LNPs is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize the lipid components of the nanoparticles. This recognition can trigger the activation of inflammatory pathways and the production of cytokines and chemokines, leading to potential adverse effects such as fever, inflammation, and pain at the injection site. On the other hand, the adaptive immune response to LNPs appears to be primarily directed against the protein encoded by the mRNA cargo, with little evidence of an ongoing adaptive immune response to the components of the LNP itself. Understanding the relationship between LNPs and the immune system is critical for the development of safe and effective nucleic acid-based delivery systems. In fact, targeting the immune system is essential to develop effective vaccines, as well as therapies against cancer or infections. There is a lack of research in the literature that has systematically studied the factors that influence the interaction between LNPs and the immune system and further research is needed to better elucidate the mechanisms underlying the immune response to LNPs. In this review, we discuss LNPs\u2019 composition, physico-chemical properties, such as size, shape, and surface charge, and the protein corona formation which can affect the reactivity of the immune system, thus providing a guide for the research on new formulations that could gain a favorable efficacy/safety profile.\n## PEG-Lipids\nThe illustration underscores the primary challenges and drawbacks associated with LNP vaccines. One significant opportunity lies in the ability to modify the protein corona composition, which can help mitigate off-target accumulation and enhance the interaction of LNPs with antigenpresenting cells and dendritic cells. This, in turn, has the potential to significantly improve vaccine efficacy. Reprinted with permission [38]. \n\nMoreover, studies have shown that upon IV administration PEG-lipid with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, inducing a change in surface structure that allows ApoE adsorption to LNPs, with the formation of a protein corona that affects their endosomal escape and mRNA release. ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it. Furthermore, Figure 6. The illustration underscores the primary challenges and drawbacks associated with LNP vaccines. One significant opportunity lies in the ability to modify the protein corona composition, which can help mitigate off-target accumulation and enhance the interaction of LNPs with antigenpresenting cells and dendritic cells. This, in turn, has the potential to significantly improve vaccine efficacy. Reprinted with permission [38].\n\n## Protein Corona\nWhen NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

Thomson, Alexandra Birkenshaw, B. Leavitt, C. J. Ross\n## Abstract\nGene editing mediated by CRISPR/Cas9 systems is due to become a beneficial therapeutic option for treating genetic diseases and some cancers. However, there are challenges in delivering CRISPR components which necessitate sophisticated delivery systems for safe and effective genome editing. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have become an attractive nonviral delivery platform for CRISPR-mediated genome editing due to their low immunogenicity and application flexibility. In this review, we provide a background of CRISPR-mediated gene therapy, as well as LNPs and their applicable characteristics for delivering CRISPR components. We then highlight the challenges of CRISPR delivery, which have driven the significant development of new, safe, and optimized LNP formulations in the past decade. Finally, we discuss considerations for using LNPs to deliver CRISPR and future perspectives on clinical translation of LNP-CRISPR gene editing.\n## \u25a0 LNP COMPOSITION FOR NUCLEIC ACID DELIVERY\nINHERENT TARGETING OF LNPS TOWARD THE LIVER LNPs interactions with blood proteins upon intravenous administration determines where they will ultimately be localized. \u221263 Once they enter circulation, LNPs are opsonized by electrolytes, lipids, apolipoproteins, immunoglobulins, coagulation, and other factors creating a specific \"biomolecular corona\" 64 that plays a role in the distribution of LNPs.

Once LNPs are administered in vivo, preferential LNP targeting to desired cells can be attributed to the formation of a biomolecular corona (BMC), however, characterization of the corona is challenging. This is due to poor separation efficiency of LNP\u2013corona complexes from unbound proteins. Herein, we developed magnetic iron-oxide-loaded LNPs (IOLNP) that allow separation of LNP\u2013corona complexes from biological media through magnetic separation. This technology enables a rapid and selective method to separate LNP\u2013corona complexes and enables in-depth characterization of the BMC while maintaining the particle integrity.",

                    "text": "Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations are a proven method for the delivery of nucleic acids for gene therapy as exemplified by the worldwide rollout of LNP-based RNAi therapeutics and mRNA vaccines. However, targeting specific tissues or cells is still a major challenge. After LNP administration, LNPs interact with biological fluids (i.e., blood), components of which adsorb onto the LNP surface forming a layer of biomolecules termed the \"biomolecular corona (BMC)\" which affects LNP stability, biodistribution, and tissue tropism. The mechanisms by which the BMC influences tissue-and cell-specific targeting remains largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media. In this study, we present a new technique that utilizes magnetic LNPs to isolate LNP-corona complexes from unbound proteins present in human serum. First, we developed a magnetic LNP formulation, containing >40 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)/LNP, the resulting LNPs containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IOLNPs) displayed a similar particle size and morphology as LNPs loaded with nucleic acids. We further demonstrated the isolation of the IOLNPs and their corresponding BMC from unbound proteins using a magnetic separation (MS) system. The BMC profile of LNP from the MS system was compared to size exclusion column chromatography and further analyzed via mass spectrometry, revealing differences in protein abundances. This new approach enabled a mild and versatile isolation of LNPs and its corona, while maintaining its structural integrity. The identification of the BMC associated with an intact LNP provides further insight into LNP interactions with biological fluids.",

The technological advances carried out in the past three decades have enabled the clinical approval of the first LNP-based siRNA therapeutic, Onpattro (4)(5)(6), which quickly became a landmark formulation that paved the way for the widespread use of LNP as nucleic acid delivery systems (2,7,8) and for the worldwide rollout of the LNP-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (9). However, like many other nanomedicines, LNP suffer from a low selectivity and specificity for target cells and organs and limits clinical translation (10,11). First of all, nanoparticles can be rapidly sequestered by macrophages into the liver and other secondary lymphoid organs, which impair their delivery to target tissues (12). Moreover, while ligand-targeted nanomedicines show a higher efficacy in vitro compared to their untargeted counterpart, this advantage is often lost in vivo due to masking from the formation of a biomolecular protein corona (BMC) (13). The formation of a BMC can be an advantage as several groups have shown that once i.v. administered, the BMC could enable LNPs to possess extrinsic targeting properties, directing them towards specific cell receptors (14-18). An early example of this includes Onpattro, as its ability to interact with specific serum proteins (Apolipoprotein E) after i.v. administrations, directs the LNP towards low-density lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes (5,6,19). More recently, studies have focused on extrahepatic delivery by optimizing the physiochemical properties of LNPs to drive distinct BMC profiles, subsequently, enabling targeting of nonliver organs such as the spleen or lungs (20)(21)(22).",

Schiffelers, Dominik Witzigmann, P. Cullis\n## Abstract\nSignificance Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology is increasingly enabling many gene therapies. Once LNPs are administered in vivo, preferential LNP targeting to desired cells can be attributed to the formation of a biomolecular corona (BMC), however, characterization of the corona is challenging. This is due to poor separation efficiency of LNP\u2013corona complexes from unbound proteins. Herein, we developed magnetic iron-oxide-loaded LNPs (IOLNP) that allow separation of LNP\u2013corona complexes from biological media through magnetic separation. This technology enables a rapid and selective method to separate LNP\u2013corona complexes and enables in-depth characterization of the BMC while maintaining the particle integrity.\n## body\nLipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations are a proven method for the delivery of nucleic acids for gene therapy as exemplified by the worldwide rollout of LNP-based RNAi therapeutics and mRNA vaccines. However, targeting specific tissues or cells is still a major challenge. After LNP administration, LNPs interact with biological fluids (i.e., blood), components of which adsorb onto the LNP surface forming a layer of biomolecules termed the \"biomolecular corona (BMC)\" which affects LNP stability, biodistribution, and tissue tropism. The mechanisms by which the BMC influences tissue-and cell-specific targeting remains largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media. In this study, we present a new technique that utilizes magnetic LNPs to isolate LNP-corona complexes from unbound proteins present in human serum. First, we developed a magnetic LNP formulation, containing >40 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)/LNP, the resulting LNPs containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IOLNPs) displayed a similar particle size and morphology as LNPs loaded with nucleic acids. We further demonstrated the isolation of the IOLNPs and their corresponding BMC from unbound proteins using a magnetic separation (MS) system. The BMC profile of LNP from the MS system was compared to size exclusion column chromatography and further analyzed via mass spectrometry, revealing differences in protein abundances. This new approach enabled a mild and versatile isolation of LNPs and its corona, while maintaining its structural integrity. The identification of the BMC associated with an intact LNP provides further insight into LNP interactions with biological fluids.\n\n## lipid nanoparticles | iron oxide nanoparticles | biomolecular corona | magnetic separation\nLipid nanoparticles (LNP) have emerged as an effective nonviral delivery system for nucleic acid payloads due to their high encapsulation efficiency, low toxicity, ability to facilitate intracellular delivery, and the possibility to modulate their size and surface properties (1)(2)(3). The technological advances carried out in the past three decades have enabled the clinical approval of the first LNP-based siRNA therapeutic, Onpattro (4)(5)(6), which quickly became a landmark formulation that paved the way for the widespread use of LNP as nucleic acid delivery systems (2,7,8) and for the worldwide rollout of the LNP-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (9). However, like many other nanomedicines, LNP suffer from a low selectivity and specificity for target cells and organs and limits clinical translation (10,11). First of all, nanoparticles can be rapidly sequestered by macrophages into the liver and other secondary lymphoid organs, which impair their delivery to target tissues (12). Moreover, while ligand-targeted nanomedicines show a higher efficacy in vitro compared to their untargeted counterpart, this advantage is often lost in vivo due to masking from the formation of a biomolecular protein corona (BMC) (13). The formation of a BMC can be an advantage as several groups have shown that once i.v. administered, the BMC could enable LNPs to possess extrinsic targeting properties, directing them towards specific cell receptors (14-18). An early example of this includes Onpattro, as its ability to interact with specific serum proteins (Apolipoprotein E) after i.v. administrations, directs the LNP towards low-density lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes (5,6,19). More recently, studies have focused on extrahepatic delivery by optimizing the physiochemical properties of LNPs to drive distinct BMC profiles, subsequently, enabling targeting of nonliver organs such as the spleen or lungs (20)(21)(22).\n\n## Discussion\nIt is well established that the BMC can dramatically affect the tropism of LNPs as illustrated by the influence of adsorbed apo-E on uptake of Onpattro LNP into hepatocytes (4).

Therefore, it is essential to improve our current understanding of the fundamental biological interaction between LNP and biological media in order to critically design the next generation of LNP for accessing and treating a wide range of diseases. Our study presents a robust method to isolate LNPs and their corona from complex media based on magnetism. We developed magnetic IOLNP by encapsulating IONPs in the LNP core. The MS technique using magnetic separator and magnetic column chromatography provides a rapid and reproducible tool for the separation of LNP-corona complexes from biological fluids and an in-depth characterization of its BMC with maintained particle integrity. Such method development is crucial in overcoming challenges posed by the analytical limitation of more conventional methods and provides new insight into the corona composition that may be masked by naturally abundant unbound protein as a result of artifacts that originated from the biological media.",

Based on nanotechnology development, the non-viral vectors provide a promising strategy for overcoming the difficulties in gene therapy. At present, according to the physicochemical properties, nanotechnology-based non-viral vectors include polymers, liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles.

                    "text": "Lipids-based nanoparticles (LNPs) are unique nanostructures, composed of various types of lipids, including cationic or ionizable lipids (CIL), structural lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol), and PEG-binding lipids (PEG-Derived phospholipids) (Patel et al., 2019). Among them, ionizable lipids are the key components that determine the titer, mRNA delivery efficiency, degradability, and reactivity (Drescher and van Hoogevest, 2020). At low pH, ionizable lipids are protonated in acidic buffers, producing a positive charge and binding to negatively charged mRNA, whereas they remain neutral at physiological pH (Chan et al., 2021;Scalzo et al., 2022). The delivery mechanism of LNPs is shown in Figure 4. Ionizable lipids are less cytotoxic than cationic lipids. This is because the positive charge of cationic lipids typically interacts with negatively charged molecules on the cell surface, leading to cell membrane damage and cell death. In contrast, ionizable lipids can dynamically regulate their charge state in the cellular environment, avoiding the continuous release of positive charges to the cell surface and reducing cytotoxicity (Sharma et al., 2014). In general, PEGbound lipids in LNPs occupy the smallest molar percentage, which can enhance particle stability by affecting charge distribution, size, and dispersion, and hinder LNPs from aggregating, playing a crucial role in blood circulation and biological distribution (Albertsen and Camilla et al., 2022;Kon et al., 2022;Gu\u00e9guen et al., 2023). Structural lipids are chiefly used to support the structure of particles and enhance stability during storage and circulation (Kulkarni et al., 2019;Witzigmann et al., 2020). According to diverse target tissues, the proportions of these four lipid components can be adjusted to change the LNP constitution (Yihunie et al., 2023).",

Although gene therapy has gained some accomplishment for the diagnosis and therapy of inherited or acquired cardiovascular diseases, how to efficiently and specifically deliver targeted genes to the lesion sites without being cleared by the blood system remains challenging. Based on nanotechnology development, the non-viral vectors provide a promising strategy for overcoming the difficulties in gene therapy. At present, according to the physicochemical properties, nanotechnology-based non-viral vectors include polymers, liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles. Non-viral vectors have an advantage in safety, efficiency, and easy production, possessing potential clinical application value when compared with viral vectors. Therefore, we summarized recent research progress of gene therapy for cardiovascular diseases based on commonly used non-viral vectors, hopefully providing guidance and orientation for future relevant research.\n## Lipid nanoparticles\nLipids-based nanoparticles (LNPs) are unique nanostructures, composed of various types of lipids, including cationic or ionizable lipids (CIL), structural lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol), and PEG-binding lipids (PEG-Derived phospholipids) (Patel et al., 2019). Among them, ionizable lipids are the key components that determine the titer, mRNA delivery efficiency, degradability, and reactivity (Drescher and van Hoogevest, 2020). At low pH, ionizable lipids are protonated in acidic buffers, producing a positive charge and binding to negatively charged mRNA, whereas they remain neutral at physiological pH (Chan et al., 2021;Scalzo et al., 2022). The delivery mechanism of LNPs is shown in Figure 4. Ionizable lipids are less cytotoxic than cationic lipids. This is because the positive charge of cationic lipids typically interacts with negatively charged molecules on the cell surface, leading to cell membrane damage and cell death. In contrast, ionizable lipids can dynamically regulate their charge state in the cellular environment, avoiding the continuous release of positive charges to the cell surface and reducing cytotoxicity (Sharma et al., 2014). In general, PEGbound lipids in LNPs occupy the smallest molar percentage, which can enhance particle stability by affecting charge distribution, size, and dispersion, and hinder LNPs from aggregating, playing a crucial role in blood circulation and biological distribution (Albertsen and Camilla et al., 2022;Kon et al., 2022;Gu\u00e9guen et al., 2023). Structural lipids are chiefly used to support the structure of particles and enhance stability during storage and circulation (Kulkarni et al., 2019;Witzigmann et al., 2020). According to diverse target tissues, the proportions of these four lipid components can be adjusted to change the LNP constitution (Yihunie et al., 2023).",

Small-angle neutron scattering has been used in this work to investigate the structure of LNPs encapsulating plasmid DNA upon their acidification (from pH 7.4 to 4.0), as would be encountered during endocytosis. The results revealed the acidification-induced structure evolution (AISE) of the LNPs on different dimension scales, involving protonation of the ionizable lipid, volume expansion and redistribution of aqueous and lipid components. A similarity analysis using an LNP\u2019s structural feature space showed a strong positive correlation between function (measured by intracellular luciferase expression) and the extent of AISE, which was further enhanced by the fraction of unsaturated helper lipid. Our findings reveal molecular and nanoscale changes occurring during AISE that underpin the LNPs\u2019 formulation\u2013nanostructure\u2013function relationship, aiding the rational design of application-directed gene delivery vehicles.",

An exemplary vector will protect the nucleic acid payload from degradation and overcome a series of extracellular and intracellular barriers to enable efficient gene translation/transcription at the desired cell/tissue target. 1,2 Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vectors formulated with an ionizable lipid, a PEGylated lipid, cholesterol, and a helper lipid have demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety in disease prevention and treatment, 3\u22125 most recently as vectors of mRNA vaccines. 6,7 Their rapid adoption is in no small part due to decades of earlier research 8\u221210 and the prior approval of Onpattro. 11 ne of the major challenges in developing LNP-based technologies is finding optimized lipid formulations for enhancing protein production, which are typically targetspecific, differing between various cells/tissues. \u221215 Changes in lipid type and composition alter their interactions and result in different nanostructures such as inverted micelles and invertedhexagonal, multiple-lamellar and amorphous phases for different formulations. 16 Moreover, the LNP nanostructure is related to its capacity for cellular uptake and release of the payload. 17,18 However, LNP development studies must rely on high-throughput screening work in vitro and in vivo due to the nature of multiple components and the complexity of LNP manufacturing. Thus, the rational design of LNP carriers, in the context of linking the structural features of key components to their functional roles and proposing target-specific adjust-ment, is a step forward for future LNP-based gene delivery applications. \n\nThe path to achieving the rational design of LNP carriers requires a better understanding of the LNP structures, which is the core of the LNP's formulation\u2212structure\u2212function relationship. The formulation mechanism of lipid nanocarriers and the structural phase transitions occurring upon encapsulation of nucleic acids have been previously investigated by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) 19,20 and the component distributions across the LNP by SANS. 21,22 arious LNP structure models have been proposed by different techniques. 17,23",

Webster, C. F. van der Walle, Peixun Li, S. Rogers, J. Lu\n## Abstract\nThe rational design of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for enhanced gene delivery remains challenging because of incomplete knowledge of their formulation\u2013structure relationship that impacts their intracellular behavior and consequent function. Small-angle neutron scattering has been used in this work to investigate the structure of LNPs encapsulating plasmid DNA upon their acidification (from pH 7.4 to 4.0), as would be encountered during endocytosis. The results revealed the acidification-induced structure evolution (AISE) of the LNPs on different dimension scales, involving protonation of the ionizable lipid, volume expansion and redistribution of aqueous and lipid components. A similarity analysis using an LNP\u2019s structural feature space showed a strong positive correlation between function (measured by intracellular luciferase expression) and the extent of AISE, which was further enhanced by the fraction of unsaturated helper lipid. Our findings reveal molecular and nanoscale changes occurring during AISE that underpin the LNPs\u2019 formulation\u2013nanostructure\u2013function relationship, aiding the rational design of application-directed gene delivery vehicles.\n## INTRODUCTION\nGene delivery offers solutions for the treatment of rare diseases and, more recently, viral pandemics. An exemplary vector will protect the nucleic acid payload from degradation and overcome a series of extracellular and intracellular barriers to enable efficient gene translation/transcription at the desired cell/tissue target. 1,2 Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vectors formulated with an ionizable lipid, a PEGylated lipid, cholesterol, and a helper lipid have demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety in disease prevention and treatment, 3\u22125 most recently as vectors of mRNA vaccines. 6,7 Their rapid adoption is in no small part due to decades of earlier research 8\u221210 and the prior approval of Onpattro. 11 ne of the major challenges in developing LNP-based technologies is finding optimized lipid formulations for enhancing protein production, which are typically targetspecific, differing between various cells/tissues. \u221215 Changes in lipid type and composition alter their interactions and result in different nanostructures such as inverted micelles and invertedhexagonal, multiple-lamellar and amorphous phases for different formulations. 16 Moreover, the LNP nanostructure is related to its capacity for cellular uptake and release of the payload. 17,18 However, LNP development studies must rely on high-throughput screening work in vitro and in vivo due to the nature of multiple components and the complexity of LNP manufacturing. Thus, the rational design of LNP carriers, in the context of linking the structural features of key components to their functional roles and proposing target-specific adjust-ment, is a step forward for future LNP-based gene delivery applications. \n\nThe path to achieving the rational design of LNP carriers requires a better understanding of the LNP structures, which is the core of the LNP's formulation\u2212structure\u2212function relationship. The formulation mechanism of lipid nanocarriers and the structural phase transitions occurring upon encapsulation of nucleic acids have been previously investigated by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) 19,20 and the component distributions across the LNP by SANS. 21,22 arious LNP structure models have been proposed by different techniques. 17,23",

            "abstract": "RNA-based therapeutics have shown great promise in various medical applications, including cancers, infectious diseases, and metabolic diseases. The recent success of mRNA vaccines for combating the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the medical value of RNA drugs. However, one of the major challenges in realizing the full potential of RNA drugs is to deliver RNA into specific organs and tissues in a targeted manner, which is crucial for achieving therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects, and enhancing overall treatment efficacy. Numerous attempts have been made to pursue targeting, nonetheless, the lack of clear guideline and commonality elucidation has hindered the clinical translation of RNA drugs. In this review, we outline the mechanisms of action for targeted RNA delivery systems and summarize four key factors that influence the targeting delivery of RNA drugs. These factors include the category of vector materials, chemical structures of vectors, administration routes, and physicochemical properties of RNA vectors, and they all notably contribute to specific organ/tissue tropism. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the main RNA-based drugs that are currently in clinical trials, highlighting their design strategies and tissue tropism applications. This review will aid to understand the principles and mechanisms of targeted delivery systems, accelerating the development of future RNA drugs for different diseases.",

                    "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

The recent success of mRNA vaccines for combating the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the medical value of RNA drugs. However, one of the major challenges in realizing the full potential of RNA drugs is to deliver RNA into specific organs and tissues in a targeted manner, which is crucial for achieving therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects, and enhancing overall treatment efficacy. Numerous attempts have been made to pursue targeting, nonetheless, the lack of clear guideline and commonality elucidation has hindered the clinical translation of RNA drugs. In this review, we outline the mechanisms of action for targeted RNA delivery systems and summarize four key factors that influence the targeting delivery of RNA drugs. These factors include the category of vector materials, chemical structures of vectors, administration routes, and physicochemical properties of RNA vectors, and they all notably contribute to specific organ/tissue tropism. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the main RNA-based drugs that are currently in clinical trials, highlighting their design strategies and tissue tropism applications. This review will aid to understand the principles and mechanisms of targeted delivery systems, accelerating the development of future RNA drugs for different diseases.\n## Protein corona\nThe formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

Although it is clear that serum proteins will be adsorbed onto the surface of LNPs following the desorption of PEG-lipids upon systemic injections, the protein corona of different ligand-modified LNPs is not well studied yet. A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al. 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles. \n\nWhile various types of ligands were incorporated into LNPs to improve the specific delivery of nucleic acids, the major accessible organs are still limited to the liver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues. Indeed, organspecific delivery is often dependent on passive distribution. Only when LNPs reach the organ of interest can they make full use of their targeting moieties to realize specific binding and enhanced uptake (Kedmi et al. 2018). Therefore, it is not surprising that the liver, lungs, and spleen, where LNPs distribute most, and tumors whose vascularization promotes LNP accumulation, are generally easier to reach than other organs. In our view, future directions in LNP-based targeted nucleic acid delivery will be mostly aimed at developing the targeted LNPs to reach the hard-to-access organs (e.g., the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, and bone) and cell types.

The liposome\u2013protein corona is a dynamic interface that regulates the interaction of liposomes with the physiological environment. Here we show that the biological identity of liposomes is clearly linked to their sequestration from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donors that ultimately leads to removal from the bloodstream. Pre-coating liposomes with an artificial corona made of human plasma proteins drastically reduces capture by circulating leukocytes in whole blood and may be an effective strategy to enable prolonged circulation in vivo. We conclude with a critical assessment of the key concepts of liposome technology that need to be reviewed for its definitive clinical translation.

The scope of LNP applications in terms of RNA is not limited to antiviral vaccines but encompasses anticancer drugs and therapeutics for genetic (including rare) diseases. Such widespread use implies high customizability of targeted delivery of LNPs to specific organs and tissues. This review addresses vector-free options for targeted delivery of LNPs, namely the influence of lipid composition of these nanoparticles on their biodistribution. In the review, experimental studies are examined that are focused on the biodistribution of mRNA or of the encoded protein after mRNA administration via LNPs in mammals. We also performed a comprehensive analysis of individual lipids\u2019 functional groups that ensure biodistribution to desired organs. These data will allow us to outline prospects for further optimization of lipid compositions of nanoparticles for targeted delivery of mRNA therapeutics.",

The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

Ivanov, V. Reshetnikov\n## Abstract\nToday, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are some of the main delivery systems for mRNA-based therapeutics. The scope of LNP applications in terms of RNA is not limited to antiviral vaccines but encompasses anticancer drugs and therapeutics for genetic (including rare) diseases. Such widespread use implies high customizability of targeted delivery of LNPs to specific organs and tissues. This review addresses vector-free options for targeted delivery of LNPs, namely the influence of lipid composition of these nanoparticles on their biodistribution. In the review, experimental studies are examined that are focused on the biodistribution of mRNA or of the encoded protein after mRNA administration via LNPs in mammals. We also performed a comprehensive analysis of individual lipids\u2019 functional groups that ensure biodistribution to desired organs. These data will allow us to outline prospects for further optimization of lipid compositions of nanoparticles for targeted delivery of mRNA therapeutics.\n## Typical biodistribution of LNPs\nThe lion's share of various LNPs gets distributed to the liver and to a lesser extent to the spleen, and the reason is the presence of a sinusoidal discontinuous endothelium with pores of a ~100-200 nm diameter in these organs (Kumar et al., 2023). After intravenous administration and entry into the bloodstream, a protein corona forms on the surface of LNPs, and this topic is investigated in detail in Dilliard et al. (2021). The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022;Da Silva Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022). Overall, the delivery of LNPs into cells by an ApoE-independent mechanism leads to their accumulation in cells other than hepatocytes (Wadhera et al., 2016). A decrease in the proportion of cholesterol also impairs the delivery of LNPs to hepatocytes (Kawaguchi et al., 2023). Because of the fairly widespread expression of LDL receptor in human tissues (https:// www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130164-LDLR/tissue),\n\n## Helper lipids\nFor classic fourcomponent LNPs, apparent pK a was 6.3-6.6 in the above study, depending on the ionizable cationic lipid used. The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).\n...\nThus, the addition of a charged lipid into LNPs affects pK a of the particles, which in turn determines the formation of a protein corona on the surface of the LNPs and accordingly their subsequent distribution throughout organs, which is modulated by proteins of the corona. This principle allows to redirect particles between the liver, spleen, and lungs through the addition of neutral, negatively charged, or positively charged lipids, respectively. It is possible that a combination of an administration route with charged lipids can ensure targeting to new types of tissues and cells.",

Furthermore, the interactions between process parameters, critical quality attributes (CQAs), and function, such as protein expression and cellular activation, are not well understood. Here, we used two iterations of design of experiments (DoE) (definitive screening design and Box\u2013Behnken design) to optimize saRNA formulations using the leading, FDA-approved ionizable lipids (MC3, ALC-0315, and SM-102). We observed that PEG is required to preserve the CQAs and that saRNA is more challenging to encapsulate and preserve than mRNA. We identified three formulations to minimize cellular activation, maximize cellular activation, or meet a CQA profile while maximizing protein expression. The significant parameters and design of the response surface modeling and multiple response optimization may be useful for designing formulations for a range of applications, such as vaccines or protein replacement therapies, for larger RNA cargoes.",

The ionizable cationic lipids are electrostatically complexed with polyanionic RNA to enable its encapsulation by the neutral lipids and facilitate cellular uptake and endosomal escape. 8,9 Phospholipids may play a role in membrane fusion and endosomal escape, but they mainly provide structural integrity to the particles. 7,10 Similarly, cholesterol enhances stability and fluidity of the LNP and improves intracellular delivery. 7,11 PEGylated lipids introduce a steric barrier at the surface of particles to increase colloidal stability by reducing aggregation and to \"shield\" particles from being bound by serum proteins in vivo including opsonins, which mark LNPs for removal by phagocytic systems. 7,12",

Kis, A. Blakney\n## Abstract\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading technology for RNA delivery, given the success of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA (mRNA) vaccines, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapies (patisiran). However, optimization of LNP process parameters and compositions for larger RNA payloads such as self-amplifying RNA (saRNA), which can have complex secondary structures, have not been carried out. Furthermore, the interactions between process parameters, critical quality attributes (CQAs), and function, such as protein expression and cellular activation, are not well understood. Here, we used two iterations of design of experiments (DoE) (definitive screening design and Box\u2013Behnken design) to optimize saRNA formulations using the leading, FDA-approved ionizable lipids (MC3, ALC-0315, and SM-102). We observed that PEG is required to preserve the CQAs and that saRNA is more challenging to encapsulate and preserve than mRNA. We identified three formulations to minimize cellular activation, maximize cellular activation, or meet a CQA profile while maximizing protein expression. The significant parameters and design of the response surface modeling and multiple response optimization may be useful for designing formulations for a range of applications, such as vaccines or protein replacement therapies, for larger RNA cargoes.\n## INTRODUCTION\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading technology for nonviral nucleic acid delivery. In particular, LNPs have been clinically approved to facilitate efficient delivery of ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based medicines, including the mRNA (mRNA)\u2212 LNP vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 1,2 and small interfering RNA (siRNA)\u2212LNP therapeutics like patisiran, which treats polyneuropathies induced by hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. 3 Early research on RNA vaccines has demonstrated that naked RNA is quickly degraded after administration by cellular ribonucleases (RNases). 4,5 LNPs slow down the degradation process to ensure RNA stability while also promoting cellular internalization via endocytosis and allowing intracellular release of RNA into the cytoplasm for translation by cellular machinery. 6,7 The loading of mRNA cargo into nanoparticles is a spontaneous process wherein lipids undergo rapid mixing with RNA and collectively self-assemble into particles approximately 100 nm in diameter. 8 he composition of LNPs typically includes an ionizable cationic lipid and three neutral helper lipids: phospholipid, cholesterol, and lipid-anchored polyethylene glycol (PEGylated lipid). The ionizable cationic lipids are electrostatically complexed with polyanionic RNA to enable its encapsulation by the neutral lipids and facilitate cellular uptake and endosomal escape. 8,9 Phospholipids may play a role in membrane fusion and endosomal escape, but they mainly provide structural integrity to the particles. 7,10 Similarly, cholesterol enhances stability and fluidity of the LNP and improves intracellular delivery. 7,11 PEGylated lipids introduce a steric barrier at the surface of particles to increase colloidal stability by reducing aggregation and to \"shield\" particles from being bound by serum proteins in vivo including opsonins, which mark LNPs for removal by phagocytic systems. 7,12",

            "abstract": "Recent progress in material science has led to the development of new drug delivery systems that go beyond the conventional approaches and offer greater accuracy and convenience in the application of therapeutic agents. This review discusses the evolutionary role of nanocarriers, hydrogels, and bioresponsive polymers that offer enhanced drug release, target accuracy, and bioavailability. Oncology, chronic disease management, and vaccine delivery are some of the applications explored in this paper to show how these materials improve the therapeutic results, counteract multidrug resistance, and allow for sustained and localized treatments. The review also discusses the translational barriers of bringing advanced materials into the clinical setting, which include issues of biocompatibility, scalability, and regulatory approval. Methods to overcome these challenges include surface modifications to reduce immunogenicity, scalable production methods such as microfluidics, and the harmonization of regulatory systems. In addition, the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is opening new frontiers in material science and personalized medicine. These technologies allow for predictive modeling and real-time adjustments to optimize drug delivery to the needs of individual patients. The use of advanced materials can also be applied to rare and underserved diseases; thus, new strategies in gene therapy, orphan drugs development, and global vaccine distribution may offer new hopes for millions of patients.",

                    "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have become a cornerstone in modern vaccine technology, particularly with the rapid development of mRNA-based vaccines, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines [141,142]. LNPs are nanoscale particles composed primarily of lipids that are designed to encapsulate and protect fragile molecules such as mRNA, ensuring their stability during storage and transportation [143]. In the context of mRNA vaccines, LNPs serve as the delivery vehicle that shields the mRNA from enzymatic degradation and facilitates its delivery into host cells [144]. \n\nThe success of LNPs in mRNA vaccines is largely attributed to their ability to effectively interact with cell membranes [145]. When administered, LNPs are taken up by cells through endocytosis, where the mRNA is then released into the cytoplasm [146]. The LNPs' lipid composition is crucial for this process, as the lipid bilayer can fuse with the cell membrane, allowing the mRNA to be directly delivered into the cells without triggering excessive immune responses or causing toxicity [147,148]. Once inside the cell, the mRNA is translated into the protein of interest, such as the spike protein in the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, triggering an immune response that prepares the body to recognize and fight the virus if it is encountered again [149]. \n\nOne of the key advantages of LNPs in vaccine delivery is their ability to induce strong immune activation [150,151]. They enhance the uptake of mRNA by dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells, which are responsible for initiating the immune response. This leads to the production of both neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses, both of which are crucial for protecting against viral infections [150,152,153]. Additionally, LNPs have shown promise in targeting specific tissues or organs, increasing the efficiency of vaccine delivery while potentially reducing side effects or systemic toxicity [154,155]. \n\nLNPs are also highly versatile, allowing for customization of their lipid components to optimize the release profile, stability, and biocompatibility of the mRNA payload [156].",

Aljabali, Ibrahim Al Faouri, Abdul Rehman\n## Abstract\nRecent progress in material science has led to the development of new drug delivery systems that go beyond the conventional approaches and offer greater accuracy and convenience in the application of therapeutic agents. This review discusses the evolutionary role of nanocarriers, hydrogels, and bioresponsive polymers that offer enhanced drug release, target accuracy, and bioavailability. Oncology, chronic disease management, and vaccine delivery are some of the applications explored in this paper to show how these materials improve the therapeutic results, counteract multidrug resistance, and allow for sustained and localized treatments. The review also discusses the translational barriers of bringing advanced materials into the clinical setting, which include issues of biocompatibility, scalability, and regulatory approval. Methods to overcome these challenges include surface modifications to reduce immunogenicity, scalable production methods such as microfluidics, and the harmonization of regulatory systems. In addition, the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is opening new frontiers in material science and personalized medicine. These technologies allow for predictive modeling and real-time adjustments to optimize drug delivery to the needs of individual patients. The use of advanced materials can also be applied to rare and underserved diseases; thus, new strategies in gene therapy, orphan drugs development, and global vaccine distribution may offer new hopes for millions of patients.\n## Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs)\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have become a cornerstone in modern vaccine technology, particularly with the rapid development of mRNA-based vaccines, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines [141,142]. LNPs are nanoscale particles composed primarily of lipids that are designed to encapsulate and protect fragile molecules such as mRNA, ensuring their stability during storage and transportation [143]. In the context of mRNA vaccines, LNPs serve as the delivery vehicle that shields the mRNA from enzymatic degradation and facilitates its delivery into host cells [144]. \n\nThe success of LNPs in mRNA vaccines is largely attributed to their ability to effectively interact with cell membranes [145]. When administered, LNPs are taken up by cells through endocytosis, where the mRNA is then released into the cytoplasm [146]. The LNPs' lipid composition is crucial for this process, as the lipid bilayer can fuse with the cell membrane, allowing the mRNA to be directly delivered into the cells without triggering excessive immune responses or causing toxicity [147,148]. Once inside the cell, the mRNA is translated into the protein of interest, such as the spike protein in the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, triggering an immune response that prepares the body to recognize and fight the virus if it is encountered again [149]. \n\nOne of the key advantages of LNPs in vaccine delivery is their ability to induce strong immune activation [150,151]. They enhance the uptake of mRNA by dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells, which are responsible for initiating the immune response. This leads to the production of both neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses, both of which are crucial for protecting against viral infections [150,152,153]. Additionally, LNPs have shown promise in targeting specific tissues or organs, increasing the efficiency of vaccine delivery while potentially reducing side effects or systemic toxicity [154,155]. \n\nLNPs are also highly versatile, allowing for customization of their lipid components to optimize the release profile, stability, and biocompatibility of the mRNA payload [156].",

LNPs have been targeted to specific cell types or organs by physicochemical targeting, in which LNP\u2019s lipid compositions are adjusted to find mixtures with the desired tropism. In a popular approach, physicochemical targeting is accomplished by formulating with charged lipids. Negatively charged lipids localize LNPs to the spleen, and positively charged lipids to the lungs. Here we found that lung-tropic LNPs employing cationic lipids induce massive thrombosis. We demonstrate that thrombosis is induced in the lungs and other organs, and greatly exacerbated by pre-existing inflammation. This clotting is induced by a variety of formulations with cationic lipids, including LNPs and non-LNP nanoparticles. The mechanism depends on the LNPs binding to fibrinogen and inducing platelet and thrombin activation. Based on these mechanisms, we engineered multiple solutions which enable positively charged LNPs to target the lungs while not inducing thrombosis. Our findings implicate thrombosis as a major barrier that blood erects against LNPs with cationic components and illustrate how physicochemical targeting approaches must be investigated early for risks and re-engineered with a careful understanding of biological mechanisms.",

However, the relationship between the IL structure and LNP endogenous organ-targeting is not well understood. In this study, we developed a novel library of biodegradable ILs featuring beta-propionate linkers, which, when incorporated into a four-component LNP formulation, show excellent extrahepatic selectivity and high protein expression. Methods: We explored the impact of structural modifications in the hydrophobic chains and polar-head groups in the ILs while keeping the linkers unchanged. In vivo results were evaluated to examine how structural changes influence the biodistribution to spleen or lungs. LNP formulations were assessed for their protein expression levels and organ-specific targeting. Additionally, protein corona formation by the best-performing LNPs was examined to provide further mechanistic insights. Results: Organ targeting was significantly influenced by structural changes in the ILs, allowing for precise control of the biodistribution between the spleen and lungs. Branched hydrophobic chains demonstrated a higher propensity for spleen targeting, while modifications in the polar-head group could drastically shift biodistribution from the lung to the spleen. This led to the identification of LNPs\u2019 zeta potential as a key determinant of their extrahepatic targeting properties. Notably, ionizable lipid A3T2C7, also known as CP-LC-1495, displayed strong lung selectivity (97%) and high protein expression in lung tissue (1.21 \u00d7 108 p/s).

Conclusions: This study elucidates the structure\u2013function relationships of ILs in passive organ-specific mRNA delivery, highlighting how the fine-tuning of hydrophobic chains, polar-head groups, and surface charge (zeta potential) allows for the precise control of LNP endogenous biodistribution, a mechanism influenced by protein corona formation.

Structural modifications, such as replacing uridine with 1-methylpseudouridine (1m\u03c8), enhance translation efficiency and help the mRNA evade immune detection. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) serve as an effective delivery system. Vaccines like BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein, prompting B cells to produce neutralizing antibodies that block the RBD from binding to the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, preventing infection. These vaccines also stimulate adaptive immune responses by activating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with mRNA functioning as an endogenous antigen. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) present the vaccine antigens via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II pathways, with CD8+ T cells recognizing MHC class I and destroying infected cells, while CD4+ T cells recognize MHC class II and assist in B cell maturation and antibody production. While mRNA vaccines have proven effective in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, challenges remain, including the decline in neutralizing antibody titers over time and the emergence of new viral variants.",

                    "text": "The delivery system for mRNA vaccines is a critical component of their development and success. For COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are employed to protect the mRNA from degradation by endonucleases as it circulates in the body and is delivered into cells. Once inside the cell, the mRNA is released into the cytoplasm, where it can initiate protein translation. LNPs, the primary delivery vehicle for these vaccines, consist of four main components: neutral phospholipids, cholesterol, polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids, and ionizable cationic lipids (Figure 2) [23,24]. \n\nThe LNPs encapsulate the mRNA by using positively charged amine groups at low pH, which interact with the negatively charged mRNA during the manufacturing process. This positive charge not only aids in mRNA encapsulation but also facilitates the fusion of LNPs with the cell membrane during internalization. PEG lipids play a crucial role in stabilizing the nanoparticles, controlling particle size, and preventing aggregation during storage. The rapid mixing technique used in production results in particles within the size range of 60-100 nm [25]. Additionally, LNPs contain apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is essential for the internalization of mRNA via endosomal pathways, further protecting the mRNA from degradation. Although the precise mechanisms by which LNPs safeguard mRNA are still not fully understood, it is known that the ionizable lipids in LNPs become protonated in the acidic environment of the endosome (pH <7). This protonation promotes lipid exchange between LNPs and the anionic phospholipids in the endosomal membrane, leading to membrane fusion. This fusion enables the release of mRNA into the cytosol, where it can be translated into proteins. ApoE enhances this process by helping the mRNA evade the endosomal degradation pathway [26].",

Dewi\n## Abstract\nThe development of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines is closely linked to advancements in mRNA manufacturing technology. Structural modifications, such as replacing uridine with 1-methylpseudouridine (1m\u03c8), enhance translation efficiency and help the mRNA evade immune detection. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) serve as an effective delivery system. Vaccines like BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein, prompting B cells to produce neutralizing antibodies that block the RBD from binding to the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, preventing infection. These vaccines also stimulate adaptive immune responses by activating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with mRNA functioning as an endogenous antigen. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) present the vaccine antigens via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II pathways, with CD8+ T cells recognizing MHC class I and destroying infected cells, while CD4+ T cells recognize MHC class II and assist in B cell maturation and antibody production. While mRNA vaccines have proven effective in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, challenges remain, including the decline in neutralizing antibody titers over time and the emergence of new viral variants.\n## The mRNA vaccine delivery system\nThe delivery system for mRNA vaccines is a critical component of their development and success. For COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are employed to protect the mRNA from degradation by endonucleases as it circulates in the body and is delivered into cells. Once inside the cell, the mRNA is released into the cytoplasm, where it can initiate protein translation. LNPs, the primary delivery vehicle for these vaccines, consist of four main components: neutral phospholipids, cholesterol, polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids, and ionizable cationic lipids (Figure 2) [23,24]. \n\nThe LNPs encapsulate the mRNA by using positively charged amine groups at low pH, which interact with the negatively charged mRNA during the manufacturing process. This positive charge not only aids in mRNA encapsulation but also facilitates the fusion of LNPs with the cell membrane during internalization. PEG lipids play a crucial role in stabilizing the nanoparticles, controlling particle size, and preventing aggregation during storage. The rapid mixing technique used in production results in particles within the size range of 60-100 nm [25]. Additionally, LNPs contain apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is essential for the internalization of mRNA via endosomal pathways, further protecting the mRNA from degradation. Although the precise mechanisms by which LNPs safeguard mRNA are still not fully understood, it is known that the ionizable lipids in LNPs become protonated in the acidic environment of the endosome (pH <7). This protonation promotes lipid exchange between LNPs and the anionic phospholipids in the endosomal membrane, leading to membrane fusion. This fusion enables the release of mRNA into the cytosol, where it can be translated into proteins. ApoE enhances this process by helping the mRNA evade the endosomal degradation pathway [26].",

[69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

[69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

The delivery approach that is both most widely used and most clinically advanced is to complex anionic oligonucleotides with cationic lipids thus forming lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (161)(162)(163). This approach has been especially important for therapeutic use of siRNA (164) and good accounts of current clinical trials using siRNA LNPs are found in recent reviews (10,165). In addition to the cationic lipid, LNPs typically include a neutral lipid such as cholesterol, but a variety of compositions are possible. While simple LNPs are effective as cell culture transfection agents, they cannot be used in vivo because extensive interactions with opsonic proteins in blood lead to rapid clearance by RES phagocytes. LNPs for in vivo use are usually 100-200 nm in size and include a surface coating of a neutral polymer such as PEG to minimize protein binding and uptake by RES cells. This allows greater persistence in the circulation and the opportunity to interact with other cell types. However, because of their size, LNPs can only exit the circulation at sites where the endothelial barrier is fenestrated, particularly liver, spleen and certain tumors having a high EPR effect. Because of this, much of the work with siRNA-LNPs has focused on liver diseases including transthyrethrin-mediated amyloidosis, clotting disorders, liver cancer and disorders of lipid metabolism (11,166). \n\nThe action of LNPs involves initial uptake by endocytosis. In some cases this is mediated by the binding of apolipoprotein E and interaction with the LDL receptor (167). Once in endosomes, the cationic lipids of the LNP interact with anionic membrane lipids to disrupt membrane structure through the formation of a non-bilayer lipid phase termed inverted hexagonal (H II ). This leads both to increased membrane permeability and to dissolution of the LNP and is the basis for conveying the oligonucleotide to the cytosol (168).",

This remarkable potential of siRNA makes it a useful candidate, and it has been successively used in the treatment of diseases, including cancer. However, certain properties of siRNA such as its large size and susceptibility to degradation by RNases are major drawbacks of using this technology at the broader scale. To overcome these challenges, there is a requirement for versatile tools for safe and efficient delivery of siRNA to its target site. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been extensively explored to this end, and this paper reviews different types of LNPs, namely liposomes, solid lipid NPs, nanostructured lipid carriers, and nanoemulsions, to highlight this delivery mode. The materials and methods of preparation of the LNPs have been described here, and pertinent physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface charge, surface modifications, and PEGylation in enhancing the delivery performance (stability and specificity) have been summarized. We have discussed in detail various challenges facing LNPs and various strategies to overcome biological barriers to undertake the safe delivery of siRNA to a target site. We additionally highlighted representative therapeutic applications of LNP formulations with siRNA that may offer unique therapeutic benefits in such wide areas as acute myeloid leukaemia, breast cancer, liver disease, hepatitis B and COVID-19 as recent examples.",

Upon systematic administration [106], various serum electrolytes, proteins, and lipids will adsorb onto the LNP's surface and form the so-called \"biomolecular corona\" [107]. This corona can significantly influence the journey of systematically administered NPs from biodistribution and cellular uptake [108] to systematic circulations and nano-bio interactions [109]. The composition of ionizable lipid particles can have a considerable effect on the formed corona [110]. ApoE is one of the most implicated serum proteins that play a significant role in the clearance and endogenous LNPs targeting to hepatic cells [72]. The delivery of nucleic acids to the liver is partly attributed to the organ's well-perfused nature and its fenestrations as well [100]. It has been recognized that LNPs accumulate in different cells present within the liver [111][112][113]. Particle size, lipase sensitivity, and apparent pKa are some characteristics that govern the intrahepatic distribution of LNPs [114]. Chen et al. investigated the effect of particle size on influencing the tissue penetration and potential of LNP formulations of siRNA. They injected the LNPs intravenously into mice and found that regardless of the size, the majority of LNPs were found 24 h after injection in the liver. Less than 1% of the LNP formulations were found in the kidney, pancreas, lung, heart and femur. However, ~10% of the 80 nm size LNPs was found in the spleen. Since the particle size did not seem to be heavily involved in liver accumulation, they further investigated other parameters that can reduce the potency of small LNPs for silencing. In the end, they concluded that there was a clear hierarchy of LNP formulated siRNAs' capability for gene silencing (78 > 42 > 38 > 27 > 117 nm).",

Pandey, H. Uluda\u01e7\n## Abstract\nRNAi (RNA interference)-based technology is emerging as a versatile tool which has been widely utilized in the treatment of various diseases. siRNA can alter gene expression by binding to the target mRNA and thereby inhibiting its translation. This remarkable potential of siRNA makes it a useful candidate, and it has been successively used in the treatment of diseases, including cancer. However, certain properties of siRNA such as its large size and susceptibility to degradation by RNases are major drawbacks of using this technology at the broader scale. To overcome these challenges, there is a requirement for versatile tools for safe and efficient delivery of siRNA to its target site. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been extensively explored to this end, and this paper reviews different types of LNPs, namely liposomes, solid lipid NPs, nanostructured lipid carriers, and nanoemulsions, to highlight this delivery mode. The materials and methods of preparation of the LNPs have been described here, and pertinent physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface charge, surface modifications, and PEGylation in enhancing the delivery performance (stability and specificity) have been summarized. We have discussed in detail various challenges facing LNPs and various strategies to overcome biological barriers to undertake the safe delivery of siRNA to a target site. We additionally highlighted representative therapeutic applications of LNP formulations with siRNA that may offer unique therapeutic benefits in such wide areas as acute myeloid leukaemia, breast cancer, liver disease, hepatitis B and COVID-19 as recent examples.\n## Liver Accumulation\nOne major feature, and limitation at times, with LNP delivery is their propensity for liver accumulation, where they are taken up by the RES [105]. Upon systematic administration [106], various serum electrolytes, proteins, and lipids will adsorb onto the LNP's surface and form the so-called \"biomolecular corona\" [107]. This corona can significantly influence the journey of systematically administered NPs from biodistribution and cellular uptake [108] to systematic circulations and nano-bio interactions [109]. The composition of ionizable lipid particles can have a considerable effect on the formed corona [110]. ApoE is one of the most implicated serum proteins that play a significant role in the clearance and endogenous LNPs targeting to hepatic cells [72]. The delivery of nucleic acids to the liver is partly attributed to the organ's well-perfused nature and its fenestrations as well [100]. It has been recognized that LNPs accumulate in different cells present within the liver [111][112][113]. Particle size, lipase sensitivity, and apparent pKa are some characteristics that govern the intrahepatic distribution of LNPs [114]. Chen et al. investigated the effect of particle size on influencing the tissue penetration and potential of LNP formulations of siRNA. They injected the LNPs intravenously into mice and found that regardless of the size, the majority of LNPs were found 24 h after injection in the liver. Less than 1% of the LNP formulations were found in the kidney, pancreas, lung, heart and femur. However, ~10% of the 80 nm size LNPs was found in the spleen. Since the particle size did not seem to be heavily involved in liver accumulation, they further investigated other parameters that can reduce the potency of small LNPs for silencing. In the end, they concluded that there was a clear hierarchy of LNP formulated siRNAs' capability for gene silencing (78 > 42 > 38 > 27 > 117 nm).",

However, the effective delivery of these RNA therapeutics remains a major challenge due to their large size, negative charge, and susceptibility to degradation. Aim: This review aims to explore advanced drug delivery systems developed to enhance the efficacy of RNA-based therapeutics, focusing on both viral and non-viral methods, and to evaluate the progress and limitations of these systems in clinical applications. Methods: The review synthesizes recent advancements in RNA delivery technologies, including viral vectors, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymer-based nanoparticles, and hybrid systems. It also examines various targeting strategies such as passive and active targeting to improve the specificity and efficiency of RNA delivery. Results: Significant progress has been made with both viral and non-viral delivery systems. Viral vectors, though effective, face challenges related to immunogenicity and production costs. Non-viral systems, particularly lipid nanoparticles and polymer-based carriers, have shown promising results, with several FDA-approved products demonstrating clinical efficacy. Advances in targeting strategies, including ligand-based and antibody-based methods, have improved the precision of RNA delivery.",

For instance, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can be critical for the delivery of certain LNPs to hepatocytes, whereas other LNPs may depend on different serum proteins like LDL or VLDL [178,179]. o Nanoparticle Size and Charge: Size affects the surface area-tovolume ratio, influencing how nanoparticles interact with immune cells and target tissues. Smaller nanoparticles have a higher surface area relative to their volume, which can influence their interaction with biomolecules. Nanoparticle size and charge also affect delivery efficiency and tissue targeting [174,182,183]. o Example: LNPs originally designed for liver delivery have been repurposed for targeting other organs. For example, altering the charge of LNPs has redirected their delivery from the liver to the spleen or lungs [142,125].",

A. Almansour, Mubarak Saad Aldosary, Maysam Taysir Almegbel, S. Alsubaie, Ahlam Mohammed Alzahrani\n## Abstract\nBackground: RNA-based therapeutics, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs), offer significant promise in treating genetic and acquired diseases by targeting specific RNA sequences, encoding therapeutic proteins, or facilitating genome editing. However, the effective delivery of these RNA therapeutics remains a major challenge due to their large size, negative charge, and susceptibility to degradation. Aim: This review aims to explore advanced drug delivery systems developed to enhance the efficacy of RNA-based therapeutics, focusing on both viral and non-viral methods, and to evaluate the progress and limitations of these systems in clinical applications. Methods: The review synthesizes recent advancements in RNA delivery technologies, including viral vectors, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymer-based nanoparticles, and hybrid systems. It also examines various targeting strategies such as passive and active targeting to improve the specificity and efficiency of RNA delivery. Results: Significant progress has been made with both viral and non-viral delivery systems. Viral vectors, though effective, face challenges related to immunogenicity and production costs. Non-viral systems, particularly lipid nanoparticles and polymer-based carriers, have shown promising results, with several FDA-approved products demonstrating clinical efficacy. Advances in targeting strategies, including ligand-based and antibody-based methods, have improved the precision of RNA delivery.\n## Lipids and Lipid-Based Nanoparticles (LNPs):\nx o Protein Corona: When nanoparticles enter the bloodstream, they quickly adsorb proteins, forming a \"corona\" that modifies their behavior. For instance, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can be critical for the delivery of certain LNPs to hepatocytes, whereas other LNPs may depend on different serum proteins like LDL or VLDL [178,179]. o Nanoparticle Size and Charge: Size affects the surface area-tovolume ratio, influencing how nanoparticles interact with immune cells and target tissues. Smaller nanoparticles have a higher surface area relative to their volume, which can influence their interaction with biomolecules. Nanoparticle size and charge also affect delivery efficiency and tissue targeting [174,182,183]. o Example: LNPs originally designed for liver delivery have been repurposed for targeting other organs. For example, altering the charge of LNPs has redirected their delivery from the liver to the spleen or lungs [142,125].",

Supplementary Fig. 6). No aggregates were found when incubating LNPs with 10% serum saline 4 h after incubation. However, decomposition of A6 LNPs were observed at 4 h, which may be attributed to the degradation of biodegradable A6 lipids in serum (Supplementary Fig. 6). We then used a size-exclusion column to isolate the \"hard protein corona\" with higher binding affinity of cKK-E12 LNPs, A6 LNPs, and Syn-3 LNPs (Fig. S7) 22,23 and used proteomics to analyze the composition of proteins on LNPs (Supplementary Table 1). Forty-six proteins were detected and quantified (Fig. 2a) on the LNPs. These proteins are involved in the function of complement activation, immune responses, coagulation, acute phase response and lipid metabolism (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 1). Previous studies identified apolipopro-teinE (ApoE) as an important protein for LNPs; which can mediate LNP delivery to the liver 24,25 . Consistent with this, we identified ApoE in the corona of all three LNPs, and as the dominant plasma protein in the corona of A6 LNPs. Although the amount of ApoE appears similar in the corona of all three LNPs, the corona of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs is dominated by a 5-6fold increase in serum albumin concentration, with ApoE composing a much smaller fraction of the corona of these LNPs (Fig. 2b). \n\nSerum albumin and ApoE-mediated cellular uptake.",

The interaction of nanoparticle formulations with cells and proteins in blood has long been discussed [39e41]. Recently, proteins bound to LNPs, called protein corona or biomolecular corona because of their shape, have been the subject of much research attention as factors that contribute greatly to LNP pharmacokinetics [42e45]. The latest findings concerning protein coronas of LNPs, including the analytical technical aspects, were recently reviewed [46]. Although there are still many unknowns owing to the immaturity of the technology, a list of constituents of protein coronas has been developed, that includes serum albumin, complement factors, immunoglobulins, and apolipoproteins. Proteins present in smaller quantities may be important; improving the methods of separation of LNP-protein corona complexes and the sophistication of proteomics technology are key to a more detailed analysis of the protein coronas. The physiological and pathological conditions of patients and animal models, and the route of administration, and their impact on pharmacokinetics are also important factors to consider.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of the intratissue distribution of LNPs, a method that makes use of the Cre/loxP recombinase system is beginning to be used [47e49]. This method uses transgenic mice that have reporter genes (especially fluorescent proteins) downstream of the loxP-flanked stop cassette, which blocks reporter gene expression in the absence of cyclization recombinase (Cre) in the cells, but in the presence of Cre, the stop cassette is removed, and the gene is expressed (Fig. 2) [50]. For example, the typical Ai14 mouse has Lox-Stop-Lox-tdTomato (LSL-tdTomato) inserted into the Rosa26 region, which is a known safe harbor locus for gene insertion into the mouse genome [50]. These",

            "text": "When NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

Lipid-based nanoparticles are, however, difficult to study analytically and so our understanding of the interaction between LNPs and biological systems remains obscure, particularly in terms of biomolecular corona formation and the impact this has on therapeutic efficacy and targeting. Ideally, we would like to engineer particles to acquire corona components that facilitate targeting, cargo delivery and improved safety. This requires studying the relationship between LNPs, biofluids and the resulting coronas. The particle-corona complexes are, however, fragile and biofluids also contain particles (such as lipoproteins) with sizes and biochemical characteristics similar to lipid nanoparticles, so contamination with biological components is a challenge. Here we describe a rapid, automated, and unbiased isolation method for LNP biomolecular coronas, coupled with proteomic and lipidomic analysis. Using these analytical methods, we systematically studied, in lean and obese rats, the variation in LNP-mediated mRNA delivery caused by individual physiology. A comprehensive multivariate model links LNP corona content to efficacy, identifying and validating high-density lipoproteins as a previously unidentified factor affecting particle efficacy.",

Although it is clear that serum proteins will be adsorbed onto the surface of LNPs following the desorption of PEG-lipids upon systemic injections, the protein corona of different ligand-modified LNPs is not well studied yet. A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al. 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles. \n\nWhile various types of ligands were incorporated into LNPs to improve the specific delivery of nucleic acids, the major accessible organs are still limited to the liver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues. Indeed, organspecific delivery is often dependent on passive distribution. Only when LNPs reach the organ of interest can they make full use of their targeting moieties to realize specific binding and enhanced uptake (Kedmi et al. 2018). Therefore, it is not surprising that the liver, lungs, and spleen, where LNPs distribute most, and tumors whose vascularization promotes LNP accumulation, are generally easier to reach than other organs. In our view, future directions in LNP-based targeted nucleic acid delivery will be mostly aimed at developing the targeted LNPs to reach the hard-to-access organs (e.g., the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, and bone) and cell types. A recent study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of LNPs containing cationic helper lipids induced efficient and specific mRNA delivery in the pancreas, which was mediated by peritoneal macrophage exosome secretion (Melamed et al. 2023).",

However, targeting specific tissues or cells is still a major challenge. After LNP administration, LNPs interact with biological fluids (i.e., blood), components of which adsorb onto the LNP surface forming a layer of biomolecules termed the \"biomolecular corona (BMC)\" which affects LNP stability, biodistribution, and tissue tropism. The mechanisms by which the BMC influences tissue-and cell-specific targeting remains largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media. In this study, we present a new technique that utilizes magnetic LNPs to isolate LNP-corona complexes from unbound proteins present in human serum. First, we developed a magnetic LNP formulation, containing >40 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)/LNP, the resulting LNPs containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IOLNPs) displayed a similar particle size and morphology as LNPs loaded with nucleic acids. We further demonstrated the isolation of the IOLNPs and their corresponding BMC from unbound proteins using a magnetic separation (MS) system. The BMC profile of LNP from the MS system was compared to size exclusion column chromatography and further analyzed via mass spectrometry, revealing differences in protein abundances. This new approach enabled a mild and versatile isolation of LNPs and its corona, while maintaining its structural integrity. The identification of the BMC associated with an intact LNP provides further insight into LNP interactions with biological fluids.",

            "text": "In an attempt to understand the biomolecular corona, several studies have been reported wherein, the concentration of the protein in the medium was varied. It was suggested that exposure of NPs at a low protein concentration allows relatively few proteins to adhere and distribute on the NPs surface forming a stable NP-protein complex. The protein layers experience a higher degree of conformational changes while masking the NPs surface. However, when the exposure media contains a high concentration of proteins, dense layering occurs and in this case, the majority of the interactions are governed by the adjacent polypeptide fragments. Comparatively lesser conformational changes are noticed since the contact between the NPs surface and the proteins are minimized. 44,45 olystyrene-and silica-NPs (200 nm) demonstrated varied patterns of bound corona upon incubation with an increasing concentration of plasma (3-80%). Densitometric analysis showed that for polystyrene NPs increasing the protein concentration directly increased the amount of bound corona, whereas for silica NPs the amount of protein decreased. SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis suggested that in a multiprotein system such a blood plasma, high binding proteins which are present in smaller amounts such as histidine-rich glycoprotein tends to replace low-binding affinity protein such as \ue103brinogen and proteins with a molecular weight in the 50-70 kDa range (present in comparatively much higher amounts in the blood plasma). 44 Similarly, for MNPs, for increasing serum concentration the apolipoprotein E-1 (ApOE-1) protein component signi\ue103cantly increased as compared to albumin and transferrin. 46 Analysis of potential protein adsorptive property of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) demonstrated that variation in the protein source such as fetal bovine serum (FBS) or human serum, can impact corona formation in terms of both quantity and quality. For 0.08 m 2 area of PLGA-NPs incubated with 50 mL human serum or FBS, the bound protein was observed to be 160.91 mg and 23.08 mg respectively.",

            "text": "Synthetic nanoparticles and EVs in biological milieus are surrounded by layers of adsorbed biomolecules, collectively referred to as the biomolecular corona. [82] The corona dynamically changes as nanoparticles traverse between various extracellular and intracellular compartments in the body. [83] The components in the biomolecular corona impact the biological identity of EVs, including immunological recognition and clearance (Figure 5). In particular, opsonins in the blood circulation play pivotal roles in mediating nanoparticle and extracellular vesicle uptake by innate immune cells. [84] Opsonins include complement proteins, immunoglobulins, and coagulation factors. Such opsonins may also cause a cascade effect where one opsonin causes the binding of others. For example, immunoglobulins on the biomolecular corona of synthetic nanoparticles attract complement proteins. [85] Notably, proteomic analysis revealed that EVs released by metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cells exhibit a substantial abundance of complement protein H (regulator of the alternative complement pathway). [86] Complement protein H on these EVs facilitates tumor progression and metastasis by suppressing the activation of other complement proteins, resulting in evasion of the complement system. Therefore, the addition of complement regulatory factors on the EV surface may offer a promising approach to mitigate the complement response and reduce immunological recognition and clearance, as shown for synthetic nanoparticles. [87] Furthermore, decreasing the cholesterol content of EV mimetics reduced the adsorption of complement on the surface, [88] indicating that cholesterol content may also impact the immune clearance of EVs. \n\nOther abundant components in the biomolecular corona of EVs are lipoproteins and/or their protein components (apolipoproteins). [83] Varying affinities for lipoproteins impact the interactions between EVs and cells, including immune cells. [89] Lipoproteins are considered a major contaminant of EVs due to overlapping physical characteristics, [90] and methods have been developed to reduce lipoprotein abundance following EV isolation.

Our data show that the lipid composition strongly influences their protein adsorption patterns, affecting their physicochemical properties and ultimately controlling tissue tropism. Lung-targeting LNPs exhibited distinct protein enrichment, including of vitronectin and prothrombin, supporting previously described mechanisms of protein corona-mediated lung selectivity [35]. In contrast, the protein-corona composition of spleen-targeting LNPs lacked a clear correlation with known targeting pathways, suggesting an alternative, but as-yet unidentified, mechanism of action. \n\nIn conclusion, these findings provide a strong foundation for the rational design of LNP systems with enhanced organ-targeting precision, guided by the structure-activity relationships of ionizable lipids and the LNP zeta potential. Understanding the molecular basis of extrahepatic targeting, including the key protein interactions that drive LNP accumulation in extrahepatic tissue, will be critical for optimizing these formulations for clinical use. Future studies should aim to elucidate these mechanisms and to evaluate the full safety profile, stability, and therapeutic potential of these LNPs in clinically relevant models. This approach holds significant promise for improving the specificity and efficacy of mRNA-based therapies, enabling more precise extrahepatic delivery and expanding the therapeutic landscape for a broad range of clinical applications, including in vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, and treatments for genetic and inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "The relationship between plasma and LNP concentrations in terms of corona size is not well studied and the dogma regarding corona formation is based largely on historical data produced (by us among others) using solid lipid nanoparticles (e.g., gold or polystyrene) because these are much easier to handle analytically 8 . Our analysis of LNP corona formation indicates that LNPs are associated with HDL particles. This will make the LNPs larger. Interestingly, similar observations to ours, regarding increases in LNP size of up to 120 nm following corona formation, have recently been reported as well 9 . The LNP size increases we observed (using DLS or NTA analysis) following LNP pull-down are, in Simonsen's opinion, excessive. We have previously shown that LNP size does indeed increase in the presence of serum 4 , but the sizes we reported in the current work (Fig. s13 1 ) were obtained, using unfiltered plasma, following the pull-down procedure, in order to characterize the resulting samples. Furthermore, if the pulldown samples were indeed contaminated by lipoproteins, particularly HDL as speculated by Simonsen, the size measurements would likely exhibit a bias towards smaller values-contrary to our observed results. While accurate in situ size measurements of LNPs with coronas were not the main purpose of this procedure, we do find that the LNPs increase in size following exposure to plasma while remaining functionally and structurally intact (in terms of being able to transfect cells and FRET interactions between the LNP cargo and LNP components). \n\nSimonsen also suggests using Asymmetric Flow Field Flow Fractionation (AF4) as a standard LNP corona isolation control. In addition to being a relatively slow method unsuitable for high-throughput, we are concerned that particles (endogenous and LNPs) and their coronas may be affected by shear forces during the running and focusing steps and prolonged incubation in a buffer environment. In the study that Simonsen cited, the authors also pointed out that AF4 causes the loss of EVs, for example 10 .",

            "text": "The composition of the protein corona that forms around LNPs upon exposure to biological fluids is a key factor in their organ selectivity and biodistribution [28,35]. Given this well-established relationship, we sought to investigate whether the differences in our extrahepatic lipid library were reflected in distinct protein corona compositions, which could potentially explain their selective accumulation in non-hepatic tissues. With that purpose, we selected and purified the two top-performing ionizable lipids for lung targeting (A1T2C3, also named CP-LC-1067, and A3T2C7, also named CP-LC-1495) and the highestperforming lipid for spleen targeting (A2T2C9, also named CP-LC-1465). As controls, we included MC3-DOTAP and MC3-18:1 PA, well-established SORT formulations known for targeting the lung and spleen, respectively, with previously characterized protein coronas [12]. Additionally, we incorporated liver-targeting LNPs using SM-102 as the ionizable lipid and a control without LNPs. Subsequently, to mimic the in vivo environment, we incubated LNPs with human plasma, allowing the natural formation of a protein corona similar to that occurring in the bloodstream (Figure 4A). After purification and LNP proteincorona isolation, we performed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to identify and quantify the adsorbed proteins. \n\nPharmaceutics 2025, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 potential was identified as a key factor in organ targeting by our ionizable lipid library, we further analyzed its influence on related protein properties such as isoelectric point (pI) and overall charge. We found that in lung-targeting LNPs, the isoelectric point distribution of adsorbed proteins was slightly shifted toward pI ~5.5 compared with liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs (Figure 4C). This may be attributed to their higher zeta potential, which likely influences protein binding. Notably, vitronectin [12], a key mediator of lung uptake, has a pI of ~5.5, suggesting a potential explanation for this enrichment.",

            "text": "There is limited understanding of the presence of lipid molecules and their adsorption on nanocarriers in the scientific research. In the blood, a lipid associated with protein is known as a lipoprotein. It is complex of apolipoprotein, cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids [106]. Apart from the transportation of lipoprotein in a biological fluid, it is also associated with several other biological processes including tissue repair, coagulation, and immunological responses. \n\nThe proteomic data have suggested that a significant amount of apolipoproteins are present in the protein corona of nanomaterials in vivo. Hellstrand and associates highlighted a report of lipid and plasma protein interaction with nanocarriers. They first pointed out the interaction of lipoprotein complexes with nanomaterials [107]. The surfaceactive agent present in the pulmonary route constituted the outset host defense in deeper part of lungs. The inhaled nanoparticle primarily formed a different corona protein due to the interaction with the lipid and the surfactant-rich pulmonary surface, but the protein corona formed here was different from the PC formed by plasma protein. Further, Raesch and coworkers presented the proteomic analysis of corona formation on NPs using a porcine surfactant as a prototype. The study analyzed the adsorbed biomolecules using LC-MS on to the surface of NPs with varying characteristics viz. lipid-NP, PEG, and PLGA NPs with incubation in a porcine surfactant. The quantitative measurements showed specific lipid compositions in coronas of all investigated NPs. The hydrophilic PEG NPs only showed minimal lipid concentrations, while other NPs indicated high lipid surface binding to nanomaterials. However, the corona formed on NPs was different from corona of plasma protein [108]. \n\nFor the application of nanomaterials in clinics, the physico-chemical properties have to be critically evaluated in a biological medium and the estimation of the results of in vivo studies will greatly help in the clinical translation of nanomaterials. The mouse model is widely used in nanomedicine research to investigate the corona on NPs by incubation with mouse serum.",

            "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

            "text": "TEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge. SAXS characterization of the drug-loaded nanoparticles before and after incubation in human plasma demonstrated the absence of the multilamellar structure, showing that the presence of the biomolecular corona did not lead to the formation of a multilamellar structure; moreover, a fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy analysis on the drugloaded liposomes after incubation revealed that the amount of Doxorubicin in the incubated particles was significantly lower with respect to the pristine ones, suggesting that the exposure to human plasma might degrade the liposomes, altering their persistence in the blood circulation. \n\nOn the other hand, protein coating on liposome carriers (namely, protein corona), is effective in protecting the nanoparticles from degradation in blood, reducing the interaction with leukocytes and prolonging the circulation time in vivo. Giulimondi and colleagues recently demonstrated the protective effect against uptake by blood macrophages of preadsorbed human plasma (HP) protein corona on liposomes obtained from cationic, neutral and anionic lipids. SAXS experiments allowed for evaluating the different effects on the mesostructure of increasing concentrations of plasma proteins adsorbed on the surface of liposomes-these observations demonstrated that the nanostructure of liposomes precoated by HP protein corona depends on the surface charge of the uncoated liposomes. Following these results, the authors showed that the protein corona of pre-coated cationic liposomes is not affected by the interaction with human plasma, suggesting that the nanoparticles' ability to evade sequestration by leukocytes during circulation remains stable. The authors demonstrated that at a low concentration, human plasma protein corona prevents the internalization of cationic liposomes into macrophages, but does not have the same effect on neutrally charged or anionic liposomes. Their findings suggest the possibility to use drug-loaded cationic liposomes coated with low-concentration protein corona to prolong blood circulation and facilitate drug delivery to the target sites [40].",

            "text": "The lion's share of various LNPs gets distributed to the liver and to a lesser extent to the spleen, and the reason is the presence of a sinusoidal discontinuous endothelium with pores of a ~100-200 nm diameter in these organs (Kumar et al., 2023). After intravenous administration and entry into the bloodstream, a protein corona forms on the surface of LNPs, and this topic is investigated in detail in Dilliard et al. (2021). The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022;Da Silva Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022). Overall, the delivery of LNPs into cells by an ApoE-independent mechanism leads to their accumulation in cells other than hepatocytes (Wadhera et al., 2016). A decrease in the proportion of cholesterol also impairs the delivery of LNPs to hepatocytes (Kawaguchi et al., 2023). Because of the fairly widespread expression of LDL receptor in human tissues (https:// www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130164-LDLR/tissue),",

            "text": "This hypothesis is supported by the finding that other cationic helper lipids (EPC and DDAB) within such LNPs cause similar protein expression in the pancreas (Melamed et al., 2023). For the LNPs based on lipid 306O i10 , the distribution among different types of liver cells has been assessed too (Hajj et al., 2020). The expression of the reporter protein proved to be distributed among hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells at a 70:15:15 ratio. \n\nAnother area of research is assessment of a distribution of LNPs based on ionizable lipids containing an amino head group and an acrylamide tail with a disulfide bond (Qiu et al., 2022). In vivo efficiency of luciferase synthesis (by translation) when fourcomponent LNPs were employed improved with increasing acrylamide tail length, and all the nanoparticles got distributed to lungs. After replacement of helper lipid DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine) with either DSPC or DOPE, the lung distribution persisted for LNPs based on the most effective lipid: 306-N16B. Of note, LNPs based on a similar ionizable lipid, 306-O12B (containing an ester bond instead of an amide bond) got completely distributed to the liver. In an analysis of the protein corona of LNPs based on either lipid 306-N16B or lipid 306-O12B, it was found that the LNPs targeted to the liver contain albumin, ApoE, and complement component C1 in the protein corona at 9%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins, whereas LNPs targeted to lungs contain albumin, fibrinogen \u03b2-chain, and fibrinogen \u03b3-chain at 17%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins. It was also revealed that negatively charged proteins predominantly (80%) constitute the protein corona of the LNPs targeted to the lungs.",

Three different lipases have been described including the lipoprotein and endothelial lipase in LSECs and the hepatic lipase in hepatocytes [161]. LNP-siRNA systems that incorporate ionizable cationic lipids that are sensitive to endothelial lipase (e.g. ester linkages between head and tail functions) have enhanced gene silencing in hepatocytes but exhibit significantly reduced activity in LSECs [159]. Co-treatment with lipase inhibitors or incorporating lipase-resistant ionizable cationic lipids can recover gene silencing in LSECs [159].\n\nBased on microanatomical, subcellular, and (patho)physiological considerations, an ideal LNP for gene regulation in hepatocytes must satisfy the following design criteria: nanoparticle size < 80 nm to efficiently pass through liver fenestrae and improve LNP stability, apparent ionizable cationic lipid pKa value around 6.4, near neutral surface charge to prevent sequestration by the MPS, and lack of immune stimulation and toxic effects. Achieving these and other criteria facilitating efficient nucleic acid entrapment and LNP formulation are detailed in the following section.\n\nIt is important to mention that upon intravenous administration LNPs adsorb serum proteins on their surface. Many, if not all, of the abovementioned physiochemical characteristics impart distinct properties to the LNPs which ultimately influence protein adsorption. This \"biomolecular corona\" covering nanoparticles significantly impacts systemic circulation and nano-bio interactions [162][163][164]. Efficient targeting and gene regulation in hepatocytes stems from the presence of ApoE in the corona of LNPs and enabled the success of Onpattro\u00ae [33,76]. A recent publication suggested that the ionizable lipid composition plays a major role in the corona formed [165].

Of note, switching the method of mRNA introduction from encapsulation to adsorption made it possible to achieve up to 80% expression of a target protein in the lungs when composition with a DOTAP/MC3 ratio of 1:1 was employed, and up to 50% expression in the spleen with composition featuring a DOTAP/MC3 ratio of 3:1. Nanoparticles carrying adsorbed mRNA had a size of ~200 nm and did not accumulate in kidneys during excretion, likely indicating the suitability of such particles for subsequent pharmaceutical research and development. In addition, these nanoparticles did not contain cholesterol, and Cy5-labeled mRNA was detectable but not expressed in the liver; this finding may be predictive of the behavior of other cholesterolfree particles. These data are consistent with another study (Gueguen et al., 2024), where LNPs of five-component composition containing cationic lipid IM21.7c also got distributed into lungs and the spleen (and very little into the liver), and >95% of the reporter protein was expressed in the lungs when the LNPs were administered intravenously. The zetapotential of the LNPs containing cationic lipid IM21.7c was positive, in contrast to the previously obtained nanoparticles (Dilliard et al., 2021), which also got distributed into lungs and the spleen but had negative zeta-potential. We believe that zeta-potential has insufficient predictive value to determine a target organ. \n\nThus, the addition of a charged lipid into LNPs affects pK a of the particles, which in turn determines the formation of a protein corona on the surface of the LNPs and accordingly their subsequent distribution throughout organs, which is modulated by proteins of the corona.",

[70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

The term \"nanoparticle protein corona\" refers to the layer of proteins that adsorb onto the surface of nanoparticles when they are present in biological environments, such as blood or tissue (Mahmoudi et al., 2023). This corona significantly influences the nanoparticles' biological behavior, affecting their circulation time, tissue distribution, cellular uptake, and overall efficacy in drug delivery applications (Monopoli et al., 2012;Lynch et al., 2006;Walczyk et al., 2010). Overview of the general experimental workflow for RES blockade in vivo experiments. NU/NU mice bearing PC346C tumors were systemically injected with dextran sulfate (30 mg/kg), liposomes (360 mg/kg) or PBS (control), followed by i.v. injection of siAR-PEG-DSG-LNPs containing 0.2 % DSPE-Cy5.5 at a dose of 5 mg/kg siRNA. Blood samples were collected via submandibular puncture (1 min and 1 h) and cardiac puncture (4 h), and Cy5.5 signal in serum was quantified by fluorescent spectroscopy. After 4 h, mice were sacrificed, organs perfused with PBS and tissues were collected for Cy5.5 and siAR quantification.

            "text": "Despite their clinical successes, our understanding of how and which biological components in complex biofluids, including blood, LNPs interact with, and the impact of such interactions on the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of LNP-based therapeutic products are still sparse and almost entirely limited to interactions with apolipoprotein E (apoE). To fully exploit the potential of LNPs for the delivery of nucleic acid-based therapies across various indications, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which LNPs interact with the biochemical environment they are intended to function in is necessary. \n\nThe study of proteins adsorbed to NPs during circulation, also referred to as the protein corona, has been a hot topic for many years in the drug delivery field. However, protein corona studies are very challenging, particularly when studying lipid-based NPs such as liposomes and LNPs. This is partly due to: (i) the coexistence of compositional, mass density, and size-similar endogenous NPs in blood plasma, including high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), chylomicrons, and EVs complicating selective purification of exogenous lipid-based NPs from plasma 2 ; and (ii) inherent limitations in tools used for NP characterization. These limitations are put into context below by discussing some of the key findings presented by Liu et al. \n\nTo validate that their PEG affinity-based LNP isolation method avoids contamination by lipoproteins, EVs and other plasma components, Liu et al. analyzed pull-down fractions from rat blood plasma samples which were incubated with either pegylated LNPs or pure PEGlipids (non-LNP control) with dot blots based on PEG-antibody staining (Fig. 1a) 1 . LNPs isolated from plasma from either an obese (OP) or lean (LP) rat model with the pull-down method exhibit strong PEG-antibody signals, while pull-down fractions from the non-LNP control only show faint signals.",

            "text": "When nanoparticles enter a biological fluid, proteins rapidly compete for binding to the nanoparticle surface, leading to the formation of a protein corona that critically defines the biological identity of the particle. The properties of such a particle-protein complex differ significantly from those of the formulated particle. Hence, the further biological responses of the body as well as the biodistribution of the nanoparticles are expected to be influenced by the nanoparticle-protein complex [34]. Therefore, the PLA nanoparticles were incubated with human blood plasma for several time points and we examined the binding of plasma proteins to the nanoparticles. The protein binding profiles were visualized by SDS-PAGE, demonstrating that an exposure for five minutes was already sufficient for an efficient corona formation ( Figure 7A). Also, the amount of corona proteins increased over time, albeit the corona seems to change only quantitatively rather than qualitatively. Furthermore, we examined the presence of apolipoproteins in the protein corona ( Figure 7B). Apolipoproteins are part of the circulating lipoproteins and serve as receptor ligands for lipid and cholesterol uptake and metabolism, and it was suggested that apolipoprotein-modified nanoparticles are able to transport drugs across the BBB [35][36][37][38]. We observed that apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and apolipoprotein A4 (ApoA4) are already present in the nanoparticle-protein complex after five minutes of exposure, and that the amount of ApoA4 slightly decreased and the ApoE concentrations significantly increased over time. The formation of the apolipoprotein corona on the PLA nanoparticles indicates a potential transport route of the nanoparticles through a lipoprotein receptor transcytosis pathway [37,39].",

            "text": "). Protein coronas can concentrate proteins known as opsonins, such as complement proteins, coagulation proteins, and antibodies. Opsonins stimulate immune cell recognition and facilitate rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the bloodstream by immune cells such as macrophages [17,[39][40][41][42][43]. Opsonic properties are also shared by proteins involved in lipid transport such as apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein E [41]. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein can act as an opsonin, enhancing macrophage-deactivating mechanisms [44]. Apolipoproteins or other proteins with dysopsonin-like properties, such as histidine-rich glycoprotein, clusterin (apolipoprotein J), and albumin, which are present in protein coronas of nanoparticles (Table 1, column 4), may prolong the time that nanoparticles circulate in blood [41].\n\nInterestingly, protein coronas have also been identified on nanoparticles whose surface has been chemically modified, e.g., through the attachment of hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (Table 1, rows 3, 4, and 7), which is useful to lengthen blood circulation times and to decrease the hepatic uptake of the nanoparticles. Protein coronas have been described for nanoparticles both in vivo (as discussed) as well as in vitro (Table 1).\n\nNanoparticles in biological environments including saliva, lung fluid, and blood have been found to interact with phospholipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and other metabolites, in addition to proteins and peptides [10,45,46]. As a result, a layer of biomolecules (biocorona) may end up coating the nanoparticles' surface giving nanoparticles a new biological identity [26,[30][31][32][33]36,47]. Ultimately, the biocorona mediates interactions between the nanoparticle and the host biological system [15,[30",

            "text": "One major feature, and limitation at times, with LNP delivery is their propensity for liver accumulation, where they are taken up by the RES [105]. Upon systematic administration [106], various serum electrolytes, proteins, and lipids will adsorb onto the LNP's surface and form the so-called \"biomolecular corona\" [107]. This corona can significantly influence the journey of systematically administered NPs from biodistribution and cellular uptake [108] to systematic circulations and nano-bio interactions [109]. The composition of ionizable lipid particles can have a considerable effect on the formed corona [110]. ApoE is one of the most implicated serum proteins that play a significant role in the clearance and endogenous LNPs targeting to hepatic cells [72]. The delivery of nucleic acids to the liver is partly attributed to the organ's well-perfused nature and its fenestrations as well [100]. It has been recognized that LNPs accumulate in different cells present within the liver [111][112][113]. Particle size, lipase sensitivity, and apparent pKa are some characteristics that govern the intrahepatic distribution of LNPs [114]. Chen et al. investigated the effect of particle size on influencing the tissue penetration and potential of LNP formulations of siRNA. They injected the LNPs intravenously into mice and found that regardless of the size, the majority of LNPs were found 24 h after injection in the liver. Less than 1% of the LNP formulations were found in the kidney, pancreas, lung, heart and femur. However, ~10% of the 80 nm size LNPs was found in the spleen. Since the particle size did not seem to be heavily involved in liver accumulation, they further investigated other parameters that can reduce the potency of small LNPs for silencing. In the end, they concluded that there was a clear hierarchy of LNP formulated siRNAs' capability for gene silencing (78 > 42 > 38 > 27 > 117 nm).",

To explore this we analyze naturally efficacious biocorona compositions using an unbiased screening workflow. First, LNPs are complexed with plasma samples, from individual lean or obese male rats, and then functionally evaluated in vitro. Then, a fast, automated, and miniaturized method retrieves the LNPs with intact biocoronas, and multiomics analysis of the LNP-corona complexes reveals the particle corona content arising from each individual plasma sample. We find that the most efficacious LNP-corona complexes were enriched with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and, compared to the commonly used corona-biomarker Apolipoprotein E, corona HDL content was a superior predictor of in-vivo activity. Using technically challenging and clinically relevant lipid nanoparticles, these methods reveal a previously unreported role for HDL as a source of ApoE and, form a framework for improving LNP therapeutic efficacy by controlling corona composition.",

            "text": "In recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs. These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. 24 Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands. 25 ur research group has successfully provided direct evidence of targeted delivery of NPs by coating a cationic liposome with a protein corona enriched in vitronectin. 26 This plasma protein bestowed the liposome with the remarkable ability to selectively target and bind to cancer cells that exhibit an elevated level of expression of the vitronectin receptor. A recent scientific hypothesis has suggested that the high liver tropism and transfection potency exhibited by Onpattro may be attributed to the formation of a protein corona enriched with Apo-E. 2 This protein corona, in turn, enables the recognition of hepatocytes through the LDL receptor, potentially contributing to its liver-targeting capabilities. \n\nIn the context of vaccination, the translation of LNP vaccines into clinical practice faces challenges due to our limited understanding of their protein corona, which may influence the tissue accumulation of particles in physiological environments. Upon ID, LNP vaccines are exposed to the dermal interstitial fluid (DIF) 27 leading to the formation of a protein corona. Given that the protein source is a key determinant in shaping the composition of the protein corona, 28 we assert that conducting a thorough investigation of LNPs in the DIF is an essential and decisive step in advancing our comprehension of their mechanism of action upon intradermal injection.",

            "text": "After intravenous administration, nanocarriers are exposed to a several sequential hurdles that must be overcome in order to efficiently reach therapeutic levels of drugs at disease sites, avoiding nonspecific uptake in healthy organs (Blanco et al., 2015;Chevalier et al., 2017). As per the literature, when nanocarriers are intravenously administered, they can interact with thousands of proteins. Biological media consists of numerous active biomolecules such as lipids, nucleic acids, proteins, and blood plasma contains roughly 3,700 identified proteins (Lazarovits et al., 2015;Chen et al., 2017). Protein corona effect i.e. due to the presence of charge on nanocarriers can result into interaction with oppositely charged serum protein. Thus, nanocarriers or the targeting moiety decorated over nanocarriers get buried in protein corona resulting into prevention of nanocarriers's interaction with the targeted receptor in cancer cells (Tonigold et al., 2018). Opsonins are key proteins in the blood serum that promotes elimination of vulnerable nanocarriers by marking them off for an immune response. The major part of opsonized nanocarriers are cleared within seconds by a receptor-mediated mechanism because of the phagocytic cells in the liver, lymph nodes, and spleen of the mononuclear phagocyte system, contributing to nonspecific distribution of nanocarriers in healthy organs (Blanco et al., 2015;Chevalier et al., 2017). \n\nOne most established strategy to mitigate the effect of protein corona involves the nanocarrier functionalization with amphiphilic or hydrophilic polymers, such as poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) (Bros et al., 2018). PEG forms strong adhered hydration layer, which sterically avoid the interaction/adsorption of serum protein (Huo et al., 2019). PEG-decorated nanocarrriers reduce their recognition by the components of the mononuclear phagocytic system, increasing their blood circulation time (Xiong et al., 2009;Naeye et al., 2010).",

            "text": "The stability of an artificial protein corona in a protein-rich environment (such as the bloodstream and the cytoplasm) is a key requirement for its effectiveness. This is because the corona stability influences its ability to maintain its composition and structure over time 1,2 . In a protein-rich environment, various proteins are present that can potentially interact with the corona. If the corona is not stable, it may undergo structural changes or disintegrate, leading to alterations in its composition. This can have significant implications for the corona's functionality, including its ability to influence interactions between the NP and biological systems. As an example, Qin et al. 3 demonstrated that an intracellular protein corona (IPC) can form on nanoparticles once they are taken up by cells. This IPC has the potential to significantly impact the intracellular transport network of these NPs. A stable protein corona is therefore crucial for maintaining the specific interactions and properties that were designed or intended. It helps ensure that the corona continues to serve its intended purpose, whether it is to enhance biocompatibility, modulate cellular uptake by engaging specific receptors, or influence other aspects of nanoparticle behavior. \n\nFor this purpose, we prepared coronated LNP and LNPi at different plasma percentages. Each batch was aliquoted into two portions. The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors 4 , and other NP types 5 . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles.",

The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

Assay design also has to accommodate throughput, cost and, feasibility. \n\nIn the context of our work, we have used therapeutic LNPs containing fluorescent mRNA cargoes to ensure that we are retrieving not just PEG molecules, but also the LNP cargo as well. Using proteomics, we can detect large numbers of proteins, but markers for EVs are notably absent. Furthermore, we see different types of coronas with different LNP compositions, rather than simply pulling down the same serum components consistently as it would be in the case of systematic contamination in the isolation procedure. Finally, the composition of the quantified LNP coronas is different from the parent plasmas. One would assume that if PEGylated lipids were simply transferring to plasma components, then there would be no particular specificity and one should obtain a proteomic pattern containing components from all lipid-related endogenous particles, and this is not what we observe. \n\nWe appreciate Simsonsen's careful evaluation of our work and, we will incorporate more extensive AF4 particle characterization in future experiments. As discussed above, notwithstanding the physiological and chemical similarities among lipoproteins, EVs, and LNPs, significant distinctions persist in their physiochemical properties, origin, formation mechanisms, compositions and, subpopulation heterogeneity. Hence, the adoption of isolation methods previously tailored for disparate nanosized entities necessitates meticulous validation to prevent cross-contaminations and enhance both efficacy and throughput. Finally, with concerns addressed, our opinion is that none of the points raised by Dr. Simonsen alter our conclusions. \n\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.",

Reprinted with permission [38]. \n\nMoreover, studies have shown that upon IV administration PEG-lipid with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, inducing a change in surface structure that allows ApoE adsorption to LNPs, with the formation of a protein corona that affects their endosomal escape and mRNA release. ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it.

            "text": "Pharmaceutical and medical applications of nanosystems represent a growing area in the flourishing field of nanotechnology, including developments in advanced pharmaceutical nanocarriers and nanodiagnostics [1][2][3]. Nanosized carriers of very diverse composition are being actively investigated, including metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and lipidic nanoparticles and also hybrid systems by combining such materials [4,5]. \n\nOne of the main limitations of these kinds of delivery systems is their short circulation time due to the opsonization phenomenon and subsequent uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). After exposure of nanocarriers to biological fluids, biomolecules are rapidly adsorbed onto their surface forming the protein corona. The corona composition determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences its toxicity, biological fate, circulation time, cell uptake, and drug release kinetics [6,7]. At first, the protein corona includes considerable amounts of low-affinity proteins which abound in the biological medium. Over time, the composition of the corona is enriched with high affinity proteins [7]. Interestingly, some of the adsorbed proteins are opsonins which promote the uptake and degradation of the nanoparticles by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (mainly located in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes). Among the proteins commonly found in the corona, IgG and proteins involved in the complement pathway typically act as opsonins (promoting uptake by MPS) whereas serum albumin and apolipoproteins enhance circulation time [8]. The clearance of the nanoparticles by the MPS reduces the bioavailability of the encapsulated drug [9,10]. A considerable amount of evidence, however, indicates that this phenomenon can be reduced by coating the nanoparticles with different polymeric substances [11][12][13]. \n\nLipid-based nanosystems stand out because of their nontoxic, biocompatible and environmentally friendly composition.",

            "text": "Conventional PEG lipids, such as distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG2000, are known to remain firmly linked to LNPs and prohibit the release of the nucleic acid. Then, utilization of specific PEG lipids that possess short acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may be advantageous to achieving high transfection efficiency because of their ability to gradually diffuse out of the LNPs, leading to the formation of destabilized LNPs that consequently release their nucleic acid contents [91,95]. \n\nThe formation of a bimolecular corona complex may change the surface properties of LNPs, and these changes can be adopted to enhance and/or target delivery of the loaded content [90,96]. It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity [90]. LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination [97]. PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system [94]. However, accelerated removal of PEGylated nanoparticles and stronger activation of complement interactions can be encountered upon infusion of these PEGylated nanoparticles in patients having anti-PEG antibodies [94,98].",

This phenomenon significantly influences the behavior, functionality, and biological interactions of nanoparticles with biosystems. Until now, conclusions regarding the role of the protein corona in specific biological applications have been based on establishing correlation rather than causation. By understanding causality, researchers can predict how changes in nanoparticle properties or biological conditions will affect protein corona composition, in turn affecting the nanoparticle interactions with the biosystems and their applications. This predictive capability is essential for designing nanoparticles with specific characteristics tailored for therapeutic and diagnostic nanomedicine applications. Here, we explore the concept of \u201cactual causality\u201d (by Halpern and Pearl) to mathematically prove how various small molecules, including metabolites, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients, spiked into plasma can induce diverse protein corona patterns on identical nanoparticles. This approach significantly enhances the depth of plasma proteome profiling. Our findings reveal that among the various spiked small molecules, phosphatidylcholine was the actual cause of the observed increase in the proteomic depth of the plasma sample. By considering the concept of causality in the field of protein corona, the nanomedicine community can substantially improve their ability to design safer and more efficient nanoparticles for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",

            "text": "The interaction of nanoparticles with physiological systems-the so-called \"nano-bio interface\"-is a complex process. It is therefore important to understand this mechanism in some detail before we delve into strategies to bypass first-pass metabolism. As we discussed, a nanoparticle's inherent composition, shape, size, and surface chemistry plays a crucial part in deciding its fate in systemic circulation. In this section, we discuss the role of two external parameters that play equally vital roles to affect circulation stability and the final disposition of a nanoparticle to the tumor: (i) formation of a protein corona and (ii) the mechanism of interactions between the nanoparticle and cells. \n\nWhen a nanoparticle enters the blood, it is coated with various serum proteins, forming a protein corona that changes the nanoparticle's synthetic identity, exposes new epitopes, and alters its function. The concept of a protein corona is thus an important parameter in shaping the final biological identity of the nanoparticle-hydrodynamic size, surface chemistry, net charge, and aggregation behavior [30,32,64]. Although this has been known for a long time, it is only recently that researchers were able to decipher the complex mixture of adsorbed proteins on nanoparticles. This was mainly led by the advancement of instrumentation and analytical methods, coupled with the motivation to shake the existing stagnancy of clinical translation for nanomedicine delivery systems [65][66][67]. Albumin, apolipoprotein, immunoglobulins, transferrin, fibrinogen, complement C3, haptoglobin, and \u03b1-2-macroglobulin are some of the most abundant proteins that comprise the protein corona [32,68]. Nanoparticles interact with these proteins mainly through long range electrostatic Van der Waal's forces, as well as short-range hydrophobic interactions [33]. There are two types of proteins in the protein corona [65,66]: opsonin and dysopsonin.",

Ultimately, however, the discrete pathways by which tuning the physicochemical properties of formulation components directs LNPs to selectively traffic and express in certain organs and tissues require more detailed mechanistic studies to establish.\n\nThe physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo . A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [ 203 ]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [ 46 , 204 ]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171] , with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205] , and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [ 206 ]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207] ; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo .\n\nLNPs may also be directly modified with a specific targeting agent in order to facilitate localization to the desired tissue or organ for more effective immunization.

For a system based on MO/medium-chain triglyceride (MCT), Wibroe et al. compared the stabilization effect against serum using the anionic surfactant citrem and the nonionic amphiphilic polymer Plu-F127. [49] Similar to that observed in cell culture media, [44] a short incubation in human serum (for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C) slightly increased the lattice parameter (a) and median diameter (d) of the binary dispersions stabilized by Plu-F127 (LD F127 ) and that by citrem (LD citrem ) (Figure 3a).

            "text": "Next, we examined the effect of DOPE-C8 on the biodistribution of LNPs. The blood half-life of the DOPE-C8-LNPs was clearly less than 10 min (Figure S1, Supporting Information); therefore, the biodistribution of the LNPs 1 h after intravenous injection was examined using IVIS (Figure 2D). The DOPE-Cx showed a significantly higher level of accumulation in the kidney compared with that when using DSPC, albeit at lower values. No differences between LNPs were observed for other organs. The highest accumulation was in the liver, which was followed by slight accumulations in the spleen and lungs. Intrahepatic distribution of the LNPs revealed that consistent levels of all LNPs accumulate mainly in hepatocytes, which are located in an area enclosed by blood vessels (Figure 2E). These results suggest that DOPE-C8 has a limited effect on the biodistribution of LNPs and that the improved mRNA expression level derives from intracellular processes such as endosomal escape. \n\nWhen nanoparticles such as LNPs are exposed to proteins such as blood, they form a protein-based layer on their surface, which is referred to as the biomolecular corona. [11] The physicochemical properties of LNPs affect their interactions with proteins and alter the biomolecular corona. The properties of the biomolecular corona are known to alter both the pharmacokinetics and the toxicity of LNPs. [12] Reports also show that phospholipids such as DSPC are preferentially located in the outer layer of LNPs due to their bulky hydrophilic moiety compared with that of other lipidic components such as ionizable lipids and cholesterol. [13] egatively charged phospholipids are known to selectively deliver mRNA to the spleen and secondary lymphoid organs. [14] e recently reported that the increased surface density of electrostatically neutral DSPC selectively delivers mRNA to the spleen rather than to the liver by abolishing ApoE-dependent hepatic clearance.

It plays an important role in the colloidal stability of NPs, which is of importance for most of their medical applications and toxicity assessment. While typical studies use either blood plasma or serum from a pooled biobank, it is unclear whether differences in the media, such as cholesterol level or protein concentration, might affect the NP colloidal stability and corona composition. In this study, the silica corona was prepared at particularly low plasma concentrations (3%, v/v\u20131.98 mg/mL) to identify the critical roles of the protein mass/NP surface ratio and the level of plasma cholesterol on the corona protein pattern and particle stability. While depending on the plasma dilution factor, the corona protein composition could be controlled by keeping the protein/NP constant. The NP colloidal stability was found to strongly correlate with the level of cholesterol in human plasma, particularly due to the high enrichment of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the corona. A cohort study on plasma samples from individuals with known cholesterol levels was performed to highlight that association, which could be relevant for all corona systems enriched with the LDL.",

This interaction promotes the binding of LNPs to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr), which are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for the internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes, partially explaining the preferential targeting of the liver by intravenously administered LNPs (Liu et al., 2023). The widespread clinical application of gene therapy has been impeded by the absence of delivery vectors capable of inducing protein expression in extrahepatic organs and tissues (LoPresti et al., 2022). Recent efforts have redirected nucleic acid delivery towards tissues beyond the liver (Kimura and Harashima, 2023). The type and proportion of helper lipids can modify the LNP structure, are essential for the stability and tissue targeting of LNPs. For instance, ester and amide bonds in lipid compounds enhance targeting to the liver and lungs, respectively. Samuel T. LoPresti et al. observed that the complete substitution of conventional helper lipids with anionic or cationic lipids led to significant and consistent transfer of lipid nanoparticles specifically to the spleen or lung, respectively (LoPresti et al., 2022). Beyond their role as delivery components, lipids may exert therapeutic effects synergistically with mRNA-encoded proteins. Multifunctional lipid materials encompass self-adjuvant lipids that enhance vaccine efficacy and paclitaxel-derived lipids enabling the combined treatment of chemotherapy and gene therapy for cancer (Hou et al., 2021;Johnson et al., 2022).",

Thus, ApoE-rich protein corona can be used to target hepatocytes. 141,142 Lung targeting of LNPs can be achieved by introducing sequences of lipid molecules that can alter the composition of the protein corona, and the unique protein corona formed promotes the interaction of LNPs with specific cellular receptors that are highly expressed in the lung. 47 It has been shown that LNPs containing lipid molecules with quaternary ammonium head groups (SORT) can be applied to gene editing of endothelial, epithelial, and immune cells in the lung. 47,48 In addition, lipid molecules characterized by cationic quaternary sulfonamide-amino lipids, amphoteric amino lipids, and doped amide bonds are also capable of delivering nucleic acids to the lungs in a better way. 35,143 Targeting of lymphoid tissues can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of lipid molecules to form protein corona.

The BC changes nanoparticles' biological identity triggering activation of the immune system. As most plasma proteins are anionic at physiological pH, the biomolecular corona provides nanoparticles with a negative surface charge that generally reduces association and capture by immune cells. Depending on the chemical identity of nanoparticles the biomolecular corona increases particle size and promotes the formation of clusters of various sizes that can be engulfed by circulating and resident macrophages. Immunogenic serum proteins can activate the complement system leading to the clearance of nanoparticles by phagocytes. Conformational changes in the bound proteins may trigger protein aggregation and amyloid fiber formation.

LNPs have been targeted to specific cell types or organs by physicochemical targeting, in which LNP\u2019s lipid compositions are adjusted to find mixtures with the desired tropism. In a popular approach, physicochemical targeting is accomplished by formulating with charged lipids. Negatively charged lipids localize LNPs to the spleen, and positively charged lipids to the lungs. Here we found that lung-tropic LNPs employing cationic lipids induce massive thrombosis. We demonstrate that thrombosis is induced in the lungs and other organs, and greatly exacerbated by pre-existing inflammation. This clotting is induced by a variety of formulations with cationic lipids, including LNPs and non-LNP nanoparticles. The mechanism depends on the LNPs binding to fibrinogen and inducing platelet and thrombin activation. Based on these mechanisms, we engineered multiple solutions which enable positively charged LNPs to target the lungs while not inducing thrombosis. Our findings implicate thrombosis as a major barrier that blood erects against LNPs with cationic components and illustrate how physicochemical targeting approaches must be investigated early for risks and re-engineered with a careful understanding of biological mechanisms.",

Several studies have described the role of protein adsorption in biological interactions [84] and have stated that \"Protein corona\" refers to the spontaneous self-assembly or biomolecular coating of the proteins on the surface of nanoparticles [85]. The formation of corona not only alters the physical properties of the nanomaterials such as size, surface charge, shape but also alerts the immune system of the body to recognize the nanoparticles as an intruder and hastens the process of opsonization [86]. Having said that, it becomes important to identify various characterization techniques to detect the extent of protein corona formation. Though several techniques such as quantitative and qualitative proteomic assays have been described to characterize the protein corona formation of the nanoparticles [87], very few studies have reported on its formation around BP nanomaterials. Here, we have discussed the techniques available to characterize the formation of protein corona around the BP nanomaterials. \n\nElectron microscopies, such as TEM, provide a clear picture of protein corona formation around the nanoparticles. For instance, in a previous study [88], the size of BPNSs was increased by 11.9 nm after being covered by plasma proteins and, in another study, the size increased by 30 nm [89]. The corona formation can also be detected by a change in surface charge. The surfaces of BPNSs coated with plasma proteins were entirely different from the native form and the charge changed to a positive value from negative. Liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry detector was used to qualitatively analyze the components of the BP-corona complex. The results revealed that the binding of proteins to BP directly depends on the protein size and, additionally, the BPNSs mainly bind with immune relevant proteins. The composition of the protein corona can also be evaluated using Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).",

            "text": "While surface charge impacts protein adsorption, it operates within a complex electrostatic environment, which could explain the subtler differences in protein-charge profiles compared with pI trends. These findings suggest that lipid composition influences not only protein adsorption but also the physicochemical characteristics of the corona, impacting organ-specific delivery. \n\nTo further investigate protein-corona-driven targeting, we analyzed the top 30 most abundant proteins in lung-and spleen-targeting LNP coronas (Tables S5-S10). Additionally, to provide a clearer interpretation of the results, we focused on proteins that were highly enriched in one organ-specific LNP corona while being absent or barely detected in the other (Figure 4E,F). Results showed that the predominant proteins absorbed in spleentargeting LNPs are actin, myosin, and the immunoglobulin lambda-like protein. These proteins exhibit a low correlation and are typically nonspecific and are often found in negative mass spectrometry controls. Therefore, the mechanism underlying spleen targeting remains unclear. However, the protein-corona composition of lung-targeting LNPs was clearly distinct from that of liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs. Notably, vitronectin and prothrombin, both extensively reported as key protein-corona components influencing lung targeting, were among the most enriched proteins [12,13,27]. These findings suggest that lung-targeting LNPs in our ionizable lipid library follow previously described mechanisms of proteincorona-mediated lung selectivity.",

            "text": "The corona detected for the 76 nm sample in the whole blood samples resembled apolipoprotein A-I with aprominent band, rather than the 9.5 nm sample. In serum, the detected corona was in a changeover from 9.5 to the 76 nm NPs i.e., the quantity of apolipoprotein A-I reduced with the increase in NP size due to the change in size or curvature of the NPs [33]. Besides the particle size, the PC detected around the NPs also depended upon parameters such as the composition of the biological medium, and the fraction of the particle surface area in direct contact with the biological medium. \n\nIf the surface area of the NPs is large i.e., if a large number of particles are present in a given area, a low affinity protein may bind and stabilize the interaction with the aggregates of NPs. The exposed surface area may also reflect the protein-compelled NP aggregation. The trapped protein in the complex can be analyzed after its release from the NP-protein corona complex although it is not a part of corona composition. The large surface area aggregates of the corona with diversified proteins have been explained in previous work [34,35]. \n\nWalczyk et al. conducted a study on several normal nanoparticles dispersed in blood plasma to investigate the formation and categorization of (hard or soft) PC assembly and their longevity. Herein, the authors used carboxylated polystyrene particles (PSCOOH), sulfonated polystyrene particles of sizes 100 and 200 nm, and silica particles of size 50 nm incubated in normal plasma. The results are shown in Figure 4a-f. In Figure 4a, it can be seenall the changes in the peaks during incubation were reproducible. Figure 4b shows that the protein complex monomer and the bigger protein-particle complexes were retained with unaltered sizes as in the plasma in situ. Figure 4c,d indicates that the particles werepolydisperse in nature, and that protein conformation is affected by the method of sample preparation. Moreover, the size of corona particle was observed to be 5 nm larger than the bare nanoparticle (Figure 4e).",

Silica nanoparticles (SiO 2 nanoparticles) of 50 nm diameter were used as a representative model system to form different coronas in the two conditions. It is known that varying serum amount can lead to formation of different coronas. 28 Then, the effect of serum content on the uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was investigated, and common pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis were used in order to determine potential differences in the mechanisms of uptake in the two conditions. Next, RNA interference was used to silence the expression of the LDL receptor, here selected as a first illustrative example, given the previous reports on its involvement in the uptake of similar silica nanoparticles. 10 This allowed",

            "text": "When nanosystems are in a physiological environment, they rapidly adsorb biomolecules such as proteins and lipids onto their surface, forming a biomolecular \"corona\" (Fig. 6), an interface organization that may be loosely divided into two components termed the \"hard\" and \"soft\" coronas, with (respectively) \"long\" and \"short\" typical exchange times.The corona will change composition if the nanoparticle moves to another compartment or fluid.Tenzer et al. found that the corona formed rapidly after the particles had been mixed with plasma and it could be detected even at the first measurement point (at 30 s) [216].This corona surrounding the particle changes its original surface charge and chemistry, size, solubility, aggregation and, hence, it changes the dialogue of nanoparticles with the cells, influencing the trafficking, in vivo biodistribution and cellular uptake because these proteins adsorbed onto the sur-face interact with cells through receptors on cell plasma membrane [217].The protein corona influences macrophage capture since proteins involved in the process of opsonization (opsonins) can be adsorbed onto the nanoparticle surface.Macrophage scavenger receptors are a broad group of phagocytic receptors that are responsible for the elimination of blood-borne viruses, pathogens, and negatively charged ligands.For ex-ample, opsonins such as IgG, complement factors, and fi-brinogen promote the phagocytosis, removal of nanoparticles from the bloodstream and concentration in the liver and spleen, while dyopsonins such as albumin and apolipoprotein help the longer circulation of nanoparticles in the body [94].Human serum albumin, when adsorbed onto the surface of polystyrene microparticles, was reported to inhibit their phagocytosis by dendritic cells [218].\n\nFor many NPs, while removal from the bloodstream is a question of minutes, interaction with cells of distant organs may be relevant hours or days after exposure.",

            "text": "In the last few decades, nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery platforms have improved the therapeutic index of many drugs. In fact, by increasing their pharmaceutical bioavailability and targeting, NPs avoid systemic toxicity while retaining pharmacological activity. 1 After intravenous injection, NPs adsorb a multitude of biological molecules (proteins, lipids, glycans, and metabolites) from plasma on their surface. These biomole cules continuously recycle 2,3 on the NP surface, thereby forming a dynamic shell known as a \"biomolecular corona.\" 4 Most research studying the biomolecular corona has focused on protein composition characterization: 5,6 therefore, the biomolecular corona is generally called the \"protein corona\" (PC). 7,8 This natural coating provides NPs with a new biological identity and significantly affects their fate, pharmacokinetics, and cellular interactions. \n\nIn terms of NP targeting abilities, the PC can 1) hinder the function of targeting ligands attached to the NP surface, thereby reducing their accumulation in the targeted tissue, 3,9,10 and 2) modify the carrier surface, facilitating cell internalization. 11 The PC can also modulate immune response. 12 Several studies have characterized PC structure, function, and formation dynamics. 13,14 Structurally, proteins that are weakly bound to the NP surface form the \"soft corona,\" while proteins strongly bound to the NP surface form the \"hard corona.\" 15,16 Functionally, the PC is characterized by the presence of opsonins (complement proteins), immunoglobulins, and lectins, 17 which match to specific receptors on leukocyte membranes. Until recently, NP opsonization was considered part of the body's defense mechanism by inducing NP clearance from circulation and consequent accumulation in the organs of the mononuclear phagocytic system (mainly spleen and liver). 18 However, in a recent study, unfolded proteins that promote macrophage uptake or their shielding by other proteins in the PC were found to reduce in vitro particle uptake by RAW264.7 macrophages. 19,20 The particular context, therefore, needs to be discussed when considering cellular uptake.",

The resulting biomolecular corona might interfere with the nanoparticle-cell interaction, induce an immune response and alter the drug-release efficiency [60]. \n\nLiposomes commonly used as vectors for therapeutic molecule delivery can be unilamellar vesicles, where the hydrophilic drug molecules are loaded in the central aqueous core of the nanoparticle, or multilamellar vesicles, which can host lipophilic drugs within the lamellar structure. The majority of liposomes commercially available for drug delivery purposes are Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUV) [61]-although they are stable during circulation, the interaction of proteins with the SUV surface provokes the formation of multilamellar structures and of liposome clusters: the change in the crystalline structure implies the rupture of the vesicles, which may result in the release of the loaded drug. \n\nThe formation of larger aggregates may impede the cellular uptake of the particles. The latter effect, however, becomes less evident as the concentration of proteins attached to the nanoparticles surface increases, possibly due to the repulsive interaction of charged proteins, as demonstrated by Caracciolo and coworkers [44]. In a recent experiment, they used a commercial formulation of liposomal Doxorubicin, a drug used for cancer treatment, to study the effect of biomolecular corona on nanoparticle stability and drug release, incubating the liposome-drug formulation in the concentration of human plasma that mimics the physiological conditions. TEM, DLS and Zeta potential experiments demonstrated the formation of biomolecular corona already at a low plasma concentration, which led to an increased particle size and to a change in the particle surface charge.",

            "text": "When flowing through the blood stream, drug carriers such as nanoparticles encounter hundreds of plasma proteins, forming a protein layer on the nanoparticle surface, known as the \u201cprotein corona\u201d. Since the protein corona influences the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles, it can modulate their circulating lifetime, cytotoxicity, and targeting efficiency. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of protein corona formation at the atomic scale is crucial, which has become possible due to advances in computer power and simulation methodologies. This review covers the following topics: (1) the structure, dynamics, and composition of protein corona on nanoparticles; (2) the effects of protein concentration and ionic strength on protein corona formation; (3) the effects of particle size, morphology, and surface properties on corona formation; (4) the interactions among lipids, membranes, and nanoparticles with the protein corona. For each topic, mesoscale, coarse-grained, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations since 2020 are discussed. These simulations not only successfully reproduce experimental observations but also provide physical insights into the protein corona formation. In particular, these simulation findings can be applied to manipulate the formation of a protein corona that can target specific cells, aiding in the rational design of nanomedicines for drug delivery applications.",

Interestingly, when LNPs are used (made using ionizable lipid Dlin-MC3-DMA), the opposite behavior is observed.

The apolipoprotein classes and quantities were also varied among PEC protein coronas. Previous studies demonstrated that the interplay of different parameters including nanoparticle surface chemistry, incubation condition, and serum protein physicochemical properties such as protein Mw, size, electrostatic charge, and chemical composition dictate the protein corona identity 48 . The interaction of proteins with nanoparticles occurs by covalent and non-covalent bonds. Herein, the studied PECs have negative zeta potential due to the neutralizing of Ch in serum condition with pH >6.5 and negative charge of dextran. Hemoglobin possesses the positive charge in serum condition and was adsorbed to the negative charge PECs. Furthermore it could be attached to the thiolated PECs via disulfide bonds between cysteine residues 46 . Apo-lipoproteins which are amphipathic molecules could also absorb on PECs. They are small proteins with negative charge in serum and bind to the lipid particles. Saha et al. demonstrated that levels of lipoproteins in protein corona depends on chemistry of nanoparticle surface as it decreased on functionalized gold nanoparticles in 10% FBS medium following increasing the hydrophobicity of nanoparticle surface 41 . Protein C which is a glycoprotein also dominantly covered the PECs. The surface of particles consists of large number of carboxyl, amine, hydroxyl and thiol (in case of using TD in PEC structure) groups that involve in interactions with protein functional moieties.

As the complete plasma proteome reference set contains more than two thousand different proteins, 70 such knowledge is particularly relevant for plasma proteins. 4,6,26,28,71 Indeed, the plasma protein corona has recently been shown to be indeed highly complex as well. 6 roteins involved in physiological as well as toxicological relevant processes in the blood system, such as to complement activation and coagulation, have been identified in the coronas of various NPs. 4,6,26,28,44,71,72 The identified proteins span about three to four orders of magnitude dynamic range, most likely covering most biologically relevant corona proteins. 6 Notably, the respective abundance of all of these proteins was affected by The early phase: a highly complex corona is established already in 30 sec, which may be composed of multiple coreshell structures ('new').

            "text": "The delivery system for mRNA vaccines is a critical component of their development and success. For COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are employed to protect the mRNA from degradation by endonucleases as it circulates in the body and is delivered into cells. Once inside the cell, the mRNA is released into the cytoplasm, where it can initiate protein translation. LNPs, the primary delivery vehicle for these vaccines, consist of four main components: neutral phospholipids, cholesterol, polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids, and ionizable cationic lipids (Figure 2) [23,24]. \n\nThe LNPs encapsulate the mRNA by using positively charged amine groups at low pH, which interact with the negatively charged mRNA during the manufacturing process. This positive charge not only aids in mRNA encapsulation but also facilitates the fusion of LNPs with the cell membrane during internalization. PEG lipids play a crucial role in stabilizing the nanoparticles, controlling particle size, and preventing aggregation during storage. The rapid mixing technique used in production results in particles within the size range of 60-100 nm [25]. Additionally, LNPs contain apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is essential for the internalization of mRNA via endosomal pathways, further protecting the mRNA from degradation. Although the precise mechanisms by which LNPs safeguard mRNA are still not fully understood, it is known that the ionizable lipids in LNPs become protonated in the acidic environment of the endosome (pH <7). This protonation promotes lipid exchange between LNPs and the anionic phospholipids in the endosomal membrane, leading to membrane fusion. This fusion enables the release of mRNA into the cytosol, where it can be translated into proteins. ApoE enhances this process by helping the mRNA evade the endosomal degradation pathway [26].",

            "text": "Whether the ionizable lipids play a direct role in endosomal uptake has not been thoroughly investigated. Studies on LNP-siRNA accumulation in the liver show that the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes mediates the LNP uptake; in apoE-deficient or LDLR-deficient mice, LNP-siRNA do not display the same gene silencing potency [34]. ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons [35]. Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes [36], and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism. When using ionizable lipids/LNPs with an apparent pK a of $6.4, about 10% of the ionizable lipids are positively charged in blood (pH 7.4) according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size [37]. Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines. More detailed discussions and recent literature about how size and surface charge affect LNP biodistribution will be presented in Section 5.\n\nThe internalization mechanism of the mRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccines following intramuscular (",

The formation of the protein corona leads to a significant increase of the hydrodynamic size of the SNPs. Confocal microscopy imaging shows that the protein corona alters the morphological response of vesicles to SNPs. In addition, Laurdan spectral imaging show that the protein corona weakens the effect of SNPs on the lipid packing in the GUV membrane.

According to different adsorption theories, this process is energetically favorable due to a rather higher net binding energy compared to the surrounding environment, increasing the NP size by 3-35 nm and the NP surface charge to 10-20 mV [5]. The corona profile is shaped by various ambient factors, including the biomolecule concentration, pH, ionic strength, temperature, and incubation time. Once the corona forms, the nanoparticle's identity undergoes a transformation, altering its physicochemical properties, targeting capabilities, and biological responses. These changes arise from the new biological identity imparted by the adsorbed proteins \n\nThe protein corona is composed of an inner layer of tightly bound/stronger affinity proteins with a longer lifetime (\"hard corona\", HC) and an outer layer of weakly bound proteins with a shorter lifetime (\"soft corona\", SC). HCs are more easily isolated and characterized: examples of NPs with HCs include liposomes, quantum dots, metallic NPs, silica NPs, polymeric NPs, and 2D materials [5]. HCs form gradually, are more stable, and comprise \"relatively immobile\" proteins with strong affinities for NP surfaces and low tendencies to dissociate. Soft coronas, consisting of biomolecules like proteins with low affinities for NP surfaces, undergo dynamic and reversible changes influenced by the conditions of the surrounding biological fluid. Understanding both soft and hard coronas is essential for interpreting NP stability, functionality, and interactions with biological systems.",

For example, a corona can reduce the adhesion of nanoparticles to the cell membrane, which has been shown to reduce cytotoxicity for single wall carbon nanotubes and polystyrene nanoparticles. 28,29 For drug delivery, however, inhibiting nanoparticle internalisation is an undesired effect, as nanoparticles are typically functionalised with receptor-binding molecules. The formation of a corona effectively coats the molecules and consequently deactivates the ability of nanoparticles to recognise cell receptors.\n\nThe molecular composition of a corona can also promote binding of nanoparticles to the cell membrane and consequently enhance the cellular uptake of nanoparticles. 27 For example, a corona composed of multiple biomolecules (i.e. proteins like prothrombin, antithrombin III, vitronectin, intera-trypsin-inhibitor heavy chain H5, platelet factor 4 and apolipoprotein H) promoted cellular uptake of polystyrene nanoparticles in human cervical carcinoma cells and human mesenchymal stem cells. 27 Corona was also shown to enhance cellular uptake of Janus gold-iron oxide and polystyrene nanoparticles in human vascular endothelial and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. 30,31 While the rapid formation of a corona on nanoparticles is known to in\ue104uence their interactions with cells, there is a gap in the fundamental understanding of how",

            "text": "Most nanoparticle-based formulations have been designed for intravenous administration to spread deeper to organ tissue without surgery. These nanovectors interact with the biological system, mainly with the circulatory proteins, upon being available into the systemic circulation. One set of proteins binds with nanoparticles' surface and forms a protein corona (PC) conjugate. After adhering, this PC makes the particles recognized by the innate immune system followed by quicker elimination by phagocytic cells present in the liver, lungs, and spleen. Additionally, these PCs increase the physical disability and agglomeration of particles. To overcome this problem, the utmost requirement is to develop new strategies to minimize PC formation with improved stability and circulatory time of nanovectors (Rampado et al., 2020). The composition and kinetics of PC vary (decrease or increase) over time. It was believed that the PCs are responsible for the instability of NPs. However, a separate study demonstrated the aggregation of nanoparticles inversely proportion with protein [human serum albumin (HSA), fibrinogen, immunoglobulin, and apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1)] concentration (Ho et al., 2018). It was observed that NPs aggregation was increased at lower protein concentrations, whereas these NPs were stable at higher protein concentrations. The interaction of the protein with the nanoparticles is varied based on the type of protein. \n\nImmunoglobulin and fibrinogens are sticky proteins either form clotting or bind with foreign bodies, whereas HAS and APOA1 interact with more NPs simultaneously to form bridges. \n\nThe concentration and tagged surfactants charged on NPs determine the PC characters (Zhang et al., 2019). Charges on NPs were changed after the formation of PC. Particles with negative charge persisted, whereas positively charged particles acquired a negative charge. Ovisprin-1 and lysozyme protein coronas were tested on plain gold nanoparticles to understand the protein corona formation in an aqueous environment (Jahan Sajib et al., 2020). It was observed that the appearance of PC is caused due to protein-protein interaction and protein's surface and hydrophobic surface effect.",

            "text": "Recently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium. It was observed that the addition of FBS could decrease the transfection efficacy of C18 LNPs while increasing the efficacy of C14 LNPs. The authors discussed these results, suggesting that the protein corona could either hinder the uptake process or facilitate it due to other receptor-mediated phenomenon [4]. Even if the protein corona has been described to inhibit transfection, it now appears that some of the proteins included in this corona could specifically interact with cellular processes and particles trafficking [2]. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [6]. Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection. Moreover, as explained by Chen et al., PEG cannot completely eliminate the binding of proteins around LNPs, and that proteins could impact the transfection in serum. \n\nSeveral parameters must then be considered when designing LNPs. The use of long lipids-PEG can offer an efficient protection against protein corona formation, prolong the circulation of LNPs, and increase the accumulation in tumor. Nevertheless, the transfection efficacy of these LNPs could finally be lower than expected because of the barrier effect of PEG. However, this effect could be balanced by an intermediate proportion of C18 lipid-PEG in LNPs formulations if an equilibrium between efficient stealth properties and efficient transfection can be found. On the other hand, recent examples highlighted the interest in using short lipids-PEG in order to avoid long effect or to target hepatic diseases. In that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs.",

            "text": "Several studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors. For instance, in 2002, a study suggested that adsorption of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) from the blood to polysorbate 80coated nanoparticles was responsible for the transport of the nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Kreuter et al., 2002). Deng et al. (2011) demonstrated that negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)-conjugated gold nanoparticles adsorbed and induced unfolding of fibrinogen from human plasma, which triggered interaction with the Mac-1 receptor and resulted in the release of inflammatory cytokines. Another study also showed that ionizable lipid nanoparticles could naturally adsorb apolipoprotein-E (ApoE), leading to enhanced uptake into hepatocyte via several receptors that contain ApoE binding ligands (Akinc et al., 2010;Williams and Chen, 2010). Similarly, lipid nanoparticles made of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) and DNA preferentially adsorbed high amount of vitronectin from human plasma that promoted uptake into cancer cells overexpressing vitronectin receptors integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (Caracciolo et al., 2013). Next to lipid nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles have also been shown to interact with distinct receptors once a biomolecular corona formed on their surface. For instance, in the presence of human serum, silica nanoparticles were shown to enter cells via interaction with the LDL receptor and/or Fc-gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI) due to the abundance of LDL and immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the biomolecular corona (Lara et al., 2017;Francia et al., 2019). Not only single corona proteins, but also complex biomolecular surface layer motifs were observed to mediate cellular uptake via interaction with scavenger receptors (Lara et al., 2018).",

            "text": "systems. This phenomenon could be explained by the differences in the chemical structure and spatial arrangement of the two polymers within the lipid nano-carriers. Namely, in the samples covered with PEG2000-DSPE, PEG groups are anchored to a phospholipid tail (DSPE), which is aligned parallel within the membrane phospholipid molecules of the formulations, allowing for the hydrophilic PEG chains to extend outward. This configuration was shown to decrease the surface hydrophobicity, and therefore reduce the plasma protein adsorption [21]. On the other hand, the large hydrophobic polypropylene oxide block of Poloxamer was probably positioned deeper and closer to the lipid layer of the NLs and NLCs, thereby limiting the degree to which the PEG chains were projected and extended on the surface of the nano-formulations [29].\n\nAccording to the literature data, upon the intravenous administration of nanoparticles in vivo, the adherence of serum biomolecules on the nanoparticles' surfaces could result in particle integrity loss and severely alter the particle properties, which has a major influence on their key performances, including their aggregation behavior, circulation time in vivo, toxicity, and targeting capability [27]. In this sense, the change in the particle diameter during the incubation in human plasma may have been due to the destabilization of the system in terms of particle agglomeration, or, more likely, the formation of a protein corona [28]. This phenomenon could be observed at the first time points of the incubation of the formulations, which points to the dynamic process of protein corona formation, i.e., the constant adsorption and desorption of proteins from the particles' surfaces, which is especially emphasized during the formation of the initial, \"soft\" corona [30]. except for NLCPOL, where there was noted a significant change in the z-average diameter after 24 h of incubation time (p = 0.0101; p < 0.05; ANOVA) ( Figure 2a). Similar values for the nano-systems' average diameters were obtained when they were incubated in human plasma, except with NLCPOL, where, after 24 h, there was an increase in particle size of ~",

Interestingly, the PS-COOH and PS-PO 3 functionalized NPs were expeditiously taken up, whereas PS-NH 2 and PS-SO 3 had a lower uptake in both the cell lines, as shown in Figure 7A-C. Further, artificially anchored NPs with a single protein corona either by the apolipoproteins ApoA4 or ApoC3 demonstrated a significantly reduced cellular uptake as illustrated in Figure 8A, while pre-coating other corona proteins such as ApoH improved the cellular uptake, as shown in Figure 8B [62]. Further, to examine the impact of protein corona on the synthetic identity of lipidbased nanoparticles (LNP) in biological systems, Chen et al. detailed the analysis of PC NPs which revealed that there was a \"missing connection\" between the physicochemical properties of NPs and their biological identity. However, there is a limited understanding of the impact of protein corona on the targeted delivery of tumors. It was demonstrated that protein corona on the surface of NPs could be manipulated by the design and development of a formulation. The alteration in the composition of the lipid component in LNPs could potentially change the charge on the NPs' surface and finally change the formed corona patterns in the serum of nude mice. Thus, lipid surface charge manipulation and a specific lipid switch on the NPs could alter the PC profile. In spite of this fact, negatively charged NPs had no profound effect on the formation of protein corona, while the institution of positively charged lipids into the nanosystem dramatically switched the pattern of PC from apolipoprotein to vitronectin-rich. The composition of this variant of protein corona had a great impact on cell transfection, biodistribution in vivo, and the efficient active delivery to tumor tissues. The corona rich with apolipoprotein demonstrated improved delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma mediated via the LDL receptor which was equated with vitronectin-rich NPs.",

Importantly, LNPs interact with proteins in the blood and incorporate them onto their surfaces, forming a targeting ligand coat of serum proteins called a protein corona. This protein corona can cause unexpected tissue localization of LNPs even when formulated to be organ-specific with the SORT methodology as certain host serum proteins also contribute to organ targeting.

In these additional blood circulation assays, liposome (DOPC: DSPE-PEG2000 = 90:10), 188kPa@lipid, and PLGA@lipid were used as the representatives for nanoparticles with extremely low ApoA1 abundance in corona, nanoparticles with appreciably high ApoA1 abundance in corona, and nanoparticles with intermediate ApoA1 abundance in corona, respectively; ApoA1 abundance in corona is observed to be ~0% for liposome, ~8% for PLGA@lipid, and ~26% for 188kPa@lipid (Figure 3f and Supplementary Figure 13a). Our addition blood circulation assays (Figure 3j) show that, for liposome (DOPC: DSPE-PEG2000 = 90:10), pre-treating the liposome-protein complex with ApoA1 antibody failed to appreciably affect the complex's blood clearance half-life (9 h and 9.6 h with and without the ApoA1 antibody treatment, respectively) (Figure 3j), which is easy to understand considering the extremely low abundance of ApoA1 in its corona (Figure 3f and Supplementary Figure 13a).

Proteins, which are the most important of these biomolecules, will adsorb -to some extent-on the NP surface, especially as PEG is removed, coating the surface with a new layer that will define the biological identity of the NP, the so-called \"biomolecular corona\", or \"protein corona\" (74,75) which can dramatically alter the surface properties of nanosized particles and determine their in vivo fate (76). Already in 2004, it was reported that the presence of proteins in physiological media affects the entry and intracellular localization of NPs in cells, thus modulating their potential biological effects and toxicity. Later on, the formation of a protein corona on top of the NP surface was observed to control biodistribution, uptake and biological response, transforming them from innocuous to toxic or vice versa. This surface coating can be formed by hundreds of b i o m o l e c u l e s , i n c l u d i n g a l b u m i n , a p o l i p o p r o t e i n s , immunoglobulins, coagulation factors, and many others (77). Some of these biomolecules might associate almost irreversibly with the iLNP surface, in either their native or denatured form, affecting, de facto, all subsequent interactions. It has been proposed that the corona is comprised of both these tightly bound proteins (\"hard\" corona), which presumably bind directly to the iLNP surface with high affinity, and also a looser, more dynamic layer (\"soft\" corona) which constantly exchanges with proteins in the environment (78). The hard and soft corona are both considered relevant in determining iLNP interactions with cells (73). \n\nTraditionally, for biomedical applications, this corona has only been conceived as a disruptive effect that hinders the functionality of nanoparticles, provoking underestimated side effects like loss of colloidal stability, aggregation, sedimentation or rapid clearance by the immune system.",

We have established an experimental workflow that is highly versatile for the isolation of an intact LNP with the adsorbed protein corona as shown in Scheme 1. \n\nCommon BMC separation techniques such as centrifugation have previously been implemented for identifying enriched proteins adsorbed on the surface of LNPs (21,22), however, the harsh separation process required likely affected the LNP integrity during pellet formation and may not effectively remove unbounded proteins (35). This MS method offers distinct advantages over conventional methods, such as the ability to use LNP formulation containing the same molar ratio and lipid composition as clinically relevant formulations while recovering isolated intact LNP-corona samples with lower amounts of unwanted free proteins. However, like most LNP-corona separation techniques, there are also limitations to the MS method. The IONP encapsulation process will need to be reoptimized for formulations containing different molar ratios of the ionizable lipid as the separation efficiency is expected to be positively correlated with the amount of ionizable lipid present. For example, lowering the ionizable lipid content in LNP formulations will likely lower the number of IONPs/LNP as there will be fewer protonated ionizable lipid molecules to complex with the negatively charged IONPs when formulating at low pH. However, because the MS method relies on material encapsulated in the core of the LNP, rather than isolation methods that depend on changing the surface properties, we suggest that the protein profiles observed are more representative of the actual BMC experienced in vivo. LNP technology is a state-of-the-art approach that is paving the way for the widespread use of LNP-based gene therapeutics including the COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines (36). It is well established that the BMC can dramatically affect the tropism of LNPs as illustrated by the influence of adsorbed apo-E on uptake of Onpattro LNP into hepatocytes (4).",

            "text": "The applications of pharmaceutical and medical nanosystems are among the most intensively investigated fields in nanotechnology. A relevant point to be considered in the design and development of nanovehicles intended for medical use is the formation of the \u201cprotein corona\u201d around the nanoparticle, that is, a complex biomolecular layer formed when the nanovehicle is exposed to biological fluids. The chemical nature of the protein corona determines the biological identity of the nanoparticle and influences, among others, the recognition of the nanocarrier by the mononuclear phagocytic system and, thus, its clearance from the blood. Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), extensively employed for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, can shed light on the formation of the protein corona and its interaction with the surroundings. The synthesis and characterization of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) coated with polymers of different chemical nature (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, chitosans) are reported. The proof-of-concept for the use of SPR technique in characterizing protein-nanoparticle interactions of surface-immobilized proteins (immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin, both involved in the formation of the corona) subjected to flowing SLN is demonstrated for non-chitosan-coated nanoparticles. All assayed nanosystems show more preference for IgG than for BSA, such preference being more pronounced in the case of polyvinyl-alcohol-coated SLN.",

            "text": "The adsorption of proteins on the surface of nanoparticles when they come in contact with the protein rich environment plays a vital role in deciding the fate of NPs. Several studies have described the role of protein adsorption in biological interactions [84] and have stated that \"Protein corona\" refers to the spontaneous self-assembly or biomolecular coating of the proteins on the surface of nanoparticles [85]. The formation of corona not only alters the physical properties of the nanomaterials such as size, surface charge, shape but also alerts the immune system of the body to recognize the nanoparticles as an intruder and hastens the process of opsonization [86]. Having said that, it becomes important to identify various characterization techniques to detect the extent of protein corona formation. Though several techniques such as quantitative and qualitative proteomic assays have been described to characterize the protein corona formation of the nanoparticles [87], very few studies have reported on its formation around BP nanomaterials. Here, we have discussed the techniques available to characterize the formation of protein corona around the BP nanomaterials. \n\nElectron microscopies, such as TEM, provide a clear picture of protein corona formation around the nanoparticles. For instance, in a previous study [88], the size of BPNSs was increased by 11.9 nm after being covered by plasma proteins and, in another study, the size increased by 30 nm [89]. The corona formation can also be detected by a change in surface charge. The surfaces of BPNSs coated with plasma proteins were entirely different from the native form and the charge changed to a positive value from negative. Liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry detector was used to qualitatively analyze the compo-",

Further, the binding of apo-E on the LNP surface can also lead to internal lipid rearrangement resulting in destabilization of the LNP core and promoting subsequent RNA release (37). However, detailed mechanisms behind the BMC of LNPs in relation to organ-or cell-specific gene delivery remains mostly unknown. Therefore, it is essential to improve our current understanding of the fundamental biological interaction between LNP and biological media in order to critically design the next generation of LNP for accessing and treating a wide range of diseases. Our study presents a robust method to isolate LNPs and their corona from complex media based on magnetism. We developed magnetic IOLNP by encapsulating IONPs in the LNP core. The MS technique using magnetic separator and magnetic column chromatography provides a rapid and reproducible tool for the separation of LNP-corona complexes from biological fluids and an in-depth characterization of its BMC with maintained particle integrity. Such method development is crucial in overcoming challenges posed by the analytical limitation of more conventional methods and provides new insight into the corona composition that may be masked by naturally abundant unbound protein as a result of artifacts that originated from the biological media.",

[28] found that the 150 nm automated LNPs had higher mRNA lacking efficacy and stronger serum adsorption ability during blood circulation than the smaller ones (70 nm), highlighting the contribution of particle size to protein corona formation and excellent mRNA delivery.This underscores the role of particle size in protein corona formation and efficient mRNA delivery.These automated LNPs could facilitate cytoplasmic mRNA encoding luciferase (Luc-mRNA) delivery and mediate efficient and prolonged luciferase expression in vivo.However, there are exceptions, as suggested by Partikel's [29] study, which indicates that polymeric NPs exhibit protein adsorption independent of particle size within the 100-200 nm range.Therefore, the influence of the particle size of NADS on its protein crown adsorption is intricately related to the properties of the carrier itself.\n\nParticle size also has a significant influence on the distribution and accumulation of NADS in tumors.",

            "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

This is since protein adsorption is mediated (in part) by hydrophobic interactions. 57 As demonstrated by Maiorano et al. utilising Dulbecco's Modi\ue103ed Eagle medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI), supplemented with Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), bio\ue104uid composition is a prominent extrinsic in\ue104uencer of corona formation. The two media (which vary in their salt, glucose and amino acid content) induced dissimilar adsorption patterns, with citrate-stabilised gold nanoparticles gaining a more abundant and stable corona in DMEM at all tested sizes. 58 Consistently, an increase in plasma concentration (from 3% to 80%) corresponded to a notable increase in protein adsorption for polystyrene nanoparticles. For silica nanoparticles, increasing plasma concentration instead induced considerable changes in the protein pattern, illustrative of competitive adsorption by less-abundant, high-affinity proteins due to enhanced adhesion at higher plasma concentrations. 59 Finally, nanoparticles which interact with proteins electrostatically have been reported to experience pH-dependent corona formation by reason of an altered protein binding affinity. 60 The instantaneous adsorption of proteins by nanoparticles may alter their physicochemical attributes (including size and surface charge), thereby providing them with a new biological identity. Thus, it is not pristine nanoparticles, but those which are biomolecule-coated that largely govern physiological responses such as systemic circulation time, bioavailability, cellular uptake and cytotoxicity. 61 For instance, the formation of a protein corona around transferrin-functionalised silicon dioxide nanoparticles was shown to eliminate their transferrinmediated targeting capability due to masked receptor-binding sites (Fig. 3). In another study, the coating of gold nanoparticles with polyacrylic acid was shown to cause the unfolding of adsorbed \ue103brinogen which, consequently, evoked an in\ue104ammatory cascade. 11 By",

Here, we show distinct differences in the protein corona formed in whole blood, whole blood with EDTA, plasma, or serum. Furthermore, the ratio between particle surface area to protein concentration influences the detected corona. We also show that the nanoparticle size per se influences the formed protein corona due to curvature effects.

[82]This study underscores the impact of seemingly minor changes in the lipids' chemical features on corona constituents.\n\nThe mentioned SORT approach has demonstrated its applicability beyond lung targeting, as on a similar note the incorporation of a negatively charged phospholipid like phosphatidic acid into LNPs was reported to promote the attachment of  2glycoprotein I.As a result, specific delivery to the spleen was achieved. [77]The interaction between  2 -glycoprotein I and acidic phospholipids has been described previously, reinforcing the rational incorporation of these lipids into NPs to specifically attract serum proteins facilitating spleen targeting. [83]ome authors have argued that it is possible to extend the circulation time of PEGylated liposomes through their conjugation with an albumin-binding domain (ABD).This led to eightfold enrichment in albumin content within the corona, contributing to increased tumor accumulation. [84,85]Similarly, arginine-lipid based siRNA polyplexes, which exhibited notable albumin association on their surface, were also associated with prolonged circulation times. [86]he examination of the concepts around endogenous targeting necessitates cautious assessment in terms of their translatability, given the multifaceted factors contributing to specific protein corona formation.Among these, hydrophobicity, surface chemistry, and charge do not depend only on NP components but on their structural arrangement.

Thio-lipids may rely on more than electrostatic interactions between the positively charged ionizable headgroup and negatively charged mRNA phosphates to form LNPs with high encapsulation efficiency-\u03c0-\u03c0 and sigma hole interactions with mRNA may also be implicated in the encapsulation process (22)(23)(24)(25). The lipids that failed to quantitatively encapsulate mRNA had either steric or solubility constraints. However, not all these lipids could deliver mRNA into cytoplasm. Investigating the cpKa of the most potent lipids and experimental pKa of the LNP formulations revealed no clear correlation between lipid efficacy and ionizability. For example, lipid 20b contained only a secondary amine incorporated into the thiophene backbone structure yet was more potent than its modified counterpart. Moreover, the resulting LNPs had an unusual pH response profile, suggesting a partial positive charge across a broad pH range. We acknowledge that more work is needed to fully understand the structure-activity relationship of these lipids. \n\nOrgan-specific delivery via LNPs and nanomedicines can be achieved via either active targeting [i.e., targeting ligands (21,26,27)] or passive targeting (i.e., specific properties of the nanoparticle such as size or charge). Little is understood about the adjustments required to achieve passive targeting for specific organs; however, strong evidence suggests that the nature of the biomacromolecular corona formed on the nanoparticle surface may direct the delivery to specific organs (28)(29)(30)(31). For example, ionizable but not cationic LNPs can bind to apolipoprotein E and utilize low-density lipoprotein receptor to enter hepatic tissues (32). The LNP ionization seems to be a major determinant in the corona composition, although LNP reorganization upon exposure to serum proteins may also contribute to this phenomenon (31).",

            "text": "Non-specific interactions between nanoparticles and plasma proteins occur when the nanoparticles enter the blood. As a result, coating the original nanoparticles with a protein corona alters the in vivo fate of nanoparticles as well as the biological responses to the nanoparticles. This is one of the substantial reasons for the two main problems associated with nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, i.e., nanotoxicity and the rapid clearance of nanoparticles from the blood after intravenous injection. A preformed albumin corona has been shown to inhibit plasma proteins such as IgG adsorption, decrease complement activation, reduce the macrophage-related phagocytosis, and ultimately prolong the blood circulation time and reduce the toxicity of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, nanoparticle-albumin complexes show an enhanced bioavailability compared to naked nanoparticles [34].\n\nLiposomes are plagued by rapid opsonization, leading to the shortening of their circulation time in the bloodstream. Interactions between liposomes and plasma proteins have been investigated in order to evaluate the role of liposomal lipid composition and concentration in forming the protein corona. Protein corona formation depends on the presence of PEG, cholesterol, the concentration of the components, and surface charge. Liposomes incorporating 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipids and cholesterol both in a molar ratio of 11% were reported to be stable over time, while their size was not altered dramatically in a biological medium. Liposomes containing cholesterol and PEGylated lipids retain their size in the presence of serum as well as their physical stability. Lipid composition and concentration have an effect on the adsorption of proteins and on liposomal stabilization [35].\n\nThe encapsulation of curcumin in a liposome improves its bioavailability and stability, but the short half-life remains an issue. Albumin was used to coat the liposomal curcumin to produce a long-circulating delivery system. Albumin-coated liposomal curcumin particles were more spherical, more homogeneous in size, and significantly larger than liposomal curc",

            "text": "Above we have described the NPs' characteristics, including their surface properties and aggregation state. As the aggregation state is determined by the surface chemistry, we will turn our attention to the biomolecular corona. Previous studies have mainly focused on the protein corona, but the corona also contains lipids [8,51,52] and likely carbohydrates. At low NP concentration levels, determining the biomolecular corona is a challenge. However, by combining the pellets, formed in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, from 5 experiments, sufficient amount of material could be obtained for analysis by SDS-PAGE, S8 Fig, and mass spectrometry (see materials and methods for details). We identified several proteins (S1 Table ) in the Au NPs' corona, of which many have been previously described in the literature [31]. Proteins of a very broad size range are found on the NP surface or incorporated in complexes with the NP and other proteins. Alpha- 2-macroglobulin is the largest protein found in the corona. It has a molecular weight of 725 kDa and its dimensions are approximately 10 nm in diameter and 15-20 nm in length [53]. The protein is therefore of similar size to the smaller Au NPs and will considerably change the size and density of the NP protein complex. The lower density slows down the sedimentation rate, resulting in a smaller apparent diameter of the complex by DCS. Lipid binding proteins as apolipoprotein E and gelsolin were also found in the corona. It has been shown for polymeric and TiO 2 NPs that the lipids remain on the NP surface after binding and even have a preferential binding compared to other proteins [8,51,52]. Bound lipids will significantly change the complex' density. Apolipoprotein E is part of the lipoprotein particle chylomicrons which transport lipids in blood from the intestine. The density of chylomicrons is less than 1 g/cm 3 and their size can be more than a micrometer. The low NP concentration made it impossible to determine the lipid concentration in the pellet.",

            "text": "To systematically study the LNPs and their newly formed corona, the unbound proteins must be separated after their in vivo administration or in vitro incubation with blood, plasma, or serum. However, a precise characterization of the BMC of soft nanomaterials, such as LNPs has proven difficult as the size and density of LNPs are similar to \"natural\" serum nanoparticles, for instance, chylomicrons, HDL, exosomes, and many more (19). \n\nCommon separation techniques such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or (ultra)centrifugation are based on, respectively, size or density, and therefore they can work well for the study of bigger or dense NPs (23) but do not allow an effective separation of LNP (30 to 100 nm) from lipoproteins and related nanostructures (7 to 80 nm) present in biological media (19). In addition, as a high g-force is commonly required in (ultra)centrifugation, proteins and LNP can aggregate and induce artifacts resulting in difficulty differentiating between unbound vs. adsorbed proteins. The lack of effective and high-throughput separation techniques for soft nanomaterials has led to alternative procedures such as cross-linking proteins on the LNP surface (24,25). This effectively removes the presence of unbounded proteins but potentially disrupts the proteins present on an intact LNP surface. Furthermore, a photoaffinity lipid probe is required in the LNP formulation which can also alter the BMC formation and profile due to deviations from clinically relevant lipid compositions. In some cases, affinity assays have been used for isolating the corona of PEGylated nanomedicines (26). However, since many affinity-based assays rely on ligand binding to the polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid, LNPs that contains diffusible PEG that are engineered to shed from the particle surface (i.e., Onpattro) may not be suitable for this method. \n\nIn this work, we demonstrate a magnetic separation (MS) technique that enables the study of LNP's BMC in a manner that is independent of their surface properties.",

            "text": "When nanoparticles are presented to a physiological environment such as human plasma they selectively absorb biomolecules to form a so-called biomolecular corona on the surface of the nanoparticle [9]. Needless to say, one should be aware of the fact that nanoparticles -indeed, any material surfaces -may be coated with bacterial endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a membrane component of all Gram-negative bacteria, especially if the nanoparticles are synthesised under non-sterile conditions. This could give rise to interference with the biological assessment of nanomaterials eg. induction of maturation of dendritic cells (DC) [10]. However, of more importance for the present discussion, several studies in recent years have provided evidence for a \"hard\" (long-lived) corona of human plasma proteins on nanoparticles of different chemical composition [11][12][13][14]; the formation of the hard corona was shown to depend on both size and surface properties eg. degree of hydrophobicity [15]. The bio-corona has been reported to impact on cellular uptake [16] and on cell signaling including NF-\u043aB-dependent cytokine production in THP.1 cells [17]. Notably, lipids, not only proteins, may also feature prominently in the bio-corona, as shown recently for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) administered into the lungs of mice [18], and the combined lipid-protein corona may play a role in cellular uptake of nanomaterials. The notion that naked particle surfaces may not exist in nature has profound implications as the bio-corona may convey a new biological \"identity\" to nanoparticles [19]. This is, in a manner of speaking, a case of the Emperor\u00b4s new clothes in reverse; hence, the Emperor is not naked as we thought but fully \"clothed\" in a layer of biomolecules. In fact, some studies have even provided detailed information on the thickness of this layer, using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy [20].",

And last but not the least, incorporation of imaging agents, together with the drug, offers the option of a theranostic approach, that is, it opens opportunities for treatment and target imaging at the same time [61\u2022].\n\nHowever, a key problem for many types of nanoparticles is the formation of a corona [62]. Corona formation involves the opsonization of a nanoparticle with plasma components. All kind of plasma proteins and lipids can accumulate into the lipid bilayer of a liposome or may get non-covalently attached to silica, gold, or other inert inorganic particles [63]. Recent studies have shown that many different plasma proteins and lipids are more or less selectively opsonized by a nanoparticle, leading to an enrichment of certain proteins in the corona during their circulation time [63]. This opsonization greatly affects their body distribution: it can lead to enhanced uptake in non-target cells such as the opsonization of complement factor C3 into liposomes, leading to uptake in macrophages [64], whereas the binding of apo-lipoproteins shifts the uptake of nanoparticles to hepatocytes [15]. This corona formation can thus disrupt all cell-selective targeting strategies. Current research activities focus on the prevention of corona formation, e.g., by the coupling of PEG molecules to the liposomes or other nanoparticles [65], although this may lead to other problems such as the accelerated blood clearance phenomenon (see above). Fundamental knowledge on processes that affect corona formation is lacking, but it is becoming clear that physio-chemical properties of the particle itself are an important factor [62,66]. The composition of plasma is also of great importance [66] and obviously this changes during disease, making it even more complicated. It is also becoming clear that the composition of the corona may affect the intracellular routing of nanoparticles within cells [66]. Nanoparticles can be internalized and degraded within the cell via clathrin-or caveolin-dependent pathways or other",

The technological advances carried out in the past three decades have enabled the clinical approval of the first LNP-based siRNA therapeutic, Onpattro (4)(5)(6), which quickly became a landmark formulation that paved the way for the widespread use of LNP as nucleic acid delivery systems (2,7,8) and for the worldwide rollout of the LNP-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (9). However, like many other nanomedicines, LNP suffer from a low selectivity and specificity for target cells and organs and limits clinical translation (10,11). First of all, nanoparticles can be rapidly sequestered by macrophages into the liver and other secondary lymphoid organs, which impair their delivery to target tissues (12). Moreover, while ligand-targeted nanomedicines show a higher efficacy in vitro compared to their untargeted counterpart, this advantage is often lost in vivo due to masking from the formation of a biomolecular protein corona (BMC) (13). The formation of a BMC can be an advantage as several groups have shown that once i.v. administered, the BMC could enable LNPs to possess extrinsic targeting properties, directing them towards specific cell receptors (14-18). An early example of this includes Onpattro, as its ability to interact with specific serum proteins (Apolipoprotein E) after i.v. administrations, directs the LNP towards low-density lipoprotein receptors on the surface of hepatocytes (5,6,19). More recently, studies have focused on extrahepatic delivery by optimizing the physiochemical properties of LNPs to drive distinct BMC profiles, subsequently, enabling targeting of nonliver organs such as the spleen or lungs (20)(21)(22).",

We selected this second approach to separate the protein corona from the surface of the nanoparticles because this is a stronger method of separation and it can also be used easily and is highly reproducible.\n\nDerived from Tables S1 and S2, Table S3 shows the proteins detected in the soft and hard corona grouped according to their biological function. Proteins from different functional categories and/or cell components, lipoproteins, complement, coagulation, immunoglobulins, enzymes and transport proteins were identified in all samples. In order to investigate how the coating of the particles determines their biointeractions and how it governs their biological fate, the protein amounts were semi-quantitatively analysed by applying the spectral-counting method. The NpSpCk represents the total number of the MS spectra for all peptides attributed to a matched protein divided by its molecular weight (Mw) in Da. This ratio takes into account the protein size and evaluates the real contribution of each protein to the corona composition [29].\n\nAs shown in Figure 5, the relative abundance of proteins on the surface of both types of nanoparticles was comparable. In general, it is assumed that PEGylation extends blood circulation times through a significant reduction in protein binding, which is responsible for its \"stealth\" behaviour in vivo [66,67]. In line with this idea, different studies have correlated the amount of bound proteins (as an indicator of opsonization) with cell internalization or half-life circulation and measured reduced protein adsorption to nanoparticles incorporating PEGylated components [68][69][70]. In contrast, other studies have demonstrated that PEGylation increases half-life in the blood but does not reduce protein adsorption. In fact, several studies have reported that PEGylation increases protein binding [67].\n\nOverall, PEGylation of the nanoparticles did not show a significant variation in their interactions with the proteins according to their biological function. However, the analysis of the relative abundance of the top three most represented proteins in the corona of the nanoparticles (serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-I and Ig kappa",

            "text": "Nanomaterials adopt a new \"identity\" in the body through the adsorption of proteins and other biomolecules (Nel et al., 2009). This phenomenon, known as bio-corona formation, is dependent upon intrinsic properties of the nanomaterials including size or surface curvature and surface chemistry (Cedervall et al., 2007;Lundqvist et al., 2008;Tenzer et al., 2011) and on the physiological environment (i.e., the extracellular or intracellular milieu). Thus, the biological identity of nanomaterials is context dependent (Nystr\u00f6m & Fadeel, 2012). Importantly, while most publications are focused on the protein corona, one should not ignore other biomolecules including lipids, as lipid-binding proteins are commonly found in the bio-corona of nanoparticles (Hellstrand et al., 2009). \n\nThe environmental dimensions of the protein corona (often referred to as the \"eco-corona\") have been expertly covered (Wheeler et al., 2021) and will not be discussed here. \n\nIn our previous survey of bio-corona research, it was noted that we and others had deployed proteomics approaches to catalogue the proteins present on the surface of a wide range of nanomaterials including spherical particles such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) or polystyrene (PS) particles and fiber-like materials including single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) (Fadeel et al., 2013). The majority of these studies were carried out using human plasma or fetal bovine serum (FBS), and in many cases, several hundred proteins were identified in the biocorona (Tenzer et al., 2013). However, these results prompt several questions: first, why do so many different proteins congregate on the surface of nanoparticles? Indeed, as previously pointed out, it seems counterintuitive that \"proteins in the blood that evolved not to bind nonspecifically to each other would do so around nanoparticles\" (Lundqvist & Cedervall, 2020).",

            "text": "The complexes formed by NPs with proteins and sugars are described as protein coronas (PCs). \n\nAs PCs travel through the body, interactions with different molecules occur and the coronas may dissolve, form conglomerates or even new compounds with unique properties. This process is known as \"from synthetic to biological identity\" and describes changes from the NPs properties designed in the laboratory to those gained by their interaction with a specific biological environment. This means that any NPs exposed to the body may form biological medium-related, unique coronas, which exert some impact on both antibacterial and toxicological activities. 7][78] Several factors play a role in the whole interaction process between NPs and protein-rich biological fluids. Lundqvist et al. 12 showed that the size of the NPs influenced this process due to the curvature effect in human blood serum. They proved this in a study where silica nanoparticles of the same type but of various sizes differently influenced the binding of A-lipoprotein from human blood. The smaller the NPs, the greater the number of proteins that bound as PCs. Also, they showed that the bigger the NP size, the more up-regulated the thrombin-generation assay. The authors, therefore, showed that the same NPs, but of various sizes, may affect the organism response in different ways. Also, Ajdar et al. 76 showed that gold nanoparticles added to human blood generated a faster prothrombotic response (in a nonlinear size dependent manner). They also showed the concentration dependent manner of the prothrombogenic effects and reduction of time until initial clot formation. Moreover, they noticed that clot strength decreased significantly in line with the size of the NPs added. 76 he aforementioned studies confirmed the extreme diversification of the interactions between NPs and biological fluids. Few studies have yet evaluated PC formation in the oral cavity, or sufficiently explained their impact on the oral mucosa and its permeability. 3",

            "text": "Also, due to differences in the surface modification of chemical groups, the formation and composition of the protein corona were different. Proteins quickly coated the surface of the original MWCNT and MWCNT-COOH and made them more compact than MWCNT-PEG, and these compact forms were more effective in protecting cells from the MWCNT surface. Further investigation showed that hydrophobicity was the main reason for the increase in the cellular uptake of the original MWCNTs. However, the protein corona filled with dysoposnins was the major reason for the low uptake of MWCNT-COOH in RAW264.7 cells. The protein corona on MWCNT reduced the exposure of the surface to the medium and limited interactions with cells. As a result, fewer ROS or inflammatory cytokines were produced. Hence, protein binding played a key role in reducing toxicity (Zhang et al., 2019). \n\nSome studies have also shown that the number and types of proteins adsorbed on the surface of NPs are closely related to the properties of NPs. Li et al. synthesised several NPs with similar shapes, sizes, and surface characteristics but different elasticity (45 kPa-760 MPa). After mixing these NPs with mouse plasma, they found that the composition of the protein corona formation changed non-monotonically with the increase in the elasticity of the NPs (Li et al., 2022). For example, apolipoprotein AI was more likely to form the corona protein over NPs of intermediate elasticity (75-700 kPa). Cheng et al. found that changing the components of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can make LNPs absorb specific proteins in the blood and target specific organs (Cheng et al., 2020). \n\nThe research team undertook a study to ascertain the relationship between the ligand-protein corona and its biological effects, utilizing Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis. They delved into the impact of the protein corona on how particles are internalised and the subsequent macrophage immune response. \n\nTheir findings revealed that the surface chemistry of AuNRs played a role in determining the protein corona's composition.",

            "text": "The most important difficulty in obtaining a successful translation of innovative formulations in clinical practice is the lack of knowledge of their in vivo performance at systemic, tissue, and cellular levels (Tang et al., 2017). This large gap between the design of nanosystems and their effective clinical application is primarily due to the partial understanding of the in vivo fate of nanomaterials. Once systemically administered, nanoparticles are characterized by a significant modulation of their physicochemical characteristics. For this reason, a full characterization of nanosystems is a mandatory step in the preformulation phases of novel nanomaterials in order to improve the outcomes in the development of nanomedicines (Corbo et al., 2016). Upon exposure to biological fluids N of nanoparticles dynamically and often immediately (<0.5 min) interact with biomolecules such as proteins and lipids through a process defined as opsonization when injected into the blood stream, promoting the formation of the so-called \"biocorona\" on their surfaces (Cai and Chen, 2019;Lima et al., 2020). The adsorption of opsonins causes their recognition as non-self compounds, promoting their metabolism and elimination by the MPS, leading to a rapid clearance, low efficiency, and high liver accumulation. Notably, opsonins rapidly identify the positively-charged particles with respect to anionic systems (Neagu et al., 2017). \n\nSeveral types of serum proteins, such as serum albumin, immunoglobulin G, fibrinogen, clustering and apolipoproteins generally present in the biological milieu, can all interact with circulating nanosystems (Lee et al., 2015). It has been reported by several studies that the formation of a protein corona is a dynamic process, induced by the competition of various proteins adsorbed onto the surfaces of nanoparticles and it can be classified as either \"soft\" or \"hard\" as a function of the nature of the compounds and interactions involved. Namely, the hard corona presents the first tightly bound layer of proteins over an extended period (many hours), while the soft corona represents a second layer of protein (not directly bound to the nanosystems) facing rapid exchanges for shorter periods (i.e.",

            "text": "159 It is clear that the PS corona formed on both nanoparticles consists of a lipoprotein complex that contains both lipids and proteins. The specific structure of the corona and its molecular conformation are affected by the hydrophobicity of the nanoparticle, with a lipid bilayer formed on the hydrophilic silver nanoparticle and a lipid monolayer formed on the hydrophobic polystyrene nanoparticle. The wo hydrophobic surfactant proteins, SP-B and SP-C, appear to mediate the formation of the corona by directly interacting with lipids in the corona, with SP-B orienting in parallel to the lipid bilayer and the helical fragment of SP-C adopting a transmembrane orientation. The hydrophilic SP-A was also found associated with the PS corona, mainly via its carbohydrate recognition domain, albeit to a lesser extent of association than SP-B and SP-C. \n\nAlthough the detailed structure and composition of the PS biomolecular corona are yet to be discovered, both MD simulations and mass spectrometry studies suggest that this corona consists of primarily phospholipids, 167,171 hydrophobic surfactant proteins, 144,145 and hydrophilic surfactant proteins. 123,172,173 A fine balance between electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions may be involved in the formation of the PS biomolecular corona. 145 The PS corona provides the particles with a physicochemical barrier against the environment, reduces the hydrophobicity of the pristine particles, and enhances biorecognition of the particles. 159 uture Directions in Understanding Aerosol Deposition in the Lung. Although plausible, direct clinical evidence for lung infection by virus-laden aerosols is still lacking. A common objection against the likelihood of aerosol transmission is the seemingly insufficient viral concentration to cause an infection, after individual airborne viral emissions in the form of a sneeze or a cough, or after continuous airborne viral emissions in the form of speaking or breathing. The aerosol volumes generated by an individual sneeze and cough are estimated at 1000 and 100 nL, respectively. 174 The aerosol volumes generated by continuous talking and breathing are estimated at 10 and 1 nL/min, respectively. 174",

            "text": "To elucidate why liposomal LNP mRNA systems exhibit longer circulation lifetimes, we characterized the biomolecular corona (BMC) adsorbing to the surface of the different LNP systems following incubation with mouse plasma. Using size-exclusion column chromatography (SEC), isolation of the plasma protein-bound LNPs was performed (Fig. S14). A ~2-fold higher (wt/wt) adsorption of plasma proteins was found for LNP with the Onpattro-like lipid composition as compared to the liposomal LNP system (Fig. 3A). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis suggested both formulations exhibited a broadly similar plasma protein profile (Fig. 3B, Table S4). Liposomal LNP formulations with other ionizable lipids such as ALC-0315 and SM-102 also showed a decrease in protein adsorption after SEC (Fig. S15). Mass spectrometry (MS) proteomic analysis detected over 1000 different proteins in the BMC of both formulations (Fig. 3C). Volcano plot analysis showed 98 proteins that are statistically different (P value = 0.01) between the two formulations. Notably, the liposomal LNP exhibit significantly lower immunoglobulin heavy variable 10-1 (Ighv10-1) and fibrinogen (Fgb) levels (Fig. S16). The classes of proteins adsorbed by liposomal LNP and Onpattro-like systems were similar but with a slight reduction in immunoproteins (~4.4% less) and a slight increase in apolipoprotein (~3.6% more) for the liposomal LNP as shown in Fig. 3D and Table S4 [21][22][23] . While the dominant contribution to prolonged circulation lifetimes correlates with the overall reduction in adsorbed plasma proteins, it is possible that the reduced levels of immune proteins and increased levels of apolipoproteins could also contribute to this effect.",

ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nclearance (\"ABC phenomenon\") observed upon repeated administration, and a hypersensitivity reaction non-IgE-mediated pseudo-allergy, referred to as CARPA (complement activation-related pseudo-allergy), caused by the activation of the complement system, which significantly reduces the efficacy and safety of PEGylated nanocarriers (Figure 6).

            "text": "The biomolecular corona A different aspect -which clearly distinguishes nanoparticles from molecular species -of importance for how nanoparticles transport through the blood-brain barrier is the concept of biomolecular corona. 49,50 The biomolecular corona refers to the adsorption of biomolecules from the environment onto the nanoparticle, forming a \"corona\" of biomolecules (Fig. 3A) that covers the original nanoparticle surface (Fig. 3B). The formation of such a corona is important to consider, because in any imaginable way a nanoparticle would come in contact with the blood-brain barrier in vivo, it would do so in the presence of a complex mixture of biomolecules in its environment, all of which could potentially adsorb. Indeed, proteins, 49,51,52 lipids 53-56 and sugars 57,58 have all been found in the corona of different nanoparticles in animal-derived biological media, though the proteins are still the most studied. Furthermore, though which biomolecules adsorb differs, the same general phenomenon of a formation of corona is observed in many biological fluids, 59 from blood serum 50,52,60,61 to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 56 to urine. 59 For nanoparticles approaching the blood-brain barrier, the corona formed in blood serum is perhaps the most important (but not the only; see below) to consider, and this is also the most wellstudied.\n\nIt is a characteristic of the nanoscale, that the adsorption of biomolecules to nanoparticles can be so strong that (some of the) biomolecules will remain with the nanoparticle for much longer than it takes a cell to take up the nanoparticle. [61][62][63][64] This is particularly so for metal, 64 metal oxide 61,62 and other inorganic nanoparticles. 62,63 Still, biomolecular adsorption is sometimes also observed for nanoparticles intended as medicines, e.g., those with grafted ligands, even if PEGylated to prevent unspecific adsorption.

            "text": "When nanoparticles (NPs) enter a biological fluid, such as serum, proteins and peptides adsorb onto the particle's surface, forming a nanoparticle-protein corona (NPPC) complex [1][2][3]. The protein cloud develops a new surface on the nanoparticle, impacting the interactions between the nanoparticle and the surrounding environment. The NPPC complex assumes the characteristics of a core-shell particle system, where the pristine particle is the \"core\" and the corona is the \"shell\" [4]. This creates a new interface between the pristine particle and the surrounding biological fluid. The formation of a protein corona has been shown to change the particle's biological effects [5][6][7][8]. In addition to this change in the particle's characteristics, the adsorbed proteins have the potential to undergo conformational changes. Changes in either set of properties are especially important for nanomaterial drug products [9][10][11][12][13]. The cloak of proteins around particles in biological fluids has been shown to enhance or diminish a particle's specificity to a desired location, incite or inhibit its ability to permeate into a cell, and heighten or mitigate a biochemical response. When a protein corona forms, it is more likely to distribute and become available due to the nano-bio interface that forms around the surface of the nanoparticle. This protein cloud can change the biodistribution of the nanoparticle system depending on the biomolecular composition formed around the surface. Consequently, if the drug is reliant on specific proteins binding to the surface of the nanoparticle, then the particle could be translocated into an unintended location if non-targeted proteins form around the particle. \n\nResearch efforts in the field of nanotoxicology have strived to relate (or correlate) particle properties to adverse health effects. There now exists a substantial amount of published literature on this topic; however, there is no general consensus on identifying physicochemical characteristics as predictors of toxicological responses.",

            "text": "Using super-resolution optical microscopy (STORM), Feiner-Gracia et al. (2017) were able to visualize the protein corona formed on mesoporous silica nanoparticles with single protein sensitivity and found a significant heterogeneity in protein absorption within the same nanoparticle population. Moreover, the authors demonstrated that changes in the corona composition occurred over time due to the chemistry and degradability of the particles, thus adding a further level of complexity to our understanding of the biological identity of nanomaterials (Feiner-Gracia et al., 2017). \n\nThe second, non-technical (and non-trivial) question refers to the biological \"meaning,\" if any, of all these proteins. It is well understood that the presence or absence of proteins, regardless of their identity, may influence the degree of agglomeration of nanoparticles. The question is whether there is a role for specific proteins in the bio-corona? Tenzer et al. (2013) performed comprehensive studies using a panel of PS nanoparticles and silica nanoparticles of various sizes displaying different surface charges and could show that the rapid formation of a plasma protein corona could modulate distinct pathophysiological effects as evidenced by the ex vivo analysis of platelet activation/aggregation and red blood cell lysis (i.e., hemolysis). However, the complexity of the protein corona precluded the assignment of specific proteins to account for these effects (and perhaps the effects were related to a shielding of the particle surface, thereby passivating the nanoparticles) (see, e.g., Hu et al., 2011, Lesniak et al., 2012). Indeed, we have shown that the cytotoxicity of silica nanoparticles is mitigated in the presence of serum whereas ZnO nanoparticles that undergo rapid dissolution are cytotoxic both in the absence and presence of serum (Shi et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Nanoparticles (NPs) are increasingly prevalent in our society, with applications ranging from nanomedicine, photovoltaics, cosmetics and beyond. Despite the ubiquity of their use, we still lack a fundamental understanding of how NPs interact with their local environments. This poor understanding becomes a critical problem when using NPs in real-life situations. Notably, it has been well documented that introducing NPs into biological fluids results in the formation of a surrogated biological identity known as the biomolecular corona, which is the spontaneous adsorption of proteins 1 , lipids 2 , sugar moieties 3 , nucleic acids 4 and metabolites 5,6 onto nanomaterial surfaces. The composition of the biomolecular corona strongly determines the ultimate fate of NPs [7][8][9] . As most studies that address the biomolecular corona formation have focused on proteins adsorbed to the surface of NPs 10 , together with the fact that the predominant model for the formation of the biomolecular corona is hegemonized by the direct adsorption of proteins from biological milieus 11 , this Review comprehensively focuses on the protein corona. \n\nThe emergence of the concept of the protein corona in nanomedicine substantially altered perspectives of researchers and interpretation of biosystem-NP interactions. The first critical milestone occurred in 2007 when Dawson's group conceived the term protein corona 12 . However, protein corona studies commenced as early as the late 1950s 13 and early 1960s 14,15 under a slightly different terminology and a colloidal science context. The characterization of protein coronas has revealed that the adsorption of proteins onto nanomaterials can have mixed biological effects. Protein corona patterns, which are dependent on the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials and the complexities of biological matrices, can unpredictably change NP outcomes including function 16 , uptake 17,18 , biodistribution 19,20 , immunological responses 10,21 and toxicity 22,23 , and can thus be a challenge for therapeutic nanomedicine.",

            "text": "By simply adjusting the head structure of N-series LNPs, different subpopulations of lung cells can be targeted. The doping LNPs with lipids containing quaternary ammonium groups can selectively deliver mRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 for specific lung diseases in the lungs. 47 Similarly, both zwitterionic amino lipids and cationic quaternary sulfonamide amino lipids have permanent cationic quaternary ammonium functional groups and can also be used to design lung-targeted LNPs. 25 The more detailed LNPs compositions for extrahepatic delivery are summarized by Dilliard S.A. and Siegwart D.J. 20 Furthermore, the length of the alkyl chain on the phosphate side determines organ selectivity. The iPhos with 9-12 and 13-16 carbon chain lengths deliver mRNA to the liver and the spleen, respectively. 47 The possible underlying mechanism for only small difference in structure to cause such astonishing organ specificity may be the result of a specific protein or the synergistic action of several proteins, but further research is still needed. Once injected into the bloodstream, LNPs can selectively control the adsorption of specific plasma proteins, acting as targeted ligands to direct LNPs to selected organs. Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver. In addition, the zeta potential of the two LNP S did not differ significantly, and both showed a slightly negative surface charge, suggesting that surface charge may not be the only factor influencing the interaction between NPs and proteins in biological fluids. 35 verall, the ionization of lipid structure can be driven by the type of organs and cells.",

            "text": "The size of aggregates may be dependent on the concentration and they tend to be slightly larger in culture media than in PBS. Moreover, monovalent and divalent cations may affect aggregate formation. Adsorption of media components, serum proteins and Ca 2+ on nanoparticle surface determines NP aggregations and size distribution [14]. Agglomeration leads to cytotoxicity reduction, because of lower availability of inorganic NPs in contact with cells. In addition, the size of aggregates prevents their cellular internalisation [39]. Studies based on silica nanoparticles indicated that minimization of NP aggregation could be obtained by introducing an optimum balance of inert (e.g., methyl phosphonate) and active (e.g., hydroxyl and aldehyde) functional groups to the surface [41]. \n\nThe protein layer of several nanometres on particle surface is called protein corona and it can be divided into a peripheral soft corona (SC)-dynamic protein exchanges with the surrounding medium-and a hard corona (HC)-a layer of more or less temporal constant composition (Figure 2, Table 2) [34,42,43]. In blood plasma, the surface of nanoparticles mainly adsorbs proteins, but some minor traces of lipids have also been found in the corona structure. Adsorption of proteins on the nanoparticle surface is the result of protein-nanoparticle binding affinities and protein-protein interactions. Hard corona interacts directly with the nanomaterial surface. Soft corona proteins interact with the hard corona via weak proteinprotein interactions. Interestingly, the corona on the NP surface does not completely mask the nanomaterial surface or its functional groups [43]. The formation of protein corona and its thickness is a parameter that is also dependent on protein concentration, temperature, duration of particle-protein interaction, serum concentration and shear stress [34,44]. \n\nProtein corona formation strongly affects cellular uptake mechanism, cell-nanoparticle interactions, intracellular location as well as cellular response (e.g., biocompatibility) [34,35,44].",

[21] These experiments have revealed the effects of protein concentration and ionic strength on nanoparticle aggregation, although the mechanism has not yet been clearly understood, which requires the understanding of particle-protein and protein-protein interactions at nearly the atomic scale. \n\n[50] To understand the corona-induced aggregation, discrete simulations were performed by Li et al. [51] and Pilkington et al., [52] showing polypeptide aggregation in the presence of nanosheets, [51] lysozyme and eLact proteins. [52] Our group's coarse-grained (CG) simulations captured that the lipid-corona formation induces aggregation of 12 nm-sized spherical Au particles, depending on the lipid type and concentration. [53] Recently, Liu et al.'s allatom simulations showed that the adsorption of extracellular substances such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids reduces aggregation of nanoplastics because of electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance. [54] Although these simulations have been able to explore the effects of corona components and their concentrations on peptide or particle aggregation, they have been performed using an implicit-solvent model or using an explicit-solvent model with only very limited system sizes, which are not always easy to accurately assess aggregation of multiple copies of relatively large nanoparticles bound to plasma proteins with consideration of their interactions with solvents. In particular, the aggregation extent and hydrodynamics (i.e., the change of R h ) of nanoparticles coated with different proteins and their concentrations at different ionic strengths have not so far been systematically studied through MD simulations.",

Because loss of nanoparticles during the nebulization blocks delivering nucleic acids to the lungs via inhalation, 11 discovery of novel structural lipids that make LNPs resilient to the use of nebulizer will substantially improve efficacy of gene therapies.\n\nIn summary, these studies reinforce the potential of structural lipids to target different organs. First, the presence of structural lipids at nanoparticle surface post PEG shedding makes them an important partner for serum proteins to form a corona. The composition of the protein corona on different nanoparticles is an active area of research. 7,26 Ability to mitigate corona formation can enable LNPs to reach tissues beyond the liver. On the other hand, the surface can be designed to adsorb proteins which exploit processes that traverse impenetrable organs like the brain or propel the nanocarriers across lung endothelium. Second, the membrane lipids can play an important role in the formulation of nanoparticles based on routes of administration. For example, when delivered through inhalation, the structural lipid can impart a valuable feature to the nanocarrier, i.e., maintain its structure and ability to transfect after nebulization. Such fea-tures are necessary for developing inhalable mRNA nanoformulations for treatment of diseases like cystic fibrosis, COVID-19, asthma, or lung cancer that can be benefited by direct access to the lungs. Finally, it is unclear whether the membrane lipids directly engage with the process of endosomal escape. However, based on the differences within in vitro transfections with use of different structural lipids, one may speculate that the structural lipid perhaps contributes to LNP disassembly and resulting cytosolic delivery of RNA. The discovery of natural products that undergo conformational changes once inside an endosome can lead to potent nanocarriers for intracellular gene delivery.",

            "text": "We also observed a negative correlation between the level of in vitro monocyte phagocytosis of lipid nanoparticles and anti-PEG IgG expansion (Figure 6c). These findings suggest that the amounts of mRNA lipid nanoparticles that remain in the blood (and free of phagocytosis) may influence the PEG antibody immunogenicity in humans. This phenomenon only affected PEG immunogenicity as the mRNA levels in the blood were not significantly correlated with the expansion of spikebinding IgG or neutralizing antibodies (Figure 5d). This is consistent with PEG being expressed on the surface of the lipid nanoparticle, whereas the spike protein, the target of neutralization and spike binding IgG, is only expressed following the mRNA transfection of cells. Larger cohort studies and animal studies are required to confirm the causal relationship between the levels of mRNA lipid nanoparticles in blood and the expansion of anti-PEG antibodies. \n\nAdditional factors could influence the biodistribution and immunogenicity of mRNA lipid vaccines. Humans display a diverse range of plasma lipids and proteins. Similar differences are likely to be found in lymphatic fluids, which vaccines must traverse. \u221228 We previously showed that clinically relevant drug-loaded liposomes displayed a large variance in immune cell association in human blood, depending on the compositions of person-specific biomolecular coronas. 21 The formation of biomolecular corona on drugloaded liposomes in vivo in human blood has been previously described. 29 The composition of biomolecular coronas has been shown to influence the fate and functionality of lipid nanoparticles. 30,31 An analysis of the in vivo or ex vivo corona formation on mRNA vaccines could help further characterize mRNA vaccine distribution and immunogenicity. \n\nOverall, our study provides important information on the kinetics of mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines in human blood in vivo and their impact on vaccine and PEG immunogenicity.

            "text": ". The presence of many 327 apolipoproteins in LNP coronas correlated with LNP efficacy (-0.1<Orthogonality<0.1). In 328 particular, Apo A-II, B, C-II, and C-IV, the structural proteins found in HDL, VLDL, and 329 chylomicron (CM) lipoproteins, were positively correlated with LNPs performance. Apo M, which 330 is found primarily on HDL 46 , also exhibited a high positive correlation to LNP performance. In 331 contrast, Apo E and Apo A-IV 47 , which are primarily found in VLDL and CM demonstrated a 332 moderate negative correlation to LNPs performance (Fig. 5a). While Apo E is often considered 333 highly correlative to LNP hepatic delivery efficacy, the amount of corona Apo E in obese-plasma-334 derived coronas declined modestly compared to lean-derived counterparts ( Supplementary Fig.  335 14). Remarkably, quantitative imaging revealed that LNPs stimulated higher cellular eGFP mRNA 336 expression when supplemented with obese plasmas that resulted in coronas with less ApoE (Fig.  337 1e). As will be shown later, this is also not simply because the obese serum stimulates protein 338 production, but rather that specific plasma components accumulate in LNP coronas and this leads 339 to enhanced LNP function. 340\n\nWhile not all protein components of LNP coronas are strongly correlated with LNP function, the 341 majority of lipids associated with LNPs did correlate with enhanced LNP performance. A lipid-342 rich corona, in general, is favorable for LNP mediated mRNA delivery. However, the 343 orthogonality of lipid hits was higher than most of the protein hits (Orthogonality>0.1 or <-0.1), 344\n\nsuggesting that the corona proteins are more relevant for explaining the differences between LNP 345 function in lean and obese contexts. The plasma lipids became more relevant (orthagonality 346 dropped below 0.1 in most cases) when considering particle uptake as opposed to function. While 347 particle uptake was not our primary readout, it is interesting that PC, for example, has previously",

            "text": "Many experimental techniques have been used to investigate the binding of proteins to nanoparticles and some models have been proposed to rationalize the experiments [10,32]. The most accepted view on protein corona formation is that proteins that adsorb with high affinity form a \"hard\" corona, do not readily desorb and show larger exchange times in the order of several hours. The \"soft\" corona is formed by proteins that adsorb with low affinity, are loosely bound, and are in permanent exchange with other proteins [9,28]. However, the mechanisms of protein corona formation are still debated and no existing model can fully explain it [6,10,29]. Comparing different NPs in blood plasma, it has been shown experimentally that the physicochemical properties of a given nanoparticle determine also their individual \"adsorbome\" [10]. \n\nIn the present study we used polymer-coated monodisperse SPIOs (11 nm core, total hydrodynamic diameter about 25 nm), as well as PEGylated variants as model nanoparticles. The iron oxide cores were labelled with 59 Fe and we used an iodination kit to label also transferrin or albumin with 125 I to trace the exchange of corona proteins in vitro and also in vivo in mice. These two proteins are of physiological relevance with albumin as the most abundant plasma protein and transferrin with a well understood function in iron transport and already widely used in transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles [20,21,23]. As shown in a recent metaanalysis of adsorbed corona proteins from 63 different nanoparticles in 26 studies, our chosen test proteins were also among the group of adsorbed plasma proteins which show a high abundance (>10%) in coronas from many NPs [10]. \n\nMost of the results on the composition, structure, and binding kinetics of the protein corona were so far performed ex situ and required the adequate isolation of the NPs from an artificial or physiological environment for example by differential centrifugation (DC) of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) [30,31]. \n\nThese techniques are easy to perform and allow the use of modern measuring technology to analyze parameters of the protein corona.",

            "text": "Understanding the mRNA loading mechanism and biobarriers helps us to identify the useful groups in carriers. However, the specific delivery of mRNA to tissues and cells in vivo remains a significant challenge. 98 Much research has reported the complicated interactions between nanoparticles and cells, as such information is key to rationally designing particles for biological applications, which may determine the cellular uptake leading to the specific accumulation. It was reported that the surface charge of LNPs at physiological pH can influence their plasma protein adsorption and in vivo behavior (e.g., tissue distribution). 14,98 A classic example is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), generally recognized as an endogenous ligand targeted to the liver. 99 One explanation is that the neutral surface vehicle will absorb more ApoE, resulting in a stronger tendency to distribute in the liver. 100 The dissociation constant (pK a ) that determines the surface charge of LNPs at different pH is one of the important factors to consider when designing ionizable lipids. Other pieces of evidence also suggest that surface charge has an impact on the targeting ability of LNPs: the inclusion of neutral ionizable lipids enhanced liver targeting, anionic lipids resulted in retargeting of delivery to the spleen, and permanently cationic lipids bearing a quaternary ammonium headgroup specifically deliver mRNA to lung. 101,102 Interestingly, the above two nonliver targeting effects occur independently of ApoE, which suggests that there is a correlation between the components of protein corona and surface charges of nanoparticles, resulting in the differences in the tissue-targeted ability 103 . 104 recent study found that LNPs prepared with the structurally similar ionizable lipids 306-O12B and 306-N16B showed slight negative charges without significant differences. 105 However, 306-O12B containing the ester linker led to liver targeting, while 306-N16B with an amide linker tended to lung targeting. Compared with ester bonds, amides tend to combine with proteins via hydrogen bonds. 106 Thus, the protein corona coating in 306-N16B LNPs is completely different from that in 306-O16B LNPs, which has been proven. 105",

            "text": "For instance, vitronectin in the corona was found to increase uptake via \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin receptor in vitro and in vivo [145,146]. Similarly, it was suggested that apolipoprotein E in the corona facilitates nanoparticle transcytosis across the blood brain barrier [147], while we and others found that silica nanoparticles are internalized by cells upon interaction of apolipoproteins in their corona with the low density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR [148,149]. Interestingly, this specific interaction was observed only when forming a corona using high serum concentrations, mimicking in vivo blood plasma concentration. This kind of observations challenges the use of standard low concentration of serum or also artificial serum-free conditions when testing nanomedicines and targeted drugs in vitro. Thus the proteins adsorbed on the nanomedicine can enable new ways to achieve targeted uptake into specific cells, and similar effects have been observed also in vivo. An example of this is that of Onpattro, a lipid nanoparticle carrying small interfering RNA (siRNA) and which -as mentioned previously-adsorbs apoE from plasma, thus promoting uptake into the liver hepatocytes via the LDLR [11]. \n\nOn the opposite side, the binding of other proteins known as \"dysopsonin\" proteins, such as for instance albumin, can prolong plasma residence time [150,151]. Similarly, it has been reported that certain corona proteins adsorbed on nanomedicines in blood can also be read by immune cells as a don't-eat-me signal. An example of a corona protein associated with reduced uptake by cells via this kind of mechanisms is clusterin [152]. Interestingly, the authors identified this protein as a major component in the corona forming on PEGylated nanoparticles and suggested that it is this specific protein in the corona to confer the socalled PEG \"stealth-effect\", as opposed to the overall reduced protein binding. Recently reduced uptake has been observed also for nanoparticles with a corona rich in histidine rich glycoprotein [153,154].",

            "text": "One major problem with the intravenous administration of colloidal particles is their interaction with the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Nanoparticles for medical applications are frequently given via parenteral administration. As with any foreign material, the body mounts a biological response to an administered nanoparticle. This response is the result of a complex interplay of factors, not just the intrinsic characteristics of the nanoparticle. In particular, most materials, upon contact with biological matrices, are immediately coated by proteins, leading to a protein \"corona\" [65]. Protein coronas are complex and variable. Certain components of the nanoparticle corona, called opsonins, may enhance uptake of the coated material by cells of the RES. The presence of opsonins on the particle surface creates a \"molecular signature\" which is recognized by immune cells and determines the route of particle internalization. The route of internalization affects the eventual fate of the nanoparticle in the body (i.e. its rate of clearance from the bloodstream, volume of distribution, organ disposition, and rate and route of clearance from the body). The cells of RES are capable of mopping up particles that they do not recognise as self i.e. particles they recognise as foreign. The negative effect can however, be remedied by linking of polyethylene glycol molecules to the lipid nanoparticles, thus increasing their hydrophilicity and the residence time of these particles in circulation. Alternatively, the lipid nanoparticles could be engineered to evade these RES cells by limiting the particle sizes to about 200 nm or less. It is believed that these cells do not recognise low nanometer-sized particles as foreign. Several other varied and unrelated challenges are encountered in lipid nanoparticle technology. These challenges constitute a serious research question which current strategies are targeted to address.",

            "text": "The term \"nanoparticles\" (NPs) refers to various types of particulate materials with one dimension of a size smaller than 100 nm [1,2]. They are increasingly popular for use as drug delivery systems to overcome classical problems faced by most drugs such as low solubility [3,4], low bioavailability [5,6], non-specificity [7,8], and/or toxicity [9,10]. Therefore, each year there is an increasing trend of NP-based therapies being approved by governmental medicine regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [11,12] or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [13,14]. However, even though many NP systems were designed to evade drug delivery-related problems, some types of NPs face unexpected challenges in vivo which can potentially lower their therapeutic effectiveness [15,16]. \n\nThe term \"nano-bio-interactions\" is used to describe the various ways in which NPs interact with the body. These interactions can be categorized based on the organs which the NPs interact with, such as NP-liver interactions [17], NP-kidney interactions [18], NP-brain interactions [19], NP-tumor interactions [20], and other non-specific NP interactions [21]. When NPs are injected, the first interaction occurs when serum proteins circulating in the blood attach themselves onto the surface of the NP, forming what is known as a protein corona [22,23]. The characteristics of the corona formed will depend on the physical and chemical characteristics of the NP, such as its size, charge, and shape, which are discussed in more detail below. \n\nThe particles then circulate around the body in the bloodstream. Their biodistribution and other nano-bio-interactions are affected by their protein corona [24,25]. In some cases, the corona configuration can cause most of the NPs to be sequestered by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). This leads to their biodistribution mainly accumulating in the liver and spleen [26,27], which could lower their therapeutic effectiveness.",

LNPs based on the most effective lipids (306-N16B or 113-N16B) with different amine cores ensured the expression of a luminescent reporter protein exclusively in the lungs, mainly in endothelial cells with little expression in macrophages. \n\nIn another study (Huo et al., 2023), a new lipid was synthesized, F-L319, which is a fluorine-containing version of lipid L319, which in turn is a biodegradable modification of MC3 owing to ester bonds in alkyl chains. The fluorinated version of the lipid was chosen due to higher stability of nanoparticles based on it. After injection, fourcomponent LNPs based on either L319 or F-L319 resulted in the expression of a luminescent product exclusively in the spleen, with the particles based on the fluorinated lipid resulting in less luminescence as compared to the nonfluorinated ones. Unexpectedly, mixing of the two ionizable lipids in fivecomponent LNPs enhanced the expression of the reporter protein without a change in LNP biodistribution. \n\nAltogether, the in vivo findings in animals indicate that lipid compositions containing novel ionizable lipids can increase tropism to various organs such as the pancreas, lungs, and liver. Thus, the development of new ionizable lipids is an effective way to improve targeted delivery of LNPs to certain organs.",

            "text": "Lipids-based nanoparticles (LNPs) are unique nanostructures, composed of various types of lipids, including cationic or ionizable lipids (CIL), structural lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol), and PEG-binding lipids (PEG-Derived phospholipids) (Patel et al., 2019). Among them, ionizable lipids are the key components that determine the titer, mRNA delivery efficiency, degradability, and reactivity (Drescher and van Hoogevest, 2020). At low pH, ionizable lipids are protonated in acidic buffers, producing a positive charge and binding to negatively charged mRNA, whereas they remain neutral at physiological pH (Chan et al., 2021;Scalzo et al., 2022). The delivery mechanism of LNPs is shown in Figure 4. Ionizable lipids are less cytotoxic than cationic lipids. This is because the positive charge of cationic lipids typically interacts with negatively charged molecules on the cell surface, leading to cell membrane damage and cell death. In contrast, ionizable lipids can dynamically regulate their charge state in the cellular environment, avoiding the continuous release of positive charges to the cell surface and reducing cytotoxicity (Sharma et al., 2014). In general, PEGbound lipids in LNPs occupy the smallest molar percentage, which can enhance particle stability by affecting charge distribution, size, and dispersion, and hinder LNPs from aggregating, playing a crucial role in blood circulation and biological distribution (Albertsen and Camilla et al., 2022;Kon et al., 2022;Gu\u00e9guen et al., 2023). Structural lipids are chiefly used to support the structure of particles and enhance stability during storage and circulation (Kulkarni et al., 2019;Witzigmann et al., 2020). According to diverse target tissues, the proportions of these four lipid components can be adjusted to change the LNP constitution (Yihunie et al., 2023).",

            "text": "While mechanisms of delivery generally aren't elucidated, there have been some clear trends in physicochemical properties that correlate with organ distribution.For example, intravenously injected (IV) LNPs formulated with negatively charged lipids often accumulate in the spleen [5][6][7][8][9] , and LNPs formulated with positively charged lipids usually accumulate in the lungs 5,7,[9][10][11][12] , as found independently by many labs and companies.These observations were, in a 2020 Nature Nanotechnology paper, distilled into a simpler and more elegant way of targeting LNPs 5 .Instead of using particular ratios of hard-tosynthesize ionizable lipids or exotic helper lipids, this seminal study showed it was possible add to a base formulation of LNPs either a negatively charged lipid to target the spleen or a positively charged lipid to target the lungs.This approach leads to democratization and reproducibility, since any lab or company can obtain such common lipids, rather than having to synthesize the particular ionizable lipid variants used in a particular lab's screening.However, while testing such promising physicochemically-targeted LNPs as therapeutics, we found that the LNPs with lung tropism induce a major unreported side effect: thrombosis.Studies of nanoparticle toxicities have largely focused on 2 of the 3 major defense systems of plasma: complement proteins and immunoglobulins [13][14][15] .However, the 3rd defense system, clotting, has often been neglected in recent years, even though it has the most deadly and acute consequences if improperly activated.Blood has evolved to actively clot in response to different foreign surfaces and the coagulation cascade is specifically known to activate in response to charged surfaces.An IV dose of nanoparticles exposes the blood to massive amounts of foreign surface area, but nanoparticles can also indirectly activate clotting by interacting with cells that affect clotting processes, such as endothelial cells, neutrophils, and platelets.",

            "text": "As shown in Fig. 4 protein corona formation had a major impact on the cellular uptake towards HeLa cells. Therefore, we aimed to deeply investigate the interaction of the protein nanocapsules with blood proteins. All nanocapsules were incubated with human serum for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Protein corona coated nanocapsules were isolated via centrifugation and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S4-6 \u2020), Pierce Assay (Fig. S3 \u2020) and mass spectrometry (Fig. 6). A full list of all identified proteins is provided in a separate supporting Excel Sheet. \n\nAll corona proteins identified by mass spectrometry were classified into eight different protein groups depending on their biological function and are summarized in Fig. 6. We found that regardless of the protein type and crosslinker, there was no specific enrichment of one or two major protein classes in the protein corona of all nanocapsules (see also protein corona profiles Fig. S4-S6 \u2020). This is in strong contrast to other nanocarrier systems such as nanocapsules prepared from hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 43,44 or polystyrene nanoparticles. 30,45 Generally, for those systems, one or two protein groups (e.g. lipoproteins or serum albumin) are the dominant class proteins with an overall amount between 50-70%. Next to this, the absolute amount of corona proteins (Fig. S3 \u2020), which bound to all protein nanocapsules was comparable (<500 \u00b5g m \u22122 surface area) and significantly lower compared to polystyrene nanoparticles (\u223c2-3 mg m \u22122 ) or HES nanocapsules (\u223c1 mg m \u22122 ). This could possibly be a result of different hydrophilicities of the materials and the fact that proteins are natural molecules also occurring in the human body. This was already found for other nanocarriers made from  \"body-similar\" components. 30,46,47 However, having a closer look at the individual protein classes, we found that the crosslinker type (TAD vs. TDI) had an influence on the relative amount of specific protein classes.",

            "text": "Early responses are likely to be the most discriminating. \n\nIt is known that in a biological environment nano-SiO 2 will associate with macromolecules (e.g. proteins and lipids) that coat the nanoparticles and form what has been termed a ''corona''. Such a coating influences the uptake, toxicity, cellular response and clearance rates of nano-SiO 2 particles [59,60]. Analysis of the corona of A549 cells incubated with culture medium by SDS-PAGE indicated preferential binding of three main serum proteins, and these were identified as albumin, apolipoprotein A-I and hemoglobin. Interaction of nano-SiO 2 with these proteins has been reported previously [11]. Additionally, proteomic analysis indicated the presence of fibronectin and vitronectin, which have also been reported to bind to silica [61,62]. It is possible that the presence of such proteins on the surface of the nanoparticles were responsible for the attenuation of cytotoxicity observed, although it is not possible from the present work to eliminate the effect of other non-proteinaceous components of serum. Apolipoproteins are lipid binding proteins with detergentlike amphipathic properties that behave as water-soluble carriers in lymph and blood. A coating of apolipoprotein A-I on the surface of nano-SiO 2 particles may impart amphipathic properties on the nanoparticles thus facilitating their transport through the lymphatic and circulatory systems and possible elimination. The presence of vitronectin and fibronectin in the corona is of interest as these proteins are involved in cell membrane stability, integrity, adhesion and wound healing and such proteins in the coating could affect the ability of nano-SiO 2 Cultures of A549 cells (n = 5) were treated for 4 h with 100 mg/ml or vehicle only (n = 5) in medium containing 1.25% serum. Total cell homogenates were prepared, separated by SDS-PAGE, proteins extracted, digested with trypsin and analysed by LC-MS/MS.",

            "text": "In the second maturation step, removal of ethanol by dialysis against physiological buffer (pH 7.4) deprotonates the ionizable lipid and stabilizes LNPs. Inherently, LNPs contain at least five additional kinds of dynamic elements that determine their potency in a bioresponsive fashion; i) a PEG-lipid that, based on short (commonly dimyristyl) lipid anchors, is sheddable upon interaction with serum proteins in blood circulation; ii) a cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine envelope that triggers the formation of an apolipoprotein E-rich surface protein corona, facilitating receptor-mediated endocytosis into liver hepatocytes via the low-density lipoprotein receptor; iii) a cationizable tertiary amine-containing lipid (Fig. 1A), which after cellular uptake into acidifying endosomes becomes positively charged and changes physical properties; iv) interaction of cationized and anionic lipids trigger membrane destabilization promoting crossing of the endosomal barrier (Fig. 1B); and v) merging nanoparticle lipids with the cellular lipid membrane lead to release of the nucleic acid payload into the cytosol to a significant extent in carrier-free, bioavailable form (32)(33)(34). Consequently, the LNP composition strongly influences protein corona formation, endogenous receptor targeting, and functional activity (35). \n\nAs multicomponent assemblies, LNPs can be improved by combinatorial variation of phospholipids, PEG-lipid, cholesterol analogs, and/or the ionizable lipid. Optimizing the cationizable lipid structure (Fig. 1A) by modifying hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic tails, optionally including degradable bonds, was key for the LNP efficacy (27,(36)(37)(38). First breakthrough was the replacement of permanent cationic lipids such as DOTMA or DOTAP by ionizable tertiary amine-containing lipids. The dynamic reversible protonation both enhances efficacy and eliminates potential toxicity problems of permanently cationic materials.",

            "text": "Akinc et al. [84] discovered that ionizable LNPs (iLNPs) adsorbing apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can enhance the uptake of LNPs via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) pathway, thereby targeting hepatocytes endogenously. Building on this finding, Johnson's team screened a chemically diverse library of ionizable cationic lipids and identified the amino lipid 5A2-SC8. [85] LNPs formulated with 5A2-SC8/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG exhibited higher in vivo delivery efficiency compared to another construct with similar physical properties, 3A5-SC14/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG. This discrepancy arises because different LNPs adsorb distinct proteins, forming varied protein coronas during delivery. Specifically, 5A2-SC8 LNPs adsorb a significant amount of ApoE, facilitating hepatocyte endocytosis via LDL-R, whereas 3A5-SC14 LNPs predominantly adsorb albumin, which is readily phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. Notably, 3A5-SC14 LNPs demonstrated a higher hepatocyte accumulation rate in vitro than 5A2-SC8. Further studies on LNP protein coronas revealed that altering the carbon chain length of PEG lipids and the molar percentage of PEGs also affects the adsorbed protein corona. Pre-incubation of ApoE with various LNPs indicated that ApoE promoted uptake only in C14-PEG LNPs, not C18-PEG LNPs, highlighting that small differences in LNP composition can influence both the type of protein corona and its effect on LNP uptake. [86,87] e PEG shield significantly impacts LNP uptake rates in cells and can cause substantial disparities between in vitro and in vivo results.",

To increase a circulation time, additional modifications of the composite's surface by hydrophilic coatings, such as polyethylene glycol derivatives, polysaccharides, or zwitterionic polymers [47,48], can be used. Alternatively, the process of opsonization can be inhibited by induced eryptosis or macrophage blockade with ballast nanoparticles [49,50]. These powerful techniques showed their efficiency in prolongation of blood circulation time on a variety of nanosized systems and may be applied without additional modification of the surface of the nanoparticles. \n\nThe biodistribution profile from both optical visualization and MPQ studies showed that particles are mainly located in the liver and spleen-organs that play a major role in nanoparticle clearance. It was described earlier that Kupffer cells in the liver and splenic macrophages react rapidly to the protein corona that is formed on injected nanoparticles unless the surface of the letter is protected from protein adsorption.

            "text": "The mechanisms underlying mRNA release from the artificial lipid nanoparticles into the cytoplasm are not yet completely understood. It has been shown that LNPs are internalised via a process involving both clathrin-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis [57]. \n\nCurrently, there are approved mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 that deliver the mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein using LNP. These include the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (BioN-  1) interaction between the delivery system and the cell membrane, (2) endocytosis, (3) exit from the endosome and mRNA release to initiate translation. Endocytosis is a mechanism by which extracellular components and fragments of the plasma membrane internalize with the formation of the endocytic vesicle. This process involves vesicles with the internal pH of ~5 known as endosomes which develop from the early endosomes to the late endosomes before fusing with the intracellular organelles called lysosomes. In such a way, particles entering the cell via endocytosis are captured by the endosomes and eventually appear in the lysosomes, where active enzymatic degradation takes place [5,46]. Tech/Pfizer) vaccines [58]. The LNP composition of these vaccines is shown in Table 1. The structural formulas of the components included in the LNP are shown in Fig. 11. The candidate mRNA vaccines CVnCoV (CureVac) and ARCoV (Walvax), which are in the clinical trials, use LNPs of different composition for the delivery (Table 2) [59,60]. \n\nThe main issue in the mRNA delivery using lipid nanoparticles lies in the nature of the lipids [61]. In particular, positively charged lipid particles can bind to the negatively charged proteins and nucleic acids and adhere to the cell surface, which destabilises the plasma membrane and causes side effects in the vaccinated patients [62,63]. Lipid components can induce immune responses after systemic or local administration. For example, PEGylated lipids can stimulate the complement system.",

Whether the ionizable surface lipids drive the ''Protein adsorption/uptake\" has not yet been thoroughly investigated but they are likely involved in protein/apoE corona formation on the LNP surface. Note that many structural and biological properties of LNPs should be ascribed not to a single lipid component but rather a combination of lipids, as illustrated above. This is illustrated by all the LNP components that contribute to the structure/morphology of LNPs. The PEG-lipids dictate the LNP size, and thus, influence the ratio of the surface to core distribution of the remaining components, and thereby ultimately their packing motif. The light blue highlight illustrates that PEG-lipids containing a long lipid tail improve the in vivo stability of LNPs.

This welldocumented phenomenon, observed with all nano-objects, is a rapid process, leading to the formation of a protein corona at the surface of nanovectors, with a dynamic remodeling over time in blood [78][79][80][81]. Proteomics analyses performed on various NPs incubated with serum demonstrated that numerous plasma proteins (>100 different proteins and peptides) bind onto nano-vectors, including immunoglobulins, lipoproteins, complement, coagulation factors, and many others [78][79][80][81]93]. Authors have brought evidence that the protein corona formation and dynamics might depend on the physicochemical features of the nanovectors, including rigidity, hydrophilic, or hydrophobic surface, as well as charged or neutral zeta potential [93]. Proteins interact with NPs by different mechanisms, mainly electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen-bonding [93]. Lipoproteins, especially apolipoproteins E and A-I, are particularly enriched in NP's protein corona, most likely through direct interaction with lipids, in case of liposomes and lipid NPs [94,95], as well as the hydrophobic core of polymeric NPs [78][79][80][81]. Interestingly, reports have recently shown that proteins within the corona, including the ApoE, induce structural rearrangements that may impact their cell internalization and overall biodistribution in vivo [93]. \n\nIn order to reduce opsonization and scavenging by MPS, NPs have been optimized through the modulation of their size, shape [2], surface charge [96], and chemical structure [97][98][99], including the synthesis of amphiphilic copolymers with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) block.",

            "text": "Based on previous reports, we prepared LNPs with the following molar ratios: 50% of D-Lin-MC3 ionizable lipid, 10% helper lipid (DSPC or DOPE), 38.5% of sterol (cholesterol or \u03b2-sitosterol) and 1.5% PEGylated lipid at an N/P ratio of 6 [9,10,33]. Structures of lipids are presented in Figure S1. This resulted in testing three formulations: MC3/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG (referred as DSPC/Chol), MC3/DOPE/Cholesterol/PEG (referred as DOPE/Chol), and MC3/DOPE/\u03b2-sitosterol/PEG (referred as DOPE/\u03b2S). \u03b2S possesses an additional ethyl group at the C24 position. All formulations resulted in LNPs of 76-95 nm with a neutral zeta potential (Table 1). Complexation of mRNA was verified by gel electrophoresis, with no free mRNA detectable (Figure 1A). Interestingly, DSPC containing LNPs exhibited a lower polydispersity index (0.066 for MC3/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG vs. 0.16 for MC3/DOPE/Cholesterol/PEG and 0.13 for MC3/DOPE/\u03b2-sitosterol/PEG). These results indicate similarly low polydispersity for the three types of LNPs. We also monitored the size of LNPs after incubation with serum and at 37 \u2022 C by dynamic light scattering (Figure 1B). Proteins in serum could interact with the surface of LNPs and induce their aggregation. The three types of LNPs remained stable during incubation confirming the PEG-mediated stabilization of the nanoparticles in serum as previously reported [38,45,46]. The size of DOPE/\u03b2S LNPs moderately increased from 90 nm to 120 nm over 8 h.",

            "text": "The PEG shedding strategy used in recently developed LNP systems is based on PEG lipid desorption from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action. \n\nThe way the PEG coating is exploited for targeting/stability has varied over the years by either making it a more stable component of LNP systems to evade undesired immune responses while in systemic circulation, as in the case of intravenously administered LNPs, or by applying the PEG coating as a transient component which provides stability upon storage but sheds in vivo upon interaction with serum proteins, as is the case for intramuscularly administered LNPs. The shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown. \n\nAdditionally, there are other mechanisms that play a vital role in PEG lipid removal from nanoparticles. One such force is the cohesive interaction of PEG lipids within nanoparticles with other lipid components.",

The exact proteins assigned in these groups are listed in Table S1 provided in the supplementary information. \n\nThis classification highlighted patterns in the composition of the protein corona forming on the nanoparticles surface. The corona of unmodified SiNPs was enriched in coagulation factors: 60.28 \u00b5g/mg in serum and 76.07 \u00b5g/mg in plasma. However, it contained lower amounts of immunoglobulins (10.19 \u00b5g/mg in serum and 6.25 \u00b5g/mg in plasma) as well as albumin (8.51 \u00b5g/mg in serum and 5.59 \u00b5g/mg in plasma). AC particles had the highest amount of complement system proteins, binding 14.13 \u00b5g/mg in serum and 14.79 \u00b5g/mg in plasma. OD particles had the highest amount of albumin adsorbed 21.33 \u00b5g/mg in serum and 21.59 \u00b5g/mg in plasma.

            "text": "It is well known that nanomaterials can interact with various biomolecules of living organisms, primarily with proteins that are able to adsorb on the nanoparticles surface, forming the biomolecular corona [82]. About 300-500 human plasma proteins could be bound to different nanoparticles. Nanomaterials are rapidly coated by proteins in physiological fluids. The formation of the protein corona leads to the change in the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, including hydrodynamic size, surface charge, and aggregation [84]. The structure of protein corona depends primarily on the nanoparticle material, size and surface properties, as well as on the composition of protein environment and experimental/physiological conditions [84][85][86]. In addition, it contributes to the colloidal stability of the particle, that presents the aggregation of the nanoparticles and protective from aggressive environmental conditions [87,88]. Functionalization of silver nanoparticles surface significantly affects the formation dynamics of protein corona. The presence of a protein coating on the surface of the nanoparticles strongly reduces the binding degree to the protein. On the contrary, the formation of the corona on the uncoated nanoparticles improved significantly their stability in biological environment. The in vitro experiments showed that the physiological stability of AgNps caused by the corona formation may be directly associated with their binding to the cell, capture and toxicity [89]. The interaction between nanoparticles and different cells is determined by the composition of protein corona [90].",

            "text": "Once injected in a biological fluid, such as blood plasma, nanoparticles (NPs) are rapidly coated with a layer of proteins forming the so-called \"protein corona\" [57,58] in a dynamic process which does not reach the thermodynamic equilibrium [59]. The corona is typically composed of a \"hard\" portion formed by a thin inner layer of more closely bound proteins, and a \"soft\" outer layer with less tightly bound and fast exchanging proteins. Hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking can contribute in various degree to NP-protein interaction depending on the nature of both nanomaterials and protein media. The protein corona represents the new and dynamic NP interface with the external environment. Experimental studies investigating the nature and composition of the protein corona presented disparate outcomes, both because of the variety of NP and because of the different analytical methods used. A set of 125 plasma proteins has been found to associate with nanomaterials [60], and among these albumin, immunoglobulins, apolipoprotein A-I, and complement components have been frequently found in the nanomaterial corona [61]. If the proteins forming the corona undergo conformational changes with respect to their native structure, their functionality may be impaired, and their regular biological activity may be altered, causing abnormal interactions with other blood components [62]. Thus, the global NP-protein system is responsible for potential adverse events in the cardiovascular system, including thrombosis, complement and leukocyte activation, and hemolysis. Opsonization by complement components and immunoglobulins can, for example, cause the activation of the immune system and receptor-mediated phagocytosys, influencing the rapidity of clearance from the blood stream and/or the biodistribution in different target organs. The blood protein corona has also effects on NP dispersion/aggregation, as well as on circulation time, biodistribution and targeting efficiency of nanomedicines [63], and in some cases was hypothesized to contribute protecting RBC membrane from lysis [64]. Despite considerable challenges due to the shortage of adequate techniques and protocols for the analysis of the extremely complex nano(protein)",

            "text": "These delivery systems contribute to the in vivo behavior of vaccines in various ways: they protect vaccines from enzymatic degradation, improve their pharmacokinetic properties through surface engineering techniques such as PEGylation, enable active targeting to specific organs or cell types, and engineer controlled release of vaccines [93,98,99]. \n\nLipid nanoparticles, self-assembling protein nanoparticles, virus-like particles, liposomes, and cationic nanoemulsion vaccines have been designed against SARS-CoV-2 [100]. The most prominent vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs), which have been designed as drug nanocarriers for nucleic acid delivery [101]. By protecting fragile and unstable nucleic acids from degradation by nucleases, LNPs can increase the half-life of nucleic acids in the blood circulation. Charge-reversible LNPs contain ionizable lipids, either positively or negatively charged, that allow the LNPs to remain neutrally charged in the bloodstream, effective encapsulation of nucleic acids in the LNPs, and a high degree of endosomal escape of LNPs (Fig. 1) [102]. \n\nLNPs contain two other main components: cholesterol, a neutral phospholipid, and PEG-lipid, which protects LNPs from phagocytosis and aggregation in the blood circulation and also during manufacturing and storage. In vaccine formulations, the PEG-lipid also ensures that the LNP maintains the desired diameter (200 nm) [103]. A factor that is crucial to efficient nucleic acid delivery is the complete escape of nucleic acids from the endosomal compartment after LNP internalization. By increasing the diffusibility of PEG-lipids, the addition of distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) lipids to nanoparticles enhances endosomal escape [104].",

Because surfactant lipids are obviously highly relevant to bio-nano interactions in the lungs, we therefore suggest an expansion of the protein corona theory to include lipids as another essential factor influencing the pulmonary corona. Its detailed characterization is an indispensable issue to address in future investigations. We believe that these findings are of general importance with respect to pulmonary drug delivery and inhalation toxicology. On the one hand, such assimilation might question the hitherto pursued targeting strategies using nanoparticles because surface-ligands meant for cellular recognition could be masked by pulmonary surfactant components and therefore inactivated. On the other hand, the interplay of the surfactant proteins and lipids as a trigger for AM clearance creates a highly effective biological barrier, protecting the human body against potential noxious effects from any kind of inhaled nanomaterials or pathogens.",

            "text": "Opsonization remains one of the most commonly discussed biological obstacles known to impact the translation of nanoparticles from animal models to the clinical setting [17]. The dynamic process of binding and exchange of plasma proteins associated with the nanomaterial surface has been demonstrated to play a key role in the clinical translation of materials. It has been shown that some protein modifications produce improved cellular uptake at the tumor site [18], whereas others induce immune responses leading to clearance via the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) [15]. Several opsonin components have been identified, including complement proteins [15], apolipoproteins [10], and various metabolites [19], with the adsorption of specific constituents or ratios being responsible for stealth effects (or lack thereof) in PEG-based materials [10]. The combination of nanoparticle-protein [20] and protein-protein [21] interactions leads to a vast array of different protein corona composition. Numerous physicochemical factors have been shown to contribute to the accumulation and subsequent composition of the protein corona including chemical composition [22], size [23], curvature [22], rigidity [24], hydrophobicity [22], presence of protein targeting ligands [25], and surface characteristics [10,11,26]. These factors contribute to the unpredictable outcome of interactions between nanoparticles and physiological phenomena, with enhanced variability also arising due to flow rate encountered in different parts of the animal [27], enzymatic modifications [12], glycosylation state [28], as well as localized plasma protein concentration [27] and content [12] within anatomical regions. While the interaction with blood proteins has been profiled for certain kinds of materials (e.g., gold nanoparticles [29] and liposomes [30]), proteomic fingerprinting has not been done for polymeric nanomedicines (at least under conditions that match those present within the blood stream of an animal). This is due to difficulty in extracting intact complexes and the fragility of the soft corona [14].",

            "text": "This mechanism is similar to enhanced permeability and retention [24,25,26] . \n\nIn 2007, Dawson and Linse jointly proposed the concept of a protein corona, which led researchers to study the fate of nanoparticles in vivo [27] . Nanoparticles will rapidly adsorb proteins forming what is known as the protein \"corona\" after enters the circulation system. The structure and composition of the protein corona depends on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial, this would in uence the biological identity of nanoparticles [28] . The physiological functions of various proteins that comprise the protein corona generally involve lipid transport, coagulation, complement activation, pathogen recognition, or ion transport [29] . Understanding nanoparticle-protein interactions is a crucial issue in the development of targeted nanomaterial delivery in vivo [30] . The physiological environment to which nanoparticles are rst exposed after intravenous administration is the blood stream, and the cell-free portion of the blood (plasma) contains more than 1000 proteins. These proteins potentially interact with nanoparticles to exert different physiological functions, such as recognition by macrophages, causing in ammatory reactions, thrombosis and allergic reactions [31] . \n\nThe safety issues of biomaterials with exceptional biocompatibility and hemo-compatibility have also received extensive attention at the nanoscale. Numerous nanomaterials have been widely used as drug delivery systems and diagnostic contrast agents in treating cardiovascular diseases. This article focuses on polymer nanoparticles and explores their bioactivity impact on the development of AS and physiochemical mechanisms. Therefore, we conducted a study of the effects of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, which are widely used in a variety of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapeutic devices, on the development of aortic atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been successful in delivering nucleic acids like siRNA and mRNA, but face challenges in protein delivery due to limited protein encapsulation and endosome escape. In this study, a family of LNPs is developed with robust high efficiency in addressing the multiple barriers in cytosolic protein delivery by incorporating clinically approved ionizable lipids into traditional cationic LNPs. The combination of cationic and ionizable lipids enables efficient protein binding and endosomal escape. Optimized LNPs efficiently deliver various proteins, including antibodies, enzymes, toxins, and Cas9 into living cells with reserved functions. Moreover, the designed LNPs show high serum stability during protein delivery, and the serum albumin adsorbed on LNPs facilitates protein delivery via albumin receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis, enabling highly efficient protein delivery in vivo. The optimized LNPs successfully deliver therapeutic proteins such as saporin and interleukin\u201010 (IL\u201010) to inhibit tumor growth in several animal models. The IL\u201010 loaded LNPs enhanced the proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells and improved the antitumor effect of adoptive transferred OT\u20101 CD8+ T cells to melanoma. This study expands the applications of LNPs for the delivery of biomacromolecules, and the developed LNP formulations have enormous potential for the delivery of protein therapeutics to treat various diseases.",

            "text": "We initially determined that PLGA nanoparticles enter the body as foreign objects, triggering an in ammatory response in ApoE \u2212/\u2212 mice. These nanoparticles were then engulfed by macrophages, migrated to sites of in ammation and eventually aggravated the formation of plaque. \n\nDuring the injection process, nanoparticles are rapidly coated with macromolecules forming a \"protein crown or corona (PC)\", which alters the size, aggregation state, surface charge and interfacial properties of the nanomaterials to create a biological identity that is distinct from its original synthetic identity. PLGA nanoparticles adsorbed a certain amount of proteins to form the PLGA + PC, with larger diameter and less stability, after incubation with mouse serum. Nanoparticles with protein coronas show completely different cell recognition or biological effects in vitro compared with in vivo [30] . \n\nMacrophages are the most important in ammatory cells in the process of AS lesion formation, are important components of lipid plaques, and serve as an important source of foam cells [40] . Therefore, we studied the effects of PLGA nanoparticles on macrophages in vitro. According to the MTS assay results, the activity of Raw 264.7 cells decreased with increasing concentrations of PLGA nanoparticles and PLGA + PC. The presence of the protein corona inhibited the phagocytosis of PLGA nanoparticles by Raw 264.7 cells. Studies have shown that the role of the protein corona in biological systems can be divided into \"opsonins\" and \"dysopsonins\" [41] . Opsonins promote macrophage phagocytosis, while dysopsonins inhibit phagocytosis. The structure and composition of the corona depend on the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial, which includes the chemistry, topography and curvature of the nanomaterial. Polymer nanoparticles possess various chemical compositions, free residues and morphologies (such as spheres, rods, vesicles, tubules and lamellae), which provide them with more diverse synthetic identities. After PLGA nanoparticles enter the blood stream, the surface-adsorbed dysopsonins may be more abundant and more stable.",

            "text": "After entering the biological system, nanoparticles interact with the biomolecules in the body and will give rise to a layer called the \"corona\". This happens within seconds of nanoparticle exposure by a process called the Vroman effect. This layer consists of many biomolecules with increased adsorption and enhanced properties compared to those in the normal biological environment. Thus, this has a high impact on the ultimate performance of these nanoparticles. The liquid profile and protein composition of this corona layer have been extensively studied with respect to various works. According to the adsorption rate of proteins to their surface, the corona can be classified into two main categories: a hard corona and a soft corona. High affinity proteins tightly and directly associated with nanoparticles will form a hard corona, and low affinity proteins loosely and indirectly associated with nanoparticles will form a soft corona. While taking this into consideration, a hard corona is more convenient in terms of nanotechnology. The structure and composition of the corona layer can be studied by various techniques, such as DLS, SEC, DCS, TEM, PAGE, LC-MS/MS, DC, SPR, ITC, etc. Parameters like the number of bonds, thermodynamic feasibility of interaction, rearrangements of molecules, temperature, conformational changes, solvation, influence of other proteins, etc., determine the nanomaterial\u2212 protein adsorption effect. 11 Generally, there are 3 steps in the protein adsorption to nanoparticles, especially for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) (Figure :2): \n\n\u2022 Region 1: characterized by protein\u2212NP surface interaction only with original protein conformation. \n\n\u2022 Region 2: characterized by protein\u2212protein interactions and protein\u2212NP interactions with changes in its structural conformations. \n\n\u2022 Region 3: characterized by protein\u2212protein interactions only, along with structural alterations and protein multilayer formation. \n\nThe composition of the corona is formed by different types of plasma proteins, viz., immunoglobulins, tissue leakage proteins, complement factors, coagulants, lipoproteins, and other serum components. They are collectively called \"adsorbomes\" after the adsorption mechanism.",

The composition of the corona has a strong influence on the surface properties of the nanoparticles. It can affect their cellular interactions, uptake and signaling properties. For this reason, protein coronae are investigated frequently as an important part of particle characterization. Main body of the abstract: The protein corona can be analyzed by different methods, which have their individual advantages and challenges. The separation techniques to isolate corona-bound particles from the surrounding matrices include centrifugation, magnetism and chromatographic methods. Different organic matrices, such as blood, blood serum, plasma or different complex protein mixtures, are used and the approaches vary in parameters such as time, concentration and temperature. Depending on the investigated particle type, the choice of separation method can be crucial for the subsequent results. In addition, it is important to include suitable controls to avoid misinterpretation and false-positive or false-negative results, thus allowing the achievement of a valuable protein corona analysis result. Conclusion: Protein corona studies are an important part of particle characterization in biological matrices. This review gives a comparative overview about separation techniques, experimental parameters and challenges which occur during the investigation of the protein coronae of different particle types.",

There is an increasing number of reports summarizing large data sets of all identified corona proteins. However, to date our knowledge about the multiple mechanisms mediating interactions between proteins and nanocarriers is still limited. In this study, we investigate the influence of protein structure on the adsorption process and focus on the effect of heat inactivation of serum and plasma, which is a common cell culture procedure used to inactivate the complement system. As in general routine lab procedure, heat inactivation was performed at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min in order to denature heat labile proteins. When nanocarriers were exposed to native versus heat inactivated serum, we saw that the cellular uptake by macrophages was significantly affected. These results were then correlated with an altered corona composition that depended on the treatment of the protein source. In summary, we were able to prove that the protein structure is one of the key parameters determining protein corona formation.",

            "text": "Different surface charges result in the distinction of serum proteins adsorbed to LNPs, which determines the subsequent organspecific distribution of LNPs 49 . Specifically, positively charged LNPs predominantly accumulate in the lungs of mice, while near-neutral LNPs present a liver accumulation. Therefore, the manipulation of surface charge by LNP formulation emerges as a feasible way to achieve the organ-selective delivery of LNPs. The systematic-selective lipid nanoparticle (Liver-LNPs) system is a classic four-component formulation that consists of cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-choline (DSPC), poly(ethylene glycol) lipids (PEG-lipid), and ionizable lipids (Fig. 3b). The ionizable lipid can be converted into its quaternary ammonium salt form via a simple and effective reaction with methyl iodide to afford a cationic targeting lipid (Fig. 3a). By adding the additional permanently cationic targeting lipid and replacing DSPC with 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) in the Liver-LNP formulation (Fig. 3b), we successfully obtained lung-selective LNPs (Lung-LNPs), which were capable of precisely delivering mRNA to the lungs. mRNA-loaded LNPs were formed by mixing an aqueous buffer solution containing mRNA and a lipid ethanol solution at the aqueousto-ethanol ratio of 3/1, v/v. Firefly luciferase mRNA (mRNA Luci ) was encapsulated by the two organ-selective LNPs, giving Liver-LNPs@mRNA Luci and Lung-LNPs@mRNA Luci . Both the obtained Liver-LNPs@mRNA Luci and Lung-LNPs@mRNA Luci were uniformly spherical assemblies with a diameter of ~60-100 nm according to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c).",

            "text": "Therefore, an enormous effort is put in investigating the processes mediating nanoparticle interaction with body fluids and cells. Various literature describes that after intravenous injection nanoparticles rapidly interact with diverse blood components like immunoglobulins, bloodclotting factors, and complement proteins, forming a socalled protein corona [27,[55][56][57][58][59][60][61]. The so built corona can be subdivided in a hard corona formed by proteins with strong binding affinity to the nanoparticles' surface like immunoglobulins and apolipoproteins and the soft corona, which builds the outer layer of the corona, and is dominated by weakly bound proteins for example albumin [59,60,62,63]. The whole process is also referred to as opsonization that only then enables recognition by and interaction with phagocytic cells [26,27,55,64]. Probably this is exactly what happened to the nanoparticles used in this study and explains the rapid accumulation in liver and spleen. However, the significantly higher uptake of the nanoparticles at the magnetic implant is a clear proof-of-concept, and with a much longer circulation time one can assume a further increasing accumulation. \n\nBy implementing a range of methods like size-exclusion chromatography gel filtration, isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance studies, Cedervall et al. gained a deeper understanding of the nanoparticle protein interaction [65]. They found that protein adsorption is strongly dependent on the particle surface characteristics and size but on protein identity as well. Especially, surface hydrophobicity plays a major role [65]. A more recent study investigated the protein adsorption on different types of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) using 10% and 100% fetal calf serum (FCS) focusing on the hard corona [66]. The most important finding of this study was that surface functionality, particle type, pore size, surface roughness and incubation time had a lesser influence on the extent of protein adsorption to the particles than the serum concentration.",

            "text": "It is now well accepted that foreign surfaces are modified by the adsorption of biomolecules such as proteins or lipids in a biological environment, and that cellular responses to materials in a biological medium might reflect the adsorbed biomolecule layer, rather than the material itself [26]. Recently, the concept of the NP-protein corona has been introduced to describe the proteins in association with NPs in biological fluids [27][28][29][30]. The composition of NP corona is flexible and is determined by many affinity constants and concentrations of the components of the blood plasma. One can speculate that in many practically relevant situations, the protein corona is the surface that is exposed to the cell membrane and is the entity the cell protective mechanisms have to deal with. Thus, for most cases it is more likely that the biologically relevant unit is not the particle, but a nanoobject of specified size, shape, and protein corona structure. Naked particle surfaces will have a much greater (non-specific) affinity for the cell surface than a particle hiding behind a corona of \"bystander\" proteins -that is proteins for which no suitable cellular recognition machinery exists. The evidence suggests that, in comparison to typical cell-membrane-biology event timescales the particle corona is likely to be a defining property of the particle in its interactions with the cell surface, whether it activates cellular machinery or not. Similar observations and outcomes exist for particles inside the cell, in key locations, though we cannot discuss details here [27][28][29][30]. We assume that the actual content of the corona is determined by (i) the NP exposure to the protein solution (blood plasma), (ii) a competition between the adsorbed proteins and the glycoproteins/membrane lipids. We will model the protein and lipid interaction with the NP surface at the CG united-atom level for selected set of proteins and lipids (see Table I). These simulations will provide interaction energies and will be used to predict the kinetics of protein/lipid corona formation.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles typically refer to tiny particles ranging from 1 to 100 nm, with their larger surface area and nanoscale size endowing them with unique physicochemical properties [73]. These nanoparticles can consist of single substances such as titanium dioxide, silver nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, iron oxides, or complexes such as polymer-drug complexes, and nucleic acid-nanoparticle complexes, among others [74][75][76][77]. When nanoparticles enter living organisms, they first come into contact with biological fluids (e.g., blood, tissue fluids, etc.). Various components in biofluids, such as proteins, lipids, sugars, etc., quickly adsorb to the surface of the nanoparticles, forming the so-called \"protein corona\". The composition and structure of the protein corona depend on the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, hydrophilicity, etc.) and the environment of the biofluid (e.g., protein concentration, pH, ionic strength, etc.) [78,79]. For example, gold nanoparticles are smaller in size but have a relatively large specific surface area, which can provide more binding sites for proteins and make it easier to adsorb some low-molecular-weight proteins, such as albumin and transferrin [80]. Polymer nanoparticles with a diameter of several hundred nanometers may bind more to macromolecular proteins such as immunoglobulins [81]. The formation of protein corona will change the surface properties of nanoparticles and affect their subsequent interactions with biological systems, such as biorecognition, immune response, and cellular uptake of",

            "text": "It is nowadays accepted that IONPs adsorb a plethora of ions and biological molecules (i.e., lipids, sugars, proteins) when they come into contact with biological fluids such as blood [94]. This biomolecular corona ultimately affects the interaction of non-functionalized IONPs with biological systems, a property known as \"biological identity\". The biomolecular corona must be taken into account when considering the intrinsic biological effects that IONPs can produce. Indeed, Escamilla-Rivera et al. found that PEG-coated IONPs absorb a wide variety of complement recognition proteins when incubated with human serum, leading to complement activation when injected in mice [95]. Similarly, Zhu et al. demonstrated that the addition of IONPs to the hyaluronic acid (HA) scaffold enhances osteogenesis in vivo, most likely mediated by a dynamic formation of a protein corona enriched in complement-, wound healing-, and inflammatory-related factors [96]. These reports thus suggest that the protein corona can endow IONPs with immunomodulating features. However, the biomolecule corona largely depends on the surface coating of the metallic core of IONPs as demonstrated by Vogt et al. These authors found that silica-coated and dextran-coated IONPs adsorb a distinctive subset of serum proteins, which leads to a differential effect on primary human macrophages [97]. Furthermore, the inherent dynamic nature of the protein corona, more specifically the so-called soft corona that exhibits a high exchange rate, can affect the biological identity of IONPs. Ashby et al. reported that a highly hydrophobic surface coating promoted the deposition of human serum proteins having larger hydrophobic domains and a much faster exchange rate, and thus a more dynamic protein corona. A similar correlation was found between larger core diameters and protein corona dynamics [98]. Nanoparticle size also seems to correlate inversely with the protein corona, not only in terms of composition but also in protein amount, due to a curvature effect [99]. Nonetheless, Ashby et al. evidenced for the first time that a soft corona is much less influential in IONP endocytosis than a hard corona [98].",

Ten microliters of stock TNS was added to the LNP solutions and mixed well in a black 96-well plate. Fluorescence intensity was monitored in a Tecan Pro200 plate reader using excitation and emission wavelengths of 321 and 445 nm. With the resulting fluorescence values, a sigmoidal plot of fluorescence versus buffer pH was created. The log of the inflection point of this curve was the apparent pKa of the LNP formulation. \n\nIsolation of protein corona. All experiments were conducted four times to ensure reproducibility. LNP suspensions were incubated with an equal amount of mouse serum for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C (total volume of 350 \u03bcL). The serum coated LNPs were separated from free serum proteins by gel permeation chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B (Sigma) using phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) as the eluent. To confirm the separation of LNP and serum, mouse serum was labeled with Alexa Fluor Tm 488 protein labeling kit (Invitrogen, Inc.) and purified according to manufacturer's instructions. LNPs were labeled with Rhodamine-PE. The separation of LNPs (with corona) and proteins was analyzed by measuring fluorescence intensities in different flow fractionations (Fig. S6). Fractions containing LNPs (with protein corona) were merged and lyophilized for 2 days. Finally, the lyophilized powders were dissolved in cold acetone to remove lipid content and denatured with 8 M urea at 65 \u00b0C for 15 min, and processed for SDSPAGE gel or proteomic assays. \n\nProteomic assay.",

            "text": "In the last few years, the adsorption of a wider range of biomolecules on the surface of NPs has been studied. By coupling chromatographic methods and mass spectrometry, nanomaterials have been shown to adsorb small molecules such as lipids (Gunnarsson et al., 2018;La Barbera et al., 2020;Lee et al., 2018;Lima et al., 2020), amino acids (Pink et al., 2018) and oligonucleotides (Vidaurre-Agut et al., 2021), with lipids being nowadays the most investigated. In a recent study, Chetwynd et al. demonstrated that, similarly to PC, the corona of metabolites can vary significantly between silica, TiO 2 , and polystyrene NPs, indicating a possible role of surface chemistry of materials on their interactions with small molecules (Chetwynd et al., 2020). Although the metabolite corona has been so far mainly analyzed from a qualitative and quantitative point of view, initial investigations by Emer et al. suggest that even in the absence of proteins, surface charge, colloidal stability, and antibacterial properties of silica NPs were altered in the presence of nutrients-rich cell media (Emer & Cardoso, 2017). It is reasonable to expect that a metabolite corona may affect physical-chemical properties of several other nanomaterials, thus prompting for more future characterization of this phenomenon. Another exciting and recent evolution in the field of PC, is the interaction between the protein and the metabolite coronae to form the biomolecular corona. Recent work from Lima et al. strongly suggests that the adsorption of lipids on polystyrene NPs may be mediated by their interaction with apolipoproteins located on the surface of lipid vesicles (HDL) responsible for lipids transport through the body (Lima et al., 2020). This work indicates that protein and metabolite coronae are able to influence each other and that integrated analysis of the different components of the biomolecular corona may be pivotal to gain a better and broad understanding of the PC.",

            "text": "Just as nanoparticle properties must be studied in relation to clotting, we must also investigate how changes in blood itself might affect nanoparticle-associated clotting.While these studies were done in mice, we must now assay for nanoparticle-associated clotting in human blood, as well as the large animals commonly used in preclinical efficacy and toxicity studies (pig, sheep, and non-human primates), noting that small animal models often do not capture fatal embolic side effects that emerge in larger animals and humans.We should also investigate how various disease states and medications that affect the blood might predispose or protect from nanoparticle-associated clotting.Here we showed that pre-existing inflammation worsens the magnitude of LNP-induced lung injury, but more in-depth mechanistic studies are required, as well as testing in other relevant disease states, such as common procoagulant genotypes (Factor V Leiden, Proteins C & S deficiency), cancers with clotting predispositions (noting that clotting is associated with metastasis), and other inflammatory diseases.Indeed, fibrinogen is an \"acutephase reactant,\" meaning that its concentration in plasma goes up dramatically during inflammation (and many cancers), thus making it more likely to bind to LNPs.These studies in different disease states are essential, because many of the proposed applications of LNPs are for cancer and inflammatory diseases, and thus nanoparticle-induced clotting could become more prominent and dangerous, perhaps occurring even for smaller LNPs or LNPs without positively charged lipids.\n\nFinally, more mechanistic studies are needed to further understand nanoparticle-induced clotting.Here we showed that fibrinogen binds to positively charged LNPs, and that this binding leads to downstream thrombosis steps (Fig. 4).We hypothesize that fibrinogen binding to LNPs changes its conformation to resemble its activated form.Such surface-bound fibrinogen/fibrin is known to bind to GPIIB/IIIA on platelets, immobilizing and leading to activation of the platelets.",

It was demonstrated that natural cholesterol analogs enhance the endosomal escape of LNPs, while the presence of natural structural lipids on nanoparticle surfaces forms a corona when dispersed in biological fluids. [187] mRNA delivery to T cells was studied by creating a vast library of LNPs. Structural analogs of immune-cell targeted ionizable lipid materials were synthesized via Michael addition chemistry. Alkyl chains terminated with epoxide groups were reacted with polyamine cores of varying lengths. Using microfluidic chips, a combination of 24 ionizable lipids, cholesterol, helper lipids, and PEG-lipids were used to encapsulate mRNA and form LNP complexes ranging from 51 to 97 nm. Screening of the process detected improved mRNA delivery for seven LNP formulations, compared to commercially available lipofectamine. No significant correlation was observed among LNP size, concentration of the genetic molecules, or the pKa of ionizable lipid with the enhanced delivery of the cargo. Furthermore, LNPs containing purified saturated ionizable lipids improved mRNA delivery over that of crude lipid formulations. [188] LNPs were also used to deliver mRNA for hemophilia treatment. In this investigation, lipid components consisting of ionizable lipid distearoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid were mixed with synthesized mRNAs to synthesize mRNA LNPs. LNP complexes of sizes smaller than 100 nm, more than 80% RNA encapsulation efficiency, and less than 10 endotoxin units were obtained. Thanks to a bioluminescence signal in the liver and a weak or absence of signal in the spleen or other organs, it was suggested that LNPs efficiently delivered mRNA to the liver. Repeated injections of LNPs, however, induced the inhibitor formation of short-lived factors. [189] In the case of long-term storage of LNPs carriers, specifically COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, little is known about the physical stability of lipid nanoparticles. Zhao et al. set out to perform a systematic study of various conditions, such as temperature and physical state",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used as carriers to deliver mRNAs [27,108,109]. The first conducted clinical trial of mRNA vaccines is LNP-delivered. LNPs are mature negatively-charged nucleic acid delivery platforms characterized as ionizable amino lipids, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids and cholesterol. The essential ionizable amino lipids facilitate mRNA to escape from the endosome by interacting with ionizable amino lipids and the endosomal membrane [110]. Polyethylene glycol is another essential component to prolong LNP circulation time because it spatially hinders the binding of mRNA and plasma proteins, which accelerates the clearance by reticuloendothelial (ER). Phospholipids and cholesterol can stably integrate the LNP structure [111]. To be specific, LNPs have two advantages as an mRNA vaccine vector. On the one hand, LNPs defend mRNA from degradation by enzymes from the endosome [112]. The characteristic guarantees high encapsulation efficiency [113]. On the other hand, LNPs have good biocompatibility through a series of biological processes to deliver mRNAs for expression. The first process involves the apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) pathway. This endogenous pathway is a targeting foundation for efficient delivery [113]. Then, the TLR4-mediated endocytosis takes up LNPs, forming a vesicle to fuse with endosomes [114]. After escaping endosomes, LNPs release mRNA into the cytoplasm to synthesize vaccine antigens.\n\nThe delivery efficacy of LNPs relies on multiple lipid components and lipid-related modifications. Foremost, the primary substance is cationic or ionizable lipids. Various cationic or ionizable lipids are used to deliver RNA, such as N- [118] and N 1 ,N 3 ,N 5 -tris(3-(didodecylamino)propyl)benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (TT3) [119]. These",

            "text": "In Massaro et al. (2023), nanoparticle size was 34 nm; in another study (Zhang et al., 2020), where the particles were also effectively targeted, their size was ~150 nm. Thus, several different compositions of four-component particles based on the MC3 lipid and helper lipid DOPE or DPPC have turned out to be targetable to lungs when administered intratracheally (Zhang et al., 2020). It should be pointed out that in both studies on delivery to lungs (Massaro et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2020), the proportion of a helper lipid (15-20 mol%) was higher as compared to standard (10 mol%) systems of LNPs, possibly indicating the necessity of increasing the helper lipid content for delivery to lungs. \n\nThe route of administration also has a significant impact on kinetics of nanoparticle distribution. In Pardi et al. (2015), effects of various administration routes were studied toward the pharmacokinetics of four-component LNPs based on new ionizable lipid L319. After subcutaneous or intradermal administration of mRNA with LNPs, reporter protein expression was observed at the injection site, whereas after intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or intravenous (retro-orbital) administration, at the injection site and in the liver. Upon intratracheal administration, the expression was noted in the lungs and liver. In that paper, intradermal administration caused the most prolonged reporter protein expression: 9 days. In all likelihood, this outcome is due to longer retention of LNPs in the dermis. There are reports of other patterns for nanoparticle distribution. For instance, in Huysmans et al. (2019), it was demonstrated that when administered subcutaneously, LNPs remain at the injection site, with partial migration to a draining lymph node after 24 h. Moreover, additional use of electroporation immediately after the subcutaneous administration of LNPs enhanced the expression of the reporter protein by two orders of magnitude (Huysmans et al., 2019).",

            "text": "The most established form of nanodelivery agents are lipidbased (Langer and Folkman, 1976;Adams et al., 2017). Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) have been approved by the FDA for delivery of siRNA to the liver and for mRNA vaccine delivery (Paunovska et al., 2022). LNPs are based on structures that can be formed by phospholipids in aqueous solutions, such as micelles and liposomes (Paunovska et al., 2022). Traditional LNPs contain multiple lipids, including cationic lipids, amphipathic phospholipids, and poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG), as well as cholesterol (Semple et al., 2010;Cheng et al., 2015;Paunovska et al., 2022). Variations of these components can be used to direct LNP uptake to specific vascular beds (Paunovska et al., 2018). LNPs can be used to deliver a range of RNA payloads from siRNA to mRNA (Musunuru et al., 2021;Rothgangl et al., 2021). Because systemic delivery of RNA often leads to accumulation in the liver (Li et al., 2020), various strategies have been developed to target other organs, including the lung. One strategy has been to covalently conjugate an antibody that binds plasmalemma vesicleassociated protein (PV1) to LNPs. This strategy can increase the protein expression of mRNA delivered via these antibodyconjugated LNPs by 40-fold in the lung (Li et al., 2020). Nanoparticle size is an important factor in lung localization, with 160 nm conjugated LNPs leading to greater protein expression in the lungs compared to smaller 70 nm particles (Anselmo et al., 2015;Li et al., 2020).",

However, incubation of NF55-SCO nanoparticles in murine serum for 60 min resulted in a significantly higher amount of C3 proteins in the corona compared to SCO alone. That may be caused by higher hydrophobicity of NF55 [81] or its complexes with SCO compared to PF14, and higher absorption of proteins, including C3, [87] on hydrophobic NPs [88]. In case of murine plasma, however, no significant differences were observed between any nanoparticles tested and the amount of C3 proteins adsorbed to nanoparticles was rather equal (Figure 4c  or SCO alone were bound to streptavidin on superparamagnetic beads or beads were left untreated (control) before incubation with murine serum (a,b) or murine plasma (c,d) for 5 or 60 min at room temperature. After pull-down, bound C3 and its fragments were quantified by Western blot.

Here we show that in bloodstream, CPP-NA nanoparticles acquire a novel nano-biomolecular interface and recruit into protein corona anti-opsonising proteins like serum albumin, clusterin and apolipoproteins at a higher extent compared to only nucleic acids-containing particles. Moreover, CPPs reduce inclusion of C3 protein in protein corona on pDNA particles and thereby might prolong circulation of respective nanoparticles in organism before elimination (Figure 3c,d) [83,84].",

            "text": "Abstract Nanomaterials offer promising solutions as drug delivery systems and imaging agents in response to the demand for better therapeutics and diagnostics. However, the limited understanding of the interaction between nanoparticles and biological entities is currently hampering the development of new systems and their applications in clinical settings. Proteins and lipids in biological fluids are known to complex with nanoparticles to form a \u201cbiomolecular corona\u201d. This has been shown to affect particles' morphology and behavior in biological systems and their interactions with cells. Hence, understanding how nanomaterials' physicochemical properties affect the formation and composition of this biocorona is a crucial step. This work evaluates existing literature on how morphology (size and shape), and surface chemistry (charge and hydrophobicity) of nanoparticles influence the formation of protein corona. The latest evidence suggest that although surface charge promotes the interaction with proteins and lipids, surface chemistry plays a leading role in determining the affinity of the nanoparticle for biomolecules and, ultimately, the composition of the corona. More recently the study of additional nanoparticles' properties like shape and surface chirality have demonstrated a significant effect on protein corona architecture, providing new tools to tailor biomolecular corona formation.

            "text": "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

            "text": "The colloidal stability of mRNA-LNPs is another critical factor that should be monitored carefully to ensure efficacy of the administered formulation. It is well-known that mRNA nanoparticles may interact with the different bodily biological fluids. This interaction may result in adsorption of biomolecules or endogenous proteins to the surface of the nanoparticles, which leads to formation of a complex known as a bimolecular or protein corona [90]. The formation of a nanoparticle-corona complex may decrease the colloidal stability of mRNA-LNPs and lead to particle aggregation and earlier release of the mRNA load [91,92]. Therefore, characterization of LNPs should be carried out in undiluted biological fluids to determine their stability, size, and mRNA encapsulation efficiency. In this context, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy can be used to determine the degree of complexation of mRNA, while the technique of fluorescence single-particle tracking can be adopted for measuring the LNPs' size and their extent of aggregation [91,92]. \n\nModifications of the helper lipid composition of LNPs may also contribute to their stability in serum. For example, incorporation of cholesterol was reported to reduce the permeability and increase the rigidity of the lipid membrane and, therefore, helps to preserve the integrity of LNPs when present in serum [93]. In addition, inclusion of PEGylated lipids in the LNP composition may provide a stealth effect and improve the colloidal stability by reducing the capability of adsorption to plasma protein, thereby avoiding aggregation in the bloodstream. However, LNPs containing PEGylated lipids were reported to exhibit low cellular uptake and transfection [94]. Therefore, careful selection of PEGylated lipids is important in this case. Conventional PEG lipids, such as distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG2000, are known to remain firmly linked to LNPs and prohibit the release of the nucleic acid.",

            "text": "Alternatively, LNPs have demonstrated higher encapsulation efficiencies than liposomes. Moreover, cationic, ionizable and fusogenic lipid components can destabilize endosomal membranes and aid protein release into the cytosol. However, successful encapsulation of proteins within LNPs does require optimization. Firstly, for high loading efficiency, the protein cargo must be co-engineered along with the LNP constituents to promote encapsulation. In addition, cationic lipids commonly used in protein LNP formulations such as DOTAP, DOTMA, or DOSPA have documented cytotoxic effects in vivo via generation of reactive oxygen species [239]. To limit LNPassociated toxicities, clinically used protein LNPs should incorporate a higher proportion of ionizable lipids relative to cationic lipids. Methods to generate vast ionizable lipid libraries with distinct branching, saturation, and charge features are readily available [162,163,165]. However, synthesis and screening of these lipids for protein delivery remain time-consuming. Additional work is needed to establish the structure-function relationships governing efficient and stable encapsulation of protein cargo within LNPs. \n\nPopular inorganic nanoparticles such as AuNPs [240] and SiNPs [241] are easily synthesized via well-established bulk methods. However, protein adsorption might cause cargo unfolding and functional loss. In addition, if the protein-nanoparticle interaction is weak, reliance on surface adsorption could risk premature cargo release in circulation. Furthermore, in many inorganic nanoparticle formulations, surface-bound proteins are exposed to the serum and are more susceptible to enzymatic degradation compared to encapsulated proteins. These materials may also exhibit poor biodegradability leading to protracted elimination. This has been shown to be the case for AuNPs [242]. \n\nVLPs have emerged as an exciting biological nanocarrier for protein delivery. They are able to mimic the natural ability of viral vectors to infect host cells without inducing permanent genetic changes. However, several factors for successful VLP production and deployment should be considered.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as potent carriers for mRNA delivery, but several challenges remain before this approach can offer broad clinical translation of mRNA therapeutics. To improve their efficacy, a better understanding is required regarding how LNPs are trapped and processed at the anionic endosomal membrane prior to mRNA release. We used surface-sensitive fluorescence microscopy with single LNP resolution to investigate the pH dependency of the binding kinetics of ionizable lipid-containing LNPs to a supported endosomal model membrane. A sharp increase of LNP binding was observed when the pH was lowered from 6 to 5, accompanied by stepwise large-scale LNP disintegration. For LNPs preincubated in serum, protein corona formation shifted the onset of LNP binding and subsequent disintegration to lower pH, an effect that was less pronounced for lipoprotein-depleted serum. The LNP binding to the endosomal membrane mimic was observed to eventually become severely limited by suppression of the driving force for the formation of multivalent bonds during LNP attachment or, more specifically, by charge neutralization of anionic lipids in the model membrane due to their association with cationic lipids from earlier attached LNPs upon their disintegration. Cell uptake experiments demonstrated marginal differences in LNP uptake in untreated and lipoprotein-depleted serum, whereas lipoprotein-depleted serum increased mRNA-controlled protein (eGFP) production substantially. This complies with model membrane data and suggests that protein corona formation on the surface of the LNPs influences the nature of the interaction between LNPs and endosomal membranes.",

            "text": "The final LNP component, the PEG-lipid, is engineered to perform two specific functions. First, PEG-lipids incorporate into the emerging nanoparticle during LNP formation. As LNP systems do not contain an aqueous core, PEG-lipids reside almost exclusively on the LNP surface, and their concentrations control particle size [146]. Both the PEG molecular weight as well as the molar percentage of PEG-lipid affect the characteristics of lipid-based particles [147][148][149]. Specifically, as the PEG-lipid is increased from 0.25 mol% to 5 mol%, a reduction in LNP size is observed from~120 nm to 25 nm, but further increases to PEG-content do not modify particle size [24,147]. Second, they improve the shelf-stability by creating a steric barrier that extends away from the surface of the LNP, thereby preventing particle aggregation and improving in vivo circulation lifetimes. However, for transfection purposes, PEG-lipids have an established inhibitory effect [150,151]. Based on the hypothesized mechanism of LNP function, the nanoparticle requires an intricate balance between stability in storage and circulation, and instability within the cell to support intracellular delivery [152]. Diffusible PEG-lipids helped stabilize particles while enabling intracellular delivery [25,151]. These lipids are composed of acyl chains that are 14-carbons in length and can dissociate rapidly from the LNP in the circulation [153]. Two hours post administration, only 20% of the injected PEG-lipid is associated with the LNP. In contrast, PEG-lipids with 18-carbon acyl chains, incorporate into the LNP and do not dissociate from the particle in the circulation. At high concentrations, these PEG-lipids can contribute to extending circulation half-life (from < 30 minutes for diffusible PEG-lipid to > 2 hours) [23,153]. However, LNPs designed to target hepatic disorders do not require a prolonged circulation lifetime due to the liver's natural ability to sequester nanoparticles. Therefore, diffusible PEG-lipids are ideal for such",

            "text": "For instance, smaller NPs adsorb relatively more proteins compared to larger NPs due to having a larger surface area-to-volume ratio in smaller NPs. 227 Additionally, hydrophobic NPs adsorb more than twice the amount of proteins of hydrophilic NPs (12 vs. 26 \u03bcg of proteins per mg of NP, respectively). 228 Other studies showed that hydrophobic NPs have a higher binding affinity for apolipoproteins, while hydrophilic NPs favoured the adsorption of fibrinogen, IgG, and albumin. 27,229 esearchers also found that hydroxylation can reduce the adsorption of certain proteins like HSA and IgE, which typically promote immune clearance, while maintaining the adsorption of ApoE, which prolongs circulation in the bloodstream. 230 Charged NPs can cause more protein denaturation than neutral NPs. 231 Studies on polystyrene NPs demonstrated that positively charged NPs have higher binding affinity to proteins with an isoelectric point of less than 5.5 (e.g., albumin), while negatively charged NPs prefer proteins with higher values (e.g., IgG). 232 Another study on various organic and inorganic NPs has demonstrated that their exposure to human serum albumin results in diverse corona formation and composition. These differences manifest in the hydrodynamic size of the NPs. 119 Porous particles decreased the amount of adsorbed proteins due to the size-exclusion effect. 227 In turn, coating NPs with polyethylene glycol (PEG), zwitterionic compounds or polysaccharides can also minimise protein adsorption. 233,234 owever, when targeting ligands are attached to the NP surface, serum proteins interfere with their binding to target cells. Conjugating targeting ligands to an equilibrated corona is an alternative to overcome the issue and enhance their binding. 235 n the other hand, the biomolecular corona can impact the NMs' physico-chemical properties and highly influence their circulation time, as well as their deposition in tissue.",

LNP includes cationic ionizable lipids, cholesterol, helper phospholipids, and polyethylene glycol lipids. The ionizable lipids envelope the negatively charged mRNA through a combination of electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction. Cholesterol as a neutral lipid can not only enhance particle stability, but also improve transfection efficiency. Polyethylene glycol lipids reduce antibody binding of serum proteins and clearance of phagocytes, thereby extending systemic circulation time. Auxiliary phospholipids can provide a bilayer stable structure, and it has also been demonstrated that the chemical properties of phosphoric acid play an important role in endosome escape [14]. In addition, there have also been reports of adverse events related to MRNA-LNP, inflammatory reactions in the body, and human tolerance to drugs [15], and further pharmacological and immunological studies on LNP components are needed to achieve safe and effective mRNA delivery. The in-depth research on mRNA-LNP has become a hot spot in the future treatment of cancer or infectious diseases.",

            "text": "It is vital to claim the biological fate of nanoparticles. \n\nRecently, evidence accumulates that protein corona has a great impact on the biological fate of nanoparticles [16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. Protein corona is a corona-like supramolecular structure formed around the surface of nanoparticles upon contact with biological fluids [23]. There are numerous types of proteins in biological fluids, which renders the composition of protein corona very complicated [24]. The formation of protein corona alters the surface chemistry of nanoparticles, i.e., change from the nanoparticulate coating layer into protein complex [25]. It is established that the surface chemistry of xenobiotics determines the cellular recognition and uptake processes [26]. Thus, protein corona will affect the cellular recognition and uptake of nanoparticles [27], and even the inflammatory [28] and cytotoxic pathways [29]. As to nanoparticles for drug delivery, premature cargo release may occur after protein corona formation [30]. The influence of protein corona can largely account for the failure of biological fate prediction. \n\nThe investigation on protein corona is necessary to interpret the biological fate of nanoparticles, and to finally promote the clinical translation. Since K. A. Dawson et al. proposed the concept of protein corona in 2007 [31], many efforts have been made in this region. The protein corona formation behaviors and mechanisms of lipid-based [32], polymeric [33], metal [34] silica [35] and other nanoparticles [36][37][38] have been comprehensively explored. With these works, relatively profound understanding of protein corona formation phenomenon is obtained. \n\nOf note, the protein corona study should be continuously paid attention to. For one thing, because of the complex physiological environment, the interaction modes between coronated nanoparticles and cells are still unclear, limiting the interpretation of the in vivo evolution of protein corona. For another thing, nanoparticles prepared from new materials are emerging rapidly, and the previously established models cannot be directly applied to the new cases.",

            "text": "The liposomes used here, have a more negative zeta potential compared to the EVs. This could rise the question, if the difference in protein corona observed between liposomes and EVs is due to the difference in zeta potential. However, the protein corona of the two differently charged liposomes was almost identical. Therefore, we conclude that the zeta potential of the liposomes plays a minor role for their protein corona composition and the difference in protein corona composition between EVs and liposomes is not mainly caused by the difference in zeta potential. \n\nAs observed for liposomes before, the EVs used in this study showed an enhanced uptake in phagocytic cell types after protein corona adsorption. We therefore investigated if the high amount of immunoglobulins representing known opsonins would explain the higher uptake. In the 33% DOPE liposome protein corona, we also found immunoglobulins but fewer complement proteins. Instead, apolipoproteins and serum albumin were enriched, which are known as dysopsonins. However, the dysopsonizing proteins could not ameliorate the opsonizing effect of immunoglobulins. Overall, the protein coronas of 33% DOPE liposomes and EVs had opsonizing properties as cell uptake into phagocytes was increased upon protein corona adsorption. \n\nComparing our results to Mateos-Maroto et al., also stresses the importance of investigating human plasma-derived protein coronas for targeting of human cell lines when developing drug delivery vehicles (Mateos-Maroto et al., 2023). In contrast to our results, they found that an FBS-derived protein corona decreased the uptake of liposomes in murine macrophage cells. For liposomes, it has been known for decades that rapid blood-clearance is a major problem for clinical applicability and surface modifications are used to prolong blood circulation times (Shen et al., 2018). This is in good accordance with our finding, that the protein corona on non-functionalized liposomes enhances uptake in monocytes. Furthermore, this raises the question if EVs would also need stealth modifications to reach their full delivery potential.",

            "text": "For long-distance information transport, exosomes and microvesicles are of interest as vehicles. Exosomes are derived from endosomal compartments named multivesicular bodies (MVBs), whereas microvesicles directly bud from plasma membranes (Th\u00e9ry et al., 2018(Th\u00e9ry et al., , 2002)). During long-distance transport, EVs encounter biological fluids, such as blood, and proteins likely adsorb to their surface. This is referred to as protein corona formation. The adsorbed protein corona can ultimately alter the EV functionality as observed for many nanoparticles. This has been largely neglected in the field of EV research. The formation of an EV protein corona was first described by T\u00f3th et al. who revealed the protein composition as well as demonstrated the influence of a protein corona on EV functionality (T\u00f3th et al., 2021). Shortly after, this was confirmed by Wolf et al. who demonstrated that a protein corona is necessary for EVs to reach their full potential in angiogenesis and wound healing assays (Wolf et al., 2022). These findings started a paradigm shift from viewing plasma-derived proteins as contaminants of EV preparations towards considering them as additional EV components. \n\nPresumably, the insights into the protein corona formed on nanoparticles also will benefit the functional understanding of the EV corona. Nanoparticles quickly adsorb proteins upon contact with biological fluids. This changes their chemical identity to a biological identity and ultimately alters their biodistribution and cell uptake (Walczyk et al., 2010). Distinct proteins regulate the uptake of nanoparticles. Apolipoproteins, a class of lipid-binding proteins abundant in human blood, are known to promote a prolonged blood circulation time by avoiding uptake in phagocytic monocytes of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (Gustafson et al., 2015). This has also been referred to as stealth effect. In contrast, so-called opsonins, such as immunoglobulins mark nanoparticles for uptake in phagocytes (Yang et al., 2013).",

The adsorption of proteins to nanoparticle surface establish a protein corona has been given particular attention in the recent years, particularly within the context of nanomedicine targeting. Since many proteins are amphipathic, they have the potential to interact with almost any nanoparticle surface in their vicinity. Consequently, the interfacial interactions of nanoparticles with proteins are inevitable in such environments. In concordance, as expressed thermodynamically by D ads G < 0 (where D ads G symbolises the Gibbs free energy of adsorption), this mechanism of lowering the excess surface energy of nanoparticles is spontaneous. 40 The surface adsorption of serum proteins by particles (opsonisation) was \ue103rst postulated by Wright and Douglas in 1903. 41 Later in 1962, whilst assessing the surface adsorption of \ue103brinogen in blood plasma, Vroman noticed that the maximum surface concentration of \ue103brinogen was attained at an intermediate time point, suggestive of its substitution by other proteins with time. 42 Described by the Vroman effect, corona formation is a dynamic and competitive process. The initial stages of adsorption are dominated by small (high mobility), abundant proteins. However, with time, some of these proteins are substituted by those which are larger (low mobility), less abundant and have greater affinity for the surface. 43 An equilibrium is gradually attained, a\ue09der which each protein has equal rates of association and dissociation, and further exchange causes no change in the corona's composition. 44 As illustrated in Fig. 2, the protein corona branches into a 'hard corona' and 'so\ue09d corona'; these denote a \ue103rmly bound, equilibrium state layer (wherein proteins exhibit high affinity for the nanoparticle surface), and a loosely bound layer (comprised of low-affinity proteins in rapid exchange with those in the medium), respectively. 45,46 An intrinsic in\ue104uencer of protein corona composition is nanoparticle size. For both citrate-stabilised and PVP-stabilised silver nanoparticles, proteomic analysis of the acquired corona revealed that 110 nm nanoparticles",

            "text": "Background: When nanoparticles (NPs) are applied into a biological fluid, such as blood, proteins bind rapidly to their surface forming a so-called \u201cprotein corona\u201d. These proteins are strongly attached to the NP surface and confers them a new biological identity that is crucial for the biological response in terms of body biodistribution, cellular uptake, and toxicity. The corona is dynamic in nature and it is well known that the composition varies in dependence of the physicochemical properties of the NPs. In the present study we investigated the protein corona that forms around poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs at different serum concentrations using two substantially different serum types, namely fetal bovine serum (FBS) and human serum. The corona was characterized by means of sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Bradford protein assay, zeta potential measurements, and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). Additionally, the time-dependent cell interaction of PLGA NPs in the absence or presence of a preformed protein corona was assessed by in vitro incubation experiments with the human liver cancer cell line HepG2. Results: Our data revealed that the physiological environment critically affects the protein adsorption on PLGA NPs with significant impact on the NP\u2013cell interaction. Under comparable conditions the protein amount forming the protein corona depends on the serum type used and the serum concentration. On PLGA NPs incubated with either FBS or human serum a clear difference in qualitative corona protein composition was identified by SDS-PAGE and LC\u2013MS/MS in combination with bioinformatic protein classification. In the case of human serum a considerable change in corona composition was observed leading to a concentration-dependent desorption of abundant proteins in conjunction with an adsorption of high-affinity proteins with lower abundance. Cell incubation experiments revealed that the respective corona composition showed significant influence on the resulting nanoparticle\u2013cell interaction. Conclusion: Controlling protein corona formation is still a challenging task and our data highlight the need for a rational future experimental design in order to enable a prediction of the corona formation on nanoparticle surfaces",

While synthetic nanoparticles like LNPs can be quickly opsonized with proteins, CDNs are much less vulnerable to opsonization. 167 Early proteins that opsonized the surface of synthetic nanoparticles may induce fast clearances by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), followed by destruction or mediation of endosomal-lysosomal pathways within those cells. 168 xposure of nanoparticles to blood via infusion may trigger complement-activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA), which is an adverse immune overreaction (hypersensitivity). 169 However, CDNs, made up of natural lipids, do not cause these side effects. 169 etermining the formulation method is critical, as much as the targeting strategy is important. Whether permanently cationic lipids or ionizable cationic lipids are used tend to determine the LNP formulation method. When LNPs use ionizable cationic lipids, LNPs employing micro\ue104uidics and self-assembly processes outnumber LNPs employing thin \ue103lm hydration and extrusion.  All  e LNPs with permanently cationic lipids and nearly all the LNPs without cationic lipids use thin \ue103lm hydration. [99][100][101][102][103] This implies the fact that the formulation method depends on the characteristics of the cationic lipids. LNPs should, therefore, be formulated a\ue09der careful consideration.

            "text": "with a new biomolecular interface for interaction with blood cells and lining endothelium, and for detection by specialised phagocyte cells with subsequent elimination [20,21]. The components of protein corona rather than the nanoparticle per se are typically recognized by receptors on the cell surface. For example, in the case of DNAlipid nanoparticles, vitronectin enriched on particles associates with \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrins on cancer cells [22]. Analogously, for targeting to hepatocytes, interaction with apolipoproteins is required for some siRNA lipoplexes [23,24]. Remarkably, the liver tropism of the first siRNA drug, Onpattro, is based on the ability of lipid nanoparticles to recruit into its PC apolipoprotein E that enables specific hepatocyte targeting [11,25,26]. Recently, the preformed protein corona was harnessed to convert nanoparticles targetable to tumour cells. For that, particles were coated with tumour-specific antibodies and human serum albumin that helps to prevent phagocytosis of the particles [27][28][29].\n\nOn the other hand, protein corona can interfere with targeted delivery by masking the ligand on the nanoparticle surface that specifically interacts with endocytosis triggering receptors [30,31]. The composition and properties of forming protein corona highly depend on one hand on the type and properties of nanoparticles, like composition, size, charge, hydrophobicity etc., [10,[32][33][34][35] and on the other, on environmental factors, like temperature, [36,37] incubation time [17,38] and, especially, on the biofluid type, [39][40][41] origin and disease [42,43]. In general, protein corona on the smaller nanoparticles is thinner and less dense than on the larger ones [44,45]. In addition, cationic nanoparticles are cleared from circulation much faster than neutral or anionic counterparts [46].

            "text": "Nanomaterials promptly adsorb biomolecules leading to the formation of a so-called bio-corona 23 . The binding of proteins or other biomolecules to nanoparticle surfaces may thereby afford a new \"identity\" to the nanoparticle 24 . Deng et al. 25 showed that poly(acrylic acid)-coated gold nanoparticles bind fibrinogen, a protein involved in blood clot formation, in a charge-dependent manner, inducing unfolding of the protein, and that binding to integrin receptors on the surface of the monocytic cell line, THP-1 leads to activation of the nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. In a comprehensive study using a panel of silica and polystyrene nanoparticles of various sizes and surface modifications, Tenzer et al. 26 could show that plasma protein adsorption occurs very rapidly, and that it affects hemolysis, thrombocyte activation, cellular uptake, and endothelial cell death. Vlasova et al. 27 reported that adsorbed plasma proteins influenced neutrophil responses caused by polymer-coated, single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs). Specifically, the adsorption of IgG resulted in neutrophil activation, as determined by degranulation and release of myeloperoxidase (MPO). Similarly, protein adsorption modulated neutrophil responses toward carboxylated, non-PEGylated SWCNTs 28 . Lara et al. 29 employed an immuno-mapping technique to study epitope presentation of two major proteins in the serum corona, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and immunoglobulin G. The authors could show that both proteins displayed functional motifs allowing for recognition of the bio-corona on silica nanoparticles by LDL receptor and Fc-\u03b3 receptor I, respectively. On the other hand, others have pointed out that the bio-corona could shield targeting ligands on nanoparticles 30 . However, recent studies suggested clever ways in which to circumvent this problem 31,32 .",

At higher plasma concentrations, free HDL functioned antagonistically, whereas 444 reduced plasma concentrations resulted in lower free HDL, greater particle uptake and, 445 subsequently, improved mRNA expression. At the lowest lean plasma concentrations, there was 446 not enough HDL to populate LNP coronas, especially when using high doses of LNPs and this 447 degraded LNP performance. The number of HDL particles is, however, elevated in obese rat 448 plasma, so the LNPs remained functional even at low obese plasma concentrations, and under 449 these conditions, there was also less competition from unbound HDL. Taken together, these results 450 are first to indicate that LNP designs that encourage association with HDL or HDL components 451 will improve LNP performance by tipping the balance between LNP uptake and, free-HDL 452 blockade of cellular uptake mechanisms (such as SR-B1 53 ). The OPLS analysis also indicated that lipids (rather than lipoproteins) were contributive but less 465 decisive for LNPs' performance. Although one lipid hit LPC 20:1 did display a negative 466 correlation to LNP performance, and LNPs formulated with LPC demonstrated increased tropism 467 towards liver endothelial cells 56 , making LPC 20:1 a potential candidate for delivery to tissues 468 other than liver hepatocytes. 469\n\nIn summary, we have created an efficient method for isolating LNPs, with intact coronas from 470 plasma followed by an automated and unbiased mass spectrometric analysis of corona protein and 471 lipid content. We used this method to evaluate how corona composition affects LNP function (in 472 terms of effective mRNA delivery) by forming coronas in plasma from individual lean and obese 473 animals. Our study identified a lipoprotein fingerprint that promotes LNP function, leading us to 474 examine the role of HDL-LNP interactions as an essential factor for LNP efficacy. With these methods, it will now be possible to explore a greater variety of particles, biofluids, tissues, and 476 physiological states in order to more fully explore the relationships between lipid nanopar",

            "text": "It is now widely accepted that upon contact of nanoparticles with biological fluid (e.g., blood plasma) proteins rapidly adsorb to the surface forming the biomolecular corona [1,2]. On one side, this process highly affects the physico-chemical properties of the nanoparticles and on the other side; it eventually determines their biological behaviour [3][4][5]. \n\nDepending on the nanoparticle system, a direct link between cellular interaction and specific protein was proven. For example, poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles which were coated with apolipoprotein E were able to cross the blood-brain barrier [6,7]. Recently, for example, the dynamic interaction of a single protein (influenza A hemagglutinin) and exosomes was studied by high-speed high-speed atomic force microscopy [8]. Next to this, due to corona formation, the colloid stability and biocompatibility of inorganic Au@Fe 3 O 4 Janus particles was enhanced [9]. In strong contrast to this, several reports recognized that protein adsorption can significantly influence the targeting properties of nanoparticles [10,11]. Here, it was shown that there was no cellular recognition of transferrin-functionalized nanoparticle after corona formation, meaning that the targeting ligands is completely covered up by plasma proteins [12]. Therefore, it is of urgent need to understand and control the interaction of nanoparticles upon contact with blood proteins in order to improve their therapeutic efficiency [13]. \n\nMost in vitro studies utilize serum or plasma to investigate protein adsorption on nanoparticles [14]. Depending on the specific protein source (human vs. mice or serum vs. plasma) [15] there have been significant difference noticed in terms of cellular interaction and protein corona composition [16,17]. Therefore, it is of great importance to always use the respective plasma source of the chosen organism for in vitro studies (e.g., mouse cells = mouse plasma, human cells = human plasma). Overall, the in vitro experiments give the opportunity to characterize general interaction between nanoparticles and proteins.",

The LNPs are mainly composed of four components: Cationic or ionizable lipid (IL), cholesterol, helper lipid, and PEGylated lipid (Ly et al., 2022). Figure 4 represents the key constituents of LNPs. The cationic or ILs (also known as pH-sensitive lipids) interact with RNA molecules through electrostatic interaction between amine and phosphate groups. The interactions mediate the cellular internalization of nanoparticles along with siRNA and their release in the cytoplasm (Jayaraman et al., 2012;Lee et al., 2022).",

            "text": "Furthermore, LNPs containing mRNA have been utilized into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy [15,16]. Previous study has shown that LNPs containing mRNA encoding fibroblast activation protein (FAP) antibodies can achieve in vivo CAR-T therapy to treat cardiac injury [17], which further emphasized the importance of LNP-mRNA therapy. \n\nLNPs are composed of four distinct lipid classes, including ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids [6. 8]. The particle size, charge, and lipid composition of nanoparticles have been shown to significantly influence their transfection capabilities and biodistribution following intravenous administration [12,18,19]. Physiochemical properties and PEGylated lipids are recognized as critical determinants in the functional performance of LNPs, influencing key processes such as transfection and systemic distribution [20]. LNPs with positive charges preferentially localize to the lungs following intravenous injection, whereas those with negative charges are more likely to accumulate in the spleen [21]. The primary mechanism underlying the distinct in vivo distribution patterns of charged LNPs is attributed to variations in the protein corona adsorbed onto the nanoparticles, which significantly affects cellular uptake [22]. Moreover, PEGylated lipids also play essential roles in LNPs for mRNA delivery [23,24]. PEGylated lipids contribute to the evasion of macrophage capture, thereby enhancing nanoparticle stability and prolonging their efficacy in vivo [25,26]. The presence of PEGylated lipids in LNPs extends their circulation time in vivo, which is particularly advantageous for intravenous injection [1,27]. Upon entering the circulation, PEGylated lipids facilitate the interaction of LNPs with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in serum, promoting subsequent binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which is primarily located in the liver [24,28]. However, studies on the impact of composition on the biofunctions of LNPs post-intramuscular administration are still lacking.",

As a fundamental step towards tuning the immune system by BC, the nanotechnologist will carefully understand factors regulating the bionano interactions, i.e., the interaction between NPs and biomolecules leading to BC formation. 40 e biomolecular corona of nanoparticles Upon exposure to biological media abundant and high exchange rate proteins rapidly cover the particle surface which results in the formation of a fast-evolving \"so\ue09d\" BC made of loosely bound proteins. 41 Over time high-affinity proteins with a very slow exchange rate undermine the so\ue09d BC and form a long-standing \"hard\" BC around NPs. 42 Typically, most studies focused on the characterization of the hard corona as the characterization of the so\ue09d corona is affected by experimental biases arising from the lack of precise protocols for its isolation. For this reason, many open-ended questions have long remained elusive including if the so\ue09d corona is different in composition from its hard counterpart, and whether proteins enriching the so\ue09d BC trigger nanoparticle-cellular interactions. Recently, it has been demonstrated that only a minor fraction of proteins is unique to so\ue09d BC, while the largest fraction is also present in the hard BC, showing that the same proteins can interact strongly or weakly with nanoparticles or pre-adsorbed neighboring proteins. \n\n9][50] Among them, the protein source (e.g., human vs. mouse serum) is surely the factor contributing most to the enrichment of the biomolecular corona with immunogenic proteins (e.g., immunoglobulins, complement proteins). For instance, Caracciolo et al. demonstrated that two different formulations of cationic liposomes were more enriched in immunogenic proteins following exposure to human plasma (HP) than they were a\ue09der exposure to mouse plasma (MP). 51",

            "text": "This work exhaustively illustrates all the possible interaction models and how to analyze the experimental data obtained to have a better understanding of the measured phenomena. Concerning the interactions between nanoparticles and blood components, an interesting study reports the QCM-D characterization of the interactions between a lipid bilayer and carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles coated with different kinds of protein corona [20]. The study found that the 'soft' protein corona, composed of loosely bounded proteins, induced a permanent alteration in the lipid bilayer structure, while the 'hard' protein corona, composed of strongly bounded proteins, weakly interacted with a lipid bilayer. However, QCM-D is a very versatile technique with which the interactions of nanoparticles have also been studied with other blood components, such as platelets [21] The study of the protein corona is crucial for the development of safe and effective nanoparticles. The QCM-D technique can provide reliable screening of interactions with protein corona-related blood proteins and has been used in several studies to characterize protein corona formation on polymeric nanoparticles. However, the results obtained from QCM-D measurements should be interpreted in the whole context of the specific system under investigation, and other techniques should be used in conjunction with QCM-D to provide a comprehensive characterization of the protein corona. \n\nIn the present work, the QCM-D technique is applied to a rough evaluation of the protein corona formation around poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles. The QCM-D sensors were functionalized with three different blood proteins, namely albumin from human serum (HSA), fibrinogen type I from human plasma (HPF), and \u03b3-globulins from human blood (HBG), and the adhesion of the nanoparticles to the functionalization layers was evaluated. Three nanoparticles with different protein affinities were tested, and the system was validated with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV-Vis experiments. This research provides a valid method to characterize the interactions between tested nanoparticles and three blood proteins commonly abundant in the protein corona.",

            "text": "Due to their unique mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electronic properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted a lot of attention in the field of nanotechnology. Most interestingly, the potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications of CNTs in medicine are being increasingly explored [1][2][3][4][5][6]. It is well known that nanoparticles are rapidly coated with various proteins in biological fluids (such as blood, plasma, or interstitial fluid) to form a protein corona [7,8]. Upon formation, the nanoparticle-protein corona complex, rather than the pristine nanoparticles per se, functions as the biological entity further interacting with other components inside cells or living organisms, which potentially influence the downstream biological events. \n\nRecent studies have identified various proteins that can be adsorbed to different nanoparticles to form the protein corona. Among these, bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been commonly adopted as a model protein to study the formation of protein corona on nanoparticles, including carbon-based nanoparticles [9][10][11][12], metal nanoparticles such as gold [13][14][15], aluminum nanoparticles [16], and zinc oxide nanoparticles [17,18]. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying the interaction between nanoparticles and proteins and subsequent biological responses are still poorly understood. \n\nThe formation of a protein corona is hypothesized to highly depend on surface properties of nanoparticles. As for CNTs, surface functionalization has been developed to improve their dispersion, stability, and biocompatibility by introducing carboxylic groups or other oxygen-containing groups [19,20]. Carboxylated CNTs can further conjugate covalently with various functional molecules such as drugs, proteins, and oligonucleotides. For example, both singlewalled CNTs (SWCNTs) and multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) were functionalized using microwave-assisted acid treatment to induce carboxylation [21,22] and were found to bind more proteins than pristine CNTs in simulated cell culture conditions [23].",

            "text": "Corbo et al. [199] compared the temporal evolution of the protein corona around leukosomes and control liposomes (~170 nm diameter each), and also their uptake by macrophages. Leukosomes are liposomes with leukocyte membrane proteins, including IgG receptors, coagulation factors, and complement proteins, introduced in the liposomal lipid bilayer to obtain NPs mimicking the activity of natural leukocytes. Both types of NPs were injected into the tail vein of healthy mice; blood was withdrawn by cardiac puncture 10 min and 1 h after injection and the proteins adsorbed to the liposomes were identified by MS. Overall, leukosomes adsorbed fewer protein types than liposomes. One of those, clusterin, was exclusively found in the leukosomal corona. Interestingly, the protein corona formed in vivo increased the uptake of liposomes by immune cells but decreased the uptake of leukosomes. The authors suggested that the interaction of IgGs and other corona proteins with the receptors on the leukosomes prevented them from binding to their receptors on the macrophages. \n\nRecently, Hadjidemetriou et al. [200] presented a proof-ofconcept clinical study on in-vivo corona formation onto PEGylated liposomal NPs in humans, which had been infused intravenously into patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma. Protein-coated liposomes were subsequently recovered from the blood, separated from blood components, and the adsorbed proteins were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. The most abundant protein classes were Igs, lipoproteins, and complement proteins, in agreement with an earlier study on mice [197]. Moreover, more protein species were identified in the in-vivo corona than in its counterpart ex-vivo corona. Interestingly, the most abundant serum protein, albumin, was essentially absent from the in-vivo corona. Instead, low-abundance, low-molecular weight proteins were present. In a subsequent study, liposomal NPs were used as tools to fingerprint the blood proteome [201].",

Whether the protein coronas act together or promote spleen targeting independently remains inconclusive. Negative charge on LNP surface increased the spleen targeting ability of LNPs. Kranz et al. [41] used DOTMA (cationic lipid) and DOPE (helper lipid) to form mRNA-Lipoprotein X (LpX)s. It was observed that mRNA-LpXs with a zeta potential around \u2212 35 mV generated a signal exclusively in the spleen, with no significant expression observed in the liver. LoPresti et al. \n\n[141] used phosphatidylserine as helper lipids, maintaining a four-component LNP system. The surface of these mRNA-LNPs displayed a weak negative surface charge, thus reproducing the same spleen tropism. \n\nFurthermore, the structures of ionizable lipids affect the protein expression of mRNA in the spleen. Fenton et al. developed an ionizable lipid OF-Deg-Lin containing biodegradable ester bonds (Fig. 12B) [189,196]. Although the mRNA-LNPs composed of OF-Deg-Lin accumulated stronger in the liver than in the spleen, the mRNA  [192] expression in the spleen was over 85% while being hardly expressed in the liver. The reason might be that the ester bond degraded quickly in the liver before inducing protein expression in the hepatocytes (e.g., during cell internalization). Conversely, OF-Deg-Lin-LNPs might have been preserved in the spleen, retaining their ability to generate functional protein expression following uptake in the resident splenic cells.",

For PLGA@lipid, the pre-treatment with ApoA1 antibody reduced the complex's blood clearance half-life (with the calculated average blood clearance half-life being shortened from 39 h to 35 h) (relatively by ~10%) (3j). Interestingly, for these three model nanoparticles, their order of relative change in blood clearance (0% for liposome, 10% for PLGA@lipid, and ~18% for 188kPa@lipid) nicely mirrors their ranks of ApoA1 abundance in corona (~0% for liposome, ~8% for PLGA@lipid, and ~26% for 188kPa@lipid) (Figure 3f and Supplementary Figure 13a). Clearly, shielding/screening adsorbed ApoA1 in corona over a nanoparticle shortens the particle's blood circulation lifetime and the relative extent of such shortening is related with the particle's relative abundance of ApoA1 in corona, which confirms the significantly positive correlation between the relative ApoA1 abundance in corona versus nanoparticle blood circulation lifetime (Figure 3h).\n\nThe reasons why ApoA1 abundance in corona is correlated positively with nanoparticle blood circulation lifetime may lie in the following aspects: (1) ApoA1 preferentially interacts with nanoparticles of intermediate elasticity over those of extremely soft or stiff elasticity, as evidenced by the isothermal titration calorimetry assays ( Figure 4a) using liposome (DOPC: DSPE-PEG2000 = 90: 10), 188kPa@lipid, and PLGA@lipid as representatives for particles of extremely soft, intermediate, and stiff elasticity, respectively.\n\n(2) ApoA1 is an effective dysopsonic protein; in fact, as dysopsonic protein, ApoA1 is more efficient than bovine serum albumin (BSA) -a widely used model dysopsonic protein (ACS Nano, 2013, 7, 10960 ) (",

While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are approved vehicles for small interfering RNA delivery, there are still challenges to use this formulation for mRNA delivery. LNPs are typically a mixture of a cationic lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The structural characterization of mRNA-containing LNPs (mRNA-LNPs) is crucial for a full understanding of the way in which they function, but this information alone is not enough to predict their fate upon entering the bloodstream. The biodistribution and cellular uptake of LNPs are affected by their surface composition as well as by the extracellular proteins present at the site of LNP administration, e.g., apolipoproteinE (ApoE). ApoE, being responsible for fat transport in the body, plays a key role in the LNP\u2019s plasma circulation time. In this work, we use small-angle neutron scattering, together with selective lipid, cholesterol, and solvent deuteration, to elucidate the structure of the LNP and the distribution of the lipid components in the absence and the presence of ApoE. While DSPC and cholesterol are found to be enriched at the surface of the LNPs in buffer, binding of ApoE induces a redistribution of the lipids at the shell and the core, which also impacts the LNP internal structure, causing release of mRNA. The rearrangement of LNP components upon ApoE incubation is discussed in terms of potential relevance to LNP endosomal escape.",

It was shown that siRNA-LNP systems containing 10 mol % of DSPC exhibit maximum activity for a size of 80 nm, which suggests that to obtain smaller systems with optimized activity, higher levels of DSPC should be incorporated. 181 This was confirmed in both human adipocytes and hepatocytes, where protein expression levels for 130 nm mRNA-LNP systems differed as much as 50-fold depending on lipid compositions with a constant DLin-MC3-DMA/Chol molar ratio. The results suggest that some of these differences may be attributed to changes in surface composition of the particles and the impact this may have on the ability of LNPs to fuse with the endosomal membrane. 180,181 The proportions of different lipid species in optimized RNA-LNP systems may vary according to the particular ionizable cationic lipid employed (see Table 3). This expands considerably the possible lipid composition of an LNP system but mostly challenges researchers to find the optimal combination for a particular application. On-going efforts are put on using advanced approaches such as high-throughput screening methods and computer-assisted drug formulation, as well as implementing digitalization and artificial intelligence for developing personalized nanomedicine.\n\nBiological Interactions: PEG Shedding and the Protein Corona. In biological media, LNP dispersions will interact with the numerous biomolecules present. The exact nature of this interaction and the impact on functional delivery will undoubtedly be complex and systematic studies are needed. It is possible that serum proteins adsorb on to the surface of LNPs which could trigger uptake by surrounding macrophages (e.g., Kuppfer cells) or dendritic cells. The PEGlipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption.

The protein corona comprises of a double layer comprising of hard inner shell (irreversible binding) and dynamic outer shell which interacts weakly with the adsorbed proteins 109 .

            "text": "Understanding protein-nanoparticle interaction, so-called nanoparticle-protein corona, is important for the interpretation of biokinetic behaviors, bioavailability, and toxicity potential. When an inorganic or organic material comes in contact with biological fluids, such as blood, rapid interactions occur instantly and lead to protein adsorption on the surface of nanoparticles. Therefore, the interaction of nanoparticles with proteins is highly dependent on the surface characteristics and particle size of the nanoparticles. 43,44 6][47] These types of interactions may cause undesirable toxic effects or facilitate the delivery of nanoparticles to organs, because plasma proteins play a critical role in the disposition, transportation, and deposition of both endogenous and exogenous molecules by noncovalent interaction. 48 In particular, nanoparticleprotein corona implicates cellular interaction in terms of toxicity, uptake, and immune response. For example, it was reported that albumin-adsorbed single-walled carbon nanotubes contributed to the induction of anti-inflammatory Notes: Serum protein adsorbed on (or bound to) the surface of nanoparticles (NPs) may facilitate immune recognition (uptake and elimination by immune cells) or cellular uptake. Protein conformational changes as a consequence of nanoparticle-protein interaction could cause undesirable toxicological effects or decrease biological activity. Uptake amount, uptake mechanism, and target-organ distribution of nanoparticles can also be influenced by nanoparticle-protein corona. \n\nsubmit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com",

            "text": "Thus, based on the latter work and on the data reported in the present study, it appears that the protein corona impacts on the magnetic behavior of SPIONs and that the surface coating (i.e., thickness/architecture, chemistry, surface charge) is an important determinant in this regard [24]. \n\nWalkey and Chan [7] compiled a list of identified plasma proteins and their relative abundances for more than 60 nanomaterials from two dozen published studies and were able to identify, across all studies, a total of 125 plasma proteins, representing the subset of plasma proteins that had been reported to adsorb to at least one nanomaterial. The physiological function of these proteins varied, but they were generally involved in lipid transport, blood coagulation, complement activation, pathogen recognition, or ion transport [7]. Indeed, in the present study, the protein corona extracted from CSNPs and compared to the plasma proteome and to the nanomag-D-spio protein corona was found to be enriched in proteins involved in almost all of these processes. Notably, complement, coagulation and immune defense related proteins are involved in opsonisation of microbes and their subsequent uptake by phagocytes, but also in systemic reactions such as thrombosis and anaphylaxis [25]. Furthermore, while apolipoproteins are thought to adsorb preferentially to hydrophobic nanoparticles, presumably due to hydrophobic interactions between the lipid part of the proteins and the nanoparticle surface [26], we found that apolipoproteins associated with both CSNPs and nanomag-D-spio, but that the lipid biosynthetic process was more prominently associated with silica coated SPIONs. For instance, apolipoprotein A1, a major component in high density lipoprotein complexes (HDL), was present in the protein corona extracted from both SPIONs. On the other hand, apolipoprotein E, a protein that is implicated in the transport of nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier [27], was enriched on the surface of CSNPs.",

Even in the case of viruses, the known composition of certain virions facilitates identification of corona proteins derived from the mammalian host. The difficulty of EV corona analysis is that both the corona and the EV proteins are derived from the same host organism. In addition, EVs are heterogeneous, therefore identifying which molecules belong to the protein corona and which are components of EVs proves to be challenging. Although the protein composition of separated plasma EVs has been already compared with published proteomic datasets of both EV preparations and artificial nanoparticle coronas, and based on this, the existence of a protein corona around EVs has already been proposed (Palviainen et al., 2020), no direct experimental evidence has been provided so far about the formation of an EV protein corona.\n\nHere we used the approach to harvest nascent EVs from serum-free conditioned medium of THP1 cells and Optiprep-purified platelets and to incubate these vesicles in EVDP samples. Our MS results obtained after dC, SEC or DGUC provided evidence for the presence of EV-associated proteins. The corona was also detectable by Wes, confocal microscopy, transmission and immune EM and was also reflected by an increased floatation density of 'coated EVs' . Some of the corona proteins could be dissociated from the EV surface in the presence of high salt solution suggesting electrostatic interactions in the corona formation.\n\nWe next compared published datasets of protein coronas formed in human blood plasma around viruses (such as HSV and RSV) and lipid nanoparticles (of the size of approx. 200 nm) with our THP1 and platelet EV data. One of the most exciting results of this study was that we found nine proteins that were present in all six datasets (THP1 and platelet mEVs, HSV, RSV, positively and negatively charged lipid nanoparticles). Furthermore, these nine proteins were also detected in several other previous studies on artificial nanoparticles (Br\u00fcckner et al., 2020;Di Santo et al., 2020;Digiacomo et al., 2020;Giulimondi et al., 2019;Papafilippou et al., 2020;",

            "text": "PEG with shorter chains is not so performant in terms of preventing protein corona formation and increasing blood circulation time, while PEG with longer chains can have a strong effect on cellular uptake and the endosomal escape process [114]. mRNA-LNP formulations were developed using two short PEG-lipids (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) which quickly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum. On the contrary, LNPs with longer lipid chains, such as C18 acyl chain (distearoyl-glycerol), show completely different in vivo behavior with a better anchoring ability on lipid membranes, protecting LNPs and decreasing their interaction with blood proteins [114]. siRNA-loaded LNP formulations containing PEG2000-DMG (1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000) have shorter circulation times and higher in vivo delivery efficacy than formulations containing PEG2000-DSG (1,2distearoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000), due to the faster dissociation from the LNPs, which may favor cellular uptake and endosomal escape [115]. \n\nDuring the formation of LNPs, PEG-lipid components arrange themselves with the hydrophilic polymer extended towards the aqueous medium, forming a hydrophilic coating on the surface of the LNPs which can increase their stability reducing aggregation phenomena during storage [24]. The LNP's ability to deliver their cargo to target cells is directly affected by the PEGylation; in fact, the addition of PEGylated lipid to NP formulations is widely used to increase the in vivo circulation time and prevent rapid clearance from the bloodstream.",

            "text": "The formation of the protein corona significantly alters the surface characteristics of nanoparticles, thus greatly affecting their interactions with organs and cells. In a recent study, Le ND et al. synthesized a series of poly(\u03b2-amino ester) (PBAE) derivatives and found that the protein corona on nanoparticles could help achieve organ targeting (lungs and spleen) [32]. Interestingly, their findings correlated closely with the study of Min Qiu et al. [33] , which demonstrated that the protein corona on lung-targeted nanoparticles had distinct characteristics that promoted lung accumulation. The protein corona formed on the surface of liposomes is primarily influenced by the physicochemical properties of the liposomes themselves. By selecting different lipid components or varying their ratios, it is possible to achieve targeting of different organs or cells. In 2020, Daniel Siegwart et al. reported a Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) delivery technology [34]. They introduced the cationic lipid DOTAP as a fifth component to the formulation 5A2-SC8/DOPE/DMG-PEG2000/Cholesterol, thereby altering the physicochemical properties of the LNPs, including their zeta potential. This modification influenced the formation of the protein corona during blood circulation, enabling intravenous delivery of mRNA to the lungs. Recently, Daniel Siegwart's team reporting the use of Lung SORT LNPs for delivering ABE mRNA/sgRNA to perform gene editing on lung stem cells, treating pulmonary cystic fibrosis [35]. These findings highlight the complexity and potential of manipulating nanoparticle properties and their protein corona to achieve targeted delivery to specific organs, including the lungs. Therefore, one promising avenue involves the introduction of cationic lipids into the liposomal formulation, which may introduce a more balanced surface charge to achieve lung-targeting. However, the exact mechanisms and optimal strategies require further investigation to enhance the efficacy of lung-targeted liposomal delivery systems. \n\nIn addition, pharmacokinetic experiment was conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of PC-Lipo and PS-Lipo in mice. As shown in Fig. 5C, PS-Lipo exhibited a faster metabolic rate compared to PC-Lipo.",

An exemplary vector will protect the nucleic acid payload from degradation and overcome a series of extracellular and intracellular barriers to enable efficient gene translation/transcription at the desired cell/tissue target. 1,2 Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vectors formulated with an ionizable lipid, a PEGylated lipid, cholesterol, and a helper lipid have demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety in disease prevention and treatment, 3\u22125 most recently as vectors of mRNA vaccines. 6,7 Their rapid adoption is in no small part due to decades of earlier research 8\u221210 and the prior approval of Onpattro. 11 ne of the major challenges in developing LNP-based technologies is finding optimized lipid formulations for enhancing protein production, which are typically targetspecific, differing between various cells/tissues. \u221215 Changes in lipid type and composition alter their interactions and result in different nanostructures such as inverted micelles and invertedhexagonal, multiple-lamellar and amorphous phases for different formulations. 16 Moreover, the LNP nanostructure is related to its capacity for cellular uptake and release of the payload. 17,18 However, LNP development studies must rely on high-throughput screening work in vitro and in vivo due to the nature of multiple components and the complexity of LNP manufacturing. Thus, the rational design of LNP carriers, in the context of linking the structural features of key components to their functional roles and proposing target-specific adjust-ment, is a step forward for future LNP-based gene delivery applications. \n\nThe path to achieving the rational design of LNP carriers requires a better understanding of the LNP structures, which is the core of the LNP's formulation\u2212structure\u2212function relationship. The formulation mechanism of lipid nanocarriers and the structural phase transitions occurring upon encapsulation of nucleic acids have been previously investigated by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) 19,20 and the component distributions across the LNP by SANS. 21,22 arious LNP structure models have been proposed by different techniques. 17,23",

            "text": "Upon entry into the body, LNPs can interact with proteins in the biological environment and adsorb proteins on the membrane surface to form the protein corona [55,111]. Thus far, it has been demonstrated that the liver-targeting of LNPs is mediated by the absorbed corona proteins, particularly apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which can bind to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expressed on hepatocytes and facilitate the uptake of LNP by liver cells [112,113]. In a recent study, Qiu et al. designed a library of O-series LNPs that contained ester bonds in their tails (Figure 4A). They discovered that 306-O12B LNPs tended to deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA to the liver and led to higher Angptl3 gene knockdown compared to DLin-MC3-DMA LNPs (Figure 4B-D). Further studies revealed that the differentiation of tissue targeting might be determined by the corona proteins on the nanoparticle surface [114,115]. \n\nLipid-like nanoparticles (LLNs) represent one of the predominant LNP delivery systems for RNA-based drugs. Dong and colleagues designed a series of LLNs with TT3 as the core structure as depicted in Figure 5A. FTT5 LLNs were formulated to deliver FLuc mRNA in vivo, mediating the highest luminescence signal in the liver (Figure 5B). Subsequently, FTT5 LLNs were utilized to package hFVIII mRNA and adenine base editor mRNA, achieving effective hFVIII protein expression and base editing in vivo of hemophilia A (HA) mice (Figure 5C). Further study showed that FTT5 LLNs with branched ester side chains exhibited greater resistance to degradation compared to FTT9 LLNs with linear chains (Figure 5D) [116]. In an effort to develop biodegradable materials, Zhang et al. rationally designed a series of LLNs with different amines and esters, bearing varied carbon chains as shown in Figure 5E.",

The nanoparticle surface is immediately covered with a layer of blood components, forming the so-called protein corona (Neagu et al., 2017). Its adsorption kinetics and composition appear to depend on particle surface properties and will contribute to fate of material in the body. Usually, particulate material will be cleared from the circulation by immune cells via active (phagocytosis) or passive (diffusion) transport before ending up in the organs of the reticulo-endothelial system (RES), mostly in the liver and the spleen. The nanoparticle itself, its drug-load and the particle-specific protein corona will all play their part in how the product finally interacts with various immune components. \n\nIn a joint presentation, Dr Patricia Urb\u00e1n (JRC) and Dr Blanka Halamoda (JRC) presented their literature reviews on the most prevalent in vivo effects of nanomaterials on the blood and on the immune system. Thrombosis was the most frequently reported effect among blood incompatibilities, whereas immunoactivation, including both activation of innate and acquired response, was the main reaction of the immune system (Halamoda-Kenzaoui and Bremer-Hoffmann, 2018). The adversities were linked to the main categories of nanomaterials employed in nanomedicine, such as inorganic, lipid based and polymer based NPs (Wicki et al., 2015). Inorganic NPs were the main category responsible for the induction of haematotoxic and immunotoxic effects, in particular thrombosis and inflammation. The most frequent adverse effects of lipid based NPs were the complement activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA) and the activation of the adaptive immune system. The latter accompanied by the production of specific antibodies and accumulation of NPs in liver and spleen, lead to the so-called accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon, particularly noticeable after repetitive administration of PEGylated NPs. The reported adverse effects could often be linked to the physicochemical properties of NPs such as surface coating, surface chemistry and surface charge.",

[65][66][67][68] Effectively what it means is that, the original nanoparticle surface is not seen by the cell membrane, but rather those biomolecules which remain on the nanoparticle surface for long enough. Thus, cell membrane receptors will interact with biomolecules in the corona, and, presumably, this interaction will determine by which mechanism the nanoparticle enters the cell. 69,70 Subsequently, one would hypothesize that once inside, the biomolecules in the corona -if, indeed, the remain associated with the nanoparticle 71-73 -will determine to where the nanoparticle is shuttled, including if it is sent through to the other side of the barrier. This puts the spotlight on identifying which biomolecules are found in the corona, and which remain there for long times. It is noteworthy that the corona composition is not a simple reflection of the biofluid in which the nanoparticle is found. That is, if a nanoparticle is put into blood plasma with serum albumin as its main component, this does not imply that serum albumin is the main component of the nanoparticle corona. 49 Rather, low abundant species are frequently picked up by nanoparticles, and, in general, the corona depends strongly on nanoparticle properties such as surface, 74 size, 61,74 shape 75 and even concentration of the biofluid. 60 Importance in vivo It seems clear that the corona will be a key determinant of how the nanoparticles are processed in vivo. In a sense, this has already been partly demonstrated. Thus, coating nanoparticles by polysorbate 80 results in the adsorption of apolipoproteins to the nanoparticle surface 10,76 -in the language employed here, the formation of a corona which includes apolipoproteins -and this has been related to successful transport of",

            "text": "The purpose of our publication \"Multiomics analysis of naturally efficacious lipid nanoparticle coronas reveals high-density lipoprotein is necessary for their function\" 1 was to elucidate why plasma from obese rats seemed to improve the function of therapeutic lipid nanoparticles (LNP), and use this knowledge to suggest how LNPs might be improved. A comprehensive proteomic analysis revealed that there is a correlation between LNP coronal content, from different individual animals and, LNP function in those same individuals. More effective LNPs tended to have coronal proteomic signatures consistent with increased HDL content. We validated this by creating HDL-augmented coronas artificially and found that these do indeed lead to improved LNP function both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we conclude that measuring LNP association with certain coronal elements, notably with the HDL component ApoM, is a good predictor for LNP efficacy. \n\nThe Matters Arising from Simonsen questions whether the pulldown method we proposed \"avoids the co-isolation of lipoproteins and EVs\". We are fully aware of potential lipoprotein and EV contamination in existing LNP corona isolation methods and this was discussed in the original publication 1 . We included multiple controls and validation experiments to ensure that any eventual contaminants do not affect our conclusions. We believe that these efforts contribute significantly to advancing our understanding of LNP coronas and other nanosized particles in complex biological systems. \n\nSeveral techniques are available to isolate LNPs from biofluids. Density centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, flow fractionation and pull-down assays may be used. Unfortunately, most of these are relatively slow, require large sample volumes, produce variable results or, they are difficult to parallelize. Systematic exploration of the relationship between LNP composition, LNP coronal content and biofluids from individual animals requires high throughput and speed, good reproducibility and, compatibility with laboratory automation systems. We found that only the pull-down method met these criteria, allowing us to make the large-scale comparisons necessary to see patterns, and to do this quickly enough that the composition of the fragile, metastable coronas can be preserved.",

For lipid A, formulations made with DEPE showed higher hEPO expression than those made with DOPE for both IV and IM routes of administration (p < 0.05, Figure 2A,B). On the other hand, for lipid B, LNPs made with DEPE showed higher hEPO levels over B-DOPE LNPs only for IV (p < 0.05) but not for the IM dosing route (Figure 2C,D). \n\nIn the context of systemic delivery, LNPs in circulation undergo dynamic interactions with serum proteins forming a protein corona, which has significant implications on the kinetics, interactions, and affinity of the LNPs with different cell types. 24 Composition and formulation changes in LNPs can alter the protein corona, thereby modulating LNP\u2212cell interactions. 25 For instance, the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) affects LNP uptake by hepatocytes through the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). PC-and PE-based helper lipids formulated into LNPs can differentially influence their ApoE adsorption and thus hepatic delivery. 13 Recently, Zhou et al. demonstrated efficient dendritic cell (DC) uptake of ApoE3-incorporated biomimetic nanoparticles through the macropinocytosis pathway for cancer immunotherapy. 26 In this work, we observed that incorporating PE-based helper lipids with differing tail lengths into LNPs resulted in significant differences in their potencies through different routes of delivery. To investigate if these differences could be attributed to differential ApoE binding, the four LNPs were evaluated for their ApoE affinity using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The dissipation and frequency shifts of all four sensors were monitored in real time (Figure 2E\u2212G).",

One of the most important serum proteins that coat the LNPs surface is apolipoprotein E (ApoE). ApoE is recognized by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which highly expressed on hepatocytes. When LNPs are systemically administered, serum ApoE adsorbed onto the surface of the particles creates an inherent receptor-mediated uptake into hepatoma cells and hepatocytes. 61,64,65 Yan et al. demonstrated the hepatic clearance of liposomes via ApoE as a ligand\u2212receptormediated uptake process using ApoE-deficient mice. 61 LNPs also passively accumulate in the liver as a consequence of physiology since the liver is a highly perfused organ with fenestrated capillaries. 65 his endogenous ligand\u2212receptor-mediated targeting suggests that similar approaches using exogenous ligands may be useful for LNP targeting to different cell and tissue types. 65,66 or example, the PEG-conjugated ligand anisamide interacts with sigma receptors expressed by murine melanoma cells (B16F10) and has been used to increase LNP-mediated siRNA delivery to lung tumors and metastases. 67 However, the efficacy of anisamide for LNP targeting may be limited by the subcellular organization of sigma receptors and the impact of anisamide on LNP endocytosis. 68 n other studies, incorporating small-molecule ligands into LNP formulations has enabled particle targeting and improved cellular uptake. The small-molecule ligand strophanthidin has been incorporated in LNP formulations to improve in vitro transfection of cells derived from different tissue types.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles. The delivery approach that is both most widely used and most clinically advanced is to complex anionic oligonucleotides with cationic lipids thus forming lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (161)(162)(163). This approach has been especially important for therapeutic use of siRNA (164) and good accounts of current clinical trials using siRNA LNPs are found in recent reviews (10,165). In addition to the cationic lipid, LNPs typically include a neutral lipid such as cholesterol, but a variety of compositions are possible. While simple LNPs are effective as cell culture transfection agents, they cannot be used in vivo because extensive interactions with opsonic proteins in blood lead to rapid clearance by RES phagocytes. LNPs for in vivo use are usually 100-200 nm in size and include a surface coating of a neutral polymer such as PEG to minimize protein binding and uptake by RES cells. This allows greater persistence in the circulation and the opportunity to interact with other cell types. However, because of their size, LNPs can only exit the circulation at sites where the endothelial barrier is fenestrated, particularly liver, spleen and certain tumors having a high EPR effect. Because of this, much of the work with siRNA-LNPs has focused on liver diseases including transthyrethrin-mediated amyloidosis, clotting disorders, liver cancer and disorders of lipid metabolism (11,166). \n\nThe action of LNPs involves initial uptake by endocytosis. In some cases this is mediated by the binding of apolipoprotein E and interaction with the LDL receptor (167). Once in endosomes, the cationic lipids of the LNP interact with anionic membrane lipids to disrupt membrane structure through the formation of a non-bilayer lipid phase termed inverted hexagonal (H II ). This leads both to increased membrane permeability and to dissolution of the LNP and is the basis for conveying the oligonucleotide to the cytosol (168).",

In the same cell model but using a different cationic lipid to formulate the LNP, Sahay et al. reported that downregulation of Cdc42 and Rac1 led to 80% decrease in LNP uptake, whereas inhibition of clathrin heavy chain-1 and caveolin-1 had little impact on LNP entry. 205 Together, these studies highlight areas in the design of LNP, which need further optimization and understanding to achieve efficient intracellular delivery.\n\nSince LNP delivery efficiency is influenced by the formation of a protein corona in biological media, one may expect that a healthy individual or a patient suffering of a pathology affecting the serum composition, will have different serum-protein diversity and concentration which could possibly affect the protein-corona composition of LNP and thus alter their activity in vivo, as observed for PLGA nanoparticles. 206 In addition, it is important to note that lipid self-assembly and therefore LNP morphology is driven by biophysical parameters including composition, temperature, pressure, electrostatics and lipid packing which have already been extensively reviewed and are therefore not addressed here. 207\u2212209 Therefore, the morphology and functional response of an RNA-LNP system administrated into a patient with abnormal body temperature (e.g., fever or low-body-temperature-related syndrome) may differ (e.g., protein-corona formation and delivery efficiency) when compared to a healthy volunteer. To date, LNPs have shown efficient delivery of RNA to the liver using passive cellular targeting (size control and protein adsorption). Compositional variations in LNPs have been demonstrated to enhance LNP accumulation in the lung and spleen; 210 however, delivery to other organs remains challenging. Like liposomal systems, LNPs can take advantage of \"natural\" and synthetic targeting processes to actively reach specific tissues and cells. The main strategies rely on proteins, peptides or natural ligands, antibodies or antibody fragments, as well as aptamers. Antibody-mediated targeting has demonstrated success in gene-silencing with LNP systems. As an example, Rameshetti et al. used an anti-CD4",

            "text": "In order to reach their receptors in vivo, nanoparticles will be first exposed to a complex biological fluid, such as for instance serum. In this environment, various proteins and other biomolecules will adsorb on the nanoparticle surface forming a biomolecular corona. This layer will then replace the synthetic identity of bare nanoparticles and in some cases it can mask the ligands of functionalized nanoparticles, which may result in the loss of targeting (Salvati et al., 2013;Hadjidemetriou et al., 2015). Additionally, some proteins with high binding affinity can strongly adsorb to the nanoparticle surface for a long period of time, creating a layer called the hard corona. In contrast to the soft corona, where proteins can be easily replaced by other proteins following dynamic changes of the surrounding environment, the hard corona is highly resistant toward such changes. Overall, this complex and dynamic layer confers nanoparticles a new biological identity. The eventual interactions between nanoparticles and cell receptors, thus receptor recognition and nanoparticle uptake, can all be affected by the presence of this layer. Strategies have been developed to prevent the formation of the biomolecular corona and maintain targeting efficiency, for instance, by creating a stealth layer using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and other special polymers or by introducing zwitterionic modifications on the nanoparticle surface (Veronese and Pasut, 2005;Yuan et al., 2012;Garc\u00eda et al., 2014;Moyano et al., 2014;Pozzi et al., 2014;Alberg et al., 2020). However, it has been shown that in the case of PEGylated surfaces, nanoparticles still could adsorb proteins (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016a). \n\nGiven the crucial role of the biomolecular corona and cell receptors in mediating nanoparticle uptake and determining their intracellular fate, it is of great importance to study in more detail the interactions between the biomolecular corona and cell receptors. Several studies have demonstrated that, indeed, the biomolecular corona itself can be recognized by cell receptors.",

Ongoing research aims to better understand the relationship between the chemical structure of ionizable lipids and their biological activity, which will help in designing more effective lipids.

However, it is still under investigation to what extent this can reflect in vivo situation [18]. Recently, Chen et al. reported the highly dynamic nature of the in vivo protein corona [19]. They showed that complement protein (C3) bound to the nanoparticle surface; however, upon contact with the blood stream other proteins rapidly exchanged C3 from the nanoparticle surfaces. The complex nature of blood and flow velocity are therefore additionally factors, which should be taken into account in order to evaluate the nanoparticles' behaviour under in vivo conditions [20]. \n\nBased on this, we aimed to characterize the in vivo corona of magnetic nanoparticles after they were exposed to the blood stream of mice. Our workflow allowed the direct recovery of the nanoparticles from the blood stream without the need of plasma preparation prior to nanoparticle recovery as described in other reports [21][22][23]. Nanoparticles were extracted from the blood stream via magnetic separation after a period being in the blood circulation of the living animal of up to 2 h. A thorough proteomic analysis was carried out to identify the distinct protein corona pattern. The identified corona composition was compared to an ex vivo situation using freshly extracted blood from mice or to an in vitro system, i.e., using serum or plasma with different anticoagulants. Additionally, cellular experiments were performed to correlate the corona composition with the cellular interaction of nanoparticles directly recovered from the blood or incubated under ex vivo or in vitro conditions.",

            "text": "Due to their small size, nanoparticles will not only penetrate easily through epithelial and endothelial barriers into the lymph and blood to be transported to different organs and tissues [176,177], but are also able to enter cells and cell organelles (e.g., mitochondria and nuclei). This may drastically affect cell metabolism and cause DNA lesions, mutations, and cell death [178]. Several studies revealed that nanoparticle shape is important regarding toxic effects as well. For example, spherical nanoparticles can be more easily engulfed by endocytosis than nanotubes and nanofibers [179]. \n\nThe surface charge of nanoparticles largely determines their interaction with biological systems. It is known that nanocarriers with positive charges show greater toxicity compared with those with negative or neutral charges. This can be explained by the ability of cationic nanoparticles to easily enter cells due to their interaction with negatively charged cell membrane glycoproteins [172]. In addition, cationic nanoparticles show an enhanced capacity for opsonization, i.e., nanomaterials in biological environments are subject to adsorption of proteins facilitating phagocytosis, including antibodies and complement components [180]. The adsorbed proteins, referred to as the protein \"corona\", will affect the surface properties of nanoparticles. Coronas are dual-layered systems composed of an inner core of strongly bound proteins (\"hard corona\") and an outer layer of more loosely bound molecules (\"soft corona\") that undergo adsorption and desorption more rapidly [181]. The protein corona is not static and can change depending on the direct environment of the nanocarrier. Furthermore, other biomolecules such as lipids can also adhere to the nanomaterial surface [85]. The structure and composition of the protein corona is influenced by factors such as the synthetic identity of the nanomaterial (inherent physicochemical properties) [182], nature of the physiological environment (e.g., blood, interstitial fluid, cell cytoplasm), and duration of exposure [183].",

            "text": "Cholesterol is a natural component of cell membranes and plays an important role in reducing the transfer temperature of LNPs, facilitating the transfer from the layered phase to the hexagonal phase, helping integrate these lipid nanoparticles with the endosome, and finally releasing mRNA from the LNPs internalized into the cytosol [61]. Cell cholesterol shows little solubility in the nanoparticle core, so it may accumulate crystalline on the surface of LNPs, causing lipid bilayer instability and increasing endosomal escape. In addition, it has a strong membrane fusion ability that is responsible for the intracellular uptake of mRNA and cytoplasmic entry [61]. Cholesterol is also a particle stabilizer in LNP formulations that limits nonspecific LNP protein interactions. It improves fat packaging and modulates the membrane fluidity and permeability of the bilayer membrane system through a condensing effect. Cholesterol also increases the ability of the phospholipid membrane to form a bicontinuous cubic phase at physiological temperatures by mixing with unsaturated phospholipids in a fat transfer system, thereby further increasing melting [36,44,59,61,64,67]. The purpose of lipid nanoparticle-mRNA systems is determined by reaching the target tissues because the target cells must then be internalized, and finally, the mRNA molecules must produce the necessary proteins which must escape the endosomes to reach the cytoplasm somewhere where translation happens [60]. The details of lipid nanoparticle delivery systems for mRNA-based vaccines are noted in Table 2.",

Despite recent studies having clarified the role of NP composition, surface chemistry and biological source (e.g., human/animal serum or plasma) in the formation of the BC, little is known about the possible impact of molecular crowding. To fill this gap, we used a cationic liposomal formulation as a model system and studied its biological identity upon incubation with human plasma, at a fixed liposome-to-plasma volume ratio and different concentrations. We carried out dynamic light scattering measurements to quantify the size and zeta potential of the investigated systems and gel electrophoresis to evaluate the composition of the corresponding coronas. Our findings suggest that NP stability may be compromised by molecular crowding, but the corona composition is stable over a wide range of concentrations, which extend over more than two orders of magnitude. As the biological identity of NPs eventually determines their final fate in vivo, we predict that this study could contribute to the development of a safe and effective nanosystem for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles have been studied for drug delivery and antitumor therapeutics [1][2][3][4][5]. Experimental and theoretical studies have mostly focused on modulating the size, structure, and surface properties of nanoparticles, in order to increase the targeting efficiency of nanoparticles [6][7][8][9][10]. However, when nanoparticles flow through the bloodstream, they interact with various plasma proteins and, thus, their surfaces are often covered by multiple protein layers, a process called protein corona [11,12]. The formation of protein corona influences conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles, which can significantly increase or decrease the targeting efficiency and cytotoxicity via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between nanoparticles and cell membranes [11, [13][14][15][16][17][18]. The mechanism of protein corona formation and the effect of protein corona on nanoparticle properties and interactions with cell membranes need to be studied at nearly the atomic scale in order to understand this and complement relevant experiments, as can be done using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Because the system containing multiple plasma proteins and nanoparticles is too large to simulate using all-atom models, theoretical studies, such as kinetic mean-field theory (MFT), density functional theory (DFT), and monte carlo (MC) simulations have been mainly performed until 2000s, but advances on computer power and force-field development make it possible to perform MD simulations of the nanoparticle complexed with plasma proteins for the past decade. Figure 1 shows that citations for research papers regarding MD simulations under the topic of protein corona have drastically increased, which will be thoroughly reviewed here, with a focus on plasma proteins, but not on other molecules, such as peptides and synthetic polymers. Zhdanov's review paper is highly recommended for MFT, DFT, and MC simulations of protein corona on nanoparticles [19]. In this review, we aim to show that MD simulations can successfully predict the experimentally observed compositions and structures of protein corona and their interactions with lipid membranes, as.",

[39][40][41][42][43][44] In particular, the corona is composed of a tightly, but not completely irreversibly, adsorbed layer of biomolecules (\"hard\" corona), which is surrounded by a more loosely associated and rapidly exchanging layer of biomolecules (\"soft\" corona). 45 The formation of a corona has been reported for several nanoparticles, including polystyrene, 46 silica, 47 carbon nanotubes, 48 silver, 39 and gold. 49 The amount, composition, and orientation of biomolecules present in the corona strongly influence  HSA (5% in PBS) was added to the microcentrifuge tubes, and the tubes were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for one hour. The tubes were subsequently centrifuged three times (18000 rcf, 4 \u2103) with a PBS solution wash between each centrifugation step. Finally, the sedimented NPs were re-dispersed in PBS to isolate the NPs and associated complexed proteins.",

Clinically used liposomes were employed because of their established pharmacokinetic and safety profile, their colloidal stability upon interaction with plasma components, and finally their efficient recovery and purification from the blood circulation of mice. 18,21,23 ubsequent comparison of the resultant protein coronas by high-resolution liquid chromatrography\u2212tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) enabled the discovery of diseasespecific signatures in blood, even at the earliest time point (before A\u03b2 plaque formation). The relative abundance of the AD-specific proteins fluctuated over the course of the disease, indicating variations of the plasma proteome as the disease progresses. Our data demonstrate that while the majority of differentially abundant plasma proteins were found to be upregulated at the initial asymptomatic stages of the disease, the abundance of these molecules was significantly reduced as a result of amyloidosis and neurodegeneration, signifying the necessity for further longitudinal investigations of the blood proteome along the AD spectrum.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, despite their potential, the clinical application of targeted LNPs has encountered hurdles. One prominent obstacle arises from the fact that, under physiological conditions, targeted LNPs become coated with biomolecules, thereby concealing their targeting ligands. \n\nRecent studies explore the gap between laboratory findings and the clinical success of NPs. This gap is partially attributed to our limited understanding of the connection between their synthetic identity, biological identity, and physiological response. 73 Upon in vivo administration (e.g., i.v., subcutaneous injection, etc.) NPs get coated by a protein corona that provides them with a new biological identity that controls physiological response. 74 In previous works, we have shown that the protein corona acquired by lipid vesicles has a composition that is simultaneously regulated by the electrical charge and by the affinity of lipids for individual proteins or specific classes of plasma proteins. 75 The protein corona regulates the interaction with immune system cells in vitro and ex vivo. 76 hese findings prompted us to create biomimetic lipoplexes with an artificial opsonin-deficient protein corona that minimizes the uptake by immune cells in vivo. 16 We have also demonstrated that the protein corona of lipoplexes locks onto receptors of cancer cells, promoting internalization by a receptor-mediated mechanism. It was the case of DOTAP/ DNA lipoplexes coated by a vitronectin-enriched protein corona. We showed that vitronectin promotes efficient uptake in cancer cells expressing high levels of the vitronectin \u03b1 \u03bd \u03b2 3 integrin receptor. 77 Accurate identification of protein corona fingerprints has allowed us to predict multiple biological interactions between lipid vesicles and cancer cells. \n\nThe development of such knowledge for LNPs will be vital for improved particle design and targeted delivery. Now that we know that the protein corona is the missing link to correlate synthetic identity and physiological response, it will be necessary to investigate the bionano interactions between LNPs and specific biological fluids. \n\nIn this regard, the quantitative structure\u2212activity relationship (QSAR) methods can be used to predict the relationships between the synthetic identity of LNPs and their mechanism of action at a cellular level.",

            "text": "Solid Lipid Nanoparticles for Atherosclerotic Plaques Targeting One of the therapeutic approaches in the management of chronic inflammatory diseases like atherosclerosis is using immune modulators, such as methotrexate, which is reported to control the released proinflammatory cytokines [258]. The preparation of methotrexate as solid-lipid NPs (SLNs) was demonstrated to reduce the production of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 proinflammatory cytokines significantly following the incubation with J774.A1 macrophages compared to the free drug [231]. It was demonstrated that the injection of amiodarone-loaded LNPs as an immune modulator enhanced the therapeutic activity and reduced the toxicity in rat models [246]. \n\nIt should be noted that the understanding of the protein corona, a layer surrounding the NP, is crucial for designing a safe and efficient atherosclerosis treatment. The corona's composition can affect the NP interaction and drug-release profiles; therefore, it could interfere with the therapeutic efficacy [259]. New strategies like zwitterionic coatings and controlling corona structure can reduce protein corona's obstructive effect in drug targeting and release [260]. Moreover, the conjugation of PEG on the outer surface of designed NPs is an additional strategy that is reported to reduce the effect of protein corona adhesion [261].",

There is a consensus that the outer surface of nanomaterials within biological systems is essentially covered by a protein corona as a result of non-specific adsorption and protein interactions. Furthermore, cellular and tissue responses of the nanomaterials depend on these corona compositions, which in turn have been demonstrated to be influenced by parameters such as size, shape, temperature, pH, surface charge, surface functional groups, and hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the nanoparticles (Gossmann et al., 2015;Yallapu et al., 2015). Even protein corona repellant membrane-wrapped nanoparticles have resulted in a non-specific protein adsorption (corona formation). However, selective cellular uptake of these nanoparticles has been observed in antigen presenting cells (Xu et al., 2016). Furthermore, the adsorption and unfolding of a single bovine serum albumin protein was found to trigger nanoparticle aggregation (Dominguez-Medina et al., 2016). Therefore, protein adsorption and associated conformation changes can play a major role in determining nanoparticle stability.",

            "text": "After injection into the body, the nanocarriers will travel along the bloodstream and face numerous components in the blood such as proteins. Due to their attractive surface charges, the proteins can be electrostatically adsorbed on the surface of nanocarriers, which is known as protein corona, hereby changing the nanocarriers' surface properties, covering the targeting moieties and finally impacting cellular uptake. 22 Therefore, the effect of the protein corona was studied in terms of toxicity, uptake and protein pattern as well as protein identification to understand the uptake behavior, as shown in Figures 4 and 5. SiNCs were incubated with human serum (HS) prior to adding them to CD8 + T-cells in medium containing different percentages of HS. The results indicate that the protein corona reduced the toxicity for all SiNCs compared to uncoated NCs ( Figure 4A). It was also found that the medium containing a higher percentage of HS contributed to enhancement of cell viability similar to previous study. 25 However, the uptake was dramatically decreased in all cases compared to the uncoated NCs, together with increasing of %HS in the medium, especially at 10% HS ( Figure 4B). These results suggest that the uptake of SiNCs in CD8 + T-cells was inhibited by the adsorbed protein forming protein corona, which can be observed from the pre-coated NCs. In addition, the different concentrations of serum might result in differences in corona composition leading to a decreased uptake with increasing  serum concentration. For gold nanoparticles, it was found that the corona inhibited caveolae-mediated endocytosis resulting in decreased uptake in human epidermal keratinocytes. 40 After forming the protein corona, the physicochemical properties of SiNCs were analyzed. Overall, the hydrodynamic size increased for all SiNCs (Table S1, Supporting Information). The \u03b6-potential after corona was about \u221220 mV for NCs as the surface was saturated with a high amount of adsorbed proteins (Table S1, Supporting Information). There were no significant differences in the surface charges after corona formation of the various nanoparticles, which was also reported in the literature. 41 In order to understand the reason for the inhibited cellular",

Interestingly, in case of human serum, PF14-pDNA nanoparticles demonstrated higher adsorption of most proteins compared to pDNA alone (Table 5), further emphasizing marked differences in composition of protein corona between sera of various mammals. In addition to fetuin, which marks nanoparticles for recognition by macrophages via scavenger receptors, also \u03b1-2-macroglobulin that is abundant in protein corona of CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles (Tables 3-5) might dampen the effect of injected pharmaceuticals, like oligonucleotides, targeting these to elimination as found earlier [77].\n\nTo sum up, serum albumin was a prominent constituent in protein corona forming around CPP-nucleic acid nanoparticles in all studied sera: from calf, mouse and human, although from mouse serum it did not associate to nanoparticles with the highest yield. However, the protein composition varied extensively between different sera and each protein corona showed individual pattern.\n\nIn addition, the functioning of proteins forming corona around PF14-pDNA nanoparticles in murine serum is in good concordance with the recent reports about the behaviour and targeting [78] of these nanoparticles in vivo. Accordingly, high level of alpha 1antitrypsin in protein corona of PF14-pDNA nanoparticles (Tables 3-5) correlates well with accumulation of nanoparticles in lungs of mice [79]. It was also shown that accumulation of apolipoprotein B-100, [80] and complement component 3 [78] in protein corona targets nanoparticles to liver. In both these organs high expression of luciferase from pGL3 plasmid was observed recently, whereas only low amounts of these nanoparticles were targeted to spleen, kidney, and heart [55,81].",

In the context of mRNA vaccines, LNPs serve as the delivery vehicle that shields the mRNA from enzymatic degradation and facilitates its delivery into host cells [144]. \n\nThe success of LNPs in mRNA vaccines is largely attributed to their ability to effectively interact with cell membranes [145]. When administered, LNPs are taken up by cells through endocytosis, where the mRNA is then released into the cytoplasm [146]. The LNPs' lipid composition is crucial for this process, as the lipid bilayer can fuse with the cell membrane, allowing the mRNA to be directly delivered into the cells without triggering excessive immune responses or causing toxicity [147,148]. Once inside the cell, the mRNA is translated into the protein of interest, such as the spike protein in the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, triggering an immune response that prepares the body to recognize and fight the virus if it is encountered again [149]. \n\nOne of the key advantages of LNPs in vaccine delivery is their ability to induce strong immune activation [150,151]. They enhance the uptake of mRNA by dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells, which are responsible for initiating the immune response. This leads to the production of both neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses, both of which are crucial for protecting against viral infections [150,152,153]. Additionally, LNPs have shown promise in targeting specific tissues or organs, increasing the efficiency of vaccine delivery while potentially reducing side effects or systemic toxicity [154,155]. \n\nLNPs are also highly versatile, allowing for customization of their lipid components to optimize the release profile, stability, and biocompatibility of the mRNA payload [156].",

However, the lack of rational design principles for efficient lung\u2010homing lipids hinders the prevalence of mRNA therapeutics in this organ. Herein, the combinatorial screening with structure\u2010function analysis is applied to rationalize the design strategy for nonpermanently charged lung\u2010targeted ionizable lipids. It is discovered that lipids carrying N\u2010methyl and secondary amine groups in the heads, and three tails originated from epoxyalkanes, exhibiting superior pulmonary selectivity and efficiency. Representative ionizable lipids with systematically variation in chemical structures are selected to study the well\u2010known but still puzzling \u201cprotein corona\u201d adsorbed on the surface of LNPs. In addition to the commonly used corona\u2010biomarker vitronectin, other arginine\u2010glycine\u2010aspartic acid (RGD)\u2010rich proteins usually involved in collagen\u2010containing extracellular matrix, such as fibrinogen and fibronectin have also been identified to have a strong correlation with lung tropism. This work provides insight into the rational design of lung\u2010targeting ionizable lipids and reveals a previously unreported potential function of RGD\u2010rich proteins in the protein corona of lung\u2010homing LNPs.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles (NPs) interact with biological fluids after being injected into the bloodstream. The interactions between NPs and plasma proteins at the nano-bio interface affect their biopharmaceutical properties and distribution in the organ and tissues due to protein corona (PrC) composition, and in turn, modification of the resulting targeting capability. Moreover, lipid and polymer NPs, at their interface, affect the composition of PrC and the relative adsorption and abundance of specific proteins. To investigate this latter aspect, we synthesized and characterized different liposomal formulations (LFs) with lipids and polymer-conjugated lipids at different molar ratios, having different sizes, size distributions and surface charges. The PrC composition of various designed LFs was evaluated ex vivo in human plasma by label-free quantitative proteomics. We also correlated the relative abundance of identified specific proteins in the coronas of the different LFs with their physicochemical properties (size, PDI, zeta potential). The evaluation of outputs from different bioinformatic tools discovered protein clusters allowing to highlight: (i) common as well as the unique species for the various formulations; (ii) correlation between each identified PrC and the physicochemical properties of LFs; (iii) some preferential binding determined by physicochemical properties of LFs; (iv) occurrence of formulation-specific protein patterns in PrC. Investigating specific clusters in PrC will help decode the multivalent roles of the protein pattern components in the drug delivery process, taking advantage of the bio-nanoscale recognition and identification for significant advances in nanomedicine.",

            "text": "Circulating proteins rapidly adsorb to the surface of liposomes, forming a protein corona that is the interface for biological interactions (Caracciolo, 2015;Corbo et al., 2016). The mechanisms of protein adsorption and the impact of the protein corona composition on interactions with the innate immune system have been reviewed in depth (Caracciolo, 2015;Barbero et al., 2017). The protein corona contributes to particle opsonization and phagocytic clearance, and may also lead to formation of immune complexes, immunogenic epitope generation from self-antigens, and activation or suppression of immune responses (Caracciolo, 2015;Corbo et al., 2016;Barbero et al., 2017). Moreover, the protein corona can interfere with targeting functions of liposomes surface-conjugated to active targeting molecules such as antibodies (Nellis et al., 2005;Suzuki et al., 2008). Recent work in understanding the protein corona has shown that its composition is dynamic and highly variable, depending on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticle as well as fluctuations in host circulating proteins. This may especially be relevant for cancer nanomedicines due to profound and heterogenous immune dysfunction associated with different types of cancer (Rosenberg, 2001). A major implication of this is that in vitro studies and studies in \"healthy\" animals are not sufficient to fully characterize the protein corona and biological impact of liposomal drugs intended for treatment of cancer. \n\nLiposome interactions with circulating complement proteins can also lead to activation of the complement cascade (Alving, 1992;Verma et al., 1992;Szebeni et al., 2002;Dobrovolskaia et al., 2008), generating complement cleavage products that are opsonins (e.g., C3b) and fragments that are anaphylatoxins (e.g., C5a). The latter have been associated with development of acute infusion reactions in patients known as complement activationrelated pseudoallergy (CARPA) (Chanan-Khan et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Another important feature of the biological environment is that the nanoparticles, while exposed to biological fluids, such as blood, lymph, gastric juice, etc., are covered with a kind of \"corona\"-a layer of proteins that are constantly adsorbed on their surface [64]. Undoubtedly, this protein (biological macromolecule) can mask several physicochemical properties (such as the surface charge and solubility) of nanoparticles and make them recognizable to the immune system, which may neutralize them before they reach the target site [65]. The covering of nanoparticles with these proteins largely determines their biological identities and further fate-their distribution through tissues and organs, their rate of excretion from the body, and their opsonization (phagocytosis involving membrane receptors). This is the key factor causing differences in the performance of nanoparticles within in vitro and in vivo [66] studies, where nanoparticles indicate good results in the first case and usually are worse or non-effective in living organisms [67,68]. \n\nHowever, the composition, density, and mechanism of formation of this macromolecular layer depends not only on the physicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticles, association/dissociation constants, competitive binding processes, and species of proteins in the biological medium but also on where the nanoparticle is located [69,70]. \n\nThe formation of this protein corona depends not only on the composition of the nanoparticle-its size, shape, surface state, and exposure time-but also on the type of media, the nanoparticle-to-protein ratio, and the presence of ions and other molecular species that interfere in the interaction between proteins and nanoparticles [71]. \n\nCareful modulation of the protein corona through the tuning of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters may allow nanoparticles to be delivered optimally in tumor tissue [72].",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading technology for nonviral nucleic acid delivery. In particular, LNPs have been clinically approved to facilitate efficient delivery of ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based medicines, including the mRNA (mRNA)\u2212 LNP vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 1,2 and small interfering RNA (siRNA)\u2212LNP therapeutics like patisiran, which treats polyneuropathies induced by hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. 3 Early research on RNA vaccines has demonstrated that naked RNA is quickly degraded after administration by cellular ribonucleases (RNases). 4,5 LNPs slow down the degradation process to ensure RNA stability while also promoting cellular internalization via endocytosis and allowing intracellular release of RNA into the cytoplasm for translation by cellular machinery. 6,7 The loading of mRNA cargo into nanoparticles is a spontaneous process wherein lipids undergo rapid mixing with RNA and collectively self-assemble into particles approximately 100 nm in diameter. 8 he composition of LNPs typically includes an ionizable cationic lipid and three neutral helper lipids: phospholipid, cholesterol, and lipid-anchored polyethylene glycol (PEGylated lipid). The ionizable cationic lipids are electrostatically complexed with polyanionic RNA to enable its encapsulation by the neutral lipids and facilitate cellular uptake and endosomal escape. 8,9 Phospholipids may play a role in membrane fusion and endosomal escape, but they mainly provide structural integrity to the particles. 7,10 Similarly, cholesterol enhances stability and fluidity of the LNP and improves intracellular delivery. 7,11 PEGylated lipids introduce a steric barrier at the surface of particles to increase colloidal stability by reducing aggregation and to \"shield\" particles from being bound by serum proteins in vivo including opsonins, which mark LNPs for removal by phagocytic systems. 7,12",

Previously, a method of soft corona fixation using click chemistry was proposed [10], which requires separate modification of hard corona and serum proteins. Our approach involves PACL modification of only serum proteins, which are then sorbed onto the surface of MLNCs, form hard and soft coronas, and are fixed to the surface under UV irradiation. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that the serum components carried one or two modifications. After incubation of MLNCs in modified serum and UV irradiation under chosen conditions, particles bearing a full corona were isolated. MLNCs were visualized using TEM at each stage of this study. The formation of a HC did not change the structure of MLNC/HCs compared to MLNCs, while the full corona was clearly visualized. A full corona under the selected conditions and with a photomodifier does not completely cover the surface of the particles but forms aggregates with linear dimensions comparable to the particle sizes. Apparently, such sorption of corona proteins is due to the heterogeneity of the lipid-peptide membrane, which may be caused by clustering of its components.",

            "text": "L ipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are clinically relevant delivery systems that have delivered mRNA-based COVID vaccines after intramuscular administration, 1,2 mRNA and single-guide RNA 3,4 to hepatocytes after intravenous administration, and siRNA to hepatocytes after intravenous administration. 5 These data justify the exploration of LNPs that target nonliver tissues. 6 Scientists use three approaches to increase nonliver mRNA delivery. One is to pretreat animals with drugs that block the liver from taking up LNPs 7 or reduce the activity of mRNA once it reaches hepatocytes. 8,9 A second is to add active targeting ligands to nanoparticles. 10 For example, mRNA-loaded LNPs were targeted to Ly6c + leukocytes utilizing antibodies that were anchored into the lipid membrane. 11 In another example, plasmalemma vesicleassociated protein-targeting LNPs were covalently conjugated with antibodies, which increased lung protein expression. 12 A third approach is to change the chemical composition of the LNP. Clinical LNPs have consisted of four components: an ionizable or cationic lipid, a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipid, a cholesterol, and a helper lipid. For example, when a cationic helper lipid was added to a liver-targeting LNP, it was redirected to lung endothelial cells. 13 In another example, RNA-lipoplexes were targeted to lymphoid-resident dendritic cells by titrating negative charge. 14 Finally, a fifth charged molecule was added to the LNP, improving tropism to the spleen and lung. 15 Notably, authors subsequently reported that these LNPs can bind different serum proteins, providing an insight into the biology of delivery. 16 These studies led us to hypothesize that changing the helper lipid could affect the internal cellular response to LNPs in vivo. \n\nWe first confirmed helper lipid-dependent tropism. We used a functional in vivo mRNA and DNA barcode system 17\u221220 to evaluate how 18 helper lipids affected tropism to 19 cell types in vivo.",

Two main parameters were considered: the average size (Mean) and the concentration of total particles (LNPs at the initial time, LNPs and serum particles during the incubation). As shown in Figure 3, after incubation in FBS, the particle size distribution profiles (concentration/size curves) were completely different depending on the lipid-PEG included in the LNPs. A flattening and displacement of the curves was observed for the DMG-and DTA-PEG (C14)-based formulations (Figure 3G-J), indicating an increase in the mean size and a decrease in the total particle concentration over time in the presence of FBS. The increase in the mean size was related to the adsorption of proteins around LNPs. On the contrary, the DSPE-and DSG-PEG (C18)-based formulations (Figure 3A-D) did not show any flattening of their curves over time. These formulations were characterized by maintaining a constant average size with no decrease in concentration during incubation.",

            "text": "The experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that protein corona influences conformations and surface properties of nanoparticles and their interactions with cell membranes, although those mechanisms have not been well understood at the atomic scale. As computer power and force-field development have advanced, MD simulations have provided considerable useful information regarding the formation of protein corona and its effect on nanoparticle properties and the nanoparticle-membrane binding for the past decade. In particular, MD simulations have been able to explore the competitive adsorption and desorption of plasma proteins on differently sized and charged nanoparticles, which helps to explain the experimental results and the Vroman effect. \n\nAlthough MD simulations have captured the experimental observations of corona formation and its interactions with nanoparticles and membranes, there are still differences in environments and mass transport conditions of experiments and simulations, which precludes any quantitative comparison between the two. For instance, there are hundreds of plasma proteins that compete with each other and form protein corona on nanoparticle surfaces. Additionally, the flowing velocity of bloodstream may modulate protein-protein and protein-nanoparticle interactions. Cell membranes consist of various membrane proteins and lipids, and their components and ratios vary in different cells. Filaments of cytoskeleton influence the membrane shape and mechanical resistance and, thus, may modulate the protein-membrane interaction. These details should be considered to predict the adsorption kinetics and final composition of protein corona for drug delivery applications, which are expected to be resolved in the future by recent efforts in developing multiscale-simulation methodologies and realistic cell-membrane models. Despite these limitations, MD simulations have successfully interpreted the Vroman effect and experimental observations at the atomic scale, clearly indicating a promising tool for the rational design of highly efficient drug delivery systems.

In Figure 10 we show that our Ag20Pep particles indeed engage in complex protein corona formation and that some of the serum proteins become specifically enriched on the surface of the nanoparticles.",

Instead of albumin, Sch\u00f6ttler et al. identified clusterin (also known as apolipoprotein J) as another protein with dysopsonic properties [52]. Clusterin was also detected in our hard corona proteins, but at very low levels (<1% in both micelle However, we found albumin and various apolipoproteins, mainly apolipoproteins A-I and E, to be prominent in the protein corona recovered from both micelles. Apolipoproteins generally exhibit dysopsonic function, as reported previously [50,52]. In summary, even though immune relevant proteins, such as immunoglobulins, were present in high percentages in the hard corona recovered from our micelles, in particular in the case of PEG5K, we also found an enrichment of dysopsonins, such as albumin and apolipoproteins. The presence of dysopsonins might antagonize the biological effects of micelle-bound opsonins [55], leading to a limited decrease in cellular uptake by macrophages and dendritic cells.",

The liposome\u2013protein corona is a dynamic interface that regulates the interaction of liposomes with the physiological environment. Here we show that the biological identity of liposomes is clearly linked to their sequestration from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donors that ultimately leads to removal from the bloodstream. Pre-coating liposomes with an artificial corona made of human plasma proteins drastically reduces capture by circulating leukocytes in whole blood and may be an effective strategy to enable prolonged circulation in vivo. We conclude with a critical assessment of the key concepts of liposome technology that need to be reviewed for its definitive clinical translation. Protein corona formation is known to have significant effects upon nanomaterials application. Here, the authors investigate the creation of a protein coating on liposomes with the aim of improving liposome circulation time by avoiding leukocyte capture and demonstrated application in vitro and ex vivo.",

            "text": "mRNA delivery vehicles primarily include LNPs, polymeric nanoparticle delivery systems, inorganic nanoparticle delivery systems, and peptide nanoparticle delivery systems. Among them, LNPs are the most widely used in mRNA vaccines; they are also common non-viral delivery vehicles in gene therapy [75]. mRNAs can be protected by LNPs from ribonuclease degradation and enter cells by endocytosis then escape into the cytoplasm via endosomes to complete mRNA translation and expression [76]. The immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines is also increased after LNP encapsulation and delivery [77]. \n\nLNPs in mRNA vaccines are composed of four main components: phospholipids, cholesterol, PEG lipids, and ionizable lipids. Because phospholipids can spontaneously organize into lipid bilayers and have high phase transition temperatures, they are often used as structural lipids and account for approximately 10-20% of the total lipids in LNPs. Kauffman et al. [78] found that phospholipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) improved mRNA transfection efficiency. Zhang et al. [79] found that DOPE can affect the biodistribution of LNPs in vivo. Cholesterol is another structural lipid in LNPs, accounting for approximately 20-50% of the total lipids in LNPs. Cholesterol enhances particle stability by modulating membrane integrity and rigidity [80,81]. The molecular geometry of cholesterol derivatives can further affect the delivery efficiency and biodistribution of LNPs [82]. PEG lipids serve to control the size of LNPs and stabilize them, preventing aggregation of the particles during storage [83,84]. PEG lipids can also prevent rapid uptake of LNPs, reducing serum protein-mediated opsonization and clearance by reticuloendothelial cells and improving the circulation half-life of LNPs [85].",

            "text": "Nanoparticles typically refer to tiny particles ranging from 1 to 100 nm, with their larger surface area and nanoscale size endowing them with unique physicochemical properties [73]. These nanoparticles can consist of single substances such as titanium dioxide, silver nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, iron oxides, or complexes such as polymer-drug complexes, and nucleic acid-nanoparticle complexes, among others [74][75][76][77]. When nanoparticles enter living organisms, they first come into contact with biological fluids (e.g., blood, tissue fluids, etc.). Various components in biofluids, such as proteins, lipids, sugars, etc., quickly adsorb to the surface of the nanoparticles, forming the so-called \"protein corona\". The composition and structure of the protein corona depend on the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, hydrophilicity, etc.) and the environment of the biofluid (e.g., protein concentration, pH, ionic strength, etc.) [78,79]. For example, gold nanoparticles are smaller in size but have a relatively large specific surface area, which can provide more binding sites for proteins and make it easier to adsorb some low-molecular-weight proteins, such as albumin and transferrin [80]. Polymer nanoparticles with a diameter of several hundred nanometers may bind more to macromolecular proteins such as immunoglobulins [81]. The formation of protein corona will change the surface properties of nanoparticles and affect their subsequent interactions with biological systems, such as biorecognition, immune response, and cellular uptake of nanoparticles [82,83]. Nanoparticles may be recognized by the immune system as a foreign body, triggering an immune response. Immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes can ingest nanoparticles through phagocytosis, which can lead to the removal of nanoparticles before they reach the target site, reducing the efficiency of drug delivery.",

            "text": "We employed antibodies against the polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules present on the LNP surfaces. These PEGs are \"anchored\" into the LNPs using acyl chains. Simonsen states that PEG molecules from LNPs can transfer to endogenous nanoparticles, while the two publications he co-authored and cited 2,3 do not mention PEG or LNPs and thus contain no direct experimental evidence to support his statement. Previous work by us indicated that when LNPs are exposed to biofluids, PEG molecules can \"shed\" from the LNPs, which is a necessary prerequisite for forming LNP coronas 4 . This work also demonstrated that this process reaches an equilibrium after four hours with about 40% of the PEGylated lipid remaining on the surface of the LNPs. PEG can associate with endogenous nanoparticles and PEG-induced precipitation is sometimes used to purify HDL and EV particles, for example, but the pharmacokinetics of PEG association with endogenous particles within blood or plasma is not well characterized. As previously stated, this is why our study was designed with a validation step that involved creating artificial coronas and testing their effect on LNP function in vitro and in vivo. \n\nAnother concern raised by Simonsen is the decreased LNP recovery when extending the Dynabead incubation period from 20 min to 30 min, as shown in Fig. S10a-d 1 (from the original publication, same below). It is important to clarify that in our experimental setup, all samples tested were incubated, prior to the addition of Dynabeads, with plasma solutions for 4 h (240 min) at 37 \u00b0C to allow the PEG shedding to equilibrate and corona to from ref. 4. Dynabeads were then added to these pre-incubated samples. A systematic design of experiments methodology was then employed to identify assay parameter values that resulted in the highest LNP recovery with the shortest incubation time, and 20 min was found to be optimal.",

The analysis of the hard corona, which involves removing excess and loosely bound proteins, is crucial for understanding the biological identity of NPs. However, this approach faces two primary obstacles: (i) techniques used may inadvertently introduce protein contaminants into the biomolecular corona outcomes, potentially skewing the results; 9 and (ii) more importantly, these methods often overlook the role of the soft corona. The soft corona, comprising dynamically bound proteins, plays a pivotal role in modulating NP-cell interactions. 8 Neglecting soft corona in studies is a notable oversight, as it can significantly impact how NPs are recognized and processed in the biological systems. 7,8 n contrast, in situ analysis of the biomolecular corona provides a more realistic representation of the in vivo environment.",

            "text": "The physicochemical properties of the protein corona and its evolution with time have been shown to affect the behavior of nanoparticles in biological environments to a large extent [1,11,28,162]. Our current understanding suggests that initially a \"soft\" protein corona, with a highly dynamic exchange of proteins, is formed around NPs. Changing its composition over time, the \"soft\" corona slowly evolves to a \"hard\" corona with less dynamic exchange [112,162,163]. Previous studies investigating nanomaterial exposure to complex biological environments [3,8,41,112,162] have largely failed to allow for the highly dynamic situation of physiological systems. Coronacarrying NPs may need to instantly react to external stimuli under such conditions as exemplified by considering the blood system where processes controlling haemostasis and thrombosis may be triggered on a timescale of minutes [28]. \n\nTenzer and co-workers [10] recently developed a new experimental approach allowing for a time-resolved determination of NP-specific fingerprints. This method, based on label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), allows for an insight into the time-evolution of the full serum protein corona. Such information, especially for short exposure times, is urgently needed to understand the interactions between NPs and biological systems. Briefly, they used their LC-MS based method to measure time-resolved corona compositions on silica and polystyrene NPs in human serum. By using NPs of various sizes (diameters of about 35, 120, 140 nm), and surface functionalities (amine, carboxylate, unmodified), they were able to provide insights into the consequences of these factors for corona composition and dynamics. \n\nThey demonstrated in their study that coronas were formed very rapidly, and showed an unexpected complexity regarding composition and dynamics on all of the NPs under investigation. They quantitatively detected 166 different plasma proteins within the corona after 0.5 min. The number of individual proteins quantified in the corona increased to almost 300 on the different types of NPs at prolonged exposure times (up to 480 min).",

Since COVID-19 infection is associated with aberrant coagulation cascade, resulting in serious alteration of coagulating factors and other mediators, timely detection of rising levels of complement proteins, immunoglobulins, and clotting factors in blood plasma could provide the information necessary for clinicians to choose the right strategy (e.g., appropriate dosing of blood-thinning medications) and aggressiveness of treatment to prevent the lethal consequences of massive blood clotting such as heart and/or brain strokes. \n\nAnalysis of the biomolecular/protein corona profiles of many nanoparticles (e.g., silica, 107 polystyrene, 107 and gold 58 ) has revealed the capacity of the corona in absorption of complement proteins, immunoglobulins, and/or coagulants, which can be extremely helpful for detection of sudden increases in the abundance of these proteins in blood plasma. We have shown that precoating of nanoparticles with specific proteins (e.g., immunoglobulins) can significantly improve the recruitment of similar proteins from blood plasma. 108 Therefore, precoating nanoparticles with clot-related proteins such as fibrinogen, fibrin, factor VIII, factor XIII, tissue plasminogen activator, or protein Z could significantly intensify the recruitment of similar proteins into the corona, creating a unique opportunity for the development of a sensitive and robust approach for rapid identification of even subtle signs of clotting in plasma. These protein-enriched coronas can be detected through welldeveloped colorimetric sensing platforms, including smartphone-readable systems for detection and discrimination of multiple proteins. 109 In addition, well-designed (opto)plasmonic nanoparticles 110 /nanosensors 111 (e.g., gold 110,112 ) may identify changes in the secretion of blood-clotting proteins by generating colored solutions amenable to detection with the naked eye or point-of-care devices.",

            "text": "This could promote rapid clearance of NPs or intolerable systemic effects such as anaphylaxis or tissue damage. To combat this reaction, PEGylation is preferred to increase its stability and minimize immune response. Despite this measure, Senti et al found that anti-PEG antibodies formed de novo or preexisting in donor serum-induced complement activation when interacting with PEGylated lipid NPs. This compromised the structural integrity of the PEGylated NPs leading to premature cargo release and increased risk of toxicity. These anti-PEG antibodies also induced C3 complement fixation, a mechanism that has been shown to lead to rapid clearance of NPs by the liver and splenic macrophages [174,175]. \n\nWhile crossing the BBB is crucial to delivering therapeutic agents for HAND, SUD, and neurodegenerative disorders, it is also the brain's most important defense against toxins and pathogens. As nanoparticles disrupt vascular endothelium, it increases the permeability of the barrier allowing its entry, but also exposing the brain to otherwise impermeable substances. This disruption could also facilitate the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, the hallmark of which is endothelial damage, increasing risks of stroke and ischemic pathologies. \n\nOne of the major hurdles nanotherapies continue to face is the clinical translation of its therapeutic effects. Although extensive research has been done in vitro that demonstrates significant therapeutic benefit, the same cannot be said for in vivo studies. This could be explained by the protein corona. As nanoparticles interact with elements of biological systems within the blood and cellular environment, they form proteins that comprise the protein corona (PC). This PC is critical for determining nanoparticle targeting, systemic response, cellular uptake, and bioavailability [176,177]. For example, optimal uptake of nanoparticles is demonstrated in vitro with a size range of 10-60 nm and a radius of 25.4 to 30.2 nm, however, the PC exhibits more inhibition on larger versus smaller size NPs as shown by Cheng et al. with gold NPs [178].",

When added to subunit proteins, they have the potential to induce strong immune responses capable of generating long-lasting immunity. Merck has developed a variety of LNPs utilizing different cationic lipid components including LNP A, which has a long half-life in vivo, and LNP B, which has a shorter half-life in vivo and is more biodegradable. Protein subunit vaccines containing LNP A have been shown to generate robust antigen-specific humoral and cellular responses with some dose dependent reactogenicity while vaccines formulated with LNP B elicit lower immunogenicity and increased tolerability. To gain insight into the innate signaling pathways utilized by these LNPs, we performed an immunogenicity study in MyD88 knockout mice utilizing RSV F subunit protein vaccine plus LNP A or B. Wild type mice immunized with LNP A vaccines produced significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory and neutrophil recruitment serum cytokines than the MyD88 knockout mice. However, with LNP B, MyD88 deficiency had no effect on cytokine expression. Humoral and cellular immune readouts are ongoing.

Stimulation with LNP A produced cytokine significant upregulation of monocyte and neutrophil-specific cytokines at 24 hours while stimulation with LNP B had no effect on cytokine production.

            "text": "\n Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been shown to be a safe and potent platform for vaccine delivery. When added to subunit proteins, they have the potential to induce strong immune responses capable of generating long-lasting immunity. Merck has developed a variety of LNPs utilizing different cationic lipid components including LNP A, which has a long half-life in vivo, and LNP B, which has a shorter half-life in vivo and is more biodegradable. Protein subunit vaccines containing LNP A have been shown to generate robust antigen-specific humoral and cellular responses with some dose dependent reactogenicity while vaccines formulated with LNP B elicit lower immunogenicity and increased tolerability. To gain insight into the innate signaling pathways utilized by these LNPs, we performed an immunogenicity study in MyD88 knockout mice utilizing RSV F subunit protein vaccine plus LNP A or B. Wild type mice immunized with LNP A vaccines produced significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory and neutrophil recruitment serum cytokines than the MyD88 knockout mice. However, with LNP B, MyD88 deficiency had no effect on cytokine expression. Humoral and cellular immune readouts are ongoing.

            "abstract": "\n \n Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by the presence of chromosomal rearrangements that result in novel fusion-oncoproteins. Since fusion genes both initiate and maintain leukemia, they are cancer-specific therapeutic targets that are expressed in every single leukemic cell. We have developed a therapeutic siRNA approach by designing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for the in vivo delivery of siRNAs to AML cells (Issa et al, 2023; Swart et al, 2023). We have now extended this approach to t(6;11)-positive AML that is associated with a dismal outcome in pediatric and adult AML. This translocation fuses the KMT2A (MLL) gene with the AFDN (AF6) gene, resulting in the dysregulation of the RAS pathway, aberrant gene expression and impaired differentiation.\n Here, we tested both an unmodified and a fully modified, 21-23 nucleotide, overhang siRNAs that successfully targets the KMT2A::AFDN gene fusion in AML cell lines and t(6;11) primary cells. Four different LNP formulations were tested, with changes both in lipid composition and molar ratios, to optimize knockdown efficiency. First, we assessed the delivery and knockdown efficiency using the Onpattro (Patisiran) LNP formulation, which consists of DLin-MC3-DMA, DSPC, cholesterol and DMG-PEG2000 at the molar ratios 50:10:38.5:1.5, respectively. Second, we utilized a LNP formulation where the cholesterol helper lipid was substituted with a naturally occurring phytosterol, namely \u03b2-sitosterol, at the same molar ratio as the standard formulation. Third, we tested an LNP formulation consisting of DLin-MC3-DMA, cholesterol, sphingomyelin and DSPC with molar ratios of 50:20:20:10. Lastly, we also tested a novel LNP formulation, which incorporates DLin-MC3-DMA, \u03b2-sitosterol, sphingomyelin and polysarcosine.\n Here, a 85% and 82% knockdown for the standard formulation, a 74% and 80% knockdown for the \u03b2-sitosterol formulation, a 76% and a 77% knockdown for the sphingomyelin formulation and a 83% and a 76% knockdown for the novel formulation were observed at a concentration of 2 \u00b5g/ml in SHI-1 cells over 48 hours when comparing the unmodified and modified siRNAs, respectively. These data indicates that knockdown efficacies are similar, while the fully modified siRNA only confers marginal increases in knockdown efficiency. As such, the choice of the optimal LNP for the treatment of AML will then depend on the pharmacokinetics and the ability of the LNPs to accumulate in the bone marrow in vivo.\n Additionally, the formation of the biomolecular protein corona upon serum exposure is an important factor mediating LNP efficiency. Serum proteins adsorbed to LNPs can facilitate LNP uptake and endosomal escape. We assessed both the association of LNPs encapsulating a cy5-labelled siRNA with SHI-1 and ML-2 cells in serum and in serum-free conditions using flow cytometry, and the knockdown efficiency. Both uptake of LNPs and knockdown were severely diminished over time in serum free conditions, and only 20% knockdown of KMT2A::AFDN was observed, suggesting that the protein corona facilitates LNP mode of action.\n To investigate whether our LNP-based siRNA delivery system targeting KMT2A::AFDN confers a functional effect on downstream targets, we assessed the expression of SHARP1. SHARP1 binds to transcriptionally active chromatin and activates gene expression critical for cell survival. Furthermore, SHARP1 cooperates with KMT2A::AFDN to regulate gene expression crucial for leukemogenesis, and mediates colony formation. Indeed, we report a 50% knockdown of SHARP1 in response to KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, while observing a 2-fold decrease in colony formation of SHI-1 cells. In addition, we assessed the expression of surface markers. Here, the expression of CD117 was decreased following KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, which indicates a shift to a more mature phenotype.\n Taken together, we successfully induced knockdown of KMT2A::AFDN in AML using different formulations of LNPs, a process which is mediated by the protein corona. We also gain insights into the downstream targeting of KMT2A::AFDN, where SHARP1 is downregulated upon KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, which is mediated through the loss of DOT1L activity. Furthermore, the colony formation was decreased following KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, which is in line with the loss of SHARP1. As such, the knockdown of KMT2A::AFDN with LNPs shows great potential in the treatment of t(6;11) AML.\n",

First, we assessed the delivery and knockdown efficiency using the Onpattro (Patisiran) LNP formulation, which consists of DLin-MC3-DMA, DSPC, cholesterol and DMG-PEG2000 at the molar ratios 50:10:38.5:1.5, respectively. Second, we utilized a LNP formulation where the cholesterol helper lipid was substituted with a naturally occurring phytosterol, namely \u03b2-sitosterol, at the same molar ratio as the standard formulation. Third, we tested an LNP formulation consisting of DLin-MC3-DMA, cholesterol, sphingomyelin and DSPC with molar ratios of 50:20:20:10. Lastly, we also tested a novel LNP formulation, which incorporates DLin-MC3-DMA, \u03b2-sitosterol, sphingomyelin and polysarcosine.\n Here, a 85% and 82% knockdown for the standard formulation, a 74% and 80% knockdown for the \u03b2-sitosterol formulation, a 76% and a 77% knockdown for the sphingomyelin formulation and a 83% and a 76% knockdown for the novel formulation were observed at a concentration of 2 \u00b5g/ml in SHI-1 cells over 48 hours when comparing the unmodified and modified siRNAs, respectively. These data indicates that knockdown efficacies are similar, while the fully modified siRNA only confers marginal increases in knockdown efficiency. As such, the choice of the optimal LNP for the treatment of AML will then depend on the pharmacokinetics and the ability of the LNPs to accumulate in the bone marrow in vivo.\n Additionally, the formation of the biomolecular protein corona upon serum exposure is an important factor mediating LNP efficiency. Serum proteins adsorbed to LNPs can facilitate LNP uptake and endosomal escape. We assessed both the association of LNPs encapsulating a cy5-labelled siRNA with SHI-1 and ML-2 cells in serum and in serum-free conditions using flow cytometry, and the knockdown efficiency. Both uptake of LNPs and knockdown were severely diminished over time in serum free conditions, and only 20% knockdown of KMT2A::AFDN was observed, suggesting that the protein corona facilitates LNP mode of action.\n To investigate whether our LNP-based siRNA delivery system targeting KMT2A::AFDN confers a functional effect on downstream targets, we assessed the expression of SHARP1. SHARP1 binds to transcriptionally active chromatin and activates gene expression critical for cell survival. Furthermore, SHARP1 cooperates with KMT2A::AFDN to regulate gene expression crucial for leukemogenesis, and mediates colony formation. Indeed, we report a 50% knockdown of SHARP1 in response to KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, while observing a 2-fold decrease in colony formation of SHI-1 cells. In addition, we assessed the expression of surface markers. Here, the expression of CD117 was decreased following KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, which indicates a shift to a more mature phenotype.\n Taken together, we successfully induced knockdown of KMT2A::AFDN in AML using different formulations of LNPs, a process which is mediated by the protein corona. We also gain insights into the downstream targeting of KMT2A::AFDN, where SHARP1 is downregulated upon KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, which is mediated through the loss of DOT1L activity. Furthermore, the colony formation was decreased following KMT2A::AFDN knockdown, which is in line with the loss of SHARP1. As such, the knockdown of KMT2A::AFDN with LNPs shows great potential in the treatment of t(6;11) AML.\n",

The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica.

Aggregation and the formation of a protein corona in the extracellular environment will alter nanoparticle size, shape, and surface properties, giving it a \"biological identity\" that is distinct from its initial \"synthetic identity\". The biological identity of a nanoparticle depends on the composition of the surrounding biological environment and determines subsequent cellular interactions. When studying nanoparticle-cell interactions, previous studies have ignored the dynamic composition of the extracellular environment as cells deplete and secrete biomolecules in a process known as \"conditioning\". Here, we show that cell conditioning induces gold nanoparticle aggregation and changes the protein corona composition in a manner that depends on nanoparticle diameter, surface chemistry, and cell phenotype. The evolution of the biological identity in conditioned media enhances the cell membrane affinity, uptake, and retention of nanoparticles. These results show that dynamic extracellular environments can alter nanoparticle-cell interactions by modulating the biological identity.

These proteins are strongly attached to the NP surface and confers them a new biological identity that is crucial for the biological response in terms of body biodistribution, cellular uptake, and toxicity. The corona is dynamic in nature and it is well known that the composition varies in dependence of the physicochemical properties of the NPs. In the present study we investigated the protein corona that forms around poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs at different serum concentrations using two substantially different serum types, namely fetal bovine serum (FBS) and human serum. The corona was characterized by means of sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Bradford protein assay, zeta potential measurements, and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). Additionally, the time-dependent cell interaction of PLGA NPs in the absence or presence of a preformed protein corona was assessed by in vitro incubation experiments with the human liver cancer cell line HepG2. Results: Our data revealed that the physiological environment critically affects the protein adsorption on PLGA NPs with significant impact on the NP\u2013cell interaction. Under comparable conditions the protein amount forming the protein corona depends on the serum type used and the serum concentration. On PLGA NPs incubated with either FBS or human serum a clear difference in qualitative corona protein composition was identified by SDS-PAGE and LC\u2013MS/MS in combination with bioinformatic protein classification. In the case of human serum a considerable change in corona composition was observed leading to a concentration-dependent desorption of abundant proteins in conjunction with an adsorption of high-affinity proteins with lower abundance. Cell incubation experiments revealed that the respective corona composition showed significant influence on the resulting nanoparticle\u2013cell interaction. Conclusion: Controlling protein corona formation is still a challenging task and our data highlight the need for a rational future experimental design in order to enable a prediction of the corona formation on nanoparticle surfaces and, therefore, the resulting biodistribution in the body."

To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies.",

The protein corona on NPs could also impede active targeting, induce off-target effects, trigger particle clearance and even provoke toxicity. This article reviews the fundamentals of NP-plasma protein interaction, the consequences of the interactions, and provides insights into the correlations of protein corona with biodistribution and cellular delivery.

The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells.",

Aggregation and the formation of a protein corona in the extracellular environment will alter nanoparticle size, shape, and surface properties, giving it a \"biological identity\" that is distinct from its initial \"synthetic identity\". The biological identity of a nanoparticle depends on the composition of the surrounding biological environment and determines subsequent cellular interactions. When studying nanoparticle-cell interactions, previous studies have ignored the dynamic composition of the extracellular environment as cells deplete and secrete biomolecules in a process known as \"conditioning\". Here, we show that cell conditioning induces gold nanoparticle aggregation and changes the protein corona composition in a manner that depends on nanoparticle diameter, surface chemistry, and cell phenotype. The evolution of the biological identity in conditioned media enhances the cell membrane affinity, uptake, and retention of nanoparticles. These results show that dynamic extracellular environments can alter nanoparticle-cell interactions by modulating the biological identity. The effect of the dynamic nature of biological environments on the biological identity of nanoparticles must be considered to fully understand nano-bio interactions and prevent data misinterpretation.",

However, repeated administrations of LNPs may lead to accumulation of delivery materials and associated toxicity. To address this challenge, we have developed biodegradable lipids which improve LNPs clearance and reduce toxicity. We modify the backbone structure of Dlin-MC3-DMA by introducing alkyne and ester groups into the lipid tails. We evaluate the performance of these lipids when co-formulated with other amine containing lipid-like materials. We demonstrate that these formulations synergistically facilitate robust mRNA delivery with improved tolerability after single and repeated administrations. We further identify albumin-associated macropinocytosis and endocytosis as an ApoE-independent LNP cellular uptake pathway in the liver. Separately, the inclusion of alkyne lipids significantly increases membrane fusion to enhance mRNA release, leading to synergistic improvement of mRNA delivery. We believe that the rational design of LNPs with multiple amine-lipids increases the material space for mRNA delivery. Lipid-like nanoparticles have applications as non-viral delivery systems for mRNA. Here, the authors develop biodegradable lipids with improved clearance and reduced toxicity.",

To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies."

The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021). Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression (Dilliard et al., 2021)...It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery (Dilliard et al., 2021). In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties.

These vesicles are widely used in small-molecule drug and nucleic acid delivery and recently gained much attention because of their remarkable success as a delivery platform for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Nonetheless, the utility of transient protein expression induced by mRNA extends far beyond vaccines against infectious diseases\u2500they also hold promise as cancer vaccines, protein replacement therapies, and gene editing components for rare genetic diseases. However, naked mRNA is inherently unstable and prone to rapid degradation by nucleases and self-hydrolysis. Encapsulation of mRNA within LNPs protects mRNA from extracellular ribonucleases and assists with intracellular mRNA delivery.In this Account, we discuss the core features of LNPs for RNA delivery. We focus our attention on LNPs designed to deliver mRNA; however, we also include examples of siRNA-LNP delivery where appropriate to highlight the commonalities and the dissimilarities due to the nucleic acid structure. First, we introduce the concept of LNPs, the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing nucleic acids as therapeutic agents, and the general reasoning behind the molecular makeup of LNPs. We also briefly highlight the most recent clinical successes of LNP-based nucleic acid therapies. Second, we describe the theory and methods of LNP self-assembly. The common idea behind all of the preparation methods is inducing electrostatic interactions between the nucleic acid and charged lipids and promoting nanoparticle growth via hydrophobic interactions. Third, we break down the LNP composition with special attention to the fundamental properties and purposes of each component. This includes the identified molecular design criteria, commercial sourcing, impact on intracellular trafficking, and contribution to the properties of LNPs. One of the key components of LNPs is ionizable lipids, which initiate electrostatic binding with endosomal membranes and facilitate cytosolic release; however, the roles of other lipid components should not be disregarded, as they are associated with stability, clearance, and distribution of LNPs. Fourth, we review the attributes of LNP constructs as a whole that can heavily influence RNA delivery. These attributes are LNP size, charge, internal structure, lipid packing, lipid membrane hydration, stability, and affinity toward biomacromolecules. We also discuss the specific techniques used to examine these attributes and how they can be adjusted. Finally, we offer our perspective on the future of RNA therapies and some questions that remain in the realm of LNP formulation and optimization.",

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery (Dilliard et al., 2021). In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021)."

Unfortunately, opsonins are also adsorbed. These proteins are immediately recognized by the phagocyte system with rapid clearance of the NPs from the bloodstream. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating of NPs (PEGylation) is the most efficient anti-opsonization strategy. Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages. However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system. To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains. Nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis allowed us to accurately determine the corona composition showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins. Due to the abundance of apolipoproteins, we exploited the \"protein corona effect\" to deliver cationic liposome-human plasma complexes to human prostate cancer PC3 cells that express a high level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in order to evaluate the cellular uptake efficiency of the systems used. Combining laser scanning confocal microscopy with flow cytometry analysis in PC3 cells we demonstrated that MC-PEG2k is the best compromise between an anti-opsonization strategy and active targeting and could be a promising candidate to treat prostate cancer in vivo."

The application of such devices in drug delivery has proven to be beneficial for matters as diverse as drug solubility, drug targeting, controlled drug release, and transport of drugs across cellular barriers. Multiple nanotherapeutics have been approved for clinical treatment, and more products are being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials. However, many biological barriers hinder the medical application of nanocarriers. There are two main classes of barriers that need to be overcome by drug nanocarriers: extracellular and intracellular barriers, both of which may capture and/or destroy therapeutics before they reach their target site. This Account discusses major biological barriers that are confronted by nanotherapeutics, following their systemic administration, focusing on cellular entry and endosomal escape of gene delivery vectors. The use of pH-responsive materials to overcome the endosomal barrier is addressed. Historically, cell biologists have studied the interaction between cells and pathogens in order to unveil the mechanisms of endocytosis and cell signaling. Meanwhile, it is becoming clear that cells may respond in similar ways to artificial drug delivery systems and, consequently, that knowledge on the cellular response against both pathogens and nanoparticulate systems will aid in the design of improved nanomedicine. A close collaboration between bioengineers and cell biologists will promote this development. At the same time, we have come to realize that tools that we use to study fundamental cellular processes, including metabolic inhibitors of endocytosis and overexpression/downregulation of proteins, may cause changes in cellular physiology. This calls for the implementation of refined methods to study nanocarrier\u2013cell interactions, as is discussed in this Account. Finally, recent papers on the dynamics of cargo release from endosomes by means of live cell imaging have significantly advanced our understanding of the transfection process. They have initiated discussion (among others) on the limited number of endosomal escape events in transfection, and on the endosomal stage at which genetic cargo is most efficiently released. Advancements in imaging techniques, including super-resolution microscopy, in concert with techniques to label endogenous proteins and/or label proteins with synthetic fluorophores, will contribute to a more detailed understanding of nanocarrier-cell dynamics, which is imperative for the development of safe and efficient nanomedicine.",

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are one of the most successful RNA delivery systems. However, expanding their application hinges on the discovery of next generation LNPs with high potency, cyto-specific targeting, and low side effects. Overcoming the difficulty of releasing cargo from endocytosed LNPs remains a significant hurdle. The endosomal escape of viral and non-viral nanoparticles relies on the topological transformation of membrane fusion pore formation followed by RNA translocation into the cytosol. In this study we show that LNP-RNA nanostructure modulates the energetic cost of LNP fusion with a target membrane. The inclusion of a new class of structurally-active lipids leads to superior LNP endosomal fusion, fast evasion of endosomal entrapment, and efficacious RNA delivery. Specifically, bicontinuous cubic RNA-LNPs, cuboplexes, have significantly higher endosomal escape rates and deliver more RNA compared to regular lamellar LNPs.",

Release from monovalent[1,2-dioleoyl-3(1)-1(trimethylammonio)propane] or multivalent (dioctadecylamidoglycylspermine) lipids was quantified by an increase of ethidium bromide (EtBr) fluorescence. Plasmid sensitivity to DNAse I degradation was examined using changes in plasmid migration on agarose gel electrophoresis. Physical separation of the DNA from the cationic lipid was confirmed and quantified on sucrose density gradients. Anionic liposomes containing compositions that mimic the cytoplasmic-facing monolayer of the plasma membrane (e.g. phosphatidylserine) rapidly released DNA from the complex. Release occurred near a 1/1 charge ratio (-/+) and was unaffected by ionic strength or ion type. Water soluble molecules with a high negative linear charge density such as dextran sulfate or heparin also released DNA. However, ionic water soluble molecules such as ATP, tRNA, DNA, poly(glutamic acid), spermidine, spermine, or histone did not, even at 100-fold charge excess (-/+). On the basis of these results, we propose that after the cationic lipid/DNA complex is internalized into cells by endocytosis it destabilizes the endosomal membrane. Destabilization induces flip-flop of anionic lipids from the cytoplasmic-facing monolayer, which laterally diffuse into the complex and form a charge neutral ion pair with the cationic lipids. This results in displacement of the DNA from the cationic lipid and release of the DNA into cytoplasm. This mechanism accounts for a variety of observations on cationic lipid/DNA complex-cell interactions."

Detailed analysis of nanoparticle protein corona is gradually revealing the \"missing link\" between nanoparticle chemical properties and the biological identity. Nevertheless, the discovery of nanoparticle protein corona's impact on tumor delivery is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that protein corona can be manipulated by formulation composition and particle surface charge changes, and a single lipid switch could switch the nanoparticle protein corona profile. The protein corona composition differences had a profound impact on cell transfection, in vivo biodistribution as well as tumor-specific delivery efficiency. Nanoparticles with apolipoprotein-rich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona.

RPE transfection was observed in both mouse models suggesting that LNP intracellular delivery is not solely dependent on apolipoprotein adsorption or phagocytosis. To investigate LNP penetration, particles were delivered to the vitreous chamber via an intravitreal injection. The 0.5% PEG particles mediated the highest luciferase activity and expression was observed in the M\u00fcller glia, the optic nerve head and the trabecular meshwork, but failed to reach the RPE.

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

Although the precise mechanisms by which LNPs safeguard mRNA are still not fully understood, it is known that the ionizable lipids in LNPs become protonated in the acidic environment of the endosome (pH <7). This protonation promotes lipid exchange between LNPs and the anionic phospholipids in the endosomal membrane, leading to membrane fusion. This fusion enables the release of mRNA into the cytosol, where it can be translated into proteins. ApoE enhances this process by helping the mRNA evade the endosomal degradation pathway (Sebastiani et al., 2021).",

While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are approved vehicles for small interfering RNA delivery, there are still challenges to use this formulation for mRNA delivery. LNPs are typically a mixture of a cationic lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The structural characterization of mRNA-containing LNPs (mRNA-LNPs) is crucial for a full understanding of the way in which they function, but this information alone is not enough to predict their fate upon entering the bloodstream. The biodistribution and cellular uptake of LNPs are affected by their surface composition as well as by the extracellular proteins present at the site of LNP administration, e.g., apolipoproteinE (ApoE). ApoE, being responsible for fat transport in the body, plays a key role in the LNP\u2019s plasma circulation time. In this work, we use small-angle neutron scattering, together with selective lipid, cholesterol, and solvent deuteration, to elucidate the structure of the LNP and the distribution of the lipid components in the absence and the presence of ApoE. While DSPC and cholesterol are found to be enriched at the surface of the LNPs in buffer, binding of ApoE induces a redistribution of the lipids at the shell and the core, which also impacts the LNP internal structure, causing release of mRNA. The rearrangement of LNP components upon ApoE incubation is discussed in terms of potential relevance to LNP endosomal escape."

Although the precise mechanisms by which LNPs safeguard mRNA are still not fully understood, it is known that the ionizable lipids in LNPs become protonated in the acidic environment of the endosome (pH <7). This protonation promotes lipid exchange between LNPs and the anionic phospholipids in the endosomal membrane, leading to membrane fusion. This fusion enables the release of mRNA into the cytosol, where it can be translated into proteins. ApoE enhances this process by helping the mRNA evade the endosomal degradation pathway (Sebastiani et al., 2021)."

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver.",

A growing number of LNPs can deliver RNA to nonhepatocytes, suggesting that ApoE- and LDLR-independent interactions could affect LNP tropism. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a universal DNA barcoding system that quantifies how chemically distinct LNPs deliver small interfering RNA in any mouse model, including genetic knockouts. We quantified how 98 different LNPs targeted 11 cell types in wildtype, LDLR-/-, very low-density lipoprotein receptor, and ApoE-/- mice, studying how these genes, which traffic endogenous lipids, affected LNP delivery. These data identified a novel, stereopure LNP that targets Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes in an ApoE-independent manner.

However, there is still a lack of clarity about the relationships between physiological conditions and corona composition over time, and how this controls biological activities/interactions. Here we review recent progress in characterizing the structure and composition of protein corona as a function of biological fluid and time. We summarize the influence of nanoparticle characteristics on protein corona composition and discuss the relevance of protein corona to the biological activity and fate of nanoparticles. The aim is to provide a critical summary of the key factors that affect protein corona formation (e.g. characteristics of nanoparticles and biological environment) and how the corona modulates biological activity, cellular uptake, biodistribution, and drug delivery. In addition to a discussion on the importance of the characterization of protein corona adsorbed on nanoparticle surfaces under conditions that mimic relevant physiological environment, we discuss the unresolved technical issues related to the characterization of nanoparticle-protein corona complexes during their journey in the body.

To explore this we analyze naturally efficacious biocorona compositions using an unbiased screening workflow. First, LNPs are complexed with plasma samples, from individual lean or obese male rats, and then functionally evaluated in vitro. Then, a fast, automated, and miniaturized method retrieves the LNPs with intact biocoronas, and multiomics analysis of the LNP-corona complexes reveals the particle corona content arising from each individual plasma sample. We find that the most efficacious LNP-corona complexes were enriched with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and, compared to the commonly used corona-biomarker Apolipoprotein E, corona HDL content was a superior predictor of in-vivo activity. Using technically challenging and clinically relevant lipid nanoparticles, these methods reveal a previously unreported role for HDL as a source of ApoE and, form a framework for improving LNP therapeutic efficacy by controlling corona composition."

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

                "text": "\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as crucial delivery vehicles for various therapeutic agents, including nucleic acids such as mRNA vaccines. These nanocarriers typically consist of four key components: ionizable lipids that complex with nucleic acids, helper phospholipids that stabilize the lipid bilayer structure, cholesterol that provides rigidity, and PEGylated lipids that extend circulation time and reduce clearance. When LNPs enter biological fluids such as blood, they immediately encounter a complex environment filled with various proteins and biomolecules. These blood components rapidly adsorb onto the surface of LNPs, forming what is known as the \"biomolecular corona.\" \n\nThe biomolecular corona represents a dynamic layer of proteins, lipoproteins, complement factors, and other biomolecules that surrounds the nanoparticle, effectively creating a new biological identity. This corona formation is not merely a passive coating but rather a competitive and evolving process that depends on both the physicochemical properties of the LNP (such as size, charge, and surface chemistry) and the composition of the biological environment. The corona significantly influences how LNPs interact with cells, tissues, and immune components, often determining their circulation time, biodistribution, cellular uptake, and ultimate therapeutic efficacy. Understanding the mechanisms of corona formation and its composition is therefore essential for designing effective LNP-based therapeutics with predictable in vivo behavior. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021). Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression (Dilliard et al., 2021)",
                            "It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery (Dilliard et al., 2021). In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021)."

However, repeated administrations of LNPs may lead to accumulation of delivery materials and associated toxicity. To address this challenge, we have developed biodegradable lipids which improve LNPs clearance and reduce toxicity. We modify the backbone structure of Dlin-MC3-DMA by introducing alkyne and ester groups into the lipid tails. We evaluate the performance of these lipids when co-formulated with other amine containing lipid-like materials. We demonstrate that these formulations synergistically facilitate robust mRNA delivery with improved tolerability after single and repeated administrations. We further identify albumin-associated macropinocytosis and endocytosis as an ApoE-independent LNP cellular uptake pathway in the liver. Separately, the inclusion of alkyne lipids significantly increases membrane fusion to enhance mRNA release, leading to synergistic improvement of mRNA delivery. We believe that the rational design of LNPs with multiple amine-lipids increases the material space for mRNA delivery. Lipid-like nanoparticles have applications as non-viral delivery systems for mRNA. Here, the authors develop biodegradable lipids with improved clearance and reduced toxicity."

Aggregation and the formation of a protein corona in the extracellular environment will alter nanoparticle size, shape, and surface properties, giving it a \"biological identity\" that is distinct from its initial \"synthetic identity\". The biological identity of a nanoparticle depends on the composition of the surrounding biological environment and determines subsequent cellular interactions. When studying nanoparticle-cell interactions, previous studies have ignored the dynamic composition of the extracellular environment as cells deplete and secrete biomolecules in a process known as \"conditioning\". Here, we show that cell conditioning induces gold nanoparticle aggregation and changes the protein corona composition in a manner that depends on nanoparticle diameter, surface chemistry, and cell phenotype. The evolution of the biological identity in conditioned media enhances the cell membrane affinity, uptake, and retention of nanoparticles. These results show that dynamic extracellular environments can alter nanoparticle-cell interactions by modulating the biological identity. The effect of the dynamic nature of biological environments on the biological identity of nanoparticles must be considered to fully understand nano-bio interactions and prevent data misinterpretation."

                            "Abstract The surfaces of pristine nanoparticles become rapidly coated by proteins in biological fluids, forming the so-called protein corona. The corona modifies key physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticle surfaces that modulate its biological and pharmacokinetic activity, biodistribution, and safety. In the two decades since the protein corona was identified, the importance of nanoparticles surface properties in regulating biological responses have been recognized. However, there is still a lack of clarity about the relationships between physiological conditions and corona composition over time, and how this controls biological activities/interactions. Here we review recent progress in characterizing the structure and composition of protein corona as a function of biological fluid and time. We summarize the influence of nanoparticle characteristics on protein corona composition and discuss the relevance of protein corona to the biological activity and fate of nanoparticles. The aim is to provide a critical summary of the key factors that affect protein corona formation (e.g. characteristics of nanoparticles and biological environment) and how the corona modulates biological activity, cellular uptake, biodistribution, and drug delivery. In addition to a discussion on the importance of the characterization of protein corona adsorbed on nanoparticle surfaces under conditions that mimic relevant physiological environment, we discuss the unresolved technical issues related to the characterization of nanoparticle-protein corona complexes during their journey in the body. Lastly, the paper offers a perspective on how the existing nanomaterial toxicity data obtained from in vitro studies should be reconsidered in the light of the presence of a protein corona, and how recent advances in fields, such as proteomics and machine learning can be integrated into the quantitative analysis of protein corona components."

                            "Nanosized objects, such as nanoparticles and other drug carriers used in nanomedicine, once in contact with biological environments are modified by adsorption of biomolecules on their surface. The presence of this corona strongly affects the following interactions at cell and organism levels. It has been shown that corona proteins can be recognized by cell receptors. However, it is not known whether the composition of this acquired layer can also affect the mechanisms nanoparticles use to enter cells. This is of particular importance when considering that the same nanoparticles can form different coronas for instance in vitro when exposed to cells in different serum amounts or in vivo depending on the exposure or administration route. Thus, in this work, different coronas were formed on 50 nm silica by exposing them to different serum concentrations. The uptake efficiency in HeLa cells was compared, and the uptake mechanisms were characterized using transport inhibitors and RNA interference. The results showed that the nanoparticles were internalized by cells via different mechanisms when different coronas were formed, and only for one corona condition was uptake mediated by the LDL receptor. This suggested that coronas of different composition can be recognized differently by cell receptors, and this in turn leads to internalization via different mechanisms. Similar studies were performed using other cells, including A549 cells and primary HUVEC, and different nanoparticles, namely 100 nm liposomes and 200 nm silica. Overall, the results confirmed that the corona composition can affect the mechanisms of nanoparticle uptake by cells."

                            "Gene therapy holds great potential for treating almost any disease by gene silencing, protein expression, or gene correction. To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently of great interest for therapeutic nucleic acid delivery. Lipid-based nanoparticles are, however, difficult to study analytically and so our understanding of the interaction between LNPs and biological systems remains obscure, particularly in terms of biomolecular corona formation and the impact this has on therapeutic efficacy and targeting. Ideally, we would like to engineer particles to acquire corona components that facilitate targeting, cargo delivery and improved safety. This requires studying the relationship between LNPs, biofluids and the resulting coronas. The particle-corona complexes are, however, fragile and biofluids also contain particles (such as lipoproteins) with sizes and biochemical characteristics similar to lipid nanoparticles, so contamination with biological components is a challenge."

(Ke et al., 2017) In previous works, we have shown that the protein corona acquired by lipid vesicles has a composition that is simultaneously regulated by the electrical charge and by the affinity of lipids for individual proteins or specific classes of plasma proteins. (Giulimondi et al., 2019) The protein corona regulates the interaction with immune system cells in vitro and ex vivo. (Giulimondi et al., 2022) hese findings prompted us to create biomimetic lipoplexes with an artificial opsonin-deficient protein corona that minimizes the uptake by immune cells in vivo. (Giulimondi et al., 2022) We have also demonstrated that the protein corona of lipoplexes locks onto receptors of cancer cells, promoting internalization by a receptor-mediated mechanism. It was the case of DOTAP/ DNA lipoplexes coated by a vitronectin-enriched protein corona. We showed that vitronectin promotes efficient uptake in cancer cells expressing high levels of the vitronectin \u03b1 \u03bd \u03b2 3 integrin receptor. (Caracciolo et al., 2013)"

Aggregation and the formation of a protein corona in the extracellular environment will alter nanoparticle size, shape, and surface properties, giving it a \"biological identity\" that is distinct from its initial \"synthetic identity\". The biological identity of a nanoparticle depends on the composition of the surrounding biological environment and determines subsequent cellular interactions. When studying nanoparticle-cell interactions, previous studies have ignored the dynamic composition of the extracellular environment as cells deplete and secrete biomolecules in a process known as \"conditioning\". Here, we show that cell conditioning induces gold nanoparticle aggregation and changes the protein corona composition in a manner that depends on nanoparticle diameter, surface chemistry, and cell phenotype. The evolution of the biological identity in conditioned media enhances the cell membrane affinity, uptake, and retention of nanoparticles. These results show that dynamic extracellular environments can alter nanoparticle-cell interactions by modulating the biological identity. The effect of the dynamic nature of biological environments on the biological identity of nanoparticles must be considered to fully understand nano-bio interactions and prevent data misinterpretation."

One of the most important serum proteins that coat the LNPs surface is apolipoprotein E (ApoE). ApoE is recognized by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which highly expressed on hepatocytes. When LNPs are systemically administered, serum ApoE adsorbed onto the surface of the particles creates an inherent receptor-mediated uptake into hepatoma cells and hepatocytes.

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

                            "In recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs. These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. (Pozzi et al., 2014) Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands. (Caracciolo, 2015)",

                            "Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer (Dilliard et al., 2021). The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021). Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression (Dilliard et al., 2021)",
                            "It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery (Dilliard et al., 2021). In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021)."

                            "The physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo. A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [203]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [46, 204]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171], with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205], and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [206]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207]; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo."

The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022)(Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022)."

                            "Akinc et al. [84] discovered that ionizable LNPs (iLNPs) adsorbing apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can enhance the uptake of LNPs via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) pathway, thereby targeting hepatocytes endogenously. Building on this finding, Johnson's team screened a chemically diverse library of ionizable cationic lipids and identified the amino lipid 5A2-SC8. [85] LNPs formulated with 5A2-SC8/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG exhibited higher in vivo delivery efficiency compared to another construct with similar physical properties, 3A5-SC14/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG. This discrepancy arises because different LNPs adsorb distinct proteins, forming varied protein coronas during delivery. Specifically, 5A2-SC8 LNPs adsorb a significant amount of ApoE, facilitating hepatocyte endocytosis via LDL-R, whereas 3A5-SC14 LNPs predominantly adsorb albumin, which is readily phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. Notably, 3A5-SC14 LNPs demonstrated a higher hepatocyte accumulation rate in vitro than 5A2-SC8. Further studies on LNP protein coronas revealed that altering the carbon chain length of PEG lipids and the molar percentage of PEGs also affects the adsorbed protein corona. Pre-incubation of ApoE with various LNPs indicated that ApoE promoted uptake only in C14-PEG LNPs, not C18-PEG LNPs, highlighting that small differences in LNP composition can influence both the type of protein corona and its effect on LNP uptake.

                            "The protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems. After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona. This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition. Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs. Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models. A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern. For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich."

It is now well acknowledged that upon systemic administration, biomolecules from blood will adsorb onto nanoparticles' surfaces, forming a \"protein corona\", affording nanoparticles a \"biological identity\" on top of their \"synthetic identity\". Detailed analysis of nanoparticle protein corona is gradually revealing the \"missing link\" between nanoparticle chemical properties and the biological identity. Nevertheless, the discovery of nanoparticle protein corona's impact on tumor delivery is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that protein corona can be manipulated by formulation composition and particle surface charge changes, and a single lipid switch could switch the nanoparticle protein corona profile. The protein corona composition differences had a profound impact on cell transfection, in vivo biodistribution as well as tumor-specific delivery efficiency. Nanoparticles with apolipoprotein-rich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. In addition, we found that, the PEG conjugated lipid chain length and PEG amount in LNPs were key factors to consider in successful RNA interference therapy for solid tumors."

Here we review the basic concept of the nanoparticle corona and its structure and composition, and highlight how the properties of the corona may be linked to its biological impacts. We conclude with a critical assessment of the key problems that need to be resolved in the near future."

Moreover, PEGylated lipids also play essential roles in LNPs for mRNA delivery (Ryals et al., 2020)(Shi et al., 2021). PEGylated lipids contribute to the evasion of macrophage capture, thereby enhancing nanoparticle stability and prolonging their efficacy in vivo (Hashiba et al., 2017)(Grenier et al., 2022). The presence of PEGylated lipids in LNPs extends their circulation time in vivo, which is particularly advantageous for intravenous injection (Samaridou et al., 2020)(Suzuki et al., 2016). Upon entering the circulation, PEGylated lipids facilitate the interaction of LNPs with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in serum, promoting subsequent binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which is primarily located in the liver (Shi et al., 2021)(Sahay et al., 2013)."

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

                            "Akinc et al. [84] discovered that ionizable LNPs (iLNPs) adsorbing apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can enhance the uptake of LNPs via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) pathway, thereby targeting hepatocytes endogenously. Building on this finding, Johnson's team screened a chemically diverse library of ionizable cationic lipids and identified the amino lipid 5A2-SC8. [85] LNPs formulated with 5A2-SC8/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG exhibited higher in vivo delivery efficiency compared to another construct with similar physical properties, 3A5-SC14/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG. This discrepancy arises because different LNPs adsorb distinct proteins, forming varied protein coronas during delivery. Specifically, 5A2-SC8 LNPs adsorb a significant amount of ApoE, facilitating hepatocyte endocytosis via LDL-R, whereas 3A5-SC14 LNPs predominantly adsorb albumin, which is readily phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. Notably, 3A5-SC14 LNPs demonstrated a higher hepatocyte accumulation rate in vitro than 5A2-SC8. Further studies on LNP protein coronas revealed that altering the carbon chain length of PEG lipids and the molar percentage of PEGs also affects the adsorbed protein corona. Pre-incubation of ApoE with various LNPs indicated that ApoE promoted uptake only in C14-PEG LNPs, not C18-PEG LNPs, highlighting that small differences in LNP composition can influence both the type of protein corona and its effect on LNP uptake.

The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021). Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression (Dilliard et al., 2021)",

In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021)."

After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona. This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition. Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs. Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models. A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern. For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich."

It is now well acknowledged that upon systemic administration, biomolecules from blood will adsorb onto nanoparticles' surfaces, forming a \"protein corona\", affording nanoparticles a \"biological identity\" on top of their \"synthetic identity\". Detailed analysis of nanoparticle protein corona is gradually revealing the \"missing link\" between nanoparticle chemical properties and the biological identity. Nevertheless, the discovery of nanoparticle protein corona's impact on tumor delivery is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that protein corona can be manipulated by formulation composition and particle surface charge changes, and a single lipid switch could switch the nanoparticle protein corona profile. The protein corona composition differences had a profound impact on cell transfection, in vivo biodistribution as well as tumor-specific delivery efficiency. Nanoparticles with apolipoprotein-rich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. In addition, we found that, the PEG conjugated lipid chain length and PEG amount in LNPs were key factors to consider in successful RNA interference therapy for solid tumors."

                            "The physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo. A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [203]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [46, 204]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171], with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205], and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [206]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207]; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo."

                            "Background: When nanoparticles (NPs) are applied into a biological fluid, such as blood, proteins bind rapidly to their surface forming a so-called \"protein corona\". These proteins are strongly attached to the NP surface and confers them a new biological identity that is crucial for the biological response in terms of body biodistribution, cellular uptake, and toxicity. The corona is dynamic in nature and it is well known that the composition varies in dependence of the physicochemical properties of the NPs. In the present study we investigated the protein corona that forms around poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs at different serum concentrations using two substantially different serum types, namely fetal bovine serum (FBS) and human serum. The corona was characterized by means of sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Bradford protein assay, zeta potential measurements, and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). Additionally, the time-dependent cell interaction of PLGA NPs in the absence or presence of a preformed protein corona was assessed by in vitro incubation experiments with the human liver cancer cell line HepG2. Results: Our data revealed that the physiological environment critically affects the protein adsorption on PLGA NPs with significant impact on the NP\u2013cell interaction. Under comparable conditions the protein amount forming the protein corona depends on the serum type used and the serum concentration. On PLGA NPs incubated with either FBS or human serum a clear difference in qualitative corona protein composition was identified by SDS-PAGE and LC\u2013MS/MS in combination with bioinformatic protein classification. In the case of human serum a considerable change in corona composition was observed leading to a concentration-dependent desorption of abundant proteins in conjunction with an adsorption of high-affinity proteins with lower abundance. Cell incubation experiments revealed that the respective corona composition showed significant influence on the resulting nanoparticle\u2013cell interaction. Conclusion: Controlling protein corona formation is still a challenging task and our data highlight the need for a rational future experimental design in order to enable a prediction of the corona formation on nanoparticle surfaces and, therefore, the resulting biodistribution in the body."

Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver.\n\nThe protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge."

                "text": "\nThe formation of a biomolecular corona on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) profoundly transforms their synthetic identity into a new biological identity, fundamentally altering how they interact with biological systems. This corona changes crucial surface properties of LNPs, including charge, hydrophilicity, stability, and targeting capabilities, which collectively determine their biological fate. <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"261886868\" paperTitle=\"(Debnath et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"273531369\" paperTitle=\"(Renzi et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of the biomolecular corona is on the cellular recognition and uptake of LNPs. When LNPs become coated with opsonins such as immunoglobulins, fibronectin, and complement proteins, they are readily recognized and cleared by phagocytic cells, substantially reducing their circulation time. <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"16024780\" paperTitle=\"(Neagu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"235596708\" paperTitle=\"(Pilkington et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> Conversely, adsorption of apolipoproteins like ApoE can extend circulation half-lives while facilitating LNP uptake through specific receptors, such as LDL receptors on hepatocytes, which was critical to the success of Onpattro\u00ae. <Paper corpusId=\"248947767\" paperTitle=\"(Kazemian et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221122365\" paperTitle=\"(Francia et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"47397011\" paperTitle=\"(Akinc et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe corona can significantly impact the targeting capabilities of LNPs, sometimes in contradictory ways. On one hand, the protein corona may impede targeted delivery by masking surface-bound targeting ligands that are necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition. <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> On the other hand, the corona itself can act as a natural targeting mechanism when it acquires proteins with receptor-binding capabilities. This has been demonstrated with vitronectin-rich coronas that promote efficient uptake in cancer cells expressing high levels of the vitronectin \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin receptor. <Paper corpusId=\"265975577\" paperTitle=\"(Pozzi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"206788144\" paperTitle=\"(Caracciolo et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe composition of the corona also determines the biodistribution patterns of LNPs following systemic administration. For example, LNPs with ApoE-rich coronas are predominantly directed to the liver, while those with fibrinogen-rich coronas show enhanced endothelial cell adhesion and may target the lungs. <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al._1, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> This selective organ targeting based on corona composition provides opportunities for developing tissue-specific delivery strategies without the need for synthetic targeting ligands.\n\nThe corona's impact extends to the immune recognition of LNPs, with significant implications for both safety and efficacy. The protein layer surrounding LNPs strongly affects their interaction with immune cells, potentially triggering or modulating immune responses. <Paper corpusId=\"261886868\" paperTitle=\"(Debnath et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> Recent research has shown that artificial coronas enriched with specific proteins like gelsolin can be used to fine-tune immune responses, suggesting potential applications in immunomodulatory therapies. <Paper corpusId=\"265975577\" paperTitle=\"(Pozzi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"246014579\" paperTitle=\"(Giulimondi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nAn important consideration is that the corona can reach maximum thickness when protein adsorption and desorption rates achieve equilibrium. Studies have shown that conjugating targeting ligands to this equilibrated corona enables more efficient delivery to target cells compared to attaching ligands to naked nanoparticles, which resulted in a 55% reduction in binding affinity to target cells in serum. <Paper corpusId=\"268147071\" paperTitle=\"(Lin et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> This highlights the importance of considering corona formation when designing targeted LNP systems.\n\nThe impact of the corona on LNP function presents both challenges and opportunities. While the corona can interfere with the intended function of engineered LNPs by masking surface properties, understanding and manipulating corona formation offers new strategies for enhancing delivery efficiency and specificity. <Paper corpusId=\"239135396\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"265975577\" paperTitle=\"(Pozzi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> By designing LNPs that selectively recruit beneficial proteins while minimizing the adsorption of proteins that promote clearance, researchers can develop more effective delivery systems with improved pharmacokinetics and targeting capabilities.",

It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity (Monopoli et al., 2012). LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination (Moghimi et al., 2017)."

Yet, the ability of LNPs to effectively encapsulate large-size DNA molecules remains elusive. This is a significant limitation, as the successful delivery of large-size DNA holds immense potential for gene therapy. To address this gap, the present study focuses on the design of PEGylated LNPs, incorporating large-sized DNA, departing from traditional RNA and ionizable lipids. The resultant LNPs demonstrate a unique particle morphology. These particles were further engineered with a DNA coating and plasma proteins. This multicomponent bionanoconstruct exhibits enhanced transfection efficiency and safety in controlled laboratory settings and improved immune system evasion in in vivo tests. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and development of bionanoarchitectures for large-size DNA delivery, opening new avenues for transformative gene therapies."

Upon introduction to a complex biological system, nanomaterials dynamically interact with all the encountered biomolecules and form the protein \"bio-corona.\" The decoration with these surface biomolecules endows nanoparticles with new properties. The present review will address updates of the protein bio-corona characteristics as influenced by nanoparticle\u2019s physicochemical properties and by the particularities of the encountered biological milieu. Undeniably, bio-corona generation influences the efficacy of the nanodrug and guides the actions of innate and adaptive immunity. Exploiting the dynamic process of protein bio-corona development in combination with the new engineered horizons of drugs linked to nanoparticles could lead to innovative functional nanotherapies. Therefore, bio-medical nanotechnologies should focus on the interactions of nanoparticles with the immune system for both safety and efficacy reasons."

                            "The physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo. A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [203]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [46, 204]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171], with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205], and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [206]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207]; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo."

One of the most important serum proteins that coat the LNPs surface is apolipoprotein E (ApoE). ApoE is recognized by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which highly expressed on hepatocytes. When LNPs are systemically administered, serum ApoE adsorbed onto the surface of the particles creates an inherent receptor-mediated uptake into hepatoma cells and hepatocytes.

                            "Gene therapy holds great potential for treating almost any disease by gene silencing, protein expression, or gene correction. To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be highly efficient carriers of short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to hepatocytes in vivo; however, the precise mechanism by which this efficient delivery occurs has yet to be elucidated. We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

                            "The protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems. After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona. This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition. Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs. Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models. A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern. For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich."

                            "Upon in vivo administration (e.g., i.v., subcutaneous injection, etc.) NPs get coated by a protein corona that provides them with a new biological identity that controls physiological response. (Ke et al., 2017) In previous works, we have shown that the protein corona acquired by lipid vesicles has a composition that is simultaneously regulated by the electrical charge and by the affinity of lipids for individual proteins or specific classes of plasma proteins. (Giulimondi et al., 2019) The protein corona regulates the interaction with immune system cells in vitro and ex vivo. (Giulimondi et al., 2022) hese findings prompted us to create biomimetic lipoplexes with an artificial opsonin-deficient protein corona that minimizes the uptake by immune cells in vivo. (Giulimondi et al., 2022) We have also demonstrated that the protein corona of lipoplexes locks onto receptors of cancer cells, promoting internalization by a receptor-mediated mechanism. It was the case of DOTAP/ DNA lipoplexes coated by a vitronectin-enriched protein corona. We showed that vitronectin promotes efficient uptake in cancer cells expressing high levels of the vitronectin \u03b1 \u03bd \u03b2 3 integrin receptor. (Caracciolo et al., 2013)"

                            "On one hand, following systemic administration, LNPs interact with specific proteins and biomolecules in the bloodstream, forming a layer of adsorbed ''protein corona'' on their surface. 25 The composition of this protein corona varies based on the type and properties of LNPs, including factors, such as composition, charge, size, surface chemistry, etc., predominantly affecting cellular uptake and biodistribution. 26\n\nOnce injected into the bloodstream, LNPs can selectively control the adsorption of specific plasma proteins, acting as targeted ligands to direct LNPs to selected organs. Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver.\n\nThe protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge."

However, the limited clinical translation of PEGylated liposomes is mainly due to the protein corona formation and the subsequent modification of liposomes\u2019 synthetic identity, which affects their interactions with immune cells and blood residency. Here we exploit the electric charge of DNA to generate unPEGylated liposome/DNA complexes that, upon exposure to human plasma, gets covered with an opsonin-deficient protein corona. The final product of the synthetic process is a biomimetic nanoparticle type covered by a proteonucleotidic corona, or \"proteoDNAsome\", which maintains its synthetic identity in vivo and is able to slip past the immune system more efficiently than PEGylated liposomes. Accumulation of proteoDNAsomes in the spleen and the liver was lower than that of PEGylated systems. Our work highlights the importance of generating stable biomolecular coronas in the development of stealth unPEGylated particles, thus providing a connection between the biological behavior of particles in vivo and their synthetic identity."

Lipid-based nanoparticles are, however, difficult to study analytically and so our understanding of the interaction between LNPs and biological systems remains obscure, particularly in terms of biomolecular corona formation and the impact this has on therapeutic efficacy and targeting. Ideally, we would like to engineer particles to acquire corona components that facilitate targeting, cargo delivery and improved safety. This requires studying the relationship between LNPs, biofluids and the resulting coronas. The particle-corona complexes are, however, fragile and biofluids also contain particles (such as lipoproteins) with sizes and biochemical characteristics similar to lipid nanoparticles, so contamination with biological components is a challenge."

The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes (Dilliard et al., 2021).

The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery (Dilliard et al., 2021). In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis (Eygeris et al., 2021)."

These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. (Pozzi et al., 2014) Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands. (Caracciolo, 2015)",

                            "Gene therapy holds great potential for treating almost any disease by gene silencing, protein expression, or gene correction. To efficiently deliver the nucleic acid payload to its target tissue, the genetic material needs to be combined with a delivery platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be excellent delivery vectors for gene therapy and are increasingly entering into routine clinical practice. Over the past two decades, the optimization of LNP formulations for nucleic acid delivery has led to a well-established body of knowledge culminating in the first-ever RNA interference therapeutic using LNP technology, i.e. Onpattro\u00ae, and many more in clinical development to deliver various nucleic acid payloads. Screening a lipid library in vivo for optimal gene silencing potency in hepatocytes resulted in the identification of the Onpattro\u00ae formulation. Subsequent studies discovered that the key to Onpattro\u00ae's liver tropism is its ability to form a specific \"biomolecular corona\". In fact, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), among other proteins, adsorbed to the LNP surface enables specific hepatocyte targeting. This proof-of-principle example demonstrates the use of the biomolecular corona for targeting specific receptors and cells, thereby opening up the road to rationally designing LNPs. To date, however, only a few studies have explored in detail the corona of LNPs and how to efficiently modulate the corona remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries about the biomolecular corona, expanding the knowledge gained with other nanoparticles to LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. In particular, we address how particle stability, biodistribution, and targeting of LNPs can be influenced by the biological environment. Onpattro\u00ae is used as a case study to describe both the successful development of an LNP formulation for gene therapy and the key influence of the biological environment. Moreover, we outline the techniques available to isolate and analyze the corona of LNPs, and we highlight their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the biomolecular corona for LNP delivery and we examine the potential of exploiting the corona as a targeting strategy beyond the liver to develop next-generation gene therapies."

We found that apolipoprotein E (apoE), which plays a major role in the clearance and hepatocellular uptake of physiological lipoproteins, also acts as an endogenous targeting ligand for ionizable LNPs (iLNPs), but not cationic LNPs (cLNPs). The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE-/- mice. Receptor dependence was explored in vitro and in vivo using low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR-/-)-deficient mice. As an alternative to endogenous apoE-based targeting, we developed a targeting approach using an exogenous ligand containing a multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-cluster, which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes. Both apoE-based endogenous and GalNAc-based exogenous targeting appear to be highly effective strategies for the delivery of iLNPs to liver."

                            "Akinc et al. [84] discovered that ionizable LNPs (iLNPs) adsorbing apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can enhance the uptake of LNPs via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) pathway, thereby targeting hepatocytes endogenously. Building on this finding, Johnson's team screened a chemically diverse library of ionizable cationic lipids and identified the amino lipid 5A2-SC8. [85] LNPs formulated with 5A2-SC8/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG exhibited higher in vivo delivery efficiency compared to another construct with similar physical properties, 3A5-SC14/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG. This discrepancy arises because different LNPs adsorb distinct proteins, forming varied protein coronas during delivery. Specifically, 5A2-SC8 LNPs adsorb a significant amount of ApoE, facilitating hepatocyte endocytosis via LDL-R, whereas 3A5-SC14 LNPs predominantly adsorb albumin, which is readily phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. Notably, 3A5-SC14 LNPs demonstrated a higher hepatocyte accumulation rate in vitro than 5A2-SC8. Further studies on LNP protein coronas revealed that altering the carbon chain length of PEG lipids and the molar percentage of PEGs also affects the adsorbed protein corona. Pre-incubation of ApoE with various LNPs indicated that ApoE promoted uptake only in C14-PEG LNPs, not C18-PEG LNPs, highlighting that small differences in LNP composition can influence both the type of protein corona and its effect on LNP uptake.

                            "On one hand, following systemic administration, LNPs interact with specific proteins and biomolecules in the bloodstream, forming a layer of adsorbed ''protein corona'' on their surface. 25 The composition of this protein corona varies based on the type and properties of LNPs, including factors, such as composition, charge, size, surface chemistry, etc., predominantly affecting cellular uptake and biodistribution. 26\n\nOnce injected into the bloodstream, LNPs can selectively control the adsorption of specific plasma proteins, acting as targeted ligands to direct LNPs to selected organs. Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver.\n\nThe protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge."

A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [203]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [46, 204]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171], with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205], and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [206]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207]; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo."

The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022)(Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022)."

To explore this we analyze naturally efficacious biocorona compositions using an unbiased screening workflow. First, LNPs are complexed with plasma samples, from individual lean or obese male rats, and then functionally evaluated in vitro. Then, a fast, automated, and miniaturized method retrieves the LNPs with intact biocoronas, and multiomics analysis of the LNP-corona complexes reveals the particle corona content arising from each individual plasma sample. We find that the most efficacious LNP-corona complexes were enriched with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and, compared to the commonly used corona-biomarker Apolipoprotein E, corona HDL content was a superior predictor of in-vivo activity. Using technically challenging and clinically relevant lipid nanoparticles, these methods reveal a previously unreported role for HDL as a source of ApoE and, form a framework for improving LNP therapeutic efficacy by controlling corona composition."

Although the precise mechanisms by which LNPs safeguard mRNA are still not fully understood, it is known that the ionizable lipids in LNPs become protonated in the acidic environment of the endosome (pH <7). This protonation promotes lipid exchange between LNPs and the anionic phospholipids in the endosomal membrane, leading to membrane fusion. This fusion enables the release of mRNA into the cytosol, where it can be translated into proteins. ApoE enhances this process by helping the mRNA evade the endosomal degradation pathway (Sebastiani et al., 2021)."

                            "Emerging therapeutic treatments based on the production of proteins by delivering mRNA have become increasingly important in recent times. While lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are approved vehicles for small interfering RNA delivery, there are still challenges to use this formulation for mRNA delivery. LNPs are typically a mixture of a cationic lipid, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and a PEG-lipid. The structural characterization of mRNA-containing LNPs (mRNA-LNPs) is crucial for a full understanding of the way in which they function, but this information alone is not enough to predict their fate upon entering the bloodstream. The biodistribution and cellular uptake of LNPs are affected by their surface composition as well as by the extracellular proteins present at the site of LNP administration, e.g., apolipoproteinE (ApoE). ApoE, being responsible for fat transport in the body, plays a key role in the LNP\u2019s plasma circulation time. In this work, we use small-angle neutron scattering, together with selective lipid, cholesterol, and solvent deuteration, to elucidate the structure of the LNP and the distribution of the lipid components in the absence and the presence of ApoE. While DSPC and cholesterol are found to be enriched at the surface of the LNPs in buffer, binding of ApoE induces a redistribution of the lipids at the shell and the core, which also impacts the LNP internal structure, causing release of mRNA. The rearrangement of LNP components upon ApoE incubation is discussed in terms of potential relevance to LNP endosomal escape."

                "text": "\nThe biomolecular corona has evolved from being viewed as an obstacle to targeted delivery to being recognized as an opportunity for enhancing LNP functionality. While traditional approaches relied on PEGylation to create a steric barrier that reduces protein adsorption and opsonization <Paper corpusId=\"248985930\" paperTitle=\"(Ly et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>, it's now understood that complete prevention of corona formation is not feasible, even with PEGylated systems <Paper corpusId=\"263607931\" paperTitle=\"(Amici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"3328751\" paperTitle=\"(Pozzi et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. Instead, researchers are developing strategies to manipulate the corona composition or to intentionally pre-coat LNPs with beneficial proteins.\n\nOne approach involves engineering LNPs to selectively recruit proteins that facilitate specific cellular interactions. For example, by modifying LNP composition to promote the formation of vitronectin-rich coronas, researchers have achieved efficient uptake in cancer cells expressing high levels of the vitronectin \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin receptor <Paper corpusId=\"265975577\" paperTitle=\"(Pozzi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"206788144\" paperTitle=\"(Caracciolo et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, replacing cholesterol with cationic DC-cholesterol can shift the corona from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich, significantly affecting tumor-specific delivery <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"203153060\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAn emerging strategy involves creating \"artificial coronas\" by pre-coating LNPs with specific human plasma proteins. This approach has been used to develop biomimetic nanoparticles covered with opsonin-deficient protein coronas that can evade immune cell recognition more effectively than traditional PEGylated liposomes <Paper corpusId=\"265975577\" paperTitle=\"(Pozzi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"246014579\" paperTitle=\"(Giulimondi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Recent research has also shown that artificial coronas enriched with gelsolin, a plasma protein that modulates immune responses, can be used to fine-tune interactions with immune cells, opening new possibilities for immunomodulatory therapies <Paper corpusId=\"265975577\" paperTitle=\"(Pozzi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"250321000\" paperTitle=\"(Giulimondi et al._1, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAn innovative approach considers the timing of targeting ligand attachment. Studies have shown that when targeting ligands are conjugated to nanoparticles with an already-formed, equilibrated protein corona, they maintain higher binding affinity to target cells compared to ligands attached to naked nanoparticles, which showed a 55% reduction in binding affinity when exposed to serum <Paper corpusId=\"268147071\" paperTitle=\"(Lin et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that attaching targeting moieties after corona formation may be more effective than traditional approaches.\n\nThese engineered corona strategies represent a paradigm shift in LNP design, moving from efforts to prevent protein adsorption toward deliberately exploiting the corona as an inherent targeting moiety <Paper corpusId=\"263607931\" paperTitle=\"(Amici et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. By understanding and controlling the composition of the biomolecular corona, researchers can develop LNPs with enhanced tissue specificity, reduced immune clearance, and improved therapeutic efficacy. This approach leverages natural biological processes rather than fighting against them, potentially opening new avenues for targeted delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics.",

                            "In recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs. These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. (Pozzi et al., 2014) Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands.

Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages. However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system. To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains. Nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis allowed us to accurately determine the corona composition showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins. Due to the abundance of apolipoproteins, we exploited the \"protein corona effect\" to deliver cationic liposome-human plasma complexes to human prostate cancer PC3 cells that express a high level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in order to evaluate the cellular uptake efficiency of the systems used. Combining laser scanning confocal microscopy with flow cytometry analysis in PC3 cells we demonstrated that MC-PEG2k is the best compromise between an anti-opsonization strategy and active targeting and could be a promising candidate to treat prostate cancer in vivo."

(Giulimondi et al., 2019) The protein corona regulates the interaction with immune system cells in vitro and ex vivo. (Giulimondi et al., 2022) hese findings prompted us to create biomimetic lipoplexes with an artificial opsonin-deficient protein corona that minimizes the uptake by immune cells in vivo. (Giulimondi et al., 2022) We have also demonstrated that the protein corona of lipoplexes locks onto receptors of cancer cells, promoting internalization by a receptor-mediated mechanism. It was the case of DOTAP/ DNA lipoplexes coated by a vitronectin-enriched protein corona. We showed that vitronectin promotes efficient uptake in cancer cells expressing high levels of the vitronectin \u03b1 \u03bd \u03b2 3 integrin receptor. (Caracciolo et al., 2013)"

                            "The protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems. After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona. This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition. Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs. Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models. A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern. For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich."

                            "The application of lipid-based nanoparticle (LNP) delivery systems remains a popular strategy for the systemic delivery of gene therapies to specific disease targets, including solid tumors. It is now well acknowledged that upon systemic administration, biomolecules from blood will adsorb onto nanoparticles' surfaces, forming a \"protein corona\", affording nanoparticles a \"biological identity\" on top of their \"synthetic identity\". Detailed analysis of nanoparticle protein corona is gradually revealing the \"missing link\" between nanoparticle chemical properties and the biological identity. Nevertheless, the discovery of nanoparticle protein corona's impact on tumor delivery is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that protein corona can be manipulated by formulation composition and particle surface charge changes, and a single lipid switch could switch the nanoparticle protein corona profile. The protein corona composition differences had a profound impact on cell transfection, in vivo biodistribution as well as tumor-specific delivery efficiency. Nanoparticles with apolipoprotein-rich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona. In addition, we found that, the PEG conjugated lipid chain length and PEG amount in LNPs were key factors to consider in successful RNA interference therapy for solid tumors."

                            "For several decades, surface grafted polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been a go-to strategy for preserving the synthetic identity of liposomes in physiological milieu and preventing clearance by immune cells. However, the limited clinical translation of PEGylated liposomes is mainly due to the protein corona formation and the subsequent modification of liposomes\u2019 synthetic identity, which affects their interactions with immune cells and blood residency. Here we exploit the electric charge of DNA to generate unPEGylated liposome/DNA complexes that, upon exposure to human plasma, gets covered with an opsonin-deficient protein corona. The final product of the synthetic process is a biomimetic nanoparticle type covered by a proteonucleotidic corona, or \"proteoDNAsome\", which maintains its synthetic identity in vivo and is able to slip past the immune system more efficiently than PEGylated liposomes. Accumulation of proteoDNAsomes in the spleen and the liver was lower than that of PEGylated systems. Our work highlights the importance of generating stable biomolecular coronas in the development of stealth unPEGylated particles, thus providing a connection between the biological behavior of particles in vivo and their synthetic identity."

Here we demonstrate that nanoparticles with a protein corona enriched with gelsolin (GSN), an abundant plasma protein that acts as a modulator of immune responses, are avidly captured by human monocytic THP-1 cells in vitro and by leukocyte subpopulations derived from healthy donors ex vivo. In human monocytes, GSN modulates the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in an inverse dose-dependent manner. Overall, our results suggest that artificial coronas can be exploited to finely tune the immune response, opening new approaches for the prevention and treatment of diseases."

A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al., 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles."
