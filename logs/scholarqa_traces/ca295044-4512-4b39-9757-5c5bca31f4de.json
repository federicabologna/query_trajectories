                    "text": "Successful recombinant protein expression and purification is frequently indispensable for both basic research studies and biotechnological and commercial applications [166]. Highthroughput protein expression and purification in E. coli has begun to revolutionize the manner in which studies are conducted in various research fields. Experiments that were typically performed manually to address one protein at a time over a period of several weeks can now be conducted for hundreds of proteins in as little as one week. However, limitations still exist and further improvements are possible. In terms of obtaining target genes, in silico design followed by array-based de novo synthesis rather than PCR may become widely used in the future. The major challenges associated with de novo synthesis are sequence errors, availability and cost. However, if array-based gene synthesis can be commercialized, the costs could decrease by 3-5 orders of magnitude to 10 3 -10 5 bp per dollar [25].\n\nCloning methods have seen rapid advances, and cloning systems used in both commercial and academic settings can be operated with high efficiency, fidelity and reliability, and at a reasonably low cost. The first requirement is to develop a highly flexible expression vector that is fully compatible with high-throughput procedures. An optimal vector must contain a strong but tunable promoter and tags with optimized N-terminal codons to facilitate protein expression, solubility and purification. Large N-terminal tags have been used to enhance translational initiation and promote solubility.

Jeon\n## Abstract\nThe ease of genetic manipulation, low cost, rapid growth and number of previous studies have made Escherichia coli one of the most widely used microorganism species for producing recombinant proteins. In this post-genomic era, challenges remain to rapidly express and purify large numbers of proteins for academic and commercial purposes in a high-throughput manner. In this review, we describe several state-of-the-art approaches that are suitable for the cloning, expression and purification, conducted in parallel, of numerous molecules, and we discuss recent progress related to soluble protein expression, mRNA folding, fusion tags, post-translational modification and production of membrane proteins. Moreover, we address the ongoing efforts to overcome various challenges faced in protein expression in E. coli, which could lead to an improvement of the current system from trial and error to a predictable and rational design.\n## Conclusion and perspectives\nSuccessful recombinant protein expression and purification is frequently indispensable for both basic research studies and biotechnological and commercial applications [166]. Highthroughput protein expression and purification in E. coli has begun to revolutionize the manner in which studies are conducted in various research fields. Experiments that were typically performed manually to address one protein at a time over a period of several weeks can now be conducted for hundreds of proteins in as little as one week. However, limitations still exist and further improvements are possible. In terms of obtaining target genes, in silico design followed by array-based de novo synthesis rather than PCR may become widely used in the future. The major challenges associated with de novo synthesis are sequence errors, availability and cost. However, if array-based gene synthesis can be commercialized, the costs could decrease by 3-5 orders of magnitude to 10 3 -10 5 bp per dollar [25].\n\nCloning methods have seen rapid advances, and cloning systems used in both commercial and academic settings can be operated with high efficiency, fidelity and reliability, and at a reasonably low cost. The first requirement is to develop a highly flexible expression vector that is fully compatible with high-throughput procedures. An optimal vector must contain a strong but tunable promoter and tags with optimized N-terminal codons to facilitate protein expression, solubility and purification. Large N-terminal tags have been used to enhance translational initiation and promote solubility. However, the cleavage of these large tags may complicate the experiment being conducted and substantially add to the final cost compared to the use of short tags. Given that the downstream costs of testing the functions of individual proteins are often far higher than protein production costs, the cost will probably not dramatically affect experimental workflows. Moreover, new tags are being developed, but considerable room for improvement remains.\n\nCurrently, certain post-translational modifications can be achieved in E. coli by coexpressing the corresponding enzymes. However, such coexpression invariably affects the growth rate of E. coli, and several vectors cannot be readily coexpressed in a single strain. One solution is to integrate genes encoding post-translational modification factors into the genome to create 'eukaryotic-like' E. coli.

Important applications of recombinant proteins are: (1) immunization, (2) biochemical studies, (3) three-dimensional analysis of the protein, and (4) biotechnological and therapeutic use. Production of recombinant proteins involves cloning of the appropriate gene into an expression vector under the control of an inducible promoter. But efficient expression of the recombinant gene depends on a variety of factors such as optimal expression signals (both at the level of transcription and translation), correct protein folding and cell growth characteristics. Display of recombinant proteins on the bacterial surface has many potential biotechnological applications and requires further knowledge on targeting motifs present on carrier proteins usually used as fusion partners. In addition, the selection of a particular expression system requires a cost breakdown in terms of design, process and other economic considerations. The relative merits of bacterial, yeast, insect and mammalian expression systems have been reviewed in Marino (1989). \n\nThis review article deals exclusively with Escherichia coli cells as a protein factory. Despite its extensive knowledge on genetics and molecular biology, there is no a priori guarantee that every gene can be expressed efficiently in this Gram-negative bacterium. Factors influencing the expression level include unique and subtle structural features of the gene sequence, the stability and efficiency of mRNA, correct and efficient protein folding, codon usage, degradation of the recombinant protein by ATP-dependent proteases and toxicity of the protein. The objectives of this article are to review the potential influence of these different parameters on the yield of recombinant proteins and to provide the reader with practical suggestions allowing optimization of recombinant protein production and targeting to different compartments of the bacterial cell.

The present review will deal with E. coli as protein factory and will cover some of the aspects related to transcriptional and translational expression signals, factors affecting protein stability and solubility and targeting of proteins to different cell compartments. Based on the knowledge accumulated over the last decade, we believe that the rate of success for those dedicated to expression of recombinant proteins based on the use E. coli strains can still be significantly improved.\n## Introduction\nHigh-level production of recombinant proteins as a prerequisite for subsequent purification has become a standard technique. Important applications of recombinant proteins are: (1) immunization, (2) biochemical studies, (3) three-dimensional analysis of the protein, and (4) biotechnological and therapeutic use. Production of recombinant proteins involves cloning of the appropriate gene into an expression vector under the control of an inducible promoter. But efficient expression of the recombinant gene depends on a variety of factors such as optimal expression signals (both at the level of transcription and translation), correct protein folding and cell growth characteristics. Display of recombinant proteins on the bacterial surface has many potential biotechnological applications and requires further knowledge on targeting motifs present on carrier proteins usually used as fusion partners. In addition, the selection of a particular expression system requires a cost breakdown in terms of design, process and other economic considerations. The relative merits of bacterial, yeast, insect and mammalian expression systems have been reviewed in Marino (1989). \n\nThis review article deals exclusively with Escherichia coli cells as a protein factory. Despite its extensive knowledge on genetics and molecular biology, there is no a priori guarantee that every gene can be expressed efficiently in this Gram-negative bacterium. Factors influencing the expression level include unique and subtle structural features of the gene sequence, the stability and efficiency of mRNA, correct and efficient protein folding, codon usage, degradation of the recombinant protein by ATP-dependent proteases and toxicity of the protein. The objectives of this article are to review the potential influence of these different parameters on the yield of recombinant proteins and to provide the reader with practical suggestions allowing optimization of recombinant protein production and targeting to different compartments of the bacterial cell. For earlier reviews on high-level of gene expression in E. coli see Makrides (1996) and Swartz (2001).",

Molecular chaperones and folding catalysts appear to present a panacea for problems of heterologous protein folding in the organism, due largely to their broad substrate range compared with, e.g., protein-specific mutagenesis approaches. Painstaking investigation of chaperone overproduction has, however, met with mixed \u2013 and largely unpredictable \u2013 results to date. The past 5 years have nevertheless seen an explosion in interest in exploiting the native folding modulators of E. coli, and particularly cocktails thereof, driven largely by the availability of plasmid systems that facilitate simultaneous, non-rational screening of multiple chaperones during recombinant protein expression. As interest in using E. coli to produce recombinant membrane proteins and even glycoproteins grows, approaches to reduce aggregation, delay host cell lysis and optimise expression of difficult-to-express recombinant proteins will become even more critical over the coming years. In this review, we critically evaluate the performance of molecular chaperones and folding catalysts native to E. coli in improving functional production of heterologous proteins in the bacterium and we discuss how they might best be exploited to provide increased amounts of correctly-folded, active protein for biochemical and biophysical studies.",

Despite its widespread use [2], however, many heterologous proteins are produced as insoluble aggregates in cytoplasmic or periplasmic inclusion bodies, while the membrane leakiness and cell lysis associated with making heterologous proteins in E. coli, leading to significantly reduced yields, have also been well documented [3,4].\n\nThe discovery of molecular chaperones and folding catalysts appeared to present a panacea for protein aggregation and cell lysis problems in E. coli [5][6][7]. Molecular chaperones prevent aggregation by binding exposed hydrophobic moieties in unfolded, partially folded or misfolded polypeptides and traffic molecules to their sub-cellular destination, while folding catalysts catalyse potentially rate-limiting steps in the folding process, such as peptidyl bond isomerisation or disulfide bond formation. Painstaking investigation of these molecules has met with disparate results to date as simple overexpression of a single modulator in the absence of its accessory molecules frequently sees no positive effect -and may simply increase the production load to the further detriment of the recombinant target. In the absence of an ability to predict the relevant bottleneck in E. coli, therefore, an increasingly common approach by researchers is the use of chaperone \"cocktails\", which is facilitated by the recent availability of a number of plasmid systems that can be used to co-produce up to 6-7 folding modulators with a heterologous protein [8,9].\n\nA universal system of producing active, recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a core objective of the biotechnology industry. In this paper, we review progress in exploiting folding modulators from E. coli to improve the functional production of heterologous proteins.",

Spada, S. Robin, J. G. Wall\n## Abstract\nDespite the fundamental importance of E. coli in the manufacture of a wide range of biotechnological and biomedical products, extensive process and/or target optimisation is routinely required in order to achieve functional yields in excess of low mg/l levels. Molecular chaperones and folding catalysts appear to present a panacea for problems of heterologous protein folding in the organism, due largely to their broad substrate range compared with, e.g., protein-specific mutagenesis approaches. Painstaking investigation of chaperone overproduction has, however, met with mixed \u2013 and largely unpredictable \u2013 results to date. The past 5 years have nevertheless seen an explosion in interest in exploiting the native folding modulators of E. coli, and particularly cocktails thereof, driven largely by the availability of plasmid systems that facilitate simultaneous, non-rational screening of multiple chaperones during recombinant protein expression. As interest in using E. coli to produce recombinant membrane proteins and even glycoproteins grows, approaches to reduce aggregation, delay host cell lysis and optimise expression of difficult-to-express recombinant proteins will become even more critical over the coming years. In this review, we critically evaluate the performance of molecular chaperones and folding catalysts native to E. coli in improving functional production of heterologous proteins in the bacterium and we discuss how they might best be exploited to provide increased amounts of correctly-folded, active protein for biochemical and biophysical studies.\n## Background\nE. coli is preferred for heterologous protein production because of its fast growth, simple fermentation, uncomplicated nutritional and sterility requirements, and extensive characterisation [1]. Despite its widespread use [2], however, many heterologous proteins are produced as insoluble aggregates in cytoplasmic or periplasmic inclusion bodies, while the membrane leakiness and cell lysis associated with making heterologous proteins in E. coli, leading to significantly reduced yields, have also been well documented [3,4].\n\nThe discovery of molecular chaperones and folding catalysts appeared to present a panacea for protein aggregation and cell lysis problems in E. coli [5][6][7]. Molecular chaperones prevent aggregation by binding exposed hydrophobic moieties in unfolded, partially folded or misfolded polypeptides and traffic molecules to their sub-cellular destination, while folding catalysts catalyse potentially rate-limiting steps in the folding process, such as peptidyl bond isomerisation or disulfide bond formation. Painstaking investigation of these molecules has met with disparate results to date as simple overexpression of a single modulator in the absence of its accessory molecules frequently sees no positive effect -and may simply increase the production load to the further detriment of the recombinant target. In the absence of an ability to predict the relevant bottleneck in E. coli, therefore, an increasingly common approach by researchers is the use of chaperone \"cocktails\", which is facilitated by the recent availability of a number of plasmid systems that can be used to co-produce up to 6-7 folding modulators with a heterologous protein [8,9].\n\nA universal system of producing active, recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a core objective of the biotechnology industry. In this paper, we review progress in exploiting folding modulators from E. coli to improve the functional production of heterologous proteins.\n\n## Overview\nThough there are currently no rigid criteria by which one might identify in silico the \"correct\" chaperone(s) to overcome a particular bottleneck in protein production, the present review identifies the co-production strategies that have most successfully overcome the major problems limiting recombinant protein yields in E. coli to date. Based on the current state-of-the-art, therefore, we summarise in Figure 3 some targeted interventions that might be used to focus chaperone screening strategies on already proven approaches, thus increasing the chances of successful production of well-behaved, active protein.",

However, there are some limitations which need to be surmounted such as codon bias, protein folding and solubility issues and post-translational modifications. Several technological advancements have been made to address these issues. Plasmids such as pRARE plasmids have been designed that contain tRNA genes cognate to the rare codons. Co-transformation of these plasmids would increase the copy number of rare tRNA genes in E. coli host and thus would be able to complement the codon usage frequency in heterologous genes. This strategy is very cost-effective and more efficient for enhancing the expression levels of heterologous genes containing large number of rare codons. Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins. Some of the antibodies that have been approved for therapeutic use in humans such as Lucentis and Cimzia have been successfully produced in the periplasm of E. coli, thus confirming the commercial viability of this approach.",

There are marked differences in codon usage between E. coli and humans. \n\nCodons that are found to be very common in human and other eukaryotic genes are very rare \n\nPlasmids for Optimizing Expression of Recombinant Proteins in E. coli 5 in E. coli. Presence of rare codons in heterologous genes can lead to errors in translation and cause low expression levels of recombinant protein in E. coli. The presence of rare codons in heterologous genes might cause translational errors due to ribosomal stalling at these positions. These translational errors include frame-shift mutations, amino acid substitutions or premature translation termination [22]. Some of the rare codons in E. coli that cause problems in recombinant proteins are AGA, CGG, CGA, AGG (arginine), AAG (lysine), GGA (glycine), CUA (leucine), AUA (isoleucine) and CCC (proline) [23]. In E. coli, CGG is a rare arginine codon which occurs at a frequency of 0.54%. McNulty and colleagues demonstrated that the presence of large number of rare arginine codon CGG in p27 protease domain from Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2) resulted in the synthesis of recombinant protein of molecular weight that was 3 kDa higher than the actual molecular weight when expressed in E. coli [22]. The resultant increase in molecular weight was found to be due to the +1 frame-shift mutation at one of the CGG codons at the C-terminus of the viral protein. Besides, glutamine residues were misincorporated instead of arginine due to misreading of CGG as CAG [22]. \n\nVarious strategies have been designed to circumvent the problem of codon bias in E. coli for enhancing the production of authentic, biologically active heterologous recombinant proteins.",

Bora, Mohamed Ahmed\n## Abstract\nPlasmids are important vectors for the transfer of genetic material among microbes. The transfer of plasmids causes transmission of genes involved in pathogenesis and survival, to the host bacteria leading to their evolution and adaptation to diverse environmental conditions. A large number of plasmids of varying sizes have been discovered and isolated from various microorganisms. Plasmids are also valuable tools to genetically manipulate microbes for various purposes including production of recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli is the most preferred microbe for production of recombinant proteins, due to rapid growth rate, cost-effectiveness, high yield of the recombinant proteins and easy scale-up process. Several plasmids have been designed to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli. In order to circumvent the issues of protein refolding, the codon usage in E. coli , the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and low recovery of functionally active recombinant proteins, various plasmids have been designed and constructed. This chapter summarizes the recent technological advancements that have extended the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex proteins, including glycosylated recombinant proteins and therapeutic antibodies. production of complex glycosylated biopharmaceuticals. Wacker and colleagues discovered a novel N-linked glycosylation pathway in bacteria Campylobacter jejuni and demonstrated the successful transfer of glycosylation pathway in E. coli to generate a strain with capability to produce recombinant glycosylated proteins [ 45 ]. These various technological advancements have demonstrated that E. coli can be engineered specifically for each heterologous protein to obtain high yield of biologically active products.\n## Codon usage and plasmid containing tRNA genes cognate to the rare codons\nCodon usage is a major issue while expressing heterologous proteins, particularly human proteins in E. coli. There are marked differences in codon usage between E. coli and humans. \n\nCodons that are found to be very common in human and other eukaryotic genes are very rare \n\nPlasmids for Optimizing Expression of Recombinant Proteins in E. coli 5 in E. coli. Presence of rare codons in heterologous genes can lead to errors in translation and cause low expression levels of recombinant protein in E. coli. The presence of rare codons in heterologous genes might cause translational errors due to ribosomal stalling at these positions. These translational errors include frame-shift mutations, amino acid substitutions or premature translation termination [22]. Some of the rare codons in E. coli that cause problems in recombinant proteins are AGA, CGG, CGA, AGG (arginine), AAG (lysine), GGA (glycine), CUA (leucine), AUA (isoleucine) and CCC (proline) [23]. In E. coli, CGG is a rare arginine codon which occurs at a frequency of 0.54%. McNulty and colleagues demonstrated that the presence of large number of rare arginine codon CGG in p27 protease domain from Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2) resulted in the synthesis of recombinant protein of molecular weight that was 3 kDa higher than the actual molecular weight when expressed in E. coli [22]. The resultant increase in molecular weight was found to be due to the +1 frame-shift mutation at one of the CGG codons at the C-terminus of the viral protein. Besides, glutamine residues were misincorporated instead of arginine due to misreading of CGG as CAG [22]. \n\nVarious strategies have been designed to circumvent the problem of codon bias in E. coli for enhancing the production of authentic, biologically active heterologous recombinant proteins.\n...\nVarious strategies have been designed to circumvent the problem of codon bias in E. coli for enhancing the production of authentic, biologically active heterologous recombinant proteins. One strategy is to synthesize the full-length gene based on codon usage, but the high cost of gene synthesis is a major drawback. Another strategy requires site-directed mutagenesis of the foreign gene to generate codons which correlates with the tRNA pool of E. coli. However, this process is very expensive and time-consuming. Another approach is to co-transform the E. coli with plasmid containing the tRNA gene cognate to the rare codons. By increasing the copy number of rare tRNA genes, E. coli strains can be designed to complement the codon usage frequency in the foreign gene.

This strategy is now routinely being employed for several difficult-to-express heterologous recombinant proteins containing rare codons, in E. coli. Currently, several plasmids such as pRARE plasmids are commercially available which harbour genes encoding for tRNA cognate to rare codons.\n\n## Future perspectives\nE. coli is a preferred expression system for production of heterologous proteins due to its well-characterized genetics, ease of genetic manipulation, availability of several plasmid vectors and engineered host strains, low manufacturing cost, high yield of recombinant proteins as compared to other expression systems including yeast, mammalian cell lines, transgenic plants and transgenic animals. However, there are some limitations which need to be surmounted such as codon bias, protein folding and solubility issues and post-translational modifications. Several technological advancements have been made to address these issues. Plasmids such as pRARE plasmids have been designed that contain tRNA genes cognate to the rare codons. Co-transformation of these plasmids would increase the copy number of rare tRNA genes in E. coli host and thus would be able to complement the codon usage frequency in heterologous genes. This strategy is very cost-effective and more efficient for enhancing the expression levels of heterologous genes containing large number of rare codons. Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins. Some of the antibodies that have been approved for therapeutic use in humans such as Lucentis and Cimzia have been successfully produced in the periplasm of E. coli, thus confirming the commercial viability of this approach.",

Finally, biofilm-based fermentation processes were established, which demonstrated the feasibility of continuous production of hEGF with improved efficiency. The best result was obtained from ychJ-disruption that showed a 28% increase in hEGF secretion over the BL21(DE3) wild strain, from 24 to 32 mg/L. Overexpression of bcsB also showed great potential in continuous immobilized fermentation. Overall, the biofilm engineering here represents an effective strategy to improve hEGF production and can be adapted to produce more recombinant proteins in future.",

                    "text": "With increasing demand for pharmaceutical proteins nowadays, more and more people are devoted to development of efficient biomanufacturing processes for proteins. Escherichia coli (E. coli), as one of the most commonly used host bacteria to express recombinant proteins, has many advantages. For example, high cell density cultures are easily achieved (Lee, 1996), transformation with exogenous genes is fast (Pope and Kent, 1996), and its use as a cell factory is well-established (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). However, commercial production of recombinant proteins by E. coli has remained a challenge. One of the most important problems is that E. coli has a poor ability to secrete proteins, which causes formation of inclusion bodies, low production titers, and complicated downstream purification procedures (Kim et al., 2015). To improve protein secretion efficiency in E. coli, some common strategies have been developed, such as selection of efficient signal peptides like the signal sequences from OmpA (Sun et al., 2019) and PelB (Mohajeri et al., 2016) that usually target proteins to the secretion machinery efficiently. Modification of key transporter proteins or auxiliary proteins involved in transmembrane transport also has been applied to increase the efficiency of protein secretion (Low et al., 2010). In addition, fusion of some peptide tags or proteins, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), also have proved to increase protein expression and extracellular secretion. Other strategies to improve protein secretion include fermentation process parameters control and medium optimization, such as addition of surfactants, osmolytes, metal ions, and glycine to the medium. \n\nRecombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF), a potential therapeutic protein that has been widely used as a healing agent for various chronic wounds, was successfully produced extracellularly in E. coli BL21(DE3) using pectate lyase B (PelB) signal peptide (Sriwidodo et al., 2019).",

In this study, a continuous process for human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) secretion by Escherichia coli was developed by taking advantage of biofilm formation. Genes bcsB, fimH, and csgAcsgB that have proved to facilitate biofilm formation and some genes moaE, yceA, ychJ, and gshB potentially involved in biofilm formation were examined for their effects on hEGF secretion as well as biofilm formation. Finally, biofilm-based fermentation processes were established, which demonstrated the feasibility of continuous production of hEGF with improved efficiency. The best result was obtained from ychJ-disruption that showed a 28% increase in hEGF secretion over the BL21(DE3) wild strain, from 24 to 32 mg/L. Overexpression of bcsB also showed great potential in continuous immobilized fermentation. Overall, the biofilm engineering here represents an effective strategy to improve hEGF production and can be adapted to produce more recombinant proteins in future.\n## INTRODUCTION\nWith increasing demand for pharmaceutical proteins nowadays, more and more people are devoted to development of efficient biomanufacturing processes for proteins. Escherichia coli (E. coli), as one of the most commonly used host bacteria to express recombinant proteins, has many advantages. For example, high cell density cultures are easily achieved (Lee, 1996), transformation with exogenous genes is fast (Pope and Kent, 1996), and its use as a cell factory is well-established (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). However, commercial production of recombinant proteins by E. coli has remained a challenge. One of the most important problems is that E. coli has a poor ability to secrete proteins, which causes formation of inclusion bodies, low production titers, and complicated downstream purification procedures (Kim et al., 2015). To improve protein secretion efficiency in E. coli, some common strategies have been developed, such as selection of efficient signal peptides like the signal sequences from OmpA (Sun et al., 2019) and PelB (Mohajeri et al., 2016) that usually target proteins to the secretion machinery efficiently. Modification of key transporter proteins or auxiliary proteins involved in transmembrane transport also has been applied to increase the efficiency of protein secretion (Low et al., 2010). In addition, fusion of some peptide tags or proteins, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), also have proved to increase protein expression and extracellular secretion. Other strategies to improve protein secretion include fermentation process parameters control and medium optimization, such as addition of surfactants, osmolytes, metal ions, and glycine to the medium. \n\nRecombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF), a potential therapeutic protein that has been widely used as a healing agent for various chronic wounds, was successfully produced extracellularly in E. coli BL21(DE3) using pectate lyase B (PelB) signal peptide (Sriwidodo et al., 2019).",

            "abstract": "BackgroundAcetylation of lysine residues is a reversible post-translational modification conserved from bacteria to humans. Several recent studies have revealed hundreds of lysine-acetylated proteins in various bacteria; however, the physiological role of these modifications remains largely unknown. Since lysine acetylation changes the size and charge of proteins and thereby may affect their conformation, we assumed that lysine acetylation can stimulate aggregation of proteins, especially for overproduced recombinant proteins that form inclusion bodies.ResultsTo verify this assumption, we used Escherichia coli strains that overproduce aggregation-prone VP1GFP protein. We found that in \u0394ackA-pta cells, which display diminished protein acetylation, inclusion bodies were formed with a delay and processed faster than in the wild-type cells. Moreover, in \u0394ackA-pta cells, inclusion bodies exhibited significantly increased specific GFP fluorescence. In CobB deacetylase-deficient cells, in which protein acetylation was enhanced, the formation of inclusion bodies was increased and their processing was significantly inhibited. Similar results were obtained with regard to endogenous protein aggregates formed during the late stationary phase in \u0394ackA-pta and \u0394cobB cells.ConclusionsOur studies revealed that protein acetylation affected the aggregation of endogenous E. coli proteins and the yield, solubility, and biological activity of a model recombinant protein. In general, decreased lysine acetylation inhibited the formation of protein aggregates, whereas increased lysine acetylation stabilized protein aggregates. These findings should be considered during the designing of efficient strategies for the production of recombinant proteins in E. coli cells.",

There are many protocols, a great number of expression plasmids, and engineered strains that can be used to obtain high protein yields [1]. Despite numerous advantages, biotechnological potential of E. coli also has its limitations including the risk of protein aggregation and accumulation of acetate as by-product. Upon high-level production, recombinant proteins may aggregate and form inclusion bodies (IBs) in E. coli cells. Formation of IBs is a complex and dynamic process affected by various factors involving molecular chaperones that control protein folding. The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs [2,3]. To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required. Coexpression of molecular chaperones or lower production rate can prevent aggregation and facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins [1][2][3]. A whole spectrum of polypeptides with different conformations, including partially or even fully native structures, can be found in IBs [4][5][6]. Therefore, in some cases, insoluble but active proteins sequestered in IBs can be the preferred form of the product [7]. \n\nAnother obstacle in recombinant protein production in E. coli cells is accumulation of acetate during extensive aerobic fermentation in cultures supplemented with glucose. At higher glucose concentrations, the carbon flux into the cells exceeds tricarboxylic acid cycle capacity, and acetyl-CoA is converted into acetate, which is easily excreted from the cell. The excretion of acetate into the environment results also from the need to regenerate the NAD + consumed by glycolysis and to recycle the CoA that is required to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA [8]. A high concentration of acetate, externally added or excreted from the cell, limits the growth of E. coli.",

Laskowska\n## Abstract\nBackgroundAcetylation of lysine residues is a reversible post-translational modification conserved from bacteria to humans. Several recent studies have revealed hundreds of lysine-acetylated proteins in various bacteria; however, the physiological role of these modifications remains largely unknown. Since lysine acetylation changes the size and charge of proteins and thereby may affect their conformation, we assumed that lysine acetylation can stimulate aggregation of proteins, especially for overproduced recombinant proteins that form inclusion bodies.ResultsTo verify this assumption, we used Escherichia coli strains that overproduce aggregation-prone VP1GFP protein. We found that in \u0394ackA-pta cells, which display diminished protein acetylation, inclusion bodies were formed with a delay and processed faster than in the wild-type cells. Moreover, in \u0394ackA-pta cells, inclusion bodies exhibited significantly increased specific GFP fluorescence. In CobB deacetylase-deficient cells, in which protein acetylation was enhanced, the formation of inclusion bodies was increased and their processing was significantly inhibited. Similar results were obtained with regard to endogenous protein aggregates formed during the late stationary phase in \u0394ackA-pta and \u0394cobB cells.ConclusionsOur studies revealed that protein acetylation affected the aggregation of endogenous E. coli proteins and the yield, solubility, and biological activity of a model recombinant protein. In general, decreased lysine acetylation inhibited the formation of protein aggregates, whereas increased lysine acetylation stabilized protein aggregates. These findings should be considered during the designing of efficient strategies for the production of recombinant proteins in E. coli cells.\n## Background\nEscherichia coli is by far the most widely used host for the production of recombinant proteins. There are many protocols, a great number of expression plasmids, and engineered strains that can be used to obtain high protein yields [1]. Despite numerous advantages, biotechnological potential of E. coli also has its limitations including the risk of protein aggregation and accumulation of acetate as by-product. Upon high-level production, recombinant proteins may aggregate and form inclusion bodies (IBs) in E. coli cells. Formation of IBs is a complex and dynamic process affected by various factors involving molecular chaperones that control protein folding. The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs [2,3]. To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required. Coexpression of molecular chaperones or lower production rate can prevent aggregation and facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins [1][2][3]. A whole spectrum of polypeptides with different conformations, including partially or even fully native structures, can be found in IBs [4][5][6]. Therefore, in some cases, insoluble but active proteins sequestered in IBs can be the preferred form of the product [7]. \n\nAnother obstacle in recombinant protein production in E. coli cells is accumulation of acetate during extensive aerobic fermentation in cultures supplemented with glucose. At higher glucose concentrations, the carbon flux into the cells exceeds tricarboxylic acid cycle capacity, and acetyl-CoA is converted into acetate, which is easily excreted from the cell. The excretion of acetate into the environment results also from the need to regenerate the NAD + consumed by glycolysis and to recycle the CoA that is required to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA [8]. A high concentration of acetate, externally added or excreted from the cell, limits the growth of E. coli.",

This strategy could provide several benefits over traditional batch processing, including smaller bioreactors, smaller facilities, and overall reduced plant footprints and investment costs. Continuous processes may also offer improved product quality and minimise heterogeneity, both in the culture and in the product. In this paper, a model protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP) mut3*, was used to test the recombinant protein expression in an Escherichia coli strain with industrial relevance grown in chemostat. An important factor in enabling stable productivity in continuous cultures is the carbon source. We have studied the viability and heterogeneity of the chemostat cultures using a chemically defined medium based on glucose or glycerol as the single carbon source. As a by-product of biodiesel production, glycerol is expected to become a sustainable alternative substrate to glucose. We have found that although glycerol gives a higher cell density, it also generates higher heterogeneity in the culture and a less stable recombinant protein production. We suggest that manipulating the balance between different subpopulations to increase the proportion of productive cells may be a possible solution for making glycerol a successful alternative to glucose.",

So far, no reports of industrial-scale continuous production of biopharmaceuticals using bacterial expression systems exist. The most-often-cited reasons for this are the genetic instabilities of the bacterial strains and recombinant plasmid leading to higher cell heterogeneity, the formation of inclusion bodies, and the increased acetate toxicity through overflow metabolism. Additionally, an increased metabolic burden which leads to lower growth rates and protein yield, and eventually increased cell death, as well as challenges of maintaining sterility, are also reported [10]. \n\nPrevious studies have focused on quantifying the metabolic load associated with recombinant protein production [11,12] and determining the growth and protein production kinetics to optimise operating conditions and devise control strategies for the bioreactor [9]. High throughput techniques, including miniaturisation and parallelisation of bioreactors are used in both industry and research. Cascade operation and multistage culture that decouples the growth from the protein production stage have been investigated with promising results, combined with adequate induction strategies for protein expression [13,14]. \n\nThe advances in continuous protein production using E. coli were recently summarised in [15], focusing on the knowledge transfer opportunities from fed-batch to continuous operation. One exciting development is using glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, as a substrate to make the RPP more sustainable [16][17][18]. Although there is an increased interest in the transition from fed-batch to continuous processing with E coli, the heterogeneity of the culture and the lack of stable production are considered obstacles [15,19]. Highthroughput single-cell expressions studies are required for understanding the dynamics and performance of heterogenous cell populations [20]. \n\nThis work uses a model protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP) mut3*, to test the recombinant protein expression in an E. coli strain with industrial relevance in glucose and glycerol-limited chemostats.",

M. Mitchell, V. Gogulancea, Wendy Smith, A. Wipat, I. D. Ofi\u0163eru\n## Abstract\nRecently, there has been a resurgence of interest in continuous bioprocessing as a cost-optimised production strategy, driven by a rising global requirement for recombinant proteins used as biological drugs. This strategy could provide several benefits over traditional batch processing, including smaller bioreactors, smaller facilities, and overall reduced plant footprints and investment costs. Continuous processes may also offer improved product quality and minimise heterogeneity, both in the culture and in the product. In this paper, a model protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP) mut3*, was used to test the recombinant protein expression in an Escherichia coli strain with industrial relevance grown in chemostat. An important factor in enabling stable productivity in continuous cultures is the carbon source. We have studied the viability and heterogeneity of the chemostat cultures using a chemically defined medium based on glucose or glycerol as the single carbon source. As a by-product of biodiesel production, glycerol is expected to become a sustainable alternative substrate to glucose. We have found that although glycerol gives a higher cell density, it also generates higher heterogeneity in the culture and a less stable recombinant protein production. We suggest that manipulating the balance between different subpopulations to increase the proportion of productive cells may be a possible solution for making glycerol a successful alternative to glucose.\n## Introduction\nNevertheless, most continuous culture studies have focused on the physiology of wild-type cells or low-stakes products such as ethanol. So far, no reports of industrial-scale continuous production of biopharmaceuticals using bacterial expression systems exist. The most-often-cited reasons for this are the genetic instabilities of the bacterial strains and recombinant plasmid leading to higher cell heterogeneity, the formation of inclusion bodies, and the increased acetate toxicity through overflow metabolism. Additionally, an increased metabolic burden which leads to lower growth rates and protein yield, and eventually increased cell death, as well as challenges of maintaining sterility, are also reported [10]. \n\nPrevious studies have focused on quantifying the metabolic load associated with recombinant protein production [11,12] and determining the growth and protein production kinetics to optimise operating conditions and devise control strategies for the bioreactor [9]. High throughput techniques, including miniaturisation and parallelisation of bioreactors are used in both industry and research. Cascade operation and multistage culture that decouples the growth from the protein production stage have been investigated with promising results, combined with adequate induction strategies for protein expression [13,14]. \n\nThe advances in continuous protein production using E. coli were recently summarised in [15], focusing on the knowledge transfer opportunities from fed-batch to continuous operation. One exciting development is using glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, as a substrate to make the RPP more sustainable [16][17][18]. Although there is an increased interest in the transition from fed-batch to continuous processing with E coli, the heterogeneity of the culture and the lack of stable production are considered obstacles [15,19]. Highthroughput single-cell expressions studies are required for understanding the dynamics and performance of heterogenous cell populations [20]. \n\nThis work uses a model protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP) mut3*, to test the recombinant protein expression in an E. coli strain with industrial relevance in glucose and glycerol-limited chemostats.",

The Escherichia coli is still the dominant host for recombinant protein production but, as a bacterial cell, it also has its issues: the aggregation of foreign proteins into insoluble inclusion bodies is perhaps the main limiting factor of the E. coli expression system. Conversely, E. coli benefits of cost, ease of use and scale make it essential to design new approaches directed for improved recombinant protein production in this host cell. With the aid of genetic and protein engineering novel tailored-made strategies can be designed to suit user or process requirements. Gene fusion technology has been widely used for the improvement of soluble protein production and/or purification in E. coli, and for increasing peptide\u2019s immunogenicity as well. New fusion partners are constantly emerging and complementing the traditional solutions, as for instance, the Fh8 fusion tag that has been recently studied and ranked among the best solubility enhancer partners. In this review, we provide an overview of current strategies to improve recombinant protein production in E. coli, including the key factors for successful protein production, highlighting soluble protein production, and a comprehensive summary of the latest available and traditionally used gene fusion technologies. A special emphasis is given to the recently discovered Fh8 fusion system that can be used for soluble protein production, purification, and immunogenicity in E. coli. The number of existing fusion tags will probably increase in the next few years, and efforts should be taken to better understand how fusion tags act in E. coli. This knowledge will undoubtedly drive the development of new tailored-made tools for protein production in this bacterial system.",

Previous studies (Bussow et al., 2005;Pacheco et al., 2012) reported that up to 75% of human proteins are successfully expressed in E. coli but only 25% are produced in an active soluble form using this host system. Other problems found within this host system include proper formation of disulfide bonds, absence of chaperones for the correct folding, and the miss-match between the codon usage of the host cell and the protein of interest (Terpe, 2006;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Pacheco et al., 2012).

Previous studies (Bussow et al., 2005;Pacheco et al., 2012) reported that up to 75% of human proteins are successfully expressed in E. coli but only 25% are produced in an active soluble form using this host system. Other problems found within this host system include proper formation of disulfide bonds, absence of chaperones for the correct folding, and the miss-match between the codon usage of the host cell and the protein of interest (Terpe, 2006;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Pacheco et al., 2012).

The production levels of recombinant proteins synthesized in E. coli are no longer pointed as a limitation for the success of the overall process, but care should be taken with the protein solubility, which is still a major bottleneck in the field. The downstream processing is deeply associated with an efficient protein production strategy, and thus it must be tailor-designed to maximize the recovery of pure recombinant proteins.\n\nAll these three properties -expression, solubility, and purification -shall always be considered together as determinants for the effective protein production in E. coli.

The high concentration of nascent polypeptide chains in a recombinant cell promotes aggregation reactions at the expense of the productive reaction to the native state. The production of large amounts of the incorrectly folded protein, generating aggregates of proteins in a mostly biologically inactive state known as inclusion bodies, is the main trouble to the production of heterologous",

                    "text": "Attaining an optimum formulation for a recombinant protein could be influenced by different factors [23,24].Since one of the biggest concerns of the biopharmaceutical manufacturing is the cost-effectiveness and repeatability of the recombinant protein production process, chemically defined-minimal media as excellent solutions can be used to achieve these two goals [25,26].Several studies have attempted to achieve maximal production under optimal conditions.Despite the constructive benefits of utilizing E. coli, high-level synthesis of soluble recombinant proteins can be challenging.Aggregated proteins, known as inclusion bodies, are generally misfolded and physiologically inactive [27].In many cases, solubilization and refolding of insoluble proteins are time-consuming and labor-intensive procedures that add to the complexity of downstream processing [28,29].Several methods have been developed to address these challenges to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins.For instance, an efficient and practical method is to modify culture conditions [30].According to the accumulated evidence to accelerate the expression of target genes and develop solubility in E. coli, remarkable methods have been developed.Four substantial factors highly affect the production of soluble protein: timing of induction, inducer concentration, temperature, and duration of induction.Nonetheless, efforts to identify optimal buffer conditions frequently rely on re-purification or functional assays, a time-and protein-intensive trial-and-error strategy.An optimal time window exists for the production of proteins.The correlation between the growth rate and the specific protein production rate for the induced batch and fed-batch cultures suggests that a sluggish growth rate under induced conditions produces little or no product.In addition, the duration of expression was limited in batch cultures.This provides information on protein aggregation in the cell and protein quality [31].Induction is typically conducted during the early mid-log phase, although there are reports of induction occurring during the late-log phase or even during the stationary phase [32].The recombinant nature of protein drugs allows intervening at upstream stages through protein engineering to produce analogue protein versions with higher stability and enhanced therapeutic values.This highlights the importance of protein engineering and structural analysis in improving the stability of recombinant proteins such as BlaR-CTD.",

H. Abdolvahab, Mojdeh Safari, Farkhonde Hasannejad, Nika Asefi, Alireza Salimi, M. Nazari\n## Abstract\nThe sequence of a carboxy-terminal of the \u03b2-lactam sensor-transducer protein (BlaR-CTD) from Bacillus licheniformis ATCC14580 was extracted from US7745193B2 patent and expressed in E. coli using pColdI vector as a soluble His-tag recombinant protein. In this study, several excipients were used to improve the stability of recombinant BlaR-CTD and obtain the optimal formulation for this protein using response surface methodology (RSM)/ Central Composite Design (CCD). Total protein concentration was measured by UV spectroscopy and the Bradford test. A total of 7 various factors were designed using four different excipients including Glycerol, Sucrose, Triton x-100, and Tween-20, and three different buffers like Tris, Borate, and PBS. By obtaining suitable excipients and buffer i.e. glycerol and sucrose, pH ranging from 7 to 9 were evaluated. The pH 7.62, glycerol 15.35%, and sucrose 152.52 mM were determined as the most suitable for improving the thermal stability of recombinant BlaR-CTD.\n## Discussion\nAttaining an optimum formulation for a recombinant protein could be influenced by different factors [23,24].Since one of the biggest concerns of the biopharmaceutical manufacturing is the cost-effectiveness and repeatability of the recombinant protein production process, chemically defined-minimal media as excellent solutions can be used to achieve these two goals [25,26].Several studies have attempted to achieve maximal production under optimal conditions.Despite the constructive benefits of utilizing E. coli, high-level synthesis of soluble recombinant proteins can be challenging.Aggregated proteins, known as inclusion bodies, are generally misfolded and physiologically inactive [27].In many cases, solubilization and refolding of insoluble proteins are time-consuming and labor-intensive procedures that add to the complexity of downstream processing [28,29].Several methods have been developed to address these challenges to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins.For instance, an efficient and practical method is to modify culture conditions [30].According to the accumulated evidence to accelerate the expression of target genes and develop solubility in E. coli, remarkable methods have been developed.Four substantial factors highly affect the production of soluble protein: timing of induction, inducer concentration, temperature, and duration of induction.Nonetheless, efforts to identify optimal buffer conditions frequently rely on re-purification or functional assays, a time-and protein-intensive trial-and-error strategy.An optimal time window exists for the production of proteins.The correlation between the growth rate and the specific protein production rate for the induced batch and fed-batch cultures suggests that a sluggish growth rate under induced conditions produces little or no product.In addition, the duration of expression was limited in batch cultures.This provides information on protein aggregation in the cell and protein quality [31].Induction is typically conducted during the early mid-log phase, although there are reports of induction occurring during the late-log phase or even during the stationary phase [32].The recombinant nature of protein drugs allows intervening at upstream stages through protein engineering to produce analogue protein versions with higher stability and enhanced therapeutic values.This highlights the importance of protein engineering and structural analysis in improving the stability of recombinant proteins such as BlaR-CTD.",

Here, we constructed fifteen TEVp5M variants with one or more of six rare arginine codons in the coding sequence replaced with abundant E. coli arginine codons. These codon variants expressed in either E. coli BL21 (DE3) or Rossetta (DE3) showed different solubility and activity. Supply of rare tRNAs increased the tendency of certain codon variants to form insoluble aggregates at early induction stage, as determined by the fused S-tag. About 32% increase in soluble protein production of M5 variant with four synonymously mutated arginine codons was identified in Rossetta (DE3) cells using GFP fusion reporter, comparable to that of TEVp5M. After purification, two other codon variants from both E. coli strains exhibited less activity than TEVp5M on cleaving the native or modified recognition sequence incorporated between GST and E. coli diaminopropionate ammonialyase by enzyme-coupled assay, whereas purified M5 variant showed activity similar to the TEVp5M. Supply of rare tRNAs caused the decrease of activity of TEVp5M and M5 by about 21%. Our results revealed that engineering of highly soluble TEVp variants can be achieved by the combined mutations of amino acid residues and optimization of specific rare codons, whereas simple augment of rare tRNAs abundance resulted in partial loss of activity.",

                    "text": "As the host, Escherichia coli is fundamentally important in the manufacture of a wide range of biotechnological and biomedical products, owing to its easy culture, fast growth, simple fermentation and easy genetic manipulation [1]. High production of recombinant protein in E. coli is a combination of several factors such as efficiency of transcription, mRNA stability, mRNA folding, codon usage, protein solubility and folding [2]. So, the strategies for optimizing expression greatly vary from gene to gene and are often determined by trial and error. \n\nIn E. coli, tRNA levels for rare codons AGG, AGA, AUA, CCC, CUA and GGA restrain high-level production of the recombinant proteins [3]. Codon optimization could enhance soluble protein production [4,5], but sometimes it also impaired protein folding and decreased activity [6,7]. Similarly, supply of deficient tRNAs increased expression levels of recombinant proteins, but decreased soluble production of some recombinant proteins [8]. So far, obtaining well-folded recombinant proteins with high yield remains a major challenge, as yield, solubility and conformational quality of soluble proteins could not be simultaneously optimized in E. coli [9]. \n\nFusion tags are frequently applied for improving protein solubility and facilitating rapid purification by affinity chromatography. To avoid potential interference with biological activity or crystallization, the fused tags need to be removed, which is often achieved by a specific protease that recognizes and cleaves the engineered sequence between the tag and target protein [10]. Tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) has been identified as a tool, owing to its stringent recognition sequence. Production of wild type TEVp or the mutant TEVpS219V with inhibition of auto-cleavage in E. coli is limited due to its low solubility [10].",

Cheng, Jun Fan\n## Abstract\nIt has been identified that a TEV protease (TEVp) variant, TEVp5M, displays improved solubility. Here, we constructed fifteen TEVp5M variants with one or more of six rare arginine codons in the coding sequence replaced with abundant E. coli arginine codons. These codon variants expressed in either E. coli BL21 (DE3) or Rossetta (DE3) showed different solubility and activity. Supply of rare tRNAs increased the tendency of certain codon variants to form insoluble aggregates at early induction stage, as determined by the fused S-tag. About 32% increase in soluble protein production of M5 variant with four synonymously mutated arginine codons was identified in Rossetta (DE3) cells using GFP fusion reporter, comparable to that of TEVp5M. After purification, two other codon variants from both E. coli strains exhibited less activity than TEVp5M on cleaving the native or modified recognition sequence incorporated between GST and E. coli diaminopropionate ammonialyase by enzyme-coupled assay, whereas purified M5 variant showed activity similar to the TEVp5M. Supply of rare tRNAs caused the decrease of activity of TEVp5M and M5 by about 21%. Our results revealed that engineering of highly soluble TEVp variants can be achieved by the combined mutations of amino acid residues and optimization of specific rare codons, whereas simple augment of rare tRNAs abundance resulted in partial loss of activity.\n## Introduction\nAs the host, Escherichia coli is fundamentally important in the manufacture of a wide range of biotechnological and biomedical products, owing to its easy culture, fast growth, simple fermentation and easy genetic manipulation [1]. High production of recombinant protein in E. coli is a combination of several factors such as efficiency of transcription, mRNA stability, mRNA folding, codon usage, protein solubility and folding [2]. So, the strategies for optimizing expression greatly vary from gene to gene and are often determined by trial and error. \n\nIn E. coli, tRNA levels for rare codons AGG, AGA, AUA, CCC, CUA and GGA restrain high-level production of the recombinant proteins [3]. Codon optimization could enhance soluble protein production [4,5], but sometimes it also impaired protein folding and decreased activity [6,7]. Similarly, supply of deficient tRNAs increased expression levels of recombinant proteins, but decreased soluble production of some recombinant proteins [8]. So far, obtaining well-folded recombinant proteins with high yield remains a major challenge, as yield, solubility and conformational quality of soluble proteins could not be simultaneously optimized in E. coli [9]. \n\nFusion tags are frequently applied for improving protein solubility and facilitating rapid purification by affinity chromatography. To avoid potential interference with biological activity or crystallization, the fused tags need to be removed, which is often achieved by a specific protease that recognizes and cleaves the engineered sequence between the tag and target protein [10]. Tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) has been identified as a tool, owing to its stringent recognition sequence. Production of wild type TEVp or the mutant TEVpS219V with inhibition of auto-cleavage in E. coli is limited due to its low solubility [10].",

Preliminary studies on the solubility and thermal resistance of the produced proteins indicated the efficacy of the Fh8 tag in increasing the expression, solubility, and thermal resistance of the product.

Considerable amounts of soluble protein are required for many analysis techniques such as circular dichroism, crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance [12].

                    "text": "For many reasons Escherichia coli is still the preferred choice as a host system for protein production. With relatively low costs one can achieve high biomass and high protein yield in only short cultivation times. Furthermore, E. coli is extremely well-studied in its biochemical and physiological characteristics. With a wealth of tools available E. coli also can be easily adapted as needed by genetic manipulation. However, even though the general procedure for protein production is straightforward, protein aggregation during expression is still a major obstacle. Different approaches are commonly applied to address this problem, and to optimize protein folding while maximizing protein expression. The currently available expression systems with their advantages and pitfalls have been regularly reviewed [1][2][3][4]. A smart combination of the different parts of the system (e.g. prokaryotic or eukaryotic host organism, type of plasmid with its specific features) can lead to an improved expression. Additional conventional approaches for protein expression optimization are the coexpression of chaperons, use of codon optimized genes, alternate protein tags, change of cultivation medium, production process optimization [2,5]. The choice of the system influences the success of proper protein folding and hence the production of active, soluble protein. Even more specialized systems facing folding problems have been developed. The preexpression of Erv1p sulfhydryl oxidase and disulfide bond isomerases for example is a robust technique for the production of disulfide bonds containing proteins [6,7]. \n\nSince every protein is different, the expression and purification strategies must be defined for each single case. In their review, Gr\u00e4slund et al. [2] summarized that there are many choices to make when expressing proteins regarding all the parts of the system; e.g. selection of E. coli strain, the fusion of the protein with a His-tag or another tag, the application of a T7 RNA polymerase expression system or another regulated promoter system, and finally the choice of the medium and cultivation conditions. They published a consensus protocol which they agreed to be a good starting-point when aiming to produce a recombinant protein. Nevertheless, success is protein dependent and a robust and ever-working strategy is still missing.",

                    "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most widely used organisms for protein production. Despite decades of progress in heterologous protein expression, the folding of many proteins, especially large multi-domain eukaryotic proteins, remains a significant challenge [1]. Heterologous protein production can account for up to 50% of E. coli's total cellular protein content and thus puts strain on the native transcriptional and translational machinery [2]. Additionally, the speed of coupled transcription and translation in bacteria can be problematic for producing large eukaryotic proteins. Key protein folding factors from the native host are also absent, causing further protein folding problems. Combined, these factors can lead to misfolding and/or aggregation of the recombinant protein [3]. Over the years many strategies have been developed to improve heterologous protein production [1,4,5]. \n\nFor each recombinant protein being expressed, numerous variables influence the amount of soluble protein being produced by the cell including the protein sequence, expression vector, cell line, and expression conditions. Many of these factors may need to be optimized to achieve expression of active, soluble protein in E. coli. Upon selecting the protein of interest (POI) to be expressed, several avenues to improve protein solubility can be explored. A protein sequence can be altered by eliminating rare codons, reducing stretches of hydrophobic residues, or simply by selecting alternative homologs of the desired protein to increase chances of successful expression. [6][7][8]. Any changes to the protein sequence itself come with the risk of altering the activity of the protein. Once a protein sequence has been selected, the appropriate expression system must be designed. The promoter, origin of replication, and the inclusion of solubility tags (MBP, DsbC, SUMO, NusA, etc.) can all be altered to enhance protein expression [6,[9][10][11][12]. After designing and building the vector harboring the POI, an E. coli expression strain must be chosen. There are many strains that have been engineered for the purpose of heterologous protein expression which are reviewed here [13].",

Ke, Alexandre Thurman, J. Eaglesham, M. Berkmen\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Introduction\nEscherichia coli is one of the most widely used organisms for protein production. Despite decades of progress in heterologous protein expression, the folding of many proteins, especially large multi-domain eukaryotic proteins, remains a significant challenge [1]. Heterologous protein production can account for up to 50% of E. coli's total cellular protein content and thus puts strain on the native transcriptional and translational machinery [2]. Additionally, the speed of coupled transcription and translation in bacteria can be problematic for producing large eukaryotic proteins. Key protein folding factors from the native host are also absent, causing further protein folding problems. Combined, these factors can lead to misfolding and/or aggregation of the recombinant protein [3]. Over the years many strategies have been developed to improve heterologous protein production [1,4,5]. \n\nFor each recombinant protein being expressed, numerous variables influence the amount of soluble protein being produced by the cell including the protein sequence, expression vector, cell line, and expression conditions. Many of these factors may need to be optimized to achieve expression of active, soluble protein in E. coli. Upon selecting the protein of interest (POI) to be expressed, several avenues to improve protein solubility can be explored. A protein sequence can be altered by eliminating rare codons, reducing stretches of hydrophobic residues, or simply by selecting alternative homologs of the desired protein to increase chances of successful expression. [6][7][8]. Any changes to the protein sequence itself come with the risk of altering the activity of the protein. Once a protein sequence has been selected, the appropriate expression system must be designed. The promoter, origin of replication, and the inclusion of solubility tags (MBP, DsbC, SUMO, NusA, etc.) can all be altered to enhance protein expression [6,[9][10][11][12]. After designing and building the vector harboring the POI, an E. coli expression strain must be chosen. There are many strains that have been engineered for the purpose of heterologous protein expression which are reviewed here [13].",

For the safety and effectiveness of the protein production, an auto-inducible expression vector is required to replace inducer interference, which is uneconomic and could be harmful. In this research, an auto-inducible expression plasmid, pCAD2_sod (a pBR322 derivate plasmid), which was under dps (RpoS-dependent gene) promoter control, was modified to provide RpoS at earlier phase. Hence, accumulates more target protein and resulting a new plasmid, pCAD2+_sod. pCAD2_sod had been constructed to automatically induces the expression of recombinant superoxide dismutase (SOD) from Staphylococcus equorum (rMnSODSeq) in the stationary growth phase of Escherichia coli. This work aimed to obtain pCAD2+_sod and determine the expression level of rMnSODSeq on mRNA and protein level. A synthetic rpoS coding region under rpoD promoter control (prpoD_rpoS) was inserted to pCAD2_sod and generated pCAD2+_sod. The rMnSODSeq (24.3 kDa) produced from pCAD2+_sod was\u2009~\u20091.5 fold higher at 37 \u00b0C and more intense at 43 \u00b0C compared to that from pCAD2_sod, likewise shifted to earlier phase (after 1 h of incubation), as shown in the SDS-PAGE. The dismutase activity was also retained after zymography assay. The mRNA level from pCAD2+_sod was determined by qPCR and gave quantification cycle (Cq) values of cDNA lowest among others. It made the relative quantification (RQ) of the mRNA expression towards rho reference gene were high. The prpoD_rpoS insertion shifts and increases the rMnSODSeq production from stationary to exponential phase. The pCAD2+_sod plasmid is potential for further recombinant protein productions.",

It is a good economic development indication for biopharmaceutical company [1]. In 2018, there are 316 biopharmaceutical products consist of recombinant therapeutic protein and nucleic acid approved in USA and Europe [2]. The major challenges in recombinant protein production are to reduce the production cost, improve the productivity both in upstream and downstream, and obtain high titer while maintaining the quality of the recombinant protein products [1].\n\nEscherichia coli had attested its versatility and economic potential in production [3]. There is a wealth of knowledge and comprehensive tools for E. coli systems, such as expression vectors, production strains, protein folding and fermentation technologies that are well tailored for industrial applications. Hence, with its recent advancements, the use of E. coli has been a preferred choice and a workhorse not only for expression of non-glycosylated proteins in the biotech industry, but also a complex protein production, bacterial N-linked glycosylation, novel strain engineering and creation of E. coli cell-free systems [4]. Varieties of promoters are used in the production of recombinant proteins. Some of the strong promoters are induced by isopropyl-\u03b2-Dthiogalacto-pyranoside (IPTG) (i.e. tac, trc, and lac), which however has been reported to the limitation of its toxicity for the host cells and also causing an ineffective production cost due to its expensiveness [1,[4][5][6].\n\nIn the previous research, an auto-inducible expression plasmid, which derivate of pBR322, with dps promoter (pCADsod) had been constructed to express sodA from Staphylococcus equorum encoding a Mn superoxide dismutase (rMnSODSeq) in stationary phase.

N. Soewandhi, C. Riani\n## Abstract\nNowadays, recombinant therapeutic proteins have been widely produced and consumed. For the safety and effectiveness of the protein production, an auto-inducible expression vector is required to replace inducer interference, which is uneconomic and could be harmful. In this research, an auto-inducible expression plasmid, pCAD2_sod (a pBR322 derivate plasmid), which was under dps (RpoS-dependent gene) promoter control, was modified to provide RpoS at earlier phase. Hence, accumulates more target protein and resulting a new plasmid, pCAD2+_sod. pCAD2_sod had been constructed to automatically induces the expression of recombinant superoxide dismutase (SOD) from Staphylococcus equorum (rMnSODSeq) in the stationary growth phase of Escherichia coli. This work aimed to obtain pCAD2+_sod and determine the expression level of rMnSODSeq on mRNA and protein level. A synthetic rpoS coding region under rpoD promoter control (prpoD_rpoS) was inserted to pCAD2_sod and generated pCAD2+_sod. The rMnSODSeq (24.3 kDa) produced from pCAD2+_sod was\u2009~\u20091.5 fold higher at 37 \u00b0C and more intense at 43 \u00b0C compared to that from pCAD2_sod, likewise shifted to earlier phase (after 1 h of incubation), as shown in the SDS-PAGE. The dismutase activity was also retained after zymography assay. The mRNA level from pCAD2+_sod was determined by qPCR and gave quantification cycle (Cq) values of cDNA lowest among others. It made the relative quantification (RQ) of the mRNA expression towards rho reference gene were high. The prpoD_rpoS insertion shifts and increases the rMnSODSeq production from stationary to exponential phase. The pCAD2+_sod plasmid is potential for further recombinant protein productions.\n## Introduction\nThe usage of recombinant protein as therapeutic agent has annually increased approximately 35 per cent since 2001. It is a good economic development indication for biopharmaceutical company [1]. In 2018, there are 316 biopharmaceutical products consist of recombinant therapeutic protein and nucleic acid approved in USA and Europe [2]. The major challenges in recombinant protein production are to reduce the production cost, improve the productivity both in upstream and downstream, and obtain high titer while maintaining the quality of the recombinant protein products [1].\n\nEscherichia coli had attested its versatility and economic potential in production [3]. There is a wealth of knowledge and comprehensive tools for E. coli systems, such as expression vectors, production strains, protein folding and fermentation technologies that are well tailored for industrial applications. Hence, with its recent advancements, the use of E. coli has been a preferred choice and a workhorse not only for expression of non-glycosylated proteins in the biotech industry, but also a complex protein production, bacterial N-linked glycosylation, novel strain engineering and creation of E. coli cell-free systems [4]. Varieties of promoters are used in the production of recombinant proteins. Some of the strong promoters are induced by isopropyl-\u03b2-Dthiogalacto-pyranoside (IPTG) (i.e. tac, trc, and lac), which however has been reported to the limitation of its toxicity for the host cells and also causing an ineffective production cost due to its expensiveness [1,[4][5][6].\n\nIn the previous research, an auto-inducible expression plasmid, which derivate of pBR322, with dps promoter (pCADsod) had been constructed to express sodA from Staphylococcus equorum encoding a Mn superoxide dismutase (rMnSODSeq) in stationary phase. The dps promoter in a high stability medium copy number plasmid, pCADsod, had given a high level expression of rMnSODSeq when the host cells entered stationary phase as high as from pBMsod (IPTG-inducible",

            "abstract": "Background Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used host organisms for the production of biopharmaceuticals, as it allows for cost-efficient and fast recombinant protein expression. However, challenging proteins are often produced with low titres or as inclusion bodies, and the manufacturing process needs to be developed individually for each protein. Recently, we developed the CASPON^TM technology, a generic fusion tag-based platform process for high-titer soluble expression including a standardized downstream processing and highly specific enzymatic cleavage of the fusion tag. To assess potential strategies for further improvement of the N-terminally fused CASPON^TM tag, we modified the 5\u2019UTR and 5\u2019 region of the tag-coding mRNA to optimize the ribosome-mRNA interactions. Results In the present work, we found that by modifying the 5\u2019UTR sequence of a pET30a cer plasmid-based system, expression of the fusion protein CASPON^TM-tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 was altered in laboratory-scale carbon-limited fed-batch cultivations, but no significant increase in expression titre was achieved. Translation efficiency was highest for a construct carrying an expression enhancer element and additionally possessing a very favourable interaction energy between ribosome and mRNA (\u2206G_total). However, a construct with comparatively low transcriptional efficiency, which lacked the expression enhancer sequence and carried the most favourable \u2206G_total tested, led to the highest recombinant protein formation alongside the reference pET30a construct. Furthermore, we found, that by introducing synonymous mutations within the nucleotide sequence of the T7AC element of the CASPON^TM tag, utilizing a combination of rare and non-rare codons, the free folding energy of the nucleotides at the 5\u2019 end (-4 to +\u200937) of the transcript encoding the CASPON^TM tag increased by 6\u00a0kcal/mol. Surprisingly, this new T7AC _ rare variant led to improved recombinant protein titres by 1.3-fold up to 5.3-fold, shown with three industry-relevant proteins in lab-scale carbon limited fed-batch fermentations under industrially relevant conditions. Conclusions This study reveals some of the complex interdependencies between the ribosome and mRNA that govern recombinant protein expression. By modifying the 5\u2019UTR to obtain an optimized interaction energy between the mRNA and the ribosome (\u0394G_total), transcript levels were changed, highlighting the different translation efficiencies of individual transcripts. It was shown that the highest recombinant titre was not obtained by the construct with the most efficient translation but by a construct with a generally high transcript amount coupled with a favourable \u0394G_total. Furthermore, an unexpectedly high potential to enhance expression by introducing silent mutations including multiple rare codons into the 5\u2019end of the CAPON^TM tag\u2019s mRNA was identified. Although the titres of the fusion proteins were dramatically increased, no formation of inclusion bodies or negative impact on cell growth was observed. We hypothesize that the drastic increase in titre is most likely caused by better ribosomal binding site accessibility. Our study, which demonstrates the influence of changes in ribosome-mRNA interactions on protein expression under industrially relevant production conditions, opens the door to the applicability of the new T7AC _ rare tag in biopharmaceutical industry using the CASPON^TM platform process.",

Today, about 30% of approved biopharmaceuticals are produced by E. coli, and despite the recent advance of other production systems such as mammalian cell culture, new product approvals, like Beovu\u00ae and Cablivi R in 2019, are constantly being granted, allowing E. coli to compete with both mammalian and non-mammalian hosts [1,2]. E. coli is not equally suited for the expression of all proteins, as it lacks the ability for several key posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, cytosolic disulphide bond formation and proteolytic protein maturation [3]. Nonetheless, there are certain commercially available strains that enable the formation of cytosolic disulphide bonds like the Shuffle and Origami E. coli hosts [3][4][5]. However, the expression of complex recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a major challenge as it can lead to accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in inclusion bodies or low expression titres [6][7][8][9]. \n\nTo obtain an efficient recombinant protein production process in E. coli, several factors play a key role. These include the basic choice of the expression system design, like plasmid-based or genome-integrated expression cassettes, and, in this regard, the copy number of the plasmid and the gene of interest (GOI) [2,6]. Also, a suitable promotor system for high level protein expression must be employed and the mRNA has to have an appropriate stability for recombinant protein expression [6]. Furthermore, the choice of fermentation process and parameters, the media composition and induction strategy play a major role for high-yield recombinant protein production [6]. \n\nAlongside all these factors, the optimization of translation initiation, which is the rate limiting and most tightly regulated step in protein biosynthesis, has received much attention in the last two decades [10].",

K\u00f6ppl, Wolfgang Buchinger, G. Striedner, M. Cserjan\u2010Puschmann\n## Abstract\nBackground Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used host organisms for the production of biopharmaceuticals, as it allows for cost-efficient and fast recombinant protein expression. However, challenging proteins are often produced with low titres or as inclusion bodies, and the manufacturing process needs to be developed individually for each protein. Recently, we developed the CASPON^TM technology, a generic fusion tag-based platform process for high-titer soluble expression including a standardized downstream processing and highly specific enzymatic cleavage of the fusion tag. To assess potential strategies for further improvement of the N-terminally fused CASPON^TM tag, we modified the 5\u2019UTR and 5\u2019 region of the tag-coding mRNA to optimize the ribosome-mRNA interactions. Results In the present work, we found that by modifying the 5\u2019UTR sequence of a pET30a cer plasmid-based system, expression of the fusion protein CASPON^TM-tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 was altered in laboratory-scale carbon-limited fed-batch cultivations, but no significant increase in expression titre was achieved. Translation efficiency was highest for a construct carrying an expression enhancer element and additionally possessing a very favourable interaction energy between ribosome and mRNA (\u2206G_total). However, a construct with comparatively low transcriptional efficiency, which lacked the expression enhancer sequence and carried the most favourable \u2206G_total tested, led to the highest recombinant protein formation alongside the reference pET30a construct. Furthermore, we found, that by introducing synonymous mutations within the nucleotide sequence of the T7AC element of the CASPON^TM tag, utilizing a combination of rare and non-rare codons, the free folding energy of the nucleotides at the 5\u2019 end (-4 to +\u200937) of the transcript encoding the CASPON^TM tag increased by 6\u00a0kcal/mol. Surprisingly, this new T7AC _ rare variant led to improved recombinant protein titres by 1.3-fold up to 5.3-fold, shown with three industry-relevant proteins in lab-scale carbon limited fed-batch fermentations under industrially relevant conditions. Conclusions This study reveals some of the complex interdependencies between the ribosome and mRNA that govern recombinant protein expression. By modifying the 5\u2019UTR to obtain an optimized interaction energy between the mRNA and the ribosome (\u0394G_total), transcript levels were changed, highlighting the different translation efficiencies of individual transcripts. It was shown that the highest recombinant titre was not obtained by the construct with the most efficient translation but by a construct with a generally high transcript amount coupled with a favourable \u0394G_total. Furthermore, an unexpectedly high potential to enhance expression by introducing silent mutations including multiple rare codons into the 5\u2019end of the CAPON^TM tag\u2019s mRNA was identified. Although the titres of the fusion proteins were dramatically increased, no formation of inclusion bodies or negative impact on cell growth was observed. We hypothesize that the drastic increase in titre is most likely caused by better ribosomal binding site accessibility. Our study, which demonstrates the influence of changes in ribosome-mRNA interactions on protein expression under industrially relevant production conditions, opens the door to the applicability of the new T7AC _ rare tag in biopharmaceutical industry using the CASPON^TM platform process.\n## Background\nEscherichia coli is one of the most commonly used host organisms for the production of biopharmaceuticals, as it allows for cost-efficient and fast recombinant protein expression. Today, about 30% of approved biopharmaceuticals are produced by E. coli, and despite the recent advance of other production systems such as mammalian cell culture, new product approvals, like Beovu\u00ae and Cablivi R in 2019, are constantly being granted, allowing E. coli to compete with both mammalian and non-mammalian hosts [1,2]. E. coli is not equally suited for the expression of all proteins, as it lacks the ability for several key posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, cytosolic disulphide bond formation and proteolytic protein maturation [3]. Nonetheless, there are certain commercially available strains that enable the formation of cytosolic disulphide bonds like the Shuffle and Origami E. coli hosts [3][4][5]. However, the expression of complex recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a major challenge as it can lead to accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in inclusion bodies or low expression titres [6][7][8][9]. \n\nTo obtain an efficient recombinant protein production process in E. coli, several factors play a key role.

The recombinant proteins were chosen to generate results for (1) proteins with a simple fold that are easily expressed to high soluble titers (like green fluorescence protein plus (GFP) [16]); and for (2) proteins with a complex fold that are prone to form intracellular IBs upon overexpression, and thus have to be expressed at low growth rates (like pyranose-2-oxidase (P2Ox) [8]).\n\n## Conclusions\nRecombinant protein production in E. coli BL21(DE3) is important in both academia and industry. In this follow-up study, we investigated the impact of common technical failures during recombinant production of two soluble, model proteins (GFP and P2Ox) on cell physiology, productivity and final protein quality. Our methodology also proved to be an interesting approach to investigate the process and product robustness. Compared to our previous results on IB production [3], our current results show that soluble protein production is less robust to temporary environmental changes. Importantly, we found that technical failures, especially those that introduce limited oxygen supply, significantly  affect cell physiology, productivity, protein quality and, therefore, also final process and product robustness.",

Previous studies (Bussow et al., 2005;Pacheco et al., 2012) reported that up to 75% of human proteins are successfully expressed in E. coli but only 25% are produced in an active soluble form using this host system. Other problems found within this host system include proper formation of disulfide bonds, absence of chaperones for the correct folding, and the miss-match between the codon usage of the host cell and the protein of interest (Terpe, 2006;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Pacheco et al., 2012). Moreover, the industrial culture of E. coli leads cells to grow in harsh conditions, resulting in cell physiology deterioration (Chou, 2007;Pacheco et al., 2012).\n\nDespite the above-mentioned issues of E. coli recombinant protein production, the benefits of cost and ease of use and scale make it essential to design new strategies directed for recombinant soluble protein production in this host cell. Several strategies have been made for efficient production of proteins in E. coli, namely, the use of different mutated host strains, co-production of chaperones and foldases, lowering cultivation temperatures, and addition of a fusion partner (Terpe, 2006;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). The combination of some of these strategies has improved the soluble production of recombinant proteins in E. coli, but the prediction of robust soluble protein production processes is still a \"a challenge and a necessity\" (Jana and Deb, 2005).\n\nNowadays, with the aid of genetic and protein engineering, novel tailor-made strategies can be designed to suit user or process requirements.\n\nThis review describes the key solubility factors that correlate with successful protein production in E. coli, and it presents a comprehensive summary of the available fusion partners for protein production and purification in the bacterial host.

In this post-genomic era, challenges remain to rapidly express and purify large numbers of proteins for academic and commercial purposes in a high-throughput manner. In this review, we describe several state-of-the-art approaches that are suitable for the cloning, expression and purification, conducted in parallel, of numerous molecules, and we discuss recent progress related to soluble protein expression, mRNA folding, fusion tags, post-translational modification and production of membrane proteins. Moreover, we address the ongoing efforts to overcome various challenges faced in protein expression in E. coli, which could lead to an improvement of the current system from trial and error to a predictable and rational design.",

            "text": "Protein expression in E. coli is relatively simple and inexpensive and the variety of available plasmids, fusion partners and strains makes it often the preferred method for production of AMPs [103,104]. However, major drawbacks have been reported using bacteria for effective AMP production as discussed below. \n\nFirst of all, the recombinant protein often needs to be fused to a carrier protein to neutralize its toxicity towards the host and to increase its solubility to avoid formation of inclusion bodies [105]. This fusion partner needs to be released during or after purification of the protein of interest via enzymatic or chemical cleavage to render functional proteins, which results in a decreased yield [102]. In addition, fusion proteins are not necessarily properly folded and production of these proteins can result in so-called \"soluble inclusion bodies\" [105]. Recently, it was shown that co-expression of the human Quiescin Sulfhydryl Oxidase (QSOX), a chaperone with thiol/disulphide oxidase activity, in the cytoplasm of E. coli can counter protein misfolding and increase the yield of soluble cysteine-rich proteins [106,107]. Although such approach improves protein production in E. coli, other obstacles remain. \n\nDirect secretion mechanisms are not present in E. coli strains used for recombinant protein production, which complicates protein purification. Protein secretion can be obtained, however, by destabilization of the E. coli structural components or by using leaky strains that lack certain structural components or mutant strains in which secretion modules derived from pathogenic E. coli or other species are incorporated [103,[108][109][110][111]. \n\nFinally, and most importantly, the protein of interest often requires complex folding, including the formation of multiple disulphide bonds and/or glycosylation. In both cases, an eukaryotic system is preferred [112]. In addition, Puertas and colleagues reported that the protein yield, when using E. coli as a host for recombinant production, is inversely proportional to the cysteine content of the protein [113].",

The Escherichia coli is still the dominant host for recombinant protein production but, as a bacterial cell, it also has its issues: the aggregation of foreign proteins into insoluble inclusion bodies is perhaps the main limiting factor of the E. coli expression system. Conversely, E. coli benefits of cost, ease of use and scale make it essential to design new approaches directed for improved recombinant protein production in this host cell. With the aid of genetic and protein engineering novel tailored-made strategies can be designed to suit user or process requirements. Gene fusion technology has been widely used for the improvement of soluble protein production and/or purification in E. coli, and for increasing peptide\u2019s immunogenicity as well. New fusion partners are constantly emerging and complementing the traditional solutions, as for instance, the Fh8 fusion tag that has been recently studied and ranked among the best solubility enhancer partners. In this review, we provide an overview of current strategies to improve recombinant protein production in E. coli, including the key factors for successful protein production, highlighting soluble protein production, and a comprehensive summary of the latest available and traditionally used gene fusion technologies. A special emphasis is given to the recently discovered Fh8 fusion system that can be used for soluble protein production, purification, and immunogenicity in E. coli. The number of existing fusion tags will probably increase in the next few years, and efforts should be taken to better understand how fusion tags act in E. coli. This knowledge will undoubtedly drive the development of new tailored-made tools for protein production in this bacterial system.",

They play important roles in a variety of cell processes, including cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle, and their failure is consequently correlated with several diseases.\n\nWith the introduction of the DNA recombinant technology in the 1970s, proteins started to be expressed in several host organisms resulting in a faster and easier process compared to their natural sources (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). Escherichia coli remains the dominant host for producing recombinant proteins, owing to its advantageous fast and inexpensive, and high yield protein production, together with the well-characterized genetics and variety of available molecular tools (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009).\n\nThe recombinant protein production in E. coli has greatly contributed for several structural studies; for instance, about 90% of the structures available in the Protein Data Bank were determined on proteins produced in E. coli. (Nettleship et al., 2010;Bird, 2011). The E. coli recombinant production has also boosted the biopharmaceutical industry: 30% of the recombinant biopharmaceuticals licensed up to 2011 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) were obtained using this host cell (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009;Walsh, 2010;Berlec and Strukelj, 2013).\n\nEscherichia coli recombinant protein-based products can also be found in major sectors of the enzyme industry and the agricultural industry with applications ranging from catalysis (e.g., washing detergents) and therapeutic use (e.g., vaccine development) to functional analysis and structure determination (e.g., crystallography; Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). As a bacterial system, the E. coli has, however, limitations at expressing more complex proteins due to the lack of sophisticated machinery to perform posttranslational modifications, resulting in poor solubility of the protein of interest that are produced as inclusion bodies (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Kamionka, 2011).

E. coli has been engineered to allow simple glycosylation of proteins by transferring the N-glycosylation system of Campylobacter jejuni into it. However, further studies are required to establish it for the industrial production of commercial therapeutic proteins (Gupta and Shukla, 2017c). The expression of genes with rare codons (e.g., those found in the human genome) often results in low expression and triggers premature termination of the synthesis of a protein molecule (Owczarek et al., 2019). The presence of rare codons can be addressed by using codon optimization or host modification. Codon optimization increases the expression of recombinant protein by many folds (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014;Gupta S. K. et al., 2019;Rosano et al., 2019). A redox environment and foldases [e.g., disulfide isomerases (Dsb proteins) and peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIase)] are necessary to form the correct disulfide bond in the periplasm (Gupta and Shukla, 2017b). The incorporation of appropriate signal sequences for protein expression in periplasm or in the extracellular space aids correct protein folding and also minimum proteolytic degradation (Gupta and Shukla, 2016). The endotoxin problem can be solved by using a purification process to increase the safety of bacterially derived therapeutics (Mamat et al., 2015). SHuffle, an E. coli strain, was developed to correctly fold disulfide-bonded proteins in its cytoplasm (Lobstein et al., 2012) and was successfully used for biologically active IgG production (Robinson et al., 2015). The T7-phage polymerase, which is commonly utilized for protein expression, also results in decreased protein expression after 3-5 subsequent generations and subcultures.",

These include protein targeting to the periplasm (550) or the culture medium (230), the use of protease-deficient host strains (211), growth of the host cells at low temperature (100), construction of N-and/or C-terminal fusion proteins (59,230,319,393), tandem fusion of multiple copies of the target gene (512), coexpression of molecular chaperones (489,581), coexpression of the T4 pin gene (519-521), replacement of specific amino acid residues to eliminate protease cleavage sites (243), modification of the hydrophobicity of the target protein (394), and optimization of fermentation conditions (24,338). \n\nAlthough the variety of approaches for protein stabilization attests to the ingenuity of the investigators, the usefulness of some of the above methods may be limited, depending on the intended use of the recombinant protein. Thus, for example, the presence of fusion moieties on the target protein may interfere with functional or structural properties (51) or therapeutic applications of the product. The engineering of enzymatic or chemical cleavage sites for the subsequent removal of the fusion partners is a complex process that involves numerous considerations: the accessibility of the cleavage sites to enzyme digestion; the purity, specificity, and cost of the commercially available enzymes; the authenticity of the N or C termini upon enzymatic digestion; the possible modification of the target protein upon chemical treatment, and so forth (see, e.g., references 78, 162, 419, and 567). For the large-scale production of fusion proteins, some of these difficulties are amplified. Similarly, the fusion of multiple copies of the target gene to create multidomain polypeptides (512) requires the subsequent conversion to monomeric protein units by cyanogen bromide cleavage. In this case, the target protein must not contain internal methionine residues and must be able to withstand harsh reaction conditions.",

            "text": "The production of recombinant proteins usually reduces cell fitness and the growth rate of producing cells. The growth disadvantage favors faster\u2010growing non\u2010producer mutants. Therefore, continuous bioprocessing is hardly feasible in Escherichia coli due to the high escape rate. The stability of E. coli expression systems under long\u2010term production conditions and how metabolic load triggered by recombinant gene expression influences the characteristics of mutations are investigated. Iterated fed\u2010batch\u2010like microbioreactor cultivations are conducted under production conditions. The easy\u2010to\u2010produce green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a challenging antigen\u2010binding fragment (Fab) are used as model proteins, and BL21(DE3) and BL21Q strains as expression hosts. In comparative whole\u2010genome sequencing analyses, mutations that allowed cells to grow unhindered despite recombinant protein production are identified. A T7 RNA polymerase expression system is only conditionally suitable for long\u2010term cultivation under production conditions. Mutations leading to non\u2010producers occur in either the T7 RNA polymerase gene or the T7 promoter. The host RNA polymerase\u2010based BL21Q expression system remains stable in the production of GFP in long\u2010term cultivations. For the production of Fab, mutations in lacI of the BL21Q derivatives have positive effects on long\u2010term stability. The results indicate that adaptive evolution carried out with genome\u2010integrated E. coli expression systems in microtiter cultivations under industrial\u2010relevant production conditions is an efficient strain development tool for production hosts.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used host organisms for the production of biopharmaceuticals, as it allows for cost-efficient and fast recombinant protein expression. Today, about 30% of approved biopharmaceuticals are produced by E. coli, and despite the recent advance of other production systems such as mammalian cell culture, new product approvals, like Beovu\u00ae and Cablivi R in 2019, are constantly being granted, allowing E. coli to compete with both mammalian and non-mammalian hosts [1,2]. E. coli is not equally suited for the expression of all proteins, as it lacks the ability for several key posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, cytosolic disulphide bond formation and proteolytic protein maturation [3]. Nonetheless, there are certain commercially available strains that enable the formation of cytosolic disulphide bonds like the Shuffle and Origami E. coli hosts [3][4][5]. However, the expression of complex recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a major challenge as it can lead to accumulation of the protein of interest (POI) in inclusion bodies or low expression titres [6][7][8][9]. \n\nTo obtain an efficient recombinant protein production process in E. coli, several factors play a key role. These include the basic choice of the expression system design, like plasmid-based or genome-integrated expression cassettes, and, in this regard, the copy number of the plasmid and the gene of interest (GOI) [2,6]. Also, a suitable promotor system for high level protein expression must be employed and the mRNA has to have an appropriate stability for recombinant protein expression [6]. Furthermore, the choice of fermentation process and parameters, the media composition and induction strategy play a major role for high-yield recombinant protein production [6]. \n\nAlongside all these factors, the optimization of translation initiation, which is the rate limiting and most tightly regulated step in protein biosynthesis, has received much attention in the last two decades [10].",

            "text": "By the end of the nineteenth century, the German microbiologist Theodor Escherich discovered a fast-growing bacterium that was called Escherichia coli after its discoverer. E. coli has become one of the most important model organisms in biology and the main workhorse in biotechnology. As a model organism, E. coli has been widely used to study evolution, and in biotechnology, it has been routinely used for the production of recombinant proteins [1]. However, recombinant protein production yields and the quality of the produced material are often not satisfactory. To create E. coli strains with improved protein production characteristics, directed engineering approaches, like deleting genes encoding proteases and coexpressing genes encoding molecular chaperones, have been commonly used [2]. However, thus far, there have been only few reported examples of the isolation of E. coli protein production strains using evolutionary, i.e., screening-and selection-based approaches. Aim of this review is to discuss the in-our-opinion most relevant examples. To set the stage for this, we first give an overview of some inour-opinion critical basics of bacterial evolution and mutagenesis. Based on our own experience, such an overview is very useful if one is interested in evolving E. coli strains for protein production, but does not have a background in bacterial genetics. However, those who are familiar with bacterial evolution and mutagenesis may skip the overview and immediately go to the section 'E. coli as a platform for the production of recombinant proteins'.",

            "text": "The existing obstacles to CRISPR-based editing in bacteria and guidelines to help achieve and enhance editing in bacteria were also described in a recent review (Vento et al., 2019). Deletion of the D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase gene dacC has resulted in enhanced extracellular protein production in E. coli (Hu et al., 2019). Alkaline phosphatase (phoA) promoter and the heatstable enterotoxin II (STII) leader sequence have also facilitated extracellular production in E. coli for the manufacture of Fab fragments (Luo et al., 2019). It was established that the posttranslational targeting of single-chain variable antibody fragment (scFv) BL1 enabled its efficient production in the periplasm due to a favorable adaptation of the E. coli proteome (Ytterberg et al., 2019). It was also revealed that by combining signal peptide and production rate screening, enhanced recombinant protein yields were obtained in the E. coli periplasm (Karyolaimos et al., 2019). One study established scale-up of a type I secretion system in E. coli using a defined mineral medium, paving the way for industrial application (Ihling et al., 2019). The industrially important strain engineering strategies utilized to increase both the quantity and quality of therapeutic products were discussed in another study (Casti\u00f1eiras et al., 2018). Another study described the use of hierarchical-Beneficial Regulatory Targeting (h-BeReTa) employing a genome-scale metabolic model and transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) to identify the relevant TR targets for strain improvement (Koduru et al., 2018). Translating heterologous proteins places a major burden on host cells, consuming expression resources and leading to slower cell growth and productivity. In a recent study, a standard cell lysatebased assay was used to quantify the burden of expressing a protein-coding sequence and provided a parameter for predicting the burden synthetic gene expression places on E. coli.",

These proteins are produced in the eukaryotic or prokaryotic heterologous hosts. By increasing the omics data especially related to different heterologous hosts as well as the presence of new amenable genetic engineering tools, we can artificially engineer heterologous hosts to produce recombinant proteins in sufficient quantities. Numerous recombinant proteins have been produced and applied in various industries, and the global recombinant proteins market size is expected to be cast to reach USD 2.4 billion by 2027. Therefore, identifying the weakness and strengths of heterologous hosts is critical to optimize the large-scale biosynthesis of recombinant proteins. E. coli is one of the popular hosts to produce recombinant proteins. Scientists reported some bottlenecks in this host, and due to the increasing demand for the production of recombinant proteins, there is an urgent need to improve this host. In this review, we first provide general information about the E. coli host and compare it with other hosts. In the next step, we describe the factors involved in the expression of the recombinant proteins in E. coli . Successful expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli requires a complete elucidation of these factors. Here, the characteristics of each factor will be fully described, and this information can help to improve the heterologous expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli .",

            "text": "Another effective factor in the expression of recombinant proteins is the conditions of bacterial cultures. Researchers use shake flasks for the optimization of growth conditions. These shake flasks do not require any special instruments (Ladner et al. 2019). However, unlike bioreactors, standard cultivation of E. coli in shake flasks is done in batches. Batch growth in flasks has several limitations such as lack of pH control, low aeration, and nutrient shortage (Weuster-Botz et al. 2001). In aerobic cultures, oxygen supply is vital. Under oxygen-restricted conditions, the metabolism of a microorganism is substantially altered, and unwanted by-products like organic acids such as acetate and ethanol may be composed (Losen et al. 2004). In E.coli, high cell density followed by the formation of acetate leads to toxicity during the culture period. Controlling oxygen levels can greatly control toxicity (Johnson et al. 2010). Acetate production and its toxicity can be solved by continuously feeding the culture with glucose and maintaining the growth rate, especially before entering the acetate production stage (Millard et al. 2021). Different types of bioreactor systems have been introduced for large-scale production of recombinant proteins in E.coli (Blunt et al. 2018;Lopes et al. 2014;Muhamad Ali et al. 2015). In one experiment, researchers used a new device (gas-vortex bioreactor) for large-scale production of recombinant proteins in E. coli and claimed their method outperformed the stirred bioreactor (Savelyeva et al. 2017). Culture conditions (such as temperature, oxygen supply, and pH) were confirmed to have a significant effect on the largescale production of recombinant proteins in E. coli (Zare et al. 2019). In one research, nerve growth factor (\u03b2-NGF) protein was heterologously produced in E. coli DE3 strain, and it was reported that the 30% dissolved oxygen and postinduction temperature of 28.5 \u00b0C were the best values to produce this protein in the bioreactor (Hajihassan et al. 2019).

            "text": "E. coli is preferred for heterologous protein production because of its fast growth, simple fermentation, uncomplicated nutritional and sterility requirements, and extensive characterisation [1]. Despite its widespread use [2], however, many heterologous proteins are produced as insoluble aggregates in cytoplasmic or periplasmic inclusion bodies, while the membrane leakiness and cell lysis associated with making heterologous proteins in E. coli, leading to significantly reduced yields, have also been well documented [3,4].\n\nThe discovery of molecular chaperones and folding catalysts appeared to present a panacea for protein aggregation and cell lysis problems in E. coli [5][6][7]. Molecular chaperones prevent aggregation by binding exposed hydrophobic moieties in unfolded, partially folded or misfolded polypeptides and traffic molecules to their sub-cellular destination, while folding catalysts catalyse potentially rate-limiting steps in the folding process, such as peptidyl bond isomerisation or disulfide bond formation. Painstaking investigation of these molecules has met with disparate results to date as simple overexpression of a single modulator in the absence of its accessory molecules frequently sees no positive effect -and may simply increase the production load to the further detriment of the recombinant target. In the absence of an ability to predict the relevant bottleneck in E. coli, therefore, an increasingly common approach by researchers is the use of chaperone \"cocktails\", which is facilitated by the recent availability of a number of plasmid systems that can be used to co-produce up to 6-7 folding modulators with a heterologous protein [8,9].\n\nA universal system of producing active, recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a core objective of the biotechnology industry. In this paper, we review progress in exploiting folding modulators from E. coli to improve the functional production of heterologous proteins.",

            "text": "Since the mammalian hormone somatostatin was first used to realize heterologous expression in Escherichia coli (Itakura et al., 1977), the expression of recombinant protein has developed rapidly for various applications, including industrial enzyme production (Headon and Walsh, 1994), biopharmaceuticals (Jozala et al., 2016), and vaccine production (Christodoulides et al., 2001). The production of recombinant proteins has been implemented in many different prokaryotic and eukaryotic host systems, including E. coli, yeast, filamentous fungi, insect cells, Arabidopsis, and even in mammalian cell culture lines (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009). Among these systems, E. coli is often preferred due to its fast growth, high cell density cultures, rich complex media, and easy transformation (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). In order to improve the heterologous protein expression of E. coli systems, a number of protein tags have been developed, including the maltose-binding protein (MBP; Kapust and Waugh, 1999), glutathione S-transferase (GST; Smith and Johnson, 1988), small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO; Marblestone et al., 2006), N-utilization substance protein A (NusA; Davis et al., 1999), thioredoxin (Trx;LaVallie et al., 1993), and ubiquitin (Bachmair et al., 1986;Varshavsky, 2005).",

            "text": "A survey of the literature in this field from the past decade has revealed no standardized method developed to promote solubility for enzymes expressed through recombinant technology. This review identifies trends in the experimental design for recombinant expression studies, in the industrial biotechnology sector, that ultimately generated inclusion bodies in E. coli. Our analysis identified which methods or tools, if any, were employed in designing the recombinant expression system and the impact on the mitigation of inclusion bodies. Our goal was to highlight the factors/strategies researchers tend to prioritize and provide a measure for their popularity implicated by the frequency of their use. Our analysis was focused on work published in the field of industrial biotechnology since 2010. Manufacturing of numerous recombinant protein products, including those of biopharmaceutical use such as growth factors, antibodies, or cytokines had historically been in the remit of recombinant protein production by E. coli. Several well-cited reviews exist on the subject, which address the challenges associated with using E. coli for these purposes [16][17][18]. Over the past decade, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells have increasingly dominated the manufacturing process as hosts for expressing protein-based biologics, therapeutics, and other relevant eukaryotic proteins. CHO cell-based systems are currently used to manufacture up to 84% [19] of approved biopharmaceuticals as opposed to 30% in E. coli [16]. This was primarily following the efforts towards the sequencing the CHO genome and its subsequent publication in 2011 [20]. Nevertheless E. coli has remained the standard workhorse for industrial biotechnology applications. Our analysis, therefore, focused on enzymes of prokaryotic origin and their plasmid-based expression in E. coli. These enzymes are industrially valuable due to their sustained performance in non-conventional niche environments owing to the wide distribution prokaryotes in adverse or unique habitats [21]. This reallocation of dominant sector preference for specific hosts in the manufacturing of different types of proteins has necessitated that even more attention needed to be paid to the improvement of host strains and expression systems of E. coli tailored to specialized applications.",

            "text": "In recent research, Escherichia coli (E. coli) has established itself as one of the most extensively used systems in the industrial production of recombinant proteins, which owes much to the high yield of production that is possible with this system, the low manufacturing cost, a wellcharacterized expression system, and amenability to high cell-density fermentation biotechnology [1,2]. In addition, due to a lack of appropriate folding-assistance proteins and cofactors that can mediate post-translational modifications, the likelihood of inclusion body formation is considerately high when heterologous proteins are expressed in E. coli [3]. However, continuous endeavors have been devoted to overcome such limitations. With the aid of genetic and protein engineering strategies, there are many solutions that can potentially provide successful expression of soluble recombinant proteins in an E. coli expression system, including choosing a suitable expression host and vector, codon usage, sequence optimization, inducer concentration, expression temperature, fusion technology and co-expression of a chaperone. \n\nTherapeutic and diagnostic proteins as biopharmaceuticals have been applied widely particularly in respect of the broader interest in recombinant technology. These proteins are required in sufficient quantities; however, it remains a challenge to obtain enough proteins from natural sources. To express eukaryotic proteins in E. coli, the concept of fusion technology represents an effective method to enhance protein solubility [4]. In a contemporary study, fusion expression vectors provide useful tools to strengthen the solubility and productivity of eukaryotic proteins, including Maltose-binding protein (MBP), N-utilization substance A (NusA), Thioredoxin A (Trx) and translation initiation factor 2 domain I (IF2). Furthermore, it has recently been determined that fusion partners like the Fasciola hepatica 8 kDa antigen (Fh8), the E. coli secreted protein A (EspA) and KDPG aldolase (EDA) have emerged with the intent of improving synthetic yields, enhancing solubility and folding processes and simplifying the purification of eukaryotic proteins [3][4][5].",

            "title": "Strategies for achieving high-level expression of genes in Escherichia coli",
            "text": "The choice of an expression system for the high-level production of recombinant proteins depends on many factors. These include cell growth characteristics, expression levels, intracellular and extracellular expression, posttranslational modifications, and biological activity of the protein of interest, as well as regulatory issues in the production of therapeutic proteins (191,254). In addition, the selection of a particular expression system requires a cost breakdown in terms of process, design, and other economic considerations. The relative merits of bacterial, yeast, insect, and mammalian expression systems have been examined in detail in an excellent review by Marino (362). In addition, Datar et al. (121) have analyzed the economic issues associated with protein production in bacterial and mammalian cells. \n\nThe many advantages of Escherichia coli have ensured that it remains a valuable organism for the high-level production of recombinant proteins (177a, 197, 254, 362, 406, 426, 510). However, in spite of the extensive knowledge on the genetics and molecular biology of E. coli, not every gene can be expressed efficiently in this organism. This may be due to the unique and subtle structural features of the gene sequence, the stability and translational efficiency of mRNA, the ease of protein folding, degradation of the protein by host cell proteases, major differences in codon usage between the foreign gene and native E. coli, and the potential toxicity of the protein to the host. Fortunately, some empirical \"rules\" that can guide the design of expression systems and limit the unpredictability of this operation in E. coli have emerged. The major drawbacks of E. coli as an expression system include the inability to perform many of the posttranslational modifications found in eukaryotic proteins, the lack of a secretion mechanism for the efficient release of protein into the culture medium, and the limited ability to facilitate extensive disulfide bond formation. On the other hand, many eukaryotic proteins retain their full biological activity in a nonglycosylated form and therefore can be produced in E. coli (see, e.g., references 170, 342, and 486).",

            "text": "This system was transferred to E. coli [60] and the production of glycosylated proteins at a scale of 5 L was made possible [61]. There are still several significant challenges to be overcome in the production of glycosylated proteins in E. coli. Not only sometimes glycosylation is incomplete, but also its efficiency can be very low and heterogeneity can be found if more than one glycosylation site is present. Additionally, the production of glycosylated proteins was shown to negatively affect cell growth [4]. Since most of the eukaryotic proteins are Nterminally acetylated, this modification is very important in recombinant protein production in prokaryotic systems as acetylation has shown to affect several cellular processes. Also, phosphorylation is very important for the activity of many recombinant proteins and it was shown that either by co-expressing chaperone proteins or by performing gene fusions, it was possible to obtain some acetylated and phosphorylated proteins in E. coli [4]. \n\nOther drawbacks are the possibility of acetate accumulation, which has a toxic effect, although this can be controlled by the oxygen level and careful choice of the expression strain. Additionally, many proteins are produced as insoluble inclusion bodies, which are inactive and require refolding. \n\nAlthough it has been argued that recombinant protein production in inclusion bodies decreases the deleterious effects associated with protein toxicity (as the protein is not active), it must be remembered that high-level recombinant protein production is always toxic to the cells due to the metabolic burden associated with the expenditure of energy, amino acids and other precursor molecules. In order to obtain an active protein from these inclusion bodies, it is often necessary to remove them from the cells, the proteins must be solubilized by denaturants that cause protein unfolding, and disulfide bonds must be broken using reducing agents. Refolding than proceeds by removing the denaturant and reducing agent followed by renaturation with oxidation agents [5].",

            "text": "Recombinant protein production has become a routine practice in many laboratories from academic to industrial fields. Several hosts are available for protein production among them, Escherichia coli has been by far the most widely used. Some advantages of this host is the low cost, infrastructure of implementation, easy handling, high yield production, and an ever increasing set of tools and genetic information useful for the expression of challenging targets. Despite its importance and utility, recombinant proteins (RP) not always are produced in a soluble and homogeneous state. For these \"difficult to express\" proteins, several approaches have been developed in order to overcome the problems associated with insolubility. Some parameters that can affect protein expression are: induction temperature, promoter strength, use of specific E. coli strains, co-expression of molecular chaperones or biological partners and the use of different solubility enhancer or fusion proteins (Correa and Oppezzo, 2011). In the last decade, the advent of high-throughput screening methods have facilitated the evaluation of hundreds of conditions generated from the combination of the mentioned parameters in order to find one that gives a soluble protein (Vincentelli et al., 2011;Vincentelli and Romier, 2013). However, to exploit all these variables it is necessary to have a method for cloning the target gene in many different vectors in a fast and simple manner. Several techniques were recently generated to facilitate the cloning of target genes in a parallel way, in which the same insert can be introduced into different expression vectors simultaneously. Among these methods are the Gateway technology [Invitrogen, (Esposito et al., 2009)], In-Fusion technology, [Clontech, (Berrow et al., 2007)], Ligase Independent Cloning, (Aslanidis and de Jong, 1990), and Restriction Free Cloning, [RF cloning, (Unger et al., 2010)].",

In shake flasks, E. coli generally produces a low amount of proteins (mg/L). However, in fermenters, several grams in a liter (g/L) can be achieved [47]. Besides the above-mentioned benefits, there are some main and general drawbacks that can arise, like the lack of proper post-translational modifications (PTMs), the formation of inclusion bodies (IB), codon bias, metabolic burden (acetate accumulation) [48] and occurrence of proteins degradation. \n\nIn the last decades, numerous E. coli strains engineered to improve their efficiency in the production of recombinant proteins have been developed [49][50][51][52][53] and have been also largely used for the preparation of recombinant antibody-like fragments [54][55][56]. Some of them have also become the gold standard for biopharmaceutical applications while others have remained only tools for basic research [44]. Of interest, the \"bacterial glycoengineering\" is emerging as an advanced biotechnological approach that harnesses prokaryotic glycosylation systems for the generation of recombinantly glycosylated proteins using E. coli host [57]. In a recent exhaustive review, Harding and coworkers have described the oligosaccharyltransferase (OTase)-dependent (periplasmic) and OTase-independent (cytoplasmic) pathways which are recombinantly introduced into E. coli to produce N-or O-glycosylated recombinant proteins, including glycoconjugated vaccines and therapeutic proteins. The same approach can be potentially applied for N-glycosylation of monoclonal antibodies and antibody-related fragments [58,59].",

            "text": "Recombinant biotherapeutic molecules, such as singledomain antibody fragments (dAbs), antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), and single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) are produced in Escherichia coli due to its well-known physiology and genetics. Factors, such as lack of glycosylation, easier production, high expression levels, high cell densities, and low production costs compared to other available expression platforms contribute to popularity of the E. coli platform. \n\nThe last few decades have witnessed significant advancements in cloning strategies, expression, and purification, thereby resulting in improved production of useful antibody-like fragments utilizing E. coli expression system. [1,2] he production process is typically quite simple. The desired gene of interest is cloned into a suitable expression vector, which is further transformed into choice of host, cultivated and induced, and protein is extracted and purified. Post purification, the protein is further characterized for structure and function. [3] However, production of recombinant antibody fragments is typically marred by low expression level and poor refolding yield (if expressed as inclusion bodies). Researchers have reported poor growth of cells and formation of inclusion bodies as the practical obstacles associated to expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli. A wide range of cultivation techniques, such as media composition, temperature, agitation, aeration and concentration of inducers, induction time and molecular techniques are currently in use for high level production of recombinant proteins to overcome the practical problems. Synergistic effects of the physical parameters along with feeding strategies might significantly improve the expression of Fab in microbial expression system. Modified strain with oxidative environment and cell free system developments have been reported to offer enhancement in the expression of biomolecules. [1] One approach involved co-expression of chaperones with the Fab to facilitate its proper folding into a desired conformation retaining its target-binding activity. Alternatively, in vitro Fab refolding from inclusion bodies has been demonstrated. However, these strategies suffer from adverse effects, such as enhanced proteolysis, increased soluble aggregates, growth inhibition, and lack of scalability, and they are therefore difficult to employ during commercial production.

            "text": "During the early development of recombinant DNA technologies in the 1970s, efforts were focused on producing products in bacteria; for example, Escherichia coli, was an attractive low-cost, high-yield (e.g., ~8 g per liter (Menacho-Melgar et al., 2020)) production host. Despite some issues, such as the challenge of purifying recombinant mammalian proteins from bacterial cell components (e.g., the cell wall) and the possibility of endotoxin contaminants (Singh et al., 2016), there were several successfullyproduced therapeutic proteins in E. coli in the 1980s. These including Humulin \u00ae (a recombinant form of insulin), Protropin \u00ae and Humatrope \u00ae (to treat hGH deficiency), Roferon A \u00ae (to treat hairy cell leukemia), and IntronA \u00ae (to treat genital warts and hepatitis) (Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2016). \n\nIn retrospect, the inability of E. coli to N-glycosylate proteins, and therefore to take advantage of the concomitant protein folding chaperone system in mammalian cells (Helenius & Aebi 2001), posed a significant challenge during early attempts to express large, difficult-to-fold mammalian proteins in E. coli that more often than not resulted in inclusion body formation. Unlike human and murine cells, which suffer from fundamental limitations for biomanufacturing (e.g., low product yield safety concerns, and high cost), a major detriment of bacterial production systems is their lack of mammalian-type glycosylation. In theory, this pitfall can be overcome, at least in part, by building N-glycosylation capabilities into E. coli used for recombinant protein production (Wayman et al., 2019). For example, the protein glycosylation pathway of Campylobacter jejuni, a pathogenic bacterium (Szymanski et al., 2002), has been transferred into laboratory strains of E. coli (Pandhal & Wright 2010;Wacker et al., 2002).",

            "text": "The development of complementary technologies enabled the successful production of recombinant polypeptides in bacteria and opened to biology researchers new avenues as obtaining suitable amounts of proteins necessary for their experimental work became easy, fast, and inexpensive. Nevertheless, the recombinant approach remained somehow unpredictable, since many constructs resisted to apparent production or accumulated as aggregates.Several factors and physical/chemical conditions that could improve the accumulation of native-like protein were identified. At the same time, it was acknowledged that the outcome of most of them was erratic and that almost any protein required its own specific optimized set of conditions to achieve its correct folding. The attempt to understand the critical points specific for recombinant protein production missed the goal of setting universally useful protocols, but contributed to the increase of the rate of success by proposing always new empiric combinations.Nevertheless, the results published in the recent literature allow for a better comprehension of some key mechanisms controlling protein production in E. coli and could enable the elaboration of rational methodologies for improving the quantitative and qualitative features of the produced polypeptides. This result will be achieved when the identification of the limiting step that impairs the accomplishment of the native folding for any single construct will become straightforward. This minireview will discuss how factors such as the expression rate, the folding machinery, and the secretion efficiency may impact the final protein yields.",

Several technological advancements have been made to address these issues. Plasmids such as pRARE plasmids have been designed that contain tRNA genes cognate to the rare codons. Co-transformation of these plasmids would increase the copy number of rare tRNA genes in E. coli host and thus would be able to complement the codon usage frequency in heterologous genes. This strategy is very cost-effective and more efficient for enhancing the expression levels of heterologous genes containing large number of rare codons. Solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins can be achieved by using plasmids that contain genes encoding for molecular chaperones such as GroEL, GroES, DnaK, DnaJ and Trigger factor. Molecular chaperones are known to assist in proper folding of recombinant proteins and prevent formation of inclusion bodies. Similarly, fusion protein tags such as GST, MBP, NusA, Ub, TRX and SUMO can be exploited to improve the expression levels of difficult-toexpress recombinant proteins and enhance their solubility. In addition, expression of recombinant proteins in periplasm of E. coli along with molecular chaperones provides various advantages such as improved solubility, proper protein folding, easier protein purification and higher yield of authentic and biologically active recombinant proteins. Some of the antibodies that have been approved for therapeutic use in humans such as Lucentis and Cimzia have been successfully produced in the periplasm of E. coli, thus confirming the commercial viability of this approach.",

            "text": "Various strategies have been designed to circumvent the problem of codon bias in E. coli for enhancing the production of authentic, biologically active heterologous recombinant proteins. One strategy is to synthesize the full-length gene based on codon usage, but the high cost of gene synthesis is a major drawback. Another strategy requires site-directed mutagenesis of the foreign gene to generate codons which correlates with the tRNA pool of E. coli. However, this process is very expensive and time-consuming. Another approach is to co-transform the E. coli with plasmid containing the tRNA gene cognate to the rare codons. By increasing the copy number of rare tRNA genes, E. coli strains can be designed to complement the codon usage frequency in the foreign gene. This strategy is very feasible and cost-effective and highly efficient for expression of heterologous genes harbouring large number of rare codons. McNulty and colleagues carried out the co-expression of argX gene which codes for the cognate tRNA for rare arginine codon CGG, with the p27 protease domain of HSV-2 in order to circumvent the problem of codon bias. It was observed that the co-expression of cognate tRNA gene for CGG codon resulted in abolition of both frame-shift mutation and glutamine misincorporation and enhanced the expression levels of authentic recombinant protein by up to sevenfold [22]. This study clearly suggested that supplementation of the cognate tRNA for the rare codons such as CGG can alleviate the CGG codon bias in E. coli and hence lead to accurate and efficient synthesis of recombinant proteins. This strategy is now routinely being employed for several difficult-to-express heterologous recombinant proteins containing rare codons, in E. coli. Currently, several plasmids such as pRARE plasmids are commercially available which harbour genes encoding for tRNA cognate to rare codons.",

As a manufacturing platform, E. coli faced several obstacles, which may limit its application in protein-based biopharmaceuticals. Their limitation factors included: (1) lack of ability to produce the correct disulfide bonds, (2) fail to produce recombinant proteins with mammalian-like post-translational modifications, (3) the problems of protein solubility, and (4) the presence of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). 17 Posttranslational modifications play an important role in protein folding, processing, and stability, as well as final biological activity and even the immunogenicity of the protein. 110 Disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, phosphorylation and proteolysis processing play a crucial role in biological activity of some recombinant proteins. 15 E. coli cannot synthesize useful HBsAg particles, probably because of unfavorable environmental conditions, such as pH and redox potential, or lipid compositions within the bacterium. 111 Studies have also shown that HBcAg phosphorylation is essential for viral replication and capsid formation. 112 herefore, the expressed proteins may be insoluble, unstable or inactive without post-translational modifications. E. coli stands out as the expression system for the production of small recombinant proteins without post-translational modifications. 14,15  owever, Spiess et al. developed an approach for the efficient generation of nonimmunogenic, stable bispecific antibodies with a natural IgG architecture by co-culture of bacteria (E. coli) expressing two distinct half-antibodies. 113 This technology provides a rapid generation of biospecific antibodies with natural architecture from any two existing antibodies for academic research and industrial development. \n\nCurrently, numerous mutant E. coli strains have been developed to improve the different protein expression (representative examples are shown in Table 3).

            "text": "Escherichia coli is the most widely studied and frequently used host for recombinant protein production because its genetics are well-characterized, the culture periods are short, and protein production levels are high [1][2][3]. Because E. coli has both inner and outer membranes, recombinant proteins produced in this host can localize to the cytoplasm, the periplasm, or the culture medium [2,4]. Production of recombinant proteins in the culture medium is the most desirable of these alternatives, whether the protein is produced on an analytical or industrial scale, because the protein being produced experiences superior protein folding, requires a simpler extraction procedure, and is contaminated with fewer proteins [1,5]. Unfortunately, E. coli is a relatively poor secretor of proteins, which is a significant barrier to the application to this methodology [6]. \n\nMany attempts have been made to enhance the extracellular production of recombinant secretory proteins in E. coli, and some success has been achieved [2,6]. Two different approaches have been pursued. In one approach, protein secretion was enhanced through co-expression or modification of transport proteins [7][8][9][10]. The validity and universality of this approach may be compromised by the complexity and regulatory mechanisms associated with protein secretion systems. The other approach was to enhance nonspecific leakage of the recombinant proteins through the host cell membranes by constructing hosts with a leaky phenotype. Induction of the leaky phenotype can be accomplished through mutation or deletion of membrane components, addition of permeability enhancers (glycine, calcium, Triton X-100, etc.), or co-expression of proteins with lytic activity (bacterial phage lysis proteins) [2,[11][12][13][14]. Because the cell membrane is compromised to some extent, this approach has the inherent risks of impaired cell growth and cell lysis. Cytosolic proteins are generally expressed in the cytoplasm and extracted, after cell disruption, using physical, chemical, or biological methods. These processes result in contamination of the recombinant protein by various cellular components.",

            "text": "Recombinant production of these GFs is challenging and is a major contributor to their high cost. They are of eukaryotic origin and typically require some level of post-translational modification, such as oxidation or glycosylation, and proper disulfide bond formation is essential for protein folding and maturation into their biologically active conformation. Consequently, production of these proteins in bacterial expression systems has been challenging. Strategies to address this issue include refolding GFs expressed in bacteria from inclusion bodies or using mammalian cell culture systems (e.g., CHO, HEK293) for their production (Alexander et al., 1992;Zou and Sun, 2004). Both strategies result in high costs and render SFM cost-prohibitive for use in the production of CCM (Tripathi and Shrivastava, 2019).\n\nEscherichia coli remains a staple of recombinant protein production and when compatible with a target protein, offers advantages in terms of speed, tractability, and cost (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Several advancements in strain engineering have made E. coli an improved host for production of disulfide-containing proteins. Mutation of trxB and gor genes (Bessette et al., 1999), as well as cytoplasmic overexpression of disulfide bond isomerases (e.g., DsbC) (Lobstein et al., 2012) are strategies that have facilitated the expression of disulfide-containing proteins in E. coli, culminating in the development of commercial strains such as Rosetta-gami B (Novagen) and SHuffle T7 (NEB), respectively. In addition, the use of redox fusion partners such as thioredoxin (Trx) (LaVallie et al., 1993), glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Schafer et al., 2015), and disulfide bond isomerases (DsbA, DsbC) (Nozach et al., 2013) have greatly improved soluble expression of proteins that contain disulfide bonds in E. coli. Despite these advancements, the use of E. coli to produce soluble mitogenic GFs remains under documented as commercial production still",

            "text": "These antibody fragments show better tissue penetration and are less immunogenic to the human body in comparison to the full antibody. Recently, ESETEC secretion technology (Wacker Biotech) has been developed to secrete recombinant products into the culture broth during fermentation and resulted in a high yield of Fab (exceeding 4.0 g/l) and of scFv (up to 3.5 g/l) (Gupta and Shukla, 2017b). In another study, it was shown that the optimization of antibody fragment production was accompanied by the alleviation of stress production in the periplasm of E. coli. Thus, the monitoring of stress responses could be used to facilitate enhanced recombinant protein production yields (Baumgarten et al., 2018). Overexpression of membrane protein in E. coli may lead to toxicity and low yields of the active protein product. Snijder and Hakulinen (2016) described the challenges associated with overexpression of \u03b1-helical membrane proteins and different approaches to overcoming these challenges as well as a detailed protocol to express and screen membrane proteins using a His-specific fluorescent probe and fluorescent size-exclusion chromatography. Strategies for the production of soluble recombinant proteins using E. coli were described in another study (Gurramkonda et al., 2018). The latest advances in recombinant protein expression in E. coli were also described recently (Rosano et al., 2019). \n\nCRISPR/Cas9 has been used to successfully carry out the chromosomal integration of large DNA into E. coli and was also able to integrate functional genes in diverse E. coli strains (Chung et al., 2017). In a recent study, it was also reported that CRISPR-Cas9-assisted native end-joining editing offered a simple strategy for efficient genetic engineering in E. coli (Huang et al., 2019). The existing obstacles to CRISPR-based editing in bacteria and guidelines to help achieve and enhance editing in bacteria were also described in a recent review (Vento et al., 2019).",

The most widespread expression system is Escherichia coli with the advantage that it is relatively cheap and easy to handle and proteins are produced in large amounts. The disadvantage is that certain proteins are found in the form of inclusion bodies and need a refolding step, which can be critical for the functionality of the allergen. Few proteins cannot be properly expressed in E coli because they require correct disulfide bond formation and/or posttranslational modifications and therefore need to be expressed in eukaryotic cells. No matter which of the expression system from the ones mentioned above is chosen, careful design, construction, and sequencing of the expression vector is important. Regarding antibiotic resistance gene of the expression vectors, kanamycin resistance should be favored over ampicillin because of reports about severe hypersensitivity reactions to ampicillin. Subsequently, master cell bank derived from one single transformed clone should be established and frozen as glycerol stock. This master cell bank will be used for all further production lots, thus ensuring consistency of the end product. For product expression and fermentation, high-cell density cultivation based on a fed-batch protocol is most common, and high-performance cultivation may result in a cell density of more than 100 OD of E coli and more than 200 OD units for Pichia pastoris, both resulting in recombinant protein titers of up to 10 g/L of culture broth. \n\nOn expression, the cells are usually separated by continuous-flow centrifugation, followed by mechanical high-pressure homogenization. Expression and harvesting are referred as upstream processing. Proteins are subsequently purified by several chromatographic steps (eg, hydrophobic interaction, ion exchange, size-exclusion chromatography). In general, downstream processing (protein purification) is usually structured into the capture, intermediate purification, and polishing model.",

However, most of the eukaryotic proteins are typically obtained as insoluble, misfolded inclusion bodies that need solubilization and refolding. Reteplase as a highly disulfide-bonded recombinant protein is an example of difficult to express protein in E. coli. Methods: In this study, a codon optimized reteplase gene was synthetically prepared and cloned under the control of an IPTG inducible T7 promoter. The vector was simultaneously transformed and expressed in three different E. coli strains. The ability of strains for expression of this recombinant pharmaceutical was compared. Also, an attempt was made to increase the soluble production of reteplase in SHuffle T7 E. coli with alterations of expression condition like temperature, inducer concentration and oxygen supply. Results: High amounts of reteplase were expressed as inclusion bodies in all three strains. BL21 (DE3) showed the highest level of expression in inclusion bodies followed by Rosetta-gami (DE3) and Shuffle T7. Changes of expression conditions were insufficient for soluble expression of reteplase in SHuffle T7 as a genetically engineered host for production of disulfide bonded proteins. Conclusion: The oxidizing cytoplasm of Rosetta-gami and Shuffle T7 in addition to alterations of cultivation parameters could not result in soluble production of reteplase, although the inclusion bodies produced in these two strains might increase the rate of refolding procedure likely due to formation of folding intermediates.",

            "text": "Successful recombinant protein expression and purification is frequently indispensable for both basic research studies and biotechnological and commercial applications [166]. Highthroughput protein expression and purification in E. coli has begun to revolutionize the manner in which studies are conducted in various research fields. Experiments that were typically performed manually to address one protein at a time over a period of several weeks can now be conducted for hundreds of proteins in as little as one week. However, limitations still exist and further improvements are possible. In terms of obtaining target genes, in silico design followed by array-based de novo synthesis rather than PCR may become widely used in the future. The major challenges associated with de novo synthesis are sequence errors, availability and cost. However, if array-based gene synthesis can be commercialized, the costs could decrease by 3-5 orders of magnitude to 10 3 -10 5 bp per dollar [25].\n\nCloning methods have seen rapid advances, and cloning systems used in both commercial and academic settings can be operated with high efficiency, fidelity and reliability, and at a reasonably low cost. The first requirement is to develop a highly flexible expression vector that is fully compatible with high-throughput procedures. An optimal vector must contain a strong but tunable promoter and tags with optimized N-terminal codons to facilitate protein expression, solubility and purification. Large N-terminal tags have been used to enhance translational initiation and promote solubility. However, the cleavage of these large tags may complicate the experiment being conducted and substantially add to the final cost compared to the use of short tags. Given that the downstream costs of testing the functions of individual proteins are often far higher than protein production costs, the cost will probably not dramatically affect experimental workflows. Moreover, new tags are being developed, but considerable room for improvement remains.\n\nCurrently, certain post-translational modifications can be achieved in E. coli by coexpressing the corresponding enzymes. However, such coexpression invariably affects the growth rate of E. coli, and several vectors cannot be readily coexpressed in a single strain. One solution is to integrate genes encoding post-translational modification factors into the genome to create 'eukaryotic-like' E. coli. Moreover, according to previous studies, tuning or precisely controlling the",

            "text": "Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is simple, fast, inexpensive, and robust, with the expressed protein comprising up to 50 percent of the total cellular protein. However, it also has disadvantages. For example, the rapidity of bacterial protein expression often results in unfolded/misfolded proteins, especially for heterologous proteins that require longer times and/or molecular chaperones to fold correctly. In addition, the highly reductive environment of the bacterial cytosol and the inability of E. coli to perform several eukaryotic post\u2010translational modifications results in the insoluble expression of proteins that require these modifications for folding and activity. Fortunately, multiple, novel reagents and techniques have been developed that allow for the efficient, soluble production of a diverse range of heterologous proteins in E. coli. This overview describes variables at each stage of a protein expression experiment that can influence solubility and offers a summary of strategies used to optimize soluble expression in E. coli.

            "text": "These systems create conditions favoring the accumulation of functional proteins. Nonetheless, the high cost of production processes in eukaryotic systems and the potential presence of human pathogens have led to the development of alternative yet efficient prokaryotic expression systems [9]. Among these systems, the Escherichia coli-based expression system has been extensively employed, utilizing a broad range of expression vectors and recombinant strains that enable the production of large quantities of heterologous proteins [10]. The technical procedures associated with these prokaryotic systems are simpler, faster, inexpensive, and easily scalable compared to most eukaryotic systems. However, certain types of proteins still pose challenges in terms of achieving sufficient quantity and quality when using a bacterial expression system. Ongoing scientific research continually reports advancements in the production processes of these difficult-to-produce proteins [11]. Access to tools and strategies that facilitate the production of such proteins is crucial for meeting the scientific and healthcare demands of our society. Therefore, it is a significant milestone for the entire scientific community specializing in this field. \n\nThis new Special Issue entitled \"Heterologous Expression of Difficult-to-Produce Proteins in Bacterial Systems\" of the International Journal of Molecular Sciences includes a total of nine contributions-four original articles and five reviews-that compile the latest biotechnological advancements, which enable the full utilization of the bacterial expression system's potential in obtaining difficult-to-produce heterologous proteins. \n\nOne important challenge in recombinant protein production processes using bacteria is post-translational modification. Among these modifications, disulfide bond formation is especially relevant since the folding of significant number of proteins depends on it. Thus, the development of strategies to produce functional proteins containing cysteines, which form disulfide bonds, is highly relevant in a reducing environment such as the E. coli cytoplasm. Commercial strains with mutations in the two genes involved in the reduction pathway (gor and trxB) were developed [3]. In addition, a CyDisCo (cytoplasmic disulfide bond formation in E. coli) system was developed to produce proteins rich in disulfide bonds.",

            "text": "demonstrate the suitability of a vector combination with independent, tight control of PglB and carrier protein expression for efficient glycoconjugate production with E. coli. P BAD is well-known for its tight repression [31] while P tac is prone to leaky expression if LacI repressor levels are too low [41]. In our case, with the gene for LacI present on the pEXT21-derived plasmid, no expression was detectable in the absence of inducers for both promoters (Figures 3 and 4C).\n\nSeveral novel aspects of the E. coli in vivo system for glycoprotein production became apparent. First, the delayed appearance of glycoconjugates on immunoblots compared to the carrier proteins indicates that Nglycosylation was the rate-limiting step, assuming that polysaccharide precursors were not limiting. Second, slight differences in cultivation conditions such as presence of an additional carbon source or specific growth rate at induction had an unexpectedly strong effect on the efficiency of glycosylation, but carrier protein synthesis remained unaffected. Pre-induction growth rates have been shown to influence the yields of recombinant proteins in other studies [42,43], but mostly only one protein had to be expressed. A systematic analysis of how cell physiology influences the efficiency of glycosylation would be of high practical relevance, but was without the scope of this study.\n\nIn this work it was demonstrated for the first time that glycosylated proteins can be produced in recombinant E. coli at a larger scale in fed-batch culture. We used a semi-defined glycerol medium and a simple pulse feed strategy. Such a design had been used successfully by others in E. coli processes, e.g., for the production of bovine growth hormone [44]. It is clear that the time-space-yields for glycoconjugates produced in E. coli are still low compared to unmodified, cytoplasmic recombinant proteins for which productivities up to 0.2 g L -1 h -1 and final yields of several grams per litre can be reached [43][44][45][46].

Besides, the extracellular secretion of target proteins can improve the recombinant protein yield because the target protein accumulation is not limited in periplasmic or intracellular space (Makrides, 1996;Fu et al., 2005). \n\nNormally, extracellular secretion of recombinant proteins is blocked mainly due to the difficulties in protein translocation across the two membranes -the cell membrane and the outer membrane of E. coli cells (Koebnik et al., 2000;Choi and Lee, 2004). Although periplasmic expression of recombinant proteins can often be achieved with the help of a signal peptide, the available methods to overcome the outer membrane barrier for extracellular production of recombinant proteins are limited. In order to solve this problem, various genetic attempts have been made to facilitate the extracellular secretion of recombinant proteins in E. coli, including manipulation of transport pathways (Sugamata and Shiba, 2005), optimization of codon and signal sequence (Takemori et al., 2012), fusion expression of carrier protein which can be normally secreted extracellularly (Fernandez et al., 2000;Choi and Lee, 2004) and fusion expression of outer membrane protein F (Jeong and Lee, 2002), YebF (Zhang et al., 2006) or osmotically inducible protein Y (Qian et al., 2008). In addition, the coexpression of lysis-promoting proteins such as bacteriocin release protein (BRP) (van der Wal et al., 1995) or colicin E1 lysis protein (Kil) (Robbens et al., 1995), as well as the use of wall-less strains (the so-called L-forms) (Gumpert and Hoischen, 1998) have also been reported.",

            "text": "The industrial production of recombinant proteins secreted by E. coli is essential in the biotechnology industry (Yoon et al., 2010). E. coli has advantageous properties, such as rapid growth to high cell densities on a low-cost carbon source, and serves as a platform for recombinant protein production (Baneyx & Mujacic, 2004). Due to its extensive use as a model system, E. coli genetics have been extensively characterized, resulting in the development of numerous tools that aid in chromosome engineering, gene replication, and gene expression (Mergulhao et al., 2005). Recombinant proteins can be targeted to different compartments within E. coli, including the cytoplasm, periplasm, and extracellular space. However, cytoplasmic expression of recombinant proteins is challenging. Proteins expressed in the cytoplasm may be susceptible to degradation by cellular proteases or accumulate as insoluble inclusion bodies, rendering them inactive (Mergulhao & Monteiro, 2007). In addition, cytoplasmic expression of certain proteins can have toxic effects on host cells, leading to reduced protein yields or even cell death (Mierendorf et al., 1998). In contrast, extracellular expression in E. coli offers several advantages for the production of recombinant proteins, including simplified downstream processing, reduced host cell contamination, high expression levels, reduced protein degradation, and increased solubility (Choi & Lee, 2004). E. coli has two major secretory pathways, the Sec and Tat pathways (Costa et al., 2015). The Sec pathway, which facilitates the transport of proteins from the cytoplasmic membrane, was the first secretory pathway identified in bacteria (Beckwith, 2013). This pathway has demonstrated the ability to translocate proteins in an unfolded state, thereby facilitating the efficient export of target proteins (Crane & Randall, 2017). In contrast, the Tat pathway has the distinct ability to transport fully folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane (Choi & Lee, 2004). \n\nChitosanase (EC 3.2.1.132)",

It is a good economic development indication for biopharmaceutical company [1]. In 2018, there are 316 biopharmaceutical products consist of recombinant therapeutic protein and nucleic acid approved in USA and Europe [2]. The major challenges in recombinant protein production are to reduce the production cost, improve the productivity both in upstream and downstream, and obtain high titer while maintaining the quality of the recombinant protein products [1].\n\nEscherichia coli had attested its versatility and economic potential in production [3]. There is a wealth of knowledge and comprehensive tools for E. coli systems, such as expression vectors, production strains, protein folding and fermentation technologies that are well tailored for industrial applications. Hence, with its recent advancements, the use of E. coli has been a preferred choice and a workhorse not only for expression of non-glycosylated proteins in the biotech industry, but also a complex protein production, bacterial N-linked glycosylation, novel strain engineering and creation of E. coli cell-free systems [4]. Varieties of promoters are used in the production of recombinant proteins. Some of the strong promoters are induced by isopropyl-\u03b2-Dthiogalacto-pyranoside (IPTG) (i.e. tac, trc, and lac), which however has been reported to the limitation of its toxicity for the host cells and also causing an ineffective production cost due to its expensiveness [1,[4][5][6].\n\nIn the previous research, an auto-inducible expression plasmid, which derivate of pBR322, with dps promoter (pCADsod) had been constructed to express sodA from Staphylococcus equorum encoding a Mn superoxide dismutase (rMnSODSeq) in stationary phase.

            "text": "Recombinant protein production with Escherichia coli is usually carried out in fed-batch mode in industry. As set-up and cleaning of equipment are time- and cost-intensive, it would be economically and environmentally favorable to reduce the number of these procedures. Switching from fed-batch to continuous biomanufacturing with microbials is not yet applied as these cultivations still suffer from time-dependent variations in productivity. Repetitive fed-batch process technology facilitates critical equipment usage, reduces the environmental fingerprint and potentially increases the overall space-time yield. Surprisingly, studies on repetitive fed-batch processes for recombinant protein production can be found for yeasts only. Knowledge on repetitive fed-batch cultivation technology for recombinant protein production in E. coli is not available until now. In this study, a mixed feed approach, enabling repetitive fed-batch technology for recombinant protein production in E. coli, was developed. Effects of the cultivation mode on the space-time yield for a single-cycle fed-batch, a two-cycle repetitive fed-batch, a three-cycle repetitive fed batch and a chemostat cultivation were investigated. For that purpose, we used two different E. coli strains, expressing a model protein in the cytoplasm or in the periplasm, respectively. Our results demonstrate that a repetitive fed-batch for E. coli leads to a higher space-time yield compared to a single-cycle fed-batch and can potentially outperform continuous biomanufacturing. For the first time, we were able to show that repetitive fed-batch technology is highly suitable for recombinant protein production in E. coli using our mixed feeding approach, as it potentially (i) improves product throughput by using critical equipment to its full capacity and (ii) allows implementation of a more economic process by reducing cleaning and set-up times.",

IMPORTANCE The bacterium Escherichia coli is widely used to produce recombinant proteins. To fold properly, many recombinant proteins have to be targeted to the E. coli periplasm, but so far the impact of the targeting pathway of a recombinant protein to the periplasm has not been extensively investigated. Here, we show that the targeting pathway of a recombinant antibody fragment has a tremendous impact on cell physiology, ultimately affecting protein production yields in the periplasm and biomass formation.

            "text": "Recombinant protein production (RPP) is an industrially important tool for the production of hundreds of licensed recombinant proteins (RPs), including IgG antibodies and antibody fragments (Walsh 2014;Sanchez-Garcia et al. 2016). Unlike their larger full-length IgG monoclonal antibody counterparts, which are commonly produced in mammalian cells, the relative simplicity of antibody fragments and their requirement for fewer post-translational modifications makes them suitable for production in bacterial hosts. The bacterium Escherichia coli is a commonly employed host for recombinant protein production (RPP) contributing to the production of one-third of FDA approved human biotherapeutics (Overton 2014;Walsh 2014). Single chain variable fragments (scFv) are an emerging class of IgG fragments comprising the antigen-binding variable heavy (V H ) and variable light (V L ) domains fused into a single polypeptide chain with a flexible linker (Nelson 2010). \n\nThe suitability of E. coli as a host for production of recombinant antibody fragments and other human biotherapeutic proteins stems, in large part from the following: (i) its physiology, metabolism and behaviour are very well understood compared to other bacterial species; (ii) it exhibits much faster growth, attains higher cell densities and also requires much cheaper growth media than mammalian hosts; and (iii) although it cannot produce RPs with 'human-like' glycosylation, it can generate disulphide bonds (Pl\u00fcckthun and Skerra 1989;Hsu et al. 2016). \n\nUnlike the cytoplasm, which is a reducing environment, the periplasm is an oxidising environment and so favours the formation of disulphide bonds (de Marco 2009); it also contains enzymes which catalyse the formation, correction and maintenance of disulphide bonds (the Dsb enzymes (Inaba 2009). The periplasm of E. coli offers additional advantages as a cellular compartment for targeting RPs in bioprocesses.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most used systems for recombinant protein production. E. coli cells have rapid growth, high productivity, potential for scale-up production and low production cost (Chen, 2012). Consequently, bacteria were used to produce recombinant spider silk proteins (Bhattacharyya et al., 2021). However, low expression level was the most prominent issue which might be due to inefficient transcription and translation. This problem was attributed to the repetitive core domain of sequence resulting in the high demand for glycyl-tRNA. The lack of tRNA or codon choices may cause premature translation termination (Fahnestock and Irwin, 1997b;Xia et al., 2010). To overcome this issue, a metabolically engineerd E. coli, in which the glycyl-tRNA pool was elavated, could express the 284.9 kDa protein of N. clavipes. A repeat motif 34 bp from MaSp1 partial cds of N. clavipes (accession number M37137) (Table 5) was used in this research. The yield was 1.2 g/L after purification, and the tenacity, elongation and Young's modulus were similar to those of N. clavipes dragline silk fibres (Xia et al., 2010). \n\nTo produce spider silk protein with longer size in E. coli, the split inteins mediated ligation technique was utilized. DNA part assembly allows for repeat motifs assembly by digestion and enzymatic ligation. A single repeat unit from MaSp1 was used to create up to 192-mer protein. Proteins with a molecular mass of 556 kDa were created at a yield of 2 g/L or 63 mg/g cell dry weight. Tensile strength and modulus were estimated from 1.03 \u00b1 0.11 GPa to 13.7 \u00b1 3.0 GPa, respectively. These recombinant proteins have similar mechanical properties as their natural counterparts. Fibre to fibre variation likely comes from genetic instability (Bowen et al., 2018) which affects final mechanical properties. These recombinant proteins do not possess N-and C-terminals, which may be the reason for shorter fibres.",

(Feng et al., 2010), by shielding them from premature breakdown within the bacterial cell. \n\nTo optimize recombinant expression in E. coli, careful selection of both the bacterial strain and expression vector is essential, guided by a thorough understanding of the target peptides characteristics. This includes considering the desired level of basal expression determined by the vector's promoter (Lozano Terol et al., 2021). The choice of expression vector significantly impacts recombinant protein production in E. coli. Key considerations include the promoter system, which directly influences expression levels. Popular choices include the lac, tac, and lacUV5 promoters (utilized in vectors like pGEX, pMAL, and pUC), as well as the powerful T7 promoter found in the pET system (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014;Tucci et al., 2016;Du et al., 2021). Additionally, some vectors incorporate fusion tags to simplify purification or detection. Careful selection of these elements is crucial for optimizing yield and functionality (Zhang et al., 2022). \n\nBacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), a Gram-positive, endotoxin-free bacterium, offers a safer alternative to E. coli as a recombinant protein expression system (Schallmey et al., 2004).

            "text": "Escherichia coli is a first-choice host for recombinant protein production, however the production of proteins with disulfide bonds is limited in this host. The cytoplasm of E. coli is a reducing environment hence the formation of disulfide bonds is favored only in the periplasm, a compartment which can be problematic for the efficient production of recombinant proteins. When a heterologous protein is expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli the unfavorable folding environment can lead to aggregation and formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Although inclusion bodies can be solubilized and re-folded in vitro, the procedures often require extensive and expensive protein specific optimization. In addition, the final yield of natively folded active protein can be low and the separation of natively folded and misfolded or partially folded protein can be problematic since their biophysical properties e.g. isoelectric point are often very similar. In addition, methods that are developed in research facilities on the shake flask scale are often infeasible on larger scale. \n\nWhile systems based on disruption of the cytoplasmic pathways for disulfide reduction have been reported and marketed for the production of disulfide bond containing proteins, these strains require the use of complex additives e.g. yeast extract and/or soytone. \n\nPreviously we showed that E. coli strains expressing CyDisCo components along with a protein of interest allow efficient disulfide bond formation and protein folding to native state for proteins including alkaline phosphatase, AppA [16], GH1 [19], BPTI, vtPA, resistin, Ero1\u03b1, CFS3, BMP4, catalytic light chain of enterokinase, IFN\u03b12, IL-17 [18] and multiple scFv and Fab antibody fragments [17]. The yields of protein obtained reported could be up to 800-fold higher than in the absence of CyDisCo [18]. We also revealed that disruption of the reducing pathways in the cytoplasm is not necessary for soluble production of disulfide bonded proteins [16].",

            "text": "E. coli is among the extensively applied host for the expression of the protein [43,44] owing to its rapid expression and growth, easy cultivation, and elevated titers [45]. Moreover, its genetics are well elucidated in comparison with other microorganisms. Notwithstanding appreciable merits, the use of E. coli is associated with certain drawbacks, which can probably affect the production efficacy of recombinant proteins. For example, a higher cell density may produce a large amount of acetate harmful to cells. It is also not capable of producing very large proteins. In addition, issues related to difficulties in protein production, disulfide bonds, and refolding ability have also been observed in the E. coli system. Failure to synthesize recombinant protein because of the lack of glycosylation is another problem [46]. The modified production in mold, insect, yeast, or mammalian cells presents higher advantages for achieving glycosylation to attain a properly folded and stable protein. Over the years, other bacterial systems are also emerged for producing recombinant proteins, like engineered Lactococcus lactis as a good cell factory for expressing membrane protein [47]. They exhibit benefits over E. coli in terms of being endotoxin-free and GRAS [48]. Pseudomonas species, including P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. fluorescens were also considered preferred substitutes for E. coli expression systems to achieve a high titer of recombinant proteins. Laffitte et al. [18] cloned thaumatin II gene into E. coli K12, but the yield of protein was very low. A synthetic gene encoding thaumatin II was effectively expressed in E. coli [49]. Saraiva et al. [15] replicated the same system, resulting in about 40 mg of pure thaumatin that showed a comparable sweetness threshold value from the natural source.",

Thus, the expression of disulfidebond containing proteins in E. coli commonly results in the production of insoluble protein (due to misfolding) sequestered into inclusion bodies (Veldkamp et al., 2007;Chen and Leong, 2009); for a review of refolding strategies, see Tsumoto et al., (2003). When refolding conditions cannot be successfully identified, the target protein must be produced solubly in vivo. The three most common strategies to express disulfide-containing proteins, all of which are discussed later in this review, are to try the following: (1) target the expressed protein to the E. coli periplasm, which is highly oxidative (Leichert and Jakob, 2004), (2) fuse the protein to thioredoxin (Lefebvre et al., 2009a), and/or (3) express the protein in bacterial strains containing thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase mutants (Xu et al., 2008).\n\nTransmembrane segments. Finally, the solubility of the recombinantly expressed protein will typically be compromised if the construct includes transmembrane-spanning regions. Thus, the soluble expression of transmembrane-containing proteins, especially integral membrane proteins, in E. coli is exceptionally challenging, requiring specialized materials and strategies (Mohanty and Wiener, 2004;Gordon et al., 2008;Dvir and Choe, 2009).",

The recombinant plasmid was subsequently transformed into E. coli BL21 for expression. E. coli BL21 harboring the recombinant plasmid was grown at 37 \u00b0C in 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 100 \u00b5g/ml ampicillin with shaking at 200 rpm and 37 \u00b0C overnight. 1% v/v of each overnight culture was inoculated into LB medium supplemented with 100 \u00b5g/ml ampicillin. The culture was subsequently incubated with shaking at 37 \u00b0C until the OD 600 reached 0.4-0.6. The induction was performed by adding 1 M isopropyl-\u03b2d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to achieve a final concentration of 1 mM. After the cells were grown for 4 h at 30 \u00b0C with shaking, they were collected by centrifugation at 16 \u00b0C and 8,000 rpm for 15 min and resuspended in buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole; pH 7.4). Sonication was then performed before the purification of the recombinant protein. The GST/hexahistidine tag was used for detection and purification.

This indicates that besides modulating the production rate of a recombinant secretory protein, the reduced synthesis of endogenous secretory proteins can also lower the load on the Sec translocon, thereby increasing protein production yields and biomass formation.

Despite its widespread use as an expression host, however, yields of correctly folded, functional protein are frequently low in E. coli. This is due largely to the formation of insoluble protein aggregates and to premature lysis of the bacterial cells. We, and others, have previously shown that the cell lysis phenomenon associated with recombinant protein production in E. coli is not a direct result of synthesis of heterologous proteins [1], [2]. Instead, protein production triggers a global stress response in the bacterium, but the mechanism by which cell lysis subsequently occurs remains unclear [3].",

Our methodology also proved to be an interesting approach to investigate the process and product robustness. Compared to our previous results on IB production [3], our current results show that soluble protein production is less robust to temporary environmental changes.

            "text": "Among the available expression hosts, E. coli remains the most attractive one for production of heterologous proteins for a variety of downstream utilization. Considerable amounts of soluble protein are required for many analysis techniques such as circular dichroism, crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance [12]. However, due to high-level expression, many recombinant proteins form inactive insoluble aggregates in the cytoplasm called inclusion bodies which are devoid of biological activities. A high concentration of denaturing agents is needed to solubilize and recover functionally active proteins from these aggregates. This process is challenging procedure and may result in the loss of secondary structure and poor recovery of bioactive proteins [6,9]. Moreover, a successful refolding process must be experimentally obtained for each protein. For example, in one study, for optimizing refolding parameters, the effect of more than 200 different buffers on solubilizing of recombinant falcipain-2 IBs was evaluated. They observed that an alkaline buffer containing sucrose or glycerol and glutathione resulted in high yield of solubilized protein [13]. So, developing an efficient approach which can decrease inclusion bodies' formation without decreasing production yield would reduce the need of additional purification steps and downstream processing costs. Remarkably, to reduce the cost of economic and commercial-scale recombinant protein production, researchers put enormous efforts on elevating expression yield of soluble recombinant proteins [14]. Although a universal approach to circumvent this problem does not exist, various strategies have been described to promote the in vivo solubility of the recombinant protein in this bacterial host. Varying several parameters such as fusion partners, post induction temperature, promoters, or E. coli strains have been reported to be able to alleviate the insolubility problem and increase the yield of soluble recombinant proteins [15].",

            "text": "We could demonstrate the applicability of the novel E. coli X-press strain for extracellular production of recombinant proteins. We explored the design space, in which extracellular protein production is favored without sacrificing viability: For the soluble model protein SpA, cultivation temperatures between 30 and 35 \u00b0C and q S,0 of up to 0.25 g g \u22121 h \u22121 enhanced both leakiness and productivity while keeping cell lysis to a minimum. The process parameters affected total product titer and leakiness positively in both investigated expression hosts. By inducible growth repression, the novel E. coli X-press strain showed less susceptibility to the metabolic burden of recombinant protein production and thus allows for tighter process control due to reduced variability across different process conditions, although temperature dependence of growth was still observed. Finally, we showed that the X-press strain can achieve high titers of different classes of recombinant protein and leaks up to 90% of all soluble product. Therefore, this strain is a promising candidate for extracellular protein production in current fed-batch applications or future continuous manufacturing. However, additional screening of the design space for different products may be required, specifically for proteins that are prone to IB formation. Further research should be directed toward the relationship between different expression systems, process parameters, and their implications on periplasmic protein release.",

Recombinant proteins are obtained mainly through microbial fermentation, with Escherichia coli being the host most used. In spite of that, some problems are associated with the production of recombinant proteins in E. coli, such as the formation of inclusion bodies, the metabolic burden, or the inefficient translocation/transport system of expressed proteins. Optimizing transcription of heterologous genes is essential to avoid these drawbacks and develop competitive biotechnological processes. Here, expression of YFP reporter protein is evaluated under the control of four promoters of different strength (PT7lac, Ptrc, Ptac, and PBAD) and two different replication origins (high copy number pMB1\u2032 and low copy number p15A). In addition, the study has been carried out with the E. coli BL21 wt and the ackA mutant strain growing in a rich medium with glucose or glycerol as carbon sources. Results showed that metabolic burden associated with transcription and translation of foreign genes involves a decrease in recombinant protein expression. It is necessary to find a balance between plasmid copy number and promoter strength to maximize soluble recombinant protein expression. The results obtained represent an important advance on the most suitable expression system to improve both the quantity and quality of recombinant proteins in bioproduction engineering.",

The main disadvantage of the fermentation control for the extracellular production of target proteins is that the fermentation conditions vary greatly with different target proteins. \n\nTo overcome the uncertainty of the fermentation conditions, the construction of leaky strains (including the E. coli Sec pathway) will become a main alternative to transport periplasmic-directed recombinant proteins into media. Leaky strains can be constructed by knocking out of genes related to the biosynthesis of cell wall and membrane, especially of the outer membrane genes such as lpp encoding Braun's lipoprotein (Shin and Chen, 2008) of E. coli. A lot of studies on the secretion of recombinant proteins in E. coli have been reported (Rinas and Hoffmann, 2004;Nandakumar et al., 2006;Xia et al., 2008;Ostendorp et al., 2009); however, the secretory efficiency into media for most of recombinant proteins was not high.

            "text": "coli) had been intentionally chosen for production of BmSXP recombinant protein based on two reasons. First, carbohydrate moieties on helminth antigens has been reported to contribute to serological cross-reactions (Yamano et al., 2009), thus an E. coli system is used because the proteins expressed do not have post translational modifications. Second, an E. coli expression system allows production of large amounts of recombinant proteins (Kathleen et al., 1996). However, synthesis of recombinant protein places substantial metabolic burden on the producing cells. In order to prevent this burden from compromising the growth, biomass production and protein production are separated by using transcription regulators. Common regulators used in E. coli include the lac, trp, araBAD and tac promoters (Makrides, 1996). The lac promoter used in this work is controlled by the use of isopropyl-\u00df-Dthiogalactoside (IPTG) (Kweon et al., 2001). Recombinant protein production is normally induced in the late exponential growth phase. However, induction in the late exponential phase or early stationary phase reduces the culture viability and can lead to production of proteases that can break down the desired recombinant protein. On the other hand, early induction can unnecessarily slow the doubling time of bacterial cells (Chisti, 1998;Corchero et al., 2001). Hence it is important to optimize the type of medium, IPTG concentration and induction time, to achieve high cell density culture towards the aim of producing a high yield of the recombinant protein. \n\nGenerally the development of fermentation strategies are focused on improving the cultivation techniques, manipulating the physiology of the bacteria and the level of recombinant protein expression.. As a result, batch and fed batch fermentation techniques have been developed (Shiloach and Fass, 2005).",

            "text": "Escherichia coli recombinant protein production systems are designed to achieve a high accumulation of soluble protein product in the bacterial cell. However, a strong and rapid protein production can lead to stressful situations for the host cell, resulting in protein misfolding in vivo, and consequent aggregation into inclusion bodies (Schumann and Ferreira, 2004;Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005a,b;Sevastsyanovich et al., 2010). For instance, macromolecular crowding of proteins at high concentrations in the E. coli cytoplasm often impairs the correct folding of proteins, leading to the formation of folding intermediates that, when inefficiently processed by molecular chaperones, promote inclusion body formation (Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005a,b).\n\nStrategies that direct the soluble production of proteins in E. coli are, thus, envisaged, and become more attractive than protein refolding procedures from inclusion bodies.\n\nSeveral methods have been shown to prevent or decrease protein aggregation during protein production in E. coli on a trial-and-error basis, including:\n\n(i) Lower expression temperatures: bacteria cultivation at reduced temperatures is often used to reduce protein aggregation, since it slows down the rate of protein synthesis and folding kinetics, decreasing the hydrophobic interactions that are involved in protein self-aggregation (Schumann and Ferreira, 2004;Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005b). Low cultivation temperatures can also reduce or impair protein degradation due to a poor activity of heat shock proteases that are usually induced during protein overproduction in E. coli (Chesshyre and Hipkiss, 1989). This strategy has, however, some drawbacks as the reduction of temperature can also affect replication, transcription, and translation rates, besides decreasing the bacterial growth and protein production yields. Nevertheless, these limitations can be circumvented by the use of coldinducible promoters that maximize protein production under low temperature conditions (Mujacic et al., 1999). (ii) E. coli-engineered host strains: E. coli mutant strains are a significant advance toward the soluble production of difficult recombinant proteins. Several targeted strain strategies have been developed through the introduction of DNA mutations that affect protein synthesis, degradation, secretion, or folding (reviewed in Ma",

This gene was cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), between the restriction sites BamHI and EcoRI. The protein production was performed in the E. coli BL21 (DE3) Rosetta gami strain, using 0.5 mM IPTG as inductor and 1 mM 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA, SIGMA-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as cofactor supply. The induction was performed at 16 \u2022 C during 16 h. After the incubation, the bacterial pellet was recovered and resuspended in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, buffer with 100 mM NaCl. The protein was purified with a standard GST purification procedure, using a Glutathione Sepharose column (16 \u00d7 25 mm.; GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), and according to the column manual. Imidazole was removed from the protein fractions by dialysis. The purified protein was cleaved from the GST-tag using a recombinant PreScission Protease, and tested for POD activity. POD activity was tested by incubating 20 \u00b5L of protein solution in 230 \u00b5L of reaction buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.8, 20 mM guaiacol, 0.3% H 2 O 2 ).",

            "text": "Escherichia coli has been used as a host for production of recombinant proteins, including antibodies and antibody fragments, as it is fast growing, easy to manipulate, and extracellular production. If the whole protein was produced extracellularly into the culture medium, the product purity from cell culture increases, downstream processing requirements decrease, and also the overall cost diminishes [2]. It has been reported that the expression of recombinant proteins under the control of lac operon induced by IPTG leads to low expression of recombinant proteins. According to the previous studies, due to the high cost and toxicity of IPTG, complex operating procedure, and nonuniform protein expression pattern, the use of lactose as an inducer for expression of recombinant proteins is preferable for overproduction of recombinant proteins [3]. By using lactose as inducer more soluble protein has been produced. The secretion of protein from bacteria occurred through highly specialized systems, in which the proteins could be translocated in either one or two steps from the cytosol to the extracellular medium. Based on previous successes, researchers continue to increase the secretion efficiency and titer through these systems to make them feasible for industrial production. These approaches include the modification of secretion tags required for secretion of the recombinant protein, development of methods for rapid screening, or selecting clones with higher titer or efficiency, and the use of genetic engineering for improving reliability and robustness of high titer secretion [4]. Also, the modification of the culture medium by suitable substances, such as glycine, SDS, sucrose, Tween 80, and TritonX-100, could be useful in extracellular production of proteins in bacteria [5,6]. The optimization of carbon sources shows a great impact on the overproduction of recombinant proteins [7]. Finding an optimum culture media for extracellular production of proteins which are produced in E. coli has always been a concern. The study aimed to enhance the production of bispecific anti-MUC1 nanobody intracellularly and extracellularly from E. coli BL21 (DE3).",

            "text": "The T7-phage polymerase, which is commonly utilized for protein expression, also results in decreased protein expression after 3-5 subsequent generations and subcultures. The novel promoter T7C p/p system can enhance recombinant protein production significantly as well as facilitating economical purification (Kesik-Brodacka et al., 2012). A specific pNEW vector has been developed using a cumate gene with a synthetic operator and the repressor protein cymR for the constitutive expression of the desired gene. This vector led to enhanced expression in comparison with a pET-based expression system (Choi et al., 2010). \n\nMoCloFlex, a new modular cloning system for flexible de novo part/plasmid assembly, has been developed, and it has been revealed that it can be used to plan, build, and isolate a custom plasmid within 24 h. This leads to reduced costs and time consumption (Klein et al., 2019). In one study, it was reported that the E. coli \"TatExpress\" strain resulted in the delivery of 5.4 g/l of human growth hormone to the periplasm by the Tat pathway using fed-batch fermentation. The protein was shown to be homogeneous, disulfide-bonded, and active. Further studies are required to evaluate the full potential of this system, and especially to explore its capability for the export of more complex proteins (Guerrero Montero et al., 2019). In another study, it was shown that the use of diverse carbon and nitrogen sources and acetate metabolism knockout strains can redirect E. coli carbon fluxes to different pathways and resulted in a 5-fold increase in protein production (Lozano Terol et al., 2019). \n\nSmall antibody fragments such as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and antibody fragments (Fabs) do not need glycosylation. Therefore, these fragments have been successfully produced in E. coli. These antibody fragments show better tissue penetration and are less immunogenic to the human body in comparison to the full antibody.",

            "text": "High-level production of recombinant proteins as a prerequisite for subsequent purification has become a standard technique. Important applications of recombinant proteins are: (1) immunization, (2) biochemical studies, (3) three-dimensional analysis of the protein, and (4) biotechnological and therapeutic use. Production of recombinant proteins involves cloning of the appropriate gene into an expression vector under the control of an inducible promoter. But efficient expression of the recombinant gene depends on a variety of factors such as optimal expression signals (both at the level of transcription and translation), correct protein folding and cell growth characteristics. Display of recombinant proteins on the bacterial surface has many potential biotechnological applications and requires further knowledge on targeting motifs present on carrier proteins usually used as fusion partners. In addition, the selection of a particular expression system requires a cost breakdown in terms of design, process and other economic considerations. The relative merits of bacterial, yeast, insect and mammalian expression systems have been reviewed in Marino (1989). \n\nThis review article deals exclusively with Escherichia coli cells as a protein factory. Despite its extensive knowledge on genetics and molecular biology, there is no a priori guarantee that every gene can be expressed efficiently in this Gram-negative bacterium. Factors influencing the expression level include unique and subtle structural features of the gene sequence, the stability and efficiency of mRNA, correct and efficient protein folding, codon usage, degradation of the recombinant protein by ATP-dependent proteases and toxicity of the protein. The objectives of this article are to review the potential influence of these different parameters on the yield of recombinant proteins and to provide the reader with practical suggestions allowing optimization of recombinant protein production and targeting to different compartments of the bacterial cell. For earlier reviews on high-level of gene expression in E. coli see Makrides (1996) and Swartz (2001).",

            "text": "The remaining six molecules were expressed completely in inclusion bodies. Moreover, we have not been able to pick up the conditions for the refolding of two proteins (ML06-StrepABD and ML06-HDD), both of which were long modifications (45 aa) with flexible linkers at the C-terminus C-terminal long modifications . Although the biomass growth rates for modifications were comparable to or lower than for ML06, the formation of predominantly insoluble fractions indicated high rates of protein synthesis accompanied by insufficient chaperone folding of the tertiary structure. Alternatively, the toxicity of expression products to the host cell can be proposed to affect the cells' viability. \n\nThe modified proteins were purified to >95% purity with several steps of FPLC (Figure 1a,b). The only exception was HDD-ML06 (>90%), which had an additional band of co-expressed admixture, which is proposed to be the truncated protein version without the homodimerization domain (ML06). The protein yields (Table 2) were also lower for modifications compared to ML06 (up to fivefold), and only StrepABD-ML06 showed an almost threefold increase in production, but was easily aggregated in solution, regardless of the concentration. Thus, we have shown that modifying the endolysin sequence with additional peptides/domains significantly affects the recombinant expression of the protein, in most cases leading to reduced production by E. coli and the formation of insoluble proteins under standard induction conditions. The data also showed that the C-terminus modifications of lysin are relatively more toxic for the recombinant producer strain of E. coli, slowing its growth, while the growth of recombinant hosts of proteins with N-terminus modifications is comparable to that of the original enzyme producer. Thus, we have shown that modifying the endolysin sequence with additional peptides/domains significantly affects the recombinant expression of the protein, in most cases leading to reduced production by E. coli and the formation of insoluble proteins under standard induction conditions.",

            "text": "However, the periplasmic expression of recombinant proteins has two major drawbacks of low yield and frequent aggregation. Alternatively, the production of domain antibodies using fusion constructs in tandem with a stretch of amino acid (peptide tag) or a large polypeptide (Thioredoxin (Trx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and maltose-binding protein (MBP) has been demonstrated in bacterial periplasmic and cytoplasmic systems [8]. Unfortunately, the reducing environment in the cytoplasmic region remains a limiting factor for the folding of the majority of cysteine rich proteins such as antibodies. An approach to overcome the shortcoming is to express the antibodies in the cytoplasm of mutant E. coli strains that provide an oxidizing environment. However, often, the formation of a partially folded/misfolded protein is triggered, which is forced to aggregate as non-functional inclusion bodies (IBs) [9]. Largely, cysteine-rich proteins are formed as IBs in both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic compartments of E. coli [10]. Utilizing various strategies for molecular and protein engineering such as gene fusion technology, co-production of chaperones [11], use of engineered host E.coli strains [12], optimizing the growth conditions such as temperature, inducer concentration, and induction time, can often help in increasing the formation of efficient soluble protein production [13]. \n\nRecently, it has been reported that recombinant proteins were overexpressed in the soluble form in the bacterial expression system by adding compatible solutes (chemical additives) such as sorbitol, arginine, and trehalose in the expression medium [14]. Although proteins with disulfide bonds are also found in the cytoplasmic region of both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, most of them are transient and involve cysteines located in redox-active sites of enzymes [15]. Both classical and non-classical IBs contain relatively pure and intact recombinant proteins, and several approaches have been reported to recover biologically active proteins from these aggregated forms.",

The recombinant proteins produced from E. coli have significantly advanced the general filed of biology and biopharmaceutical industry. For example, about 90% of the protein whose structures have been reported in the protein data bank and about 30% of the recombinant biopharmaceuticals licensed for use were produced in E. coli [25][26][27][28]. The major disadvantage of this bacterial system for the production of recombinant proteins is the poor solubility of the protein of interest, resulting in the accumulation and thus purification from the inclusion bodies by stringent non-native purification methods. About 75% of human proteins are expressed in bacteria but only 25% are produced in active soluble form [29,30]. While solubility remains the major bottleneck in the field, the issue can be handled by fusing the recombinant protein with a protein tag such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), a 26 KDa protein that rapidly folds into highly stable and soluble protein upon translation. The tag can be enzymatically removed after the purification for downstream applications of the recombinant protein. The CCHV N protein was previously expressed in soluble form as a GST fusion protein, followed by the proteolytic removal of the GST tag after purification, and the use of N protein in X-ray crystallographic studies [17][18][19]. \n\nInterestingly, the N protein fused to a C-terminal His tag was highly expressed in bacteria but it rapidly aggregated after purification by the native purification procedure. The aggregation tendency was so high that fractions containing the high protein concentration became turbid immediately after purification and lacked the RNA binding activity. Although clear protein fractions containing low concentrations of the protein showed some RNA binding activity, but the protein was rapidly aggregated and lost activity by a single Freeze thaw cycle.",

However, hampered protein targeting, translocation and folding as well as protein instability can all negatively affect periplasmic protein production yields. Strategies to enhance periplasmic protein production yields have focused on harmonizing secretory recombinant protein production rates with the capacity of the secretory apparatus by transcriptional and translational tuning, signal peptide selection and engineering, increasing the targeting, translocation and periplasmic folding capacity of the production host, preventing proteolysis, and, finally, the natural and engineered adaptation of the production host to periplasmic protein production.

            "text": "For many reasons Escherichia coli is still the preferred choice as a host system for protein production. With relatively low costs one can achieve high biomass and high protein yield in only short cultivation times. Furthermore, E. coli is extremely well-studied in its biochemical and physiological characteristics. With a wealth of tools available E. coli also can be easily adapted as needed by genetic manipulation. However, even though the general procedure for protein production is straightforward, protein aggregation during expression is still a major obstacle. Different approaches are commonly applied to address this problem, and to optimize protein folding while maximizing protein expression. The currently available expression systems with their advantages and pitfalls have been regularly reviewed [1][2][3][4]. A smart combination of the different parts of the system (e.g. prokaryotic or eukaryotic host organism, type of plasmid with its specific features) can lead to an improved expression. Additional conventional approaches for protein expression optimization are the coexpression of chaperons, use of codon optimized genes, alternate protein tags, change of cultivation medium, production process optimization [2,5]. The choice of the system influences the success of proper protein folding and hence the production of active, soluble protein. Even more specialized systems facing folding problems have been developed. The preexpression of Erv1p sulfhydryl oxidase and disulfide bond isomerases for example is a robust technique for the production of disulfide bonds containing proteins [6,7]. \n\nSince every protein is different, the expression and purification strategies must be defined for each single case. In their review, Gr\u00e4slund et al. [2] summarized that there are many choices to make when expressing proteins regarding all the parts of the system; e.g. selection of E. coli strain, the fusion of the protein with a His-tag or another tag, the application of a T7 RNA polymerase expression system or another regulated promoter system, and finally the choice of the medium and cultivation conditions. They published a consensus protocol which they agreed to be a good starting-point when aiming to produce a recombinant protein. Nevertheless, success is protein dependent and a robust and ever-working strategy is still missing.",

It has also been proved that the N-terminal sequence of the full length Cel-CD played a crucial role in transportation through both inner and outer membranes. By subcellular location analysis, it is identified that the secretion is a two-step process via the SecB-dependent pathway through the inner membrane and an unknown pathway through the outer membrane (Gao et al., 2016). Thirdly, E. coli may degrade the recombinant protein. Unlike sequence problems, these problems can be circumvented by using mutant strains of E. coli. \n\nAccumulation of endotoxins (LPS), pyrogenic to humans and animals, is yet another problem in the production of therapeutic proteins in E. coli, besides instability of is plas- mid or mRNA (Terpe, 2006). Proteins expressed in E. coli also retain their amino terminal methionine, thus affecting the stability and in turn immunogenicity of proteins (Daly and Hearn, 2005). Further, expression of mammalian proteins in E. coli remains difficult and often results in inactive aggregates because the recombinant proteins do not fold properly. However attempts have been made to produce soluble prion proteins in E. coli (Abskharon et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The high effective production of recombinant proteins based on lignocellulosic sugars was initially demonstrated using the fluorescence reporter eGFP as a prominent model. Astonishingly, the recombinant E. coli strains, those expressing eGFP rather than those harbouring the corresponding empty vector, reached significantly higher cell densities during the cultivations. Usually, the selection pressure by the added antibiotics and the constitutive expression of antibiotic resistance genes in response as well as the general plasmid maintenance induce a stress response, especially when an additional target protein is highly expressed (Hoffmann & Rinas, 2004;Hoffmann et al., 2002). Such improved growth performances of recombinant strains were frequently described, but the reasons are very speculative (Yee & Blanch, 1992). However, the response to the high expression of recombinant protein includes an extensive reprogramming of gene expression patterns and down regulation of several housekeeping genes (Hoffmann et al., 2002), which probably provides more energy resources for other cellular functions. \n\nThis improved growth behaviour was further observed during the heterologous expression of bovine and human \u03b1 S1 -casein in E. coli BL21(DE3). In addition to its highlyefficient protein biosynthesis depending on the T7 expression system, this host was chosen because it lacks the Lon and the OmpT proteases (Studier & Moffatt, 1986). Furthermore, the successful production of other recombinant milk proteins was also reported for this strain (Garc\u00eda-Montoya et al., 2013;Goda et al., 2000;Hansson et al., 1993;Ponniah et al., 2010;Simons et al., 1993;Wang et al., 1989).

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one among the earliest and most commonly used host organism for protein expression (Terpe, 2006) due to the fast growth and expression, ease of culture and high yields (Swartz, 1996). Moreover, the genetics of E. coli are wellunderstood when compared to other organisms. Despite its great advantages, E. coli has certain drawbacks that can possibly influence the production efficiency of recombinant proteins. This is because a high cell density of this organism results in large quantities of acetate, which is toxic to cells. It is also reported through studies that this organism fails to produce very large proteins. Additionally, some issues were observed for E. coli system in terms of difficulties in producing proteins that have disulfide bonds and refolding ability. Another factor is the failure to produce modified protein due to the absence of glycosylation (Jenkins and Curling, 1994). Glycosylation affects properties such as solubility, stability functionality, immunogenicity, etc. In order to achieve glycosylation for attaining a stable and properly folded protein, a higher advantage is noticed for recombinant production in yeast, mold, insect or mammalian cells. A solution can be opting for secretion of the heterologous protein into the medium instead of intracellular inclusion bodies. This way, soluble and active proteins can be attained with a much easier downstream processing and cost reduction (Mergulh\u00e3o et al., 2005). Emergence of other bacterial systems can also be noticed over the years in the field of recombinant protein production. The engineering of Lactococcus lactis, a gram-positive bacterium for membrane protein expression is one such example (Chen, 2012). Additionally, they also possess advantages over E. coli in terms of being GRAS and endotoxin free (Yeh et al., 2009). Pseudomonas species such as P. fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, and P. putida, were also found as suitable alternatives to E. coli expression systems to attain higher yields of the recombinant protein. Today, several other bacterial systems are widely explored as cell factories.",

            "text": "In higher eukaryotic expression systems, the expression of the native gene directly amplified from the influenza virus occurs without major problems [39]. However, when such genes are expressed in E. coli cells, problems arise due to the different use of individual codons, leading to a protein without biological activity. Regardless of the chosen expression conditions of the inserted NA gene, the recombinant protein accumulates in the insoluble fraction of the cell biomass in the form of inclusion bodies. The formation of inclusion bodies is a common but often undesirable phenomenon associated with the overexpression of a heterologous gene in E. coli cells. However, accumulation of recombinant protein in inclusion bodies may be an advantage. They contain a high proportion of target protein and at the same time fewer undesirable proteins [40][41][42]. The optimization of recombinant proteins expressed in this form is relatively rare, but may represent a promising strategy for various insoluble proteins produced by E. coli [35,[43][44][45][46]. In our previous work [26], we were able to produce biologically active NA in E. coli cells, and now we bring our focus to optimizing the conditions for the production of recombinant enzymes in inclusion bodies in order to maximize NA production. \n\nThe effect of propagation (pre-incubation) time on the monitored variables was observed in the range of 2-24 h at 37 \u2022 C. Recombinant protein production was induced by the addition of a 1 mM IPTG solution at the end of the lag phase (biomass yield 0.10 \u00b1 0.03 g/L), in the early exponential phase (0.43 \u00b1 0.03 g/L), in the mid-exponential phase (1.02 \u00b1 0.02 g/L), in the late exponential phase (1.39 \u00b1 0.02 g/L), in the early stationary phase (1.64 \u00b1 0.02 g/L) and in the stationary phase (1.68 \u00b1 0.03 g/L) of producer growth (Figure 1).",

            "text": "There is only a limited number of examples of E. coli strains with improved protein production characteristics isolated by evolutionary approaches. Interestingly, using evolutionary approaches to modulate metabolic pathways in E. coli for metabolite production has been very successful [110,111]. This appears to be due to the relative ease to monitor most metabolites. Therefore, it is not surprising that the major bottleneck hampering the use of evolutionary approaches to isolate E. coli protein production strains seems to be the ability to rapidly and accurately monitor not only the amount, but also the quality of a produced protein. The importance of being able to monitor Isolating Escherichia coli strains for recombinant protein production 903 both protein quantity and quality is nicely illustrated by the isolation of strains with improved IgG and mtVKORc1 production characteristics [116,120]. We reckon that the development of, in many instances target-specific, assays to rapidly monitor protein production will be key for extending the use of evolutionary approaches to isolate E. coli protein production strains. In all the reported examples of the isolation of E. coli protein production strains, different strain backgrounds, promoter systems, induction regimes, culturing conditions and, sometimes, also ways to facilitate mutagenesis were used. This makes that it is currently impossible to formulate general rules for how to design an experiment to isolate an E. coli protein production strain. So far, it appears that the effects that most of the aforementioned factors can have on the isolation of protein production strains may have been underestimated. One obvious example is the isolation of C41(DE3) from BL21(DE3), which depended on the presence of the native lac wild-type promoter and RecA in the ancestor strain BL21(DE3). However, also more subtle factors like the induction kinetics of a chosen promoter system or varying levels of global regulators in different strain backgrounds may influence the evolutionary trajectories of protein production strains. Also, stress caused by e.g., starvation, temperature fluctuations, and exposure to antibiotics during the strain isolation procedure may affect evolutionary trajectories [37]. Therefore, accumulated mutations in an isolated protein production strain may not only reflect adaptations improving protein production. The presence of the same or similar mutations in multiple, parallel isolated strains may help to identify the",

In most cases production of heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli K12 strains has remained an empirical exercise in which different systems are tested without a careful insight into the various factors affecting adequate expression of the encoded protein. The present review will deal with E. coli as protein factory and will cover some of the aspects related to transcriptional and translational expression signals, factors affecting protein stability and solubility and targeting of proteins to different cell compartments. Based on the knowledge accumulated over the last decade, we believe that the rate of success for those dedicated to expression of recombinant proteins based on the use E. coli strains can still be significantly improved.",

            "text": "E. coli is a favorable host for recombinant heterologous protein production. The robustness of this microorganism, fast and simple cultivation, easy genetical manipulation, the enormous amounts of available physiological data and molecular biology tools are key reasons for its widespread use. Despite these positive general characteristics, protein aggregation and/or improper folding are major obstacles which often lead to reduced functional product yields. Many examples indicate the limited capacity of the natural E. coli protein folding machinery for a high level accumulation of heterlologous proteins with features wich are not usual for the hosts protein portfolio. Examples are proteins with multiple disulfide bonds, very large proteins, proteins with a high hydrophobicity, and proteins with natural glycosylation. However, target specific engineering approaches and process optimisation can lead to success. In the meanwhile there exists an extensive toolbox of elements which overcome natural limitations of the E. coli system, such as vectors for coexpression of rare tRNAs, chaperons and foldases, hosts and vectors with improved disulfide oxidation and isomerisation characteristics, newly designed secretion tools, and hosts for superior expression of membrane proteins [1][2][3]. Even tools for modulation the glycoylation pattern of proteins seems to become a future option [4,5].\n\nDue to their therapeutic importance the production of disulfide stabilised proteins has been a major research focus in the past. This research gave the general impression that the cytoplasm of E. coli is a reducing compartment and thus the production of proteins with reduced cysteines should be granted. Hyperoxia and oxydation stress are important factors in connection with protein folding in Eukaryotes (e.g. see recent review by [6]), but have been largely neglected for recombinant protein production in E. coli. Although oxidative damage of proteins by carbonylation in E. coli has been extensively studied, it has been barely considered in connection with heterologous protein expression. One milestone publication in this aspect is the effect of the dissolved oxygen level on the carbonylation level and activity of human interferon \u03b3 [7].\n\nIn the present study we show at the example of a protein of the ribonuclease inhibitor (RI",

            "text": "Nevertheless, most continuous culture studies have focused on the physiology of wild-type cells or low-stakes products such as ethanol. So far, no reports of industrial-scale continuous production of biopharmaceuticals using bacterial expression systems exist. The most-often-cited reasons for this are the genetic instabilities of the bacterial strains and recombinant plasmid leading to higher cell heterogeneity, the formation of inclusion bodies, and the increased acetate toxicity through overflow metabolism. Additionally, an increased metabolic burden which leads to lower growth rates and protein yield, and eventually increased cell death, as well as challenges of maintaining sterility, are also reported [10]. \n\nPrevious studies have focused on quantifying the metabolic load associated with recombinant protein production [11,12] and determining the growth and protein production kinetics to optimise operating conditions and devise control strategies for the bioreactor [9]. High throughput techniques, including miniaturisation and parallelisation of bioreactors are used in both industry and research. Cascade operation and multistage culture that decouples the growth from the protein production stage have been investigated with promising results, combined with adequate induction strategies for protein expression [13,14]. \n\nThe advances in continuous protein production using E. coli were recently summarised in [15], focusing on the knowledge transfer opportunities from fed-batch to continuous operation. One exciting development is using glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production, as a substrate to make the RPP more sustainable [16][17][18]. Although there is an increased interest in the transition from fed-batch to continuous processing with E coli, the heterogeneity of the culture and the lack of stable production are considered obstacles [15,19]. Highthroughput single-cell expressions studies are required for understanding the dynamics and performance of heterogenous cell populations [20]. \n\nThis work uses a model protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP) mut3*, to test the recombinant protein expression in an E. coli strain with industrial relevance in glucose and glycerol-limited chemostats.",

These processes are often based on heterologous expression of plasmid-encoded genes and the systems have to meet the following quality criteria: (i) the respective products must be obtained with high yields, (ii) production must be cost-effective, (iii) plasmid stability must be high, while (iv) expression has to be certainly and tightly controllable (Jana and Deb, 2005;S\u00f8rensen and Mortensen, 2005;Wendisch et al., 2006;Wegerer et al., 2008). The host of choice for production of many recombinant proteins is in particular the Gramnegative bacterium E. coli for several reasons: (i) its economical and fast high-density cultivation possibilities (ii) combined with its simplicity, (iii) the extensive biochemical and genetic knowledge, and (iv) the large variety of available biotechnological tools for high-level expression of a multitude of recombinant proteins (Jana and Deb, 2005;S\u00f8rensen and Mortensen, 2005). Other organisms such as Corynebacterium glutamicum or the yeast Pichia pastoris are used for the industrial production of amino acids or therapeutic glycoproteins with fully humanized N-glycosylation structures respectively (Macauley-Patrick et al., 2005;Wildt and Gerngross, 2005;Wendisch et al., 2006). The importance of biotechnical processes in industrial production is steadily increasing, due to rising oil prices and the demand for ecologically feasible production (Wendisch et al., 2006). As most established systems for heterologous productions are plasmid-based, they often require antibiotics for plasmid selection. This is not only cost-intensive but also entails potential risks to the environment from the antibiotics in industrial waste as well as from the spreading of the resistance genes when cells would escape inadvertently (H\u00e4gg et al., 2004).

Escherichia coli (E. coli), as one of the most commonly used host bacteria to express recombinant proteins, has many advantages. For example, high cell density cultures are easily achieved (Lee, 1996), transformation with exogenous genes is fast (Pope and Kent, 1996), and its use as a cell factory is well-established (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). However, commercial production of recombinant proteins by E. coli has remained a challenge. One of the most important problems is that E. coli has a poor ability to secrete proteins, which causes formation of inclusion bodies, low production titers, and complicated downstream purification procedures (Kim et al., 2015). To improve protein secretion efficiency in E. coli, some common strategies have been developed, such as selection of efficient signal peptides like the signal sequences from OmpA (Sun et al., 2019) and PelB (Mohajeri et al., 2016) that usually target proteins to the secretion machinery efficiently. Modification of key transporter proteins or auxiliary proteins involved in transmembrane transport also has been applied to increase the efficiency of protein secretion (Low et al., 2010). In addition, fusion of some peptide tags or proteins, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), also have proved to increase protein expression and extracellular secretion. Other strategies to improve protein secretion include fermentation process parameters control and medium optimization, such as addition of surfactants, osmolytes, metal ions, and glycine to the medium. \n\nRecombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF), a potential therapeutic protein that has been widely used as a healing agent for various chronic wounds, was successfully produced extracellularly in E. coli BL21(DE3) using pectate lyase B (PelB) signal peptide (Sriwidodo et al., 2019).",

            "text": "This method often adjusts the metabolic carbon supply, prevents the absorption of amino acid analogs, establishes intracellular disulfide bonds [33], and demonstrates a reproducible performance with computer control. E. coli can produce recombinant proteins with up to 80% of its dry weight and withstand many environmental conditions [34]. Human insulin-like growth factor (hIGF-I) is a single-chain 70-residue therapeutic protein with three disulfide bonds within its structure. IGF-I affects cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in the long term. E. coli promotes the production of this kind of protein through its relative ease, low cost, and accelerated high-density cultivation. Therefore, it played an important role in the pharmaceutical industry in the last decades. \n\nHowever, E. coli has several disadvantages that need to be addressed for efficient protein production. High cell densities cause toxicity owing to the deposition of acetates [35][36][37]. This can be inhibited by monitoring oxygen levels. Proteins that are generated as inclusion bodies are often inert, insoluble, and require refolding. Owing to the limitation associated with the processing of proteins with multiple disulfide bonds, it is extremely difficult to refold such proteins [38,39]. The E. coli system generates unmodified proteins without glycosylation. Hence, some of the antibodies that are synthesized do not recognize mammalian proteins [40][41][42]. Interestingly, the non-glycosylated human tPA produced in E. coli was fully active in vitro. Given the absence of glycosylation, the drug exhibited a four-fold longer plasma half-life and a correspondingly higher clearance rate in animals [43,44]. The resulting quantity constituted 5-10% of total E. coli protein.",

            "text": "To date, E. coli continues to be the first-choice microorganism for manufacturing recombinant proteins at laboratory and industrial scales. Its success is mostly due to its fast growth, simple culture procedures, cost-effectiveness, unusually high versatility, and the associated systems that make it adaptable to varying production demands (Ferrer-Miralles and Villaverde, 2013; Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2016). From 2004 to 2013, 24% of the biopharmaceuticals approved by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency were derived from E. coli (Baeshen et al., 2014). Currently, biopharmaceuticals produced from E. coli are used in the treatment of diabetes, growth hormone-deficiency in children, leukemia, gout, and many other therapeutic indications as previously discussed in Section \"Biological Activity of Microbial Biologics\" (Baeshen et al., 2015). A major concern when using E. coli as a production platform is the lack of post-translational modifications (PTMs) present in most eukaryotic proteins; lacking PTMs can lead to protein products being insoluble, unstable, or inactive (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009). However, it is possible to add synthetic PTMs to generate versions of the protein that are more stable than the original naked product (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009). Examples of this include pegylated products, like human growth hormone, stimulating factor, IFNs \u03b1-2a and \u03b1-2b, (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009). Additionally, there is a risk of translational errors due to the presence of a large number of rare codons that appear in human genes that are different from those occurring in E. coli genes. Even at low levels, these errors may cause an impact on the tertiary structure, premature termination of protein synthesis or amino acid misincorporation which results in low protein expression (Gustafsson et al., 2004).",

            "text": "The difficult process and high cost of extraction and separation of natural enterokinase and its probable contamination by other protease led to a great attempt to produce it on larger scale and lower finished cost in E. coli. A lot of research has been done to produce this enzyme in E. coli (Skala 2013;Chun et al. 2011) and Pichia pastoris (Smith 2013) in the form of IB (inclusion bodies) or soluble protein. Production of active enzymes in most of them was limited and needed several steps of purification or dialysis. \n\nThioredoxin (TRX) as a chaperon-like fusion tag helps the solubility and stability of the fusion protein (Berndt 2008). It can be followed by DDDDK enterokinase and cleaved from the target protein using enterokinase activity. \n\nDifferent strains of E. coli have been developed for different purposes. Among them, Bl21 (DE3) with Escherichia coli T7 RNA polymerase-based protein production in combination with T7 promoter-based expression vector allows high-efficiency protein expression of any gene that is under the control of a T7 promoter. The lon protease deficiency and the lack of ompT, outer membrane protease, which can degrade recombinant proteins during purification serve as advantages of BL21 (Grodberg and Dunn 1988). NiCo21 (DE3) and SHuffle T7 strains have been also engineered to minimize E. coli protein contamination and recombinant protein folding containing multiple disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm, respectively (Robichon et al. 2011;Lobstein et al. 2012;Kim et al. 2021). \n\nOne of the complexities of enterokinase production is related to the multiple disulfide bonds and an unpaired thiol that directs the protein production process to the IB formation (Schumann and Ferreira 2004). One strategy to prevent the formation of inclusion bodies is to slow down the production of recombinant proteins at low temperatures because the ability of the protein to fold at temperatures above 30 \u00b0C is decreased. Sometimes, it is probably the easiest and the most useful method which can prevent inclusion body formation by facilitating correct folding.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is by far the most widely used host for the production of recombinant proteins. There are many protocols, a great number of expression plasmids, and engineered strains that can be used to obtain high protein yields [1]. Despite numerous advantages, biotechnological potential of E. coli also has its limitations including the risk of protein aggregation and accumulation of acetate as by-product. Upon high-level production, recombinant proteins may aggregate and form inclusion bodies (IBs) in E. coli cells. Formation of IBs is a complex and dynamic process affected by various factors involving molecular chaperones that control protein folding. The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs [2,3]. To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required. Coexpression of molecular chaperones or lower production rate can prevent aggregation and facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins [1][2][3]. A whole spectrum of polypeptides with different conformations, including partially or even fully native structures, can be found in IBs [4][5][6]. Therefore, in some cases, insoluble but active proteins sequestered in IBs can be the preferred form of the product [7]. \n\nAnother obstacle in recombinant protein production in E. coli cells is accumulation of acetate during extensive aerobic fermentation in cultures supplemented with glucose. At higher glucose concentrations, the carbon flux into the cells exceeds tricarboxylic acid cycle capacity, and acetyl-CoA is converted into acetate, which is easily excreted from the cell. The excretion of acetate into the environment results also from the need to regenerate the NAD + consumed by glycolysis and to recycle the CoA that is required to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA [8]. A high concentration of acetate, externally added or excreted from the cell, limits the growth of E. coli.",

            "text": "Proteins are essential components of life and constitute the majority of living organisms. They play crucial roles in a number of cell processes, including cell signalling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and cell cycle, and therefore their de ciency is associated with several disorders. With the advent of recombinant DNA technology in the late1970s, proteins began to be produced in many host organisms, resulting in quicker and simpler processes relative to their natural sources [1]. With the advancements in biological therapeutics, the development of recombinant protein drugs on a wide scale is becoming increasingly essential. The optimizations of conditions for the expression of recombinant proteins have been carried out in a variety of expression systems like Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, insect cells, and mammalian cells [2][3][4]. Among these expression systems, the prokaryotic expression systems for the production of recombinant proteins are much preferred. E. coli was the rst host in which recombinant DNA (rDNA) protein, insulin, was produced [5]. E. coli remains the dominant host for the production of recombinant proteins because it is inexpensive and cost-effective for mass production of recombinant proteins. E. coli has a fast growth rate with early protein expression and high protein yield, which makes it preferable over other expression systems. Because of the better understanding of E. coli mode of transcription and translation, it is easier to manipulate its genome to optimize protein expression. \n\nA large number of commercially important proteins are recombinantly produced in E. coli, including T4 DNA ligase, CD4 and viral antigens for vaccines [6][7][8]. The expression of proteins in E. coli is achieved by inserting the gene for the recombinant protein in an expression vector under the control of a constitutive or regulatable promotor. Constitutive promoters are used for the overproduction of recombinant protein by continuous production, but they impart metabolic stress on cells energy resources leading to growth inhibition and ultimately lower yield of recombinant protein [9].",

            "text": "Abstract Production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli expression systems has shown many advantages, as well as disadvantages, especially for biotechnological and other down-stream applications. The choice of an appropriate vector depends on the gene, to be cloned for purification procedures and other analyses. Selection of a suitable production strain plays an important role in the preparation of recombinant proteins. The main criteria for the selection of the host organism are the properties of the recombinant produced protein, its subsequent use and the total amount desired. The most common problems in eukaryotic gene expression and recombinant proteins purification are, for instance, post-translational modifications, formation of disulphide bonds, or inclusion bodies. Obtaining a purified protein is a key step enabling further characterization of its role in the biological system. Moreover, methods of protein purification have been developed in parallel with the discovery of proteins and the need for their studies and applications. After protein purification, and also between the individual purification steps, it is necessary to test protein stability under different conditions over time. Shortly, all the essential points have been briefly discussed, which could be encountered during production and purification of a recombinant protein of interest, especially from eukaryotic source and expressed heterogeneously in prokaryotic production system.",

            "text": "B acterial expression system has been used for research and commercial based production of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins. Bacterial strain, E. coli has been used to produce biopharmaceutical products such as insulin, interferon, human growth factors and other recombinant proteins (Tripathi, 2016). Bacterial strain E. coli offers different advantages, such as easy to grow, high growth rate and cheap media demands. Moreover, its cellular components and genetics are well studied, which make it a host, that can bear fruitful genetic manipulations for expression of recombinant proteins (Joseph et al., 2015;Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014;Sivashanmugam et al., 2009;Tripathi, 2016). However, in spite of all these advantages, protein production in bacterial expression system, has never been a straight forward method. Certain disadvantages such as lack of post-translational modifications, formation of inclusion bodies, protein toxicity etc. may result in production of proteins either with improper structure and function or with no or very low yield (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Different methodologies have been developed to target those factors that might be responsible for the problem of low yield in bacterial expression system. Briefly, these methodologies can be broadly classified as (i) those dealing with optimization of bioprocessing and culture conditions and (ii) those that deal at molecular level for enhancement of protein production, such as strain engineering, increased plasmid number, codon optimization and genetic manipulations of certain genetic elements. \n\nOptimization of bioprocessing and culturing conditions include several strategies. For enhanced production of recombinant proteins, usually cultures with high cell densities are preferred in batch and fed-batch fermentation processes. Cultures can either be induced or grown in auto-induction media for enhanced production of recombinant proteins in a regulated way (Sivashanmugam et al., 2009). Different media compositions, have been studied and shown to affect the protein expression level.",

This opened the door for the expression of multiple diverse molecules. The first recombinant pharmaceutical product was insulin, licenced back in 1982 (Baeshen et al. 2014).\n\nToday, the main focus of the pharmaceutical market remains on the production of monoclonal antibodies, diverse hormones and growth factors, which turn out to be the majority of the pharmaceutical income (Walsh 2004, Baeshen et al. 2014, Baeshen et al. 2015.\n\nAlthough complex recombinant proteins are mainly produced in mammalian cells, a good number of proteins is still expressed in Escherichia coli (Walsh 2014, Humer et al. 2018. Recently published papers reported that the production of biopharmaceutical proteins in E. coli moved up to a number as high as 40 % (Walsh 2010, Gupta andShukla 2016). Protein production in E. coli gained importance as the demand in single-chain antibody fragments, which can be successfully expressed in E. coli, increased (Spadiut et al. 2013). E. coli is most likely the cheapest organism to cultivate, though its products are hard to purify and therefore take long durations and efforts when it comes to product purification (Berlec and Strukelj 2013). The genome of E. coli is known very well (Huang et al. 2012) and E. coli shows very fast replication rates, resulting in high cell densities (Murarka et al. 2007, Sahdev et al. 2007. Also, cultivations can be carried out on comparatively cheap media, coupled with the little risk of contamination compared to other cultivation hosts (DeLisa et al. 1999). In addition, scale-up can be straightforward, when compared to other organisms. Summing up, protein production using E. coli as a host provides a very useful alternative to mammalian cell cultivations (Baeshen et al. 2015), as e.g. yields up to 4 g/L of soluble antibody fragments have been reported already (Gupta and Shukla 2016).\n\nBesides the classical aim to produce a high",

            "text": "Here, we have shown that enhancing the production of a recombinant protein in the periplasm of E. coli by rhamnose promoter-based production rate screening can lead to increased accumulation levels of at least three key players in protein translocation, SecA, LepB, and YidC. It is conceivable that the accumulation levels of more key players involved in protein translocation also go up. Interestingly, the increase of the SecA, LepB, and YidC accumulation levels is reversible, which indicates that E. coli adapts for enhanced periplasmic recombinant protein production through regulatory mechanisms rather than through the accumulation of mutations. Previously, it has been shown that when the strong T7 promoter is used for recombinant protein production, stress caused by the production of a recombinant protein can lead to the accumulation of mutations that alleviate production stress while at the same time they enable enhanced production yields (Kwon et al., 2015;Schlegel et al., 2015). Thus, the promoter system governing the expression of the gene encoding a recombinant protein seems to play a role in how E. coli deals with recombinant protein production stress. \n\nHow does E. coli adapt for enhanced periplasmic recombinant protein production when using the tunable rhamnose promoterbased setup? It is tempting to speculate that enhancing production yields by protein production rate screening using the tunable rhamnose promoter-based setup leads to mild protein secretion stress to which cells can adapt by increasing their protein translocation capacity, rather than as previously thought the direct harmonization of secretory recombinant protein production rates with the Sec-translocon capacity (Schlegel et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Recombinant or heterologous protein production (RPP) is an important biotechnological process, with applications that range from catalysis (e.g. washing detergents) and therapeutic use (e.g. antibody production), to protein production for enzymatic characterization and crystallography. Production of human proteins in bacteria dates back to the production of the 14-codon somatostatin gene in Escherichia coli in 1977 [1]. Since then, several hosts have been explored, including other prokaryote species [2], various yeast and fungal species [3], plant, insect, and mammalian cell lines [4]. As there is no universally optimal host, the choice of host is based on various parameters (protein yield, production time, etc.) on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOne of the most critical parameters, especially for proteins of therapeutic interest, is the presence of post-translational modifications. Complex proteins might harbor disulfide bonds as well as complex glycan structures (e.g. antibodies and antibody fragments) that influence the 3D structure, serum stability and the protein effector functions [5]. However, in the case of E. coli, many engineered strains and expression platforms were made available over the years [6], including strains that enable some complex posttranslational modifications [7]. These advances, together with its easy cultivation, fast growth, and well-studied physiology explain E. coli 's role as a major host for RPP, including sensitive applications such as therapeutic protein production [8].\n\nOver-expression of recombinant proteins can lead to significant stress in the host cell, which in turn limits its capacity to function as a cell factory. First, it constitutes a general metabolic burden, as it is responsible for depletion of precursor metabolites [9]. Recombinant proteins are usually produced in very high amounts (it is not unusual to comprise 30% or more of total cellular protein in the cell), which leads to a significant stress for the cell. The latter reacts by employing a heat-shock like response, which involves the induction of chaperones, foldases and proteases [10]. Another potential drawback of RPP in bacterial cells is that many rec",

            "text": "However, studies on repetitive fed-batch using E. coli are scarce. \n\nRepetitive fed-batch technology has shown promising effects in recombinant protein production mainly using Pichia pastoris (Ohya et al., 2005;Martens et al., 2011;Fricke et al., 2013). To our knowledge, a repetitive fed-batch cultivation mode using E. coli has only been implemented for pyruvate production (Zeli\u0107 et al., 2004). However, the potential of using E. coli in repetitive fedbatch mode for recombinant protein production has not been investigated yet. \n\nIn this study we performed repetitive fed-batch cultivations for recombinant protein production using the production host E. coli in combination with lactose induction. In previous studies, the negative side effects of IPTG induction onto recombinant protein production in long-term fermentations were shown, whereas lactose was found to have a beneficial effect on productivity (Malakar and Venkatesh, 2012;Dvorak et al., 2015;Kopp et al., 2019a). We believe that no studies on repetitive fed-batch cultivation with E. coli for recombinant protein production have been published yet, either due to toxic effects of IPTG and the consequent decreasing productivity over time (Dvorak et al., 2015;Kopp et al., 2019b) or due to the absence of an induction strategy comparable to the established yeast system (Fricke et al., 2013). The goal of this study was to compare productivities and space-time yields of different production modes for E. coli. The assessment of changes in product quality and purity was not in the scope of this study. For the first time, we were able to show that a repetitive fed-batch cultivation mode using our developed lactose induction strategy is able to outperform conventional fed-batches and chemostat cultivations regarding the overall space-time yield.",

Thus, some targets, especially larger multidomain and membrane proteins, either fail to express in E. coli or express insolubly as inclusion bodies. Moreover, insolubility is not just restricted to heterologous proteins, as many bacterial proteins also cannot be produced in soluble form when overexpressed in E. coli (Vincentelli et al., 2003). In addition, the reducing environment of the bacterial cytoplasm makes the efficient production of disulfide-containing proteins challenging (Stewart et al., 1998;Ritz and Beckwith, 2001). Finally, E. coli lacks the machinery required to perform certain eukaryotic post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can be critical for the formation of folded, active protein . Considerable efforts have been made in recent years to maximize the efficient production of soluble recombinant proteins in bacteria. A remarkable number of novel reagents (new vectors, new host strains) and strategies (chaperone co-expression, low temperature induction) have been developed that allow many of these disadvantages to be readily and successfully overcome. It is this topic, how to optimize soluble protein expression in E. coli, that is the focus of this review. Section I outlines a typical expression protocol for the production of heterologous proteins in E. coli. While this protocol has proven highly successful for a broad range of targets, every protein has its own unique set of biophysical characteristics that often requires protocol changes in order to successfully express the target. Thus, in the second part of this review, critical parameters that are essential to consider when designing a protein expression strategy are highlighted (Fig. 5.24.1). These parameters have the common goal of maximizing the yield of soluble, active protein.

After entering the bloodstream, bacterial endotoxins can cause fever, hypotension, respiratory failure, endotoxic shock and ultimately sepsis. Therefore, many methods have been developed to remove endotoxins from recombinant protein preparations [45]. In addition, the overexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli can lead to the formation of inactive, insoluble aggregates called inclusion bodies (IBs). One of the methods to avoid or reduce the production of IB is to lower the temperature or change the culture conditions, which will cause both an increase in protein expression and will affect its solubility [23].\n\nThe first biopharmaceutical produced by means of genetic engineering in E. coli was human insulin. It was achieved by David Goeddel's team (Genentech) in 1978. Next, Genentech and Lilly signed an agreement for the commercialization of recombinant insulin, which was authorized by the FDA in 1982. These were Humulin R (rapid-acting insulin) and Humulin N (NPH, indirect--acting insulin) preparations [32,56]. Most recombinant proteins with therapeutic properties produced in the E. coli system are used in the treatment of infectious diseases, the group of endocrine diseases or metabolic disorders [20]. In the cells of E. coli, interferons (alpha-1, alpha-2a, alpha-2b and gamma-1b) are successfully produced, as well as human albumin, hormones (insulin analogues, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, human growth hormone,",

            "text": "E. coli is an attractive host as it is fast, simple to use, robust and cost-effective and therefore remains the dominant host for the production of recombinant proteins. In terms of glycoprotein production, the protein is usually expressed in inclusion bodies as bacteria do not have either the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus needed to secrete and post-translationally modify glycoproteins. As the protein is produced in inclusion bodies, refolding is needed to produce samples for structural biology -a process which can be time consuming and inefficient. However this method has proved useful for a number of products, for instance Watson et al. used E. coli to produce crystals of the extracellular domain of human UL16-binding protein ULBP1 [10]. Here the authors investigated various refolding strategies before finding the optimum protocol of slow dilution of guanidinesolubilised protein in solution containing arginine, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, reduced and oxidized glutathione and phenylmethyl-sulphonyl fluoride over 48 hours. In addition, recently the crystal structures of the murine class I major histocompatibility complex H-2Kb (PDB entry 3ROL) [11] and human \u03b2-secretase I with bound inhibitors (PDB entry 3S7M and 3S7L) [12] and the NMR structure of the sterile alpha motifs of EphA2 and SHIP2 (PDB entry 2KSO) [13] have solved using production in E. coli followed by refolding.\n\nAnother approach is to express the glycoprotein in the periplasm of E. coli using a bacterial signal sequence such as OmpA. For example, human \u03b11-microglubulin was produced in the periplasm of E. coli and used to obtain the crystal structure to 2.3 \u00c5 resolution which revealed a potential heme binding site (PDB entry 3QKG) [14].\n\nRecently an engineered eukaryotic protein glycosylation pathway has been inserted into E. coli resulting in cells capable of producing glycoproteins with Man3GlcNAc2 sugars",

Several targeted strain strategies have been developed through the introduction of DNA mutations that affect protein synthesis, degradation, secretion, or folding (reviewed in Makino et al., 2011), including: engineered strains for improved protein processing at low temperatures, such as the Arctic Express strain (Agilent Technologies); mutated strains that increase mRNA stability by attenuation of RNases activity, which is responsible for the shorter halflife of mRNA in E. coli cells (Lopez et al., 1999); engineered strains that supply extra copies of rare tRNAs, such as the Rosetta strains (Invitrogen) and the BL21 Codon Plus strains (Novagen; Baca and Hol, 2000;Sorensen et al., 2003b); mutant strains that facilitate disulfide bond formation and protein folding in the E. coli cytoplasm by render it oxidizing due to mutations in glutathione reductase (gor) and thioredoxin reductase (trxB) genes, and/or by co-production of Dsb proteins (Bessette et al., 1999;Lobstein et al., 2012), such as the Origami strains (Novagen) or the new SHuffle strain (New England Biolabs; Lobstein et al., 2012); and C41 and C43 (Avidis) BL21 (DE3) mutant strains that improve the synthesis of membrane proteins (Miroux and Walker, 1996). (iii) Cultivation conditions: protein production can be efficiently improved by the use of high cell-density culture systems like batch, which offers a limited control of the cell growth, and fed-batch, which allows the real time optimization of growth conditions (Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005b). The composition of the cell growth medium and the fermentation variables such as temperature, pH, induction time, and inducer concentration are also essential for the prevention of protein aggregation, whereby a careful optimization improves the FIGURE 1 | Strategies for soluble protein production in E. coli.\n\n(A) Expression vectors should be carefully selected in order to incorporate specific",

            "text": "Enzymatic catalysis provides tremendous opportunities for industry to carry out efficient and economical biocatalytic conversions. Traditional markets include the food and feed industry, but enzymatic processes are increasingly implemented in emerging markets such as fine chemical production and pharmaceutical industries [1]. Cost-efficient high-yield production of the biocatalysts, usually by heterologous expression in bacterial or yeast systems, is critical for the economic viability of such processes. The choice of the production host depends on several properties of the target protein itself. If posttranslational modifications are not required, prokaryotic systems like E. coli are most attractive due to high productivity, low cost and easy handling. However, overexpression of recombinant proteins in bacteria can cause problems like the production of insoluble aggregates of misfolded and inactive proteins called inclusion bodies (IB). Inclusion bodies consist of the overproduced polypeptide aggregated with small amounts of foreign proteins and nucleic acids [2]. Strategies for resolving this problem and for optimizing expression levels in E. coli have already been reported [3][4][5][6][7] and include the application of well-characterized expression systems under the control of tightly regulated promoters as well as the application of different expression conditions. In general, reduced cell growth, caused by lowered temperatures or oxygen limitation, promotes the expression of complex heterologous proteins in an active and soluble form and reduces IB formation [8][9][10][11]. Overdrive of inducer, on the other hand, results in IB formation and cell damage, whereas limited induction is favorable for native enzyme production [12]. Refolding of IB is widely discussed in literature [13,14], but is not possible for every given protein. \n\nIn this study we analyzed different expression systems for the production of recombinant pyranose 2-oxidase (POx; pyranose:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase; glucose 2-oxidase; EC 1.1.3.10) from Trametes multicolor in the prokaryotic host E. coli.",

[1] showed that in response to high oxygen concentrations, soxS expression is increased 16 fold, making it a possible candidate for inducing recombinant protein expression in response to high oxygen concentrations. Expression of recombinant proteins is often achieved by coupling the recombinant protein gene to promoters of genes that are activated in response to the presence or absence of a specific factor. Among the known examples for such couplings are the expression systems of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, where the heterologous gene is coupled to the methanol-activated AOX1 promoter [4]; the glucose-depletion activated expression system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [5]; and the arabinose inducible ara P BAD promoter in, E. coli, [6]. The activation of the soxS gene by increasing dissolved oxygen levels could be an additional way for expressing recombinant proteins from E. coli without affecting cell growth or metabolism since it does not rely on starvation stress induced by nitrogen, phosphate, or amino acids limitation [7]. Expression of recombinant proteins using high oxygen concentration has attractive properties such as precise control of the induction timing and the elimination of the inducer in the final product or the waste effluents of the bioprocess, making this strategy potentially suitable for production of pharmaceutical-grade proteins [8]. In this report, we describe the expression of recombinant green fluorescent protein from E. coli by using the soxS promoter and molecular oxygen as an inducer. The expression was compared to other induction procedure and the effect of oxygen on bacterial growth and protein integrity was evaluated.",

            "text": "A third option and collateral way to produce recombinant antibody fragments is their recovery directly from the surrounding E. coli culture medium. In general, a target protein fused to an N-terminal secretion tag can be recognized and translocated by the Sec machinery to the periplasm but it could further cross the outer membrane reaching the extracellular medium giving rise to a secretory protein. Extracellular protein expression holds several advantages over intracellular production such as the more oxidative and ample environment for effective protein folding, a higher titer of recombinant protein expression, and straightforward downstream purification process. The extracellular expression also enables the direct harvesting of proteins from the culture supernatant, sparing the procedures of cell lysis and reducing the process-related impurities, such as host cell DNA and endotoxins. Furthermore, extracellular secretion can prevent the accumulation of insoluble inclusion bodies in the cytosol or periplasm as well as the toxic effects exerted by some target proteins on the host upon their intracellular expression. The extracellular secretion can be successfully achieved by optimizing the induction starting point and by adding chemical agents that promote outer cell membrane permeability [131,148,173]. To date, the supplementation of Triton X-100 or glycine to the culture medium facilitates the extracellular secretion of target proteins from E. coli cells in periplasmic expression settings. Indeed, while glycine induces the swelling of E. coli cells and enlargement of the periplasmic space by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycans, Triton X-100 disrupts the integrity of the outer membrane [174]. In this way, a functional recombinant scFv has been efficiently recovered (2.86 mg/L) from the extracellular medium by adding 0.25% Triton X-100 [159]. An experimental setting for the efficient secretion of Fab fragments in E. coli in shake flasks has been recently described by Luo and coworkers [160].",

The nature of the target proteins themselves, along with cost, ease of use, and speed, are typically cited as major factors to consider in production. Despite a wide variety of alternative expression systems, most recombinant proteins for research and therapeutics are produced in a limited number of systems: Escherichia coli , yeast, insect cells, and the mammalian cell lines HEK293 and CHO. Recent interest in Vibrio natriegens as a new bacterial recombinant protein expression host is due in part to its short doubling time of \u2264\u200910\u00a0min but also stems from the promise of compatibility with techniques and genetic systems developed for E. coli . We successfully incorporated V. natriegens as an additional bacterial expression system for recombinant protein production and report improvements to published protocols as well as new protocols that expand the versatility of the system. While not all proteins benefit from production in V. natriegens , we successfully produced several proteins that were difficult or impossible to produce in E. coli . We also show that in some cases, the increased yield is due to higher levels of properly folded protein. Additionally, we were able to adapt our enhanced isotope incorporation methods for use with V. natriegens . Taken together, these observations and improvements allowed production of proteins for structural biology, biochemistry, assay development, and structure-based drug design in V. natriegens that were impossible and/or unaffordable to produce in E. coli .

            "text": "The potential of achieving high recombinant protein titers in repetitive fed-batch cultivation mode was shown by Luttmann et al. for P. pastoris as production host (Martens et al., 2011). However, repetitive fed-batch technology for recombinant protein production using E. coli has not been investigated yet. As methanol was continuously fed throughout the repetitive fed-batch studies with P. pastoris (Martens et al., 2011;Fricke et al., 2013), we established a similar feeding strategy for the inducer lactose and E. coli. Hence a feed-forward feeding strategy according to Eq. 1 was applied throughout all cycles. Furthermore, we tested whether a single-cycle fed batch, a two-cycle repetitive fed-batch, a three-cycle repetitive fed-batch or a chemostat is the cultivation mode of choice regarding overall space-time yield. We tested the cultivation modes for two different recombinant products: one produced in the cytoplasm and one secreted to the periplasm. Establishing such a process is of high interest for industry, to reduce downtime. For the calculations within this study the duration of the cycles and downtimes of the cultivation were chosen as regularly applied in industry (Slouka et al., 2018). Downtime, production time as well as calculation of total product titer are depicted in Figure 1. \n\nThe fermenter scale for the calculations was assumed with 10 m 3 , which is a common scale for E. coli in industry. Thus, time for steam in place (SIP) and cleaning in place (CIP) takes 3 and 6 h, respectively (communication with industrial partner). Batch phase on glucose was 6 h (Slouka et al., 2018). Noninduced fed-batch time was 8 h, to achieve a biomass of 35-40 g/L before induction using a growth rate of \u00b5 = 0.1 h \u22121 (equivalent to a q s of 0.25 g/g/h using a biomass/substrate yield of 0.4 g/g for calculation, Kopp et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Before initiating a protein expression project, it is essential to determine the definitive use of the recombinantly produced protein. Must the protein be soluble? Does the final product need to be active? Is the native protein conformation important? In some instances, such as antibody production, the production of soluble protein is not necessary, as the protein sequence, rather than the correct 3-dimensional fold, is required for successful antibody production (Yan et al., 2007). For these cases, expression that causes the protein to be incorporated into inclusion bodies is suggested, as the recombinant protein, while misfolded or unfolded, is highly enriched and protected from proteases (Valax and Georgiou, 1993). However, most often, the objective of recombinant protein expression in E. coli is to produce a protein product that is soluble, folded, and active.\n\nExpression in E. coli requires four elements: (1) the protein of interest, (2) a bacterial expression vector, (3) an expression cell line, and (4) the equipment/materials for bacterial cell culture (i.e., shaker/media). There are multiple parameters that can be varied when optimizing an expression protocol, from selecting a vector with the appropriate promoter, to choosing an appropriate induction temperature. With each selection affecting the solubility and activity of the protein product, this task can appear daunting. However, decades of work by individual protein chemists, coupled with the recent experiences of high-throughput structural genomics efforts, have resulted in the identification of a consensus protocol that allows a diverse set of proteins to be successfully expressed in E. coli. A flowchart of the protocol typically used by the authors to express a diverse set of proteins is shown in Figure 5.24.2 (Mustelin et al., 2005;Brown et al., 2008;Critton et al., 2008). More extensive protocols are also available (Peti and Page, 2007;Gr\u00e5slund et al., 2008a).\n\nThe protocol outlined in Figure 5.24.2 consists of nine steps. First, the optimal residue boundaries of the desired protein product, the \"target protein,\" are determined. The target gene is then subcloned into a bacterial expression vector that utilizes the T7 lacO",

            "text": "Although a number of expression hosts are available for the production of recombinant proteins, Escherichia coli expression system remains the first choice for basic research and the initial development in commercial activities owing to its several advantages, such as fast growth, low cost, and high-yield protein production [1]. About 90% of the structures presented in the Protein Data Bank were determined with the recombinant proteins produced in E. coli [2]. Up to 2011, 30% of the recombinant biopharmaceuticals licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) have been produced in this host cell [3]. As a bacterial expression system, the limitation obviously exists for E. coli to express complex proteins due to lack of the sophisticated machinery to perform posttranslational modifications. Moreover, many recombinant proteins are liable to form incorrect conformation in this expression system, resulting in formation of inclusion bodies especially under over-expression condition. Up to 75% of human proteins are successfully expressed in E. coli, while only 25% of them are produced in an active soluble form using this host system [4]. \n\nProduction of active soluble proteins continues to face challenges. To improve the solubility of recombinant proteins in E. coli, some factors have been intensively examined, such as culture temperature, combination of promoters and induction conditions, coexpression of molecular chaperones and folding modulators [1]. In some specific cases, enhancement of soluble protein production is significant. While, in other cases, improvements can be minimal and many recombinant proteins remain insoluble under these conditions. In light of the enhancement of soluble protein production, the best available tools to date have been fusion tags. Although the mechanisms for these fusion tags to enhance the solubility of their partner proteins remain unclear, several hypotheses have been proposed. It has been suggested that fusion partners can attract chaperones or have an intrinsic chaperone-like activities, and some acidic fusion partners can inhibit protein aggregation by electrostatic repulsion [5,6,7].",

            "text": "Since the advent of production of recombinant proteins, application of therapeutic and diagnostic proteins as biopharmaceuticals was changed remarkably (Walsh 2014). These proteins are required in huge amount and usually can not be obtained from natural sources due to extremely low availability. Moreover, Genetically engineered proteins with special benefits (e.g. Insulin analogs) are as such molecules which can therefore only be obtained via recombinant technology (Walsh 2000(Walsh , 2006;;Sanchez and Demain 2012). Escherichia coli was the first and still popularly used host for the fast and economical production of recombinant proteins (Vincentelli and Romier 2013;Chance et al. 1981;Choi and Lee 2004;Rosano and Ceccarelli 2014;Lebendiker and Danieli 2014). In-depth knowledge of genetic and biochemical pathways of E. coli and availability of variety of vectors made is an attractive host for such purposes. Although significant improvements have been made at transcription, translation and translocation, still obtaining soluble and bioactive proteins is a major challenge (Pines and Inouye 1999;Baneyx 1999;Rosano and Ceccarelli 2014). \n\nSecreted proteins such as antibodies, enzymes, hormones etc. are used for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Secreted proteins having two or more cysteines makes disulfide bonds, which is usually vital for structure formation and bioactivity (Creighton 1997b;Creighton et al. 1995;Clarke and Fersht 1993). The cytosol of E. coli is reducing which gives inclusion bodies when such proteins are expressed in the cytosol (Freedman 1989;Hwang et al. 1992;Aslund et al. 1994;Carmel-Harel and Storz 2000;Russel 1995;Messens and Collet 2006). Usually in vitro oxidative refolding is difficult, laborious, time consuming and may be uneconomical depending upon refolding yield (Lilie et al. 1998;Lange and Rudolph 2009;Yamaguchi et al. 2013;Basu et al. 2011).",

E. coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing the TEVp 5M or codon variant were cultured overnight at 37 \u02daC in 5 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, diluted to 5-fold and grown at 37 \u02daC. When OD 600 reached about 0.5, cells were induced by 0.5 mM of IPTG. After culturing at 28 \u02daC for 12 h, cells in 5 ml of LB medium were collected by centrifugation and disrupted in 0.8 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl). Pellets were washed three times with buffer A, solubilized by 0.2 ml of 8 M urea, and centrifuged to remove the precipitants. About 40 mg and 10 mg of proteins in supernatants and pellets respectively were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or Western blotting using mouse anti-His6 antibody. Protein concentration was determined by Coomassie brilliant blue G250, using bovine serum albumin as standard. The absorption of 8 M urea solution was applied as control and subtracted. \n\nRecombinant codon variant or that fused with the bacterially codon-optimized emerald green fluorescent protein (EmGFP) were expressed in either E. coli BL21(DE3) or Rosseta (DE3) cells. Three colonies were selected randomly and the fluorescence of cells, soluble fractions and pellets were measured by an F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi, Japan). Excitation and emission was conducted at 488 nm and 515 nm. Cells harboring pET28-TEVp 5M were used as the control and cell fluorescence was subtracted. \n\nThe S-tagged TEVp 5M or selected codon variant were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) plysS cells and induced for 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min respectively at 37 \u02daC. Soluble protein production was determined by measuring the fused S-tag amount, according to Novagen's SNTag System protocol.",

            "text": "To screen recombinant spidroin expression in different E. coli strains, nine commercially available strains were used in this work (Supplementary Table 1). Some strains were chosen based on factors previously shown or hypothesized to affect recombinant silk production, such as codon usage and inclusion body formation. These strains include RosettaGami B, which has upregulation of seven tRNAs for rare codons including those for glycine and proline, as well as BLR, which has a recA \u2212 mutation that may facilitate increased stability of plasmids containing repetitive sequences (Yedahalli et al., 2016;Huemmerich et al., 2004;Karla et al., 2005). The strain SoluBL21 has been developed through directed evolution to produce soluble protein when its ancestral strain, BL21(DE3), does not yield detectable soluble product. Likewise, strain pGro7 expresses a chaperone protein that prevents inclusion body formation and promotes soluble production (SoluBL21 Competent E. coli, 2022;Nishihara et al., 1998). The remaining strains were chosen to potentially identify unknown targets for the optimization of recombinant spidroin expression. This includes strains HMS174 and MG1655, which unlike other strains tested, are from the K-12 E. coli lineage instead of the B lineage (Hausjell et al., 2018;Leal-Ega\u00f1a et al., 2012;Bachmann, 1972). Strain pLysS restricts basal expression, while strain Origami B contains mutations that change the cytoplasmic environment and cellular stress responses through alterations to the thiol-redox equilibrium, glutathione metabolism, and oxidative stress response (Studier and Moffatt, 1986;Kong and Guo, 2014;Lobstein et al., 2016;Kunert et al., 1990). All strains used in this study were DE3 lysogens and proteins were expressed from the pET19b vector under control of the T7 promoter. We additionally studied a tenth hybrid strain, SoluBL21-pLysS, which we developed by combining features from pLysS and SoluBL21.",

            "text": "Recombinant protein expression has revolutionized all aspects of the biological sciences. Most significantly, it has dramatically expanded the number of proteins that can be investigated both biochemically and structurally. Previously, protein production was the domain of experts, as purification from a natural source (i.e., plants, rabbits, bovine) was often difficult and time consuming. However, the availability of new commercial systems for recombinant protein expression, combined with advanced protein purification techniques, has made protein production prevalent throughout the biological and biomedical sciences. This has enabled the research community to study thousands of low abundance and novel proteins from a large variety of organisms. Notably, 31 recombinant proteins were approved for therapeutic use between 2003 and 2006, highlighting the importance of heterologous protein expression in biopharmaceutical research (Walsh, 2006). As the number of recombinantly produced proteins increases, so too does an appreciation for the difficulties and limitations inherent to this process.\n\nIn spite of the development of multiple nonbacterial recombinant expression systems over the last three decades (yeast, baculovirus, mammalian cell, cell free systems; see Table 5.24.1), Escherichia coli is still the preferred host for recombinant protein expression (Yin et al., 2007). The rationale is clear: E. coli is easy to genetically manipulate, it is inexpensive to culture, and expression is fast, with proteins routinely produced in one day. Moreover, protocols for isotope-labeling for NMR spectroscopy and selenomethionine incorporation for X-ray crystallography are well established, making it highly suitable for structural studies. Thus, E. coli has multiple, significant benefits over other expression systems including cost, ease-of-use, and scale.\n\nDespite its many advantages and widespread use, there are also disadvantages to using E. coli as an expression host. In contrast to eukaryotic systems, transcription and translation are fast and tightly coupled. Since many eukaryotic proteins require longer times and/or the assistance of folding chaperones to fold into their native state, this rate enhancement often leads to a pool  Spirin, 2004;Langlais et al., 2007; for other references, see text.\n\nof partially folded, unfolded, or misfolded,",

            "text": "The resulting quantity constituted 5-10% of total E. coli protein. To improve the process in E. coli, the following measures have been used: (i) Use of multiple promoters to control expression; (ii) use of specific host strains; (iii) co-expression of chaperones and/or foldase; (iv) reduction of temperature; (v) secretion of proteins in the periplasmic space or medium; (vi) reduction of protein synthesis; (vii) shift of the growth medium; (viii) introduction of a fusion partner; (ix) release of a protein fragment; and (x) denaturation and refolding of the protein in vitro [45]. Rapid fermentation with a cell density of E. coli has resulted in dry cell contents ranging from 20 to 175 g/L [46]. The issue of acetate development and toxicity can be solved by exponentially feeding glucose in the media and maintaining the real rate of growth below which the development of acetate is obtained. Yields as high as 5.5 g/L of \u03b1-consensus interferon have been achieved in the broth [47]. Long-term development of the chemostat (219 generations below a dilution rate of 0.05 h \u22121 ) produced an E. coli mutant with an increased growth rate and biomass yields, shorter lag period, lower acetate production, and increased stress resistance [48]. This strain produced high yields of heterologous secreted proteins [49]. Heterologous proteins developed as inclusion bodies in E. coli are inert, composite, and insoluble and typically exhibit non-native intraand inter-molecular disulfide bonds and rare free cysteines [50]. Such bodies must be separated from the cell to derive the active protein along with the proteins solubilized by denaturants, and disulfide bonds must be extracted using reduction agents. Refolding is achieved by eliminating the denaturant and reducing agent, accompanied by the protein being renatured. Heterologous recombinant proteins may be formed in a highly soluble biologically active form when their genomes are fused to the E. coli genes with thioredoxin [51].",

Engineering of oxidizing cellular environments, co-expression of molecular chaperones, use of periplasmic protease deficient strain of E. coli and balancing of heavy and light chain expression have all enabled increased yield of up to 1 mg/L [8,10,11]. However, these options often require some degree of further optimization such as balancing expression of each polypeptide chain, or the use of proprietary modified E. coli strains which are not readily available. Modification of translation initiation regions (TIRs) to reduce protein translation rates has also had some success at improving overall yield [12]. The lower translation rate is believed to decrease protein load on the secretory system, reducing the accumulation of unprocessed products in the cytoplasm. Indeed, the high level expression of antibody obtained in fermentor cultures was obtained using balanced but low strength TIRs for both heavy and light chains [8]. \n\nIn this study, we explored strategies for optimization of antibody expression in general laboratory strains of E. coli using simple methods for reducing translation rates. These include the use of a low-copy number plasmid, reduction of inducer concentration and induction of antibody HC/LC at late log phase. Single step purification on Protein A resulted in co-elution of bacterial proteins along with degraded heavy chain. Introduction of a second purification step with Protein L successfully removed contaminating proteins and heavy chain fragments.",

It is a gram-negative rod-shaped proteobacterium and mammalian intestinal pathogen (Overman et al. 2014). The genetics of E. coli has been studied more than any other gram-negative bacteria. Due to recent advances in the understanding of transcription and translation processes, the mechanism of protein folding, and the availability of improved genetic tools, the use of E. coli to express recombinant proteins has increased (Demain and Vaishnav 2009).\n\nBacteria are commonly used to produce recombinant proteins less than 30 kDa (Demain and Vaishnav 2009) and production of larger sizes is problematic, but the production of far larger proteins has also been reported in this host. Chloroplast is a promising heterologous host for the production of recombinant proteins in the future. Comparing the potential of E. coli and plant chloroplast to produce recombinant protein can be a good comparison. In the chloroplast, the integration of heterologous genes into the genome is achieved by means of homologous recombination (Burnett et al. 2020), and polycistronic mRNA is produced in this organelle. Introduced and integrated heterologous genes into the chloroplast genome can have 10,000 polyploidy in a young leaf cell (Verma and Daniell 2007), which is unmatched by any other expression system. Also, some plant-derived recombinant therapeutic proteins can be used as oral drugs (Kurup and Thomas 2020) without the need for a purification process, which sharply decreases the cost of the final product. In addition, plants can grow in the presence of soil, water, and light, which is cost-effective compared to the growth media of other expression systems (Burnett and Burnett 2020). This expression system has some drawbacks. One of the main problems is the process of integration of heterologous genes into the chloroplast genome, which is mostly done using a gene gun device (Burnett and Burnett 2020), which is expensive, as well as optimization of ch",

The recombinant vector was introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells for expression. The culture was then supplemented with 0.5 mM IPTG (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) as soon as the cell density at 600 nm reached 0.6. An LB broth medium was used to cultivate bacterial cultures in a shaking incubator overnight. The cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h. The suspension was subjected to a centrifugation process (10,000 g, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C) and sonication (Hielscher Co. Teltow, Germany) using short pulses (30 pulses of 30 s with a 1-min interval in between, 80% amplitude). The supernatant was separated after the debris was eliminated by centrifugation (10,000 g, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C). The presence of the target protein was confirmed by the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blotting. Subsequently, a large-scale cell culture was conducted to produce more protein. Once more, bacterial cultures were grown in a shaking incubator in an LB broth medium overnight. The suspension was centrifuged and sonicated with short pulses, the same as in the previous steps. The debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 g, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C), and the supernatant containing soluble protein was subjected to affinity chromatography using a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen Co., Hilden, Germany).",

            "text": "A bacterial expression host system, generally E. coli, is the preferable host for recombinant proteins due to its low cost, well-known biochemistry and genetics, rapid growth, and good productivity (Baeshen et al., 2015;Gupta and Shukla, 2016). Some disadvantages of this system include a lack of proper post-translational modifications (PTMs), inclusion body (IB) formation, codon bias, and endotoxin issues. Some techniques such as the addition of fusion tags (Liu M. et al., 2019) to the gene sequence, cofactor supplementation, and co-expression of the protein with molecular or chemical chaperones can avoid IB formation (Gupta S. K. et al., 2019) and improve soluble expression (Malekian et al., 2019). Different tags such as Fh8, SUMO, His, TRX, and MBP at the N-or Cterminal enhance protein solubility and also help in affinity purification (Paraskevopoulou and Falcone, 2018). Inducing protein expression by lowering the temperature after induction of culture leads to soluble protein. This strategy also increases protein stability and proper folding. Further, novel promoters and glycoengineering E. coli cells also lead to increased expression of a recombinant protein (Gupta and Shukla, 2016). However, the production of recombinant proteins in IBs has some advantages such as low product degradation by host cell proteases. Despite the various advantages of this system, a lack of PTM machinery results in a cumbersome purification process (Mamat et al., 2015). PTMs (glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, phosphorylation, or proteolytic processing) are involved in folding processes, stability, and biological activity (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009). E. coli has been modified for PTM for the production of recombinant proteins. An E. coli host has also been engineered to produce glycosylated antibodies (Wacker et al., 2002;Valderrama-Rincon et al., 2012;Gupta and Shukla, 2016).",

            "text": "E. coli remains the most widely used system for recombinant protein expression due to its numerous advantages over other expression systems such as yeast, baculovirus, mammalian cells, and cell-free systems. The key benefits of using E. coli include its low cost, ease of use, and ability to scale production efficiently, making it the preferred host for many researchers. [14] urthermore, the flexibility of E. coli in accommodating various expression conditions allows for fine-tuning protein production to optimize yield and solubility, which are critical for downstream applications. Recent studies have demonstrated that altering expression parameters, such as temperature, induction time, and inducer concentration, can significantly enhance production efficiency and solubility of target proteins. [15] ur comprehensive search on the database, which catalogued E. coli-expressed recombinant proteins, included entries corresponding to 17 317 unique UniProt IDs sourced from 19 799 research articles. This extensive dataset provides valuable insight into the commonly used induction conditions across a wide array of proteins. For instance, in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), we show that the most frequently used induction temperatures are 18, 20, and 16 \u00b0C, which accounted for 19.1%, 15.6%, and 13.6% of cases, respectively. The induction times are clustered predominantly around two ranges: 12-16 h (69.0%) and 3-6 h (14.3%), with isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) concentrations commonly set to 1 millimolar or 0.5 millimolar. Additionally, as shown in Figure 5, specific conditions are favored to maximize the expression of proteins with distinct annotations. For example, proteins associated with \"disulfide bond,\" \"protease\", and \"DNA-binding\" annotations tend to be expressed under shorter induction times (2-8 h) and higher temperatures (28-37 \u00b0C), whereas those related to the \"cytoskeleton\", \"cell cycle\", and \"nucleus\" are less commonly expressed under shorter induction times. Moreover, proteins that bind iron or whose functions are iron-dependent are more frequently expressed at 28 \u00b0C for 24 h.",

            "text": "However, additional DpnI treatment might be advantageous in case too much template plasmid is transferred giving rise to false positive colonies. As colony screening by PCR or restriction digest may be challenging when the product only differs marginally from its original plasmid, two clones were stochastically selected and sequenced. A positive clone was used for protein expression in E. coli and the mutated protein was purified by affinity chromatography to compare its fluorescence properties with the wild-type (Fig 4D and Fig 4E). \n\nTaken together, AQUA Cloning provides the simplest means of realizing sophisticated mutagenesis that exceeds the potentials of other existing mutagenesis protocols in terms of flexibility, costs and applicability. \n\nAQUA Expression-combined cloning and expression. DNA cloning is often considered a time-consuming process that precedes the actual experiments. In some cases, as for the production of recombinant protein in E. coli, the time required for cloning may even exceed the time required for the experiment in which the recombinant protein may be used for. \n\nWith AQUA Cloning robustly assembling circular plasmids in vivo within the most common strains of E. coli, we aimed to reduce the labor and time required for the production of recombinant protein to an absolute minimum. By transferring the DNA assembly reaction into the expression host, it becomes possible to combine cloning and expression in a single cell, thus performing cloning and expression of recombinant protein within 24 h, from one day to the next (see Fig 5A). To demonstrate 'AQUA Expression', a plasmid consisting of three DNA fragments was assembled by AQUA Cloning in the expression strain BL21 (DE3). One fragment contained the coding sequence for the red fluorescent protein mCherry, while the two remaining DNA segments comprised a bacterial expression vector split within the resistance gene for the antibiotic, spectinomycin (Fig 5B). With this approach, the method entails an intrinsic positive selection for in vivo assembly, as only clones performing the re-assembly of the resistance gene will emerge in the presence of the antibiotic.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is the most important production system for recombinant proteins reaching volumetric yields in the gram per liter scale for extracellular production (40)(41)(42). For production of functional antibody fragments, the key to success was the secretion of both V chains into the periplasmic space of E. coli where the oxidizing environment allows the correct formation of disulfide bonds and the assembly to a functional Fv fragment (43). This strategy also allowed the first expression of functional Fab fragments in E. coli described in 1988 (44). \n\nThe production of recombinant antibodies in the reducing cytoplasmic compartment results mostly in non-functional aggregates (45). Recovery of functional antibody fragments from cytoplasmic inclusion bodies by complete denaturation and refolding (46) is often not efficient. Stable cysteine free mutants of some scFvs were successfully produced in the cytoplasm of E. coli (47,48). E. coli strains with mutations in the glutathione and thioredoxin reductase in combination with coexpression of cytoplasmic chaperones GroEL/ES, trigger factor, DnaK/J as well as signal sequence-less variants of periplasmic chaperones DsbC and Skp increased the yield of functional Fab (49). \n\nFor the production of camelid single domain antibodies (VHH), coexpression of Erv1p sulfhydryl oxidase increased the yield in the cytoplasm (50). \n\nDespite these efforts, most antibody fragments are produced in the periplasm of E. coli using N-terminal leader sequences targeting the periplasmic Sec pathway (51), for example signal peptides derived from outer membrane protein A (OmpA), alkaline phosphatase A (PhoA), or pectate lyase B (PelB) (52)(53)(54). Also the SRP pathway can be used for antibody fragment production (55).",

However, the production of protein in the E. coli expression system doesn't always yield maximum product because of various underlying parameters, which must be optimized depending on the promoter under which the protein of interest is inserted and the protein to be produced itself. This review article discussed some of the important parameters that are optimized for maximum expression of recombinant protein in E. coli. The expression of the protein is better when induced with IPTG instead of lactose because IPTG is not metabolized by bacterial cells during growth and remains constant throughout the process. The expression of the protein is observed to be high at temperatures of about 37\u00b0C. However, the temperature must be optimized according to the protein of interest since higher temperatures may lead to proteolytic degradation of the protein. Optimization of protein expression in Escherichia coli must be carried out experimentally to check what conditions best suit the recombinant protein.",

The recombinant plasmid (pET32-ThnM1) was generated by cloning thnM1 into the pET-32a(1). The recombinant plasmid harboring E. coli BL21 (DE3) (StrateGene, La Jolla, CA, USA) and E. coli ThnM1 was used as an expression host for protein production. E. coli-ThnM1 was cultured and grown in Luria Bertani medium (LB) supplemented with 50 mg/ mL ampicillin at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 180 rpm until the optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) reached 0.8. The culture was then induced with IPTG at a final concentration of 0.4 mM and continued to grow at 20\u00b0C for 18 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (20 min, 824 \u00c2 g) at 4\u00b0C, washed with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 100 mM NaCl, subsequently suspended in 1 mL of the same buffer, and lysed by sonication using a Sonosmasher (Ultrasonic, Ulsso Hitec, Republic of Korea.) in an ice bath. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 \u00c2 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The target protein was purified using the TALON cobalt resin kit for His-tag purification (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan). The fractions of the purified protein were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and the pure fractions were pooled using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters (Millipore; 30,000 nominal molecular weight limit [NMWL]). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (31). The purified protein was stored in 10% glycerol containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) buffer at 270\u00b0C for future use.

            "text": "Combined with GMP-compliant cell lines and processes and well-established approval procedures, it is hard to imagine that the CHO platform will be displaced by any other expression system for the manufacturing of complex proteins in the near future. \n\nAlthough mammalian cells are favored for the production of complex proteins, prokaryotic cells are much easier to handle and are much less expensive in terms of media requirements. Accordingly, where the product is a simpler protein, E. coli is often the ideal choice of production host. Indeed, the first recombinant therapeutic protein (human insulin) has been commercially produced in E. coli since 1982 (Baeshen et al., 2014). Many other commercial recombinant protein products including cytokines for cancer treatment or technical enzymes for industrial applications have been produced in E. coli, but its status as the gold standard prokaryotic host is mainly for historical reasons and a range of other prokaryotes may be more suitable (Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2016;Singh et al., 2016). In our laboratory, we use Pseudomonas fluorescens for the larger-scale production of recombinant proteins, which accumulate in the cytosol by default or can be secreted to the culture medium (Retallack et al., 2012). For example, we chose cytosolic accumulation for the production of a 19-kDa phenylalanine-free protein that can be used for the dietetic management of patients suffering from phenylketonuria -an inborn error metabolism that results in decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine (Hoffmann et al., 2018). The phenylalanine-free protein can easily be extracted from the cells by high-pressure homogenization and isolated via a single affinity purification step (Figure 1). Simple medium-scale cultivation in 2.5-L shake flasks with a culture volume of 0.5-1.0 L achieved yields of 2.5 g/L.",

            "text": "The advent of recombinant DNA technology has revolutionized the biotechnology industry [1]. In particular, cells can be reprogrammed and instructed to express the protein of interest. This approach is acknowledged by its power for overproduction of pharmaceutical and industrial proteins in an efficient way. The annual market value of recombinant proteins reaches billions of dollars, and the global market still continues to grow [2]. Recent progress in identification of microbes with specific functions has accelerated the accumulation of genomic information [3][4][5], which facilitates exploration of more proteins applicable in industry and biorefinery. Accordingly, there arises a pressing need for an economically viable method to efficiently produce recombinant proteins. \n\nEscherichia coli is recognized as the biotechnology workhorse because it has several advantages including easy manipulation with genetics, culturability with the cost-effective medium, and scalable production scheme [6]. Employment of E. coli that harbors the gene-born plasmid has been commonly applied for production of recombinant proteins based on glucose [7]. However, many problems associated with protein overproduction occur. For instance, the presence of a plasmid negatively affects cell proteins and ribosome components [8]. The gratuitous overexpression of \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-Gal) was reported to cause the ribosome destruction in cells [9]. The folding process is usually afflicted with an abnormal level of the expressed protein, consequently forming inclusion bodies [10]. It is known that the physiological function of central metabolism provides precursor metabolites and energy to fuel the cellular activity. Most of cellular energy is utilized for the synthesis of proteins [11]. To force the production of a gene-encoding product perturbs cell physiology as a result of energy drainage and imbalanced carbon flux in central metabolism. This in turn triggers the global stress response which further restricts the cellular growth and protein production [12]. Moreover, the metabolic response of E. coli to protein overproduction is complicated and depends on the strain type as well as culture compositions [13]. Taken together, the task to produce a large amount of recombinant proteins remains challenging.",

Its Frontiers in Microbiology | Microbiotechnology, Ecotoxicology and Bioremediation benefits of cost and ease of use and scale make E. coli one of the most widely used host systems for recombinant protein production, but one must be aware that success is not always guaranteed in this prokaryotic host system, mainly when working with recombinant proteins of human origin.\n\nThis review highlighted several key factors that contribute to the soluble protein production and purification in E. coli, including the use of different mutated host strains, co-production of chaperones and foldases and testing different cultivation conditions, with a main focus in the gene fusion technology.\n\nThe use of fusion partners was an important turning point for the E. coli host system: fusion tags promote or increase protein solubility, help on protein purification and can also be used to increase protein's immunogenicity. Traditional fusion systems like MBP, GST, NusA, or Trx have constantly been challenged and complemented by novel fusion solutions such as the SUMO tag (Butt et al., 2005;Marblestone et al., 2006), the HaloTag (Ohana et al., 2009), the SNUT tag (Caswell et al., 2010), and the expressivity tag (Hansted et al., 2011), among others.\n\nMore recently, a novel and unique fusion system for simple and inexpensive soluble protein overproduction and purification in E. coli was developed and studied: the Fh8 tag (Costa, 2013).\n\nThe Fh8 is ranked among the best solubility enhancer tags as Trx, MBP, or NusA (Costa et al., 2013a), and it offers a specific and simple purification of the target proteins by using its natural calcium-binding properties and mild conditions for HIC (Costa et al., 2013b). The Fh8 fusion partner is one of the few existing tags to promote simultaneously target protein solubility directly into the E. coli cytoplasm and a simple and cost-effective protein purification.\n\nThe novel Fh8 fusion system overcomes several issues related with recombinant protein production",

            "text": "Abstract The microbial expression system (Escherichia coli) is the most widely studied host for the production of biotherapeutic products, such as antibody fragments, single chain variable fragments and nanobodies. However, recombinant biotherapeutic proteins are often expressed as insoluble proteins, thereby limiting the utility of E. coli as expression system. To overcome this limitation, various strategies have been developed, such as changes at DNA level (codon optimization), fusion with soluble tags and variations in process parameters (temperature), and inducer concentration. However, there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d strategy. The most commonly used approach involves induction at low temperature, as reducing the temperature during cultivation has been reported to increase bioactive protein production in E. coli. In this study, we examine the impact of various process parameters, such as temperature and inducer concentration, as well as, high plasmid copy number vector for achieving enhanced soluble expression of TNF\u03b1 inhibitor Fab. An interaction amongst these parameters has been observed and their optimization has been demonstrated to result in expression of 30\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009mg/L antibody fragment using E. coli. This case study illustrates how process optimization can contribute toward making biotherapeutics affordable.",

            "text": "In general, recombinant proteins are the most common source of the diagnostic reagents and can be expressed in mammalian, insect and bacterial cells [19][20][21]. While each of these systems has its advantages [22], the bacterial expression system is one of the most universally used and has been employed widely due to multiple factors, including its relative inexpensive cost, ease of manipulation and rapid growth rate [23]. However, different codon usage pattern in E. coli can cause diminished the production of heterologous eukaryotic protein. Many E. coli strains, such as BL21 CodonPlus and Rosetta-2 derived from BL21, are optimized to enhance expression of gene sequences that contain codons used rarely by E. coli [24]. Because there are a few rare codons in the US11 gene, three different E. coli strains, including E. coli BL21 (DE3), BL21 CodonPlus and BL21 Rosetta were used to optimize the expression of the fusion protein. As a result, His-tagged US11 protein could be expressed in all of these three bacteria hosts, but with a slight better expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3) (data not shown). Additionally, different expression parameters were tested to optimize the expression of the US11 protein, demonstrating that the US11 protein gained the highest expression under the condition of 37\u00b0C (Figure 2A, lane 7) with 1 mM IPTG (Figure 2A, lane 3) for 5 h (Figure 2B, lane 6). \n\nIt is very common that high level expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli result in the formation of insoluble and inactive aggregate known as inclusion bodies [25]. Although the proteins in the inclusion bodies are easy to purify and are protected from the intracellular protease, they are synthesized in the form of misfolding or partial folding polypeptides. Therefore, purified inclusion bodies must undergo the process of protein renaturation. In the present study, denaturation solution was removed by dilution or dialysis, which permitted renaturation of the His-tagged US11 proteins.",

            "text": "BackgroundThe Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli has been widely used as a cell factory for the production of proteins and specialty chemicals because it is the best characterized host with many available expression and regulation systems. However, recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli are generally intracellular and often found in the form of inclusion bodies. Extracellular production of proteins is advantageous compared with intracellular production because extracellular proteins can be purified more easily and can avoid protease attack, which results in higher product quality. In this study, we found a catalytic domain of a cellulase (Cel-CD) and its N-terminus can be employed as carriers for extracellular production of recombinant proteins.ResultsIn this report, we identified the catalytic domain of a cellulase (Cel-CD) from Bacillus sp. that can be secreted into the medium from recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3) in large quantities without its native signal peptide. By subcellular location analysis, we proved that the secretion was a two-step process and the N-terminal sequence of the full length Cel-CD played a crucial function in secretion. Both the Cel-CD and its N-terminal sequence can serve as carriers for efficient extracellular production of select target proteins.ConclusionsFusion of heterologous proteins with N20 from Cel-CD can carry the target proteins out of the cells with a concentration from 101 to 691\u00a0mg/L in flask cultivation. The extracellular recombinant proteins with a relative high purity. The results suggested that this system has a potential application in plant biomass conversion and industrial production of enzymes and therapeutic proteins.",

            "text": "In this study, we successfully engineered a pathway to produce a terminally sialylated, homogeneous N-glycosylated protein with \u03b1-2,6-linkages in the periplasm of E. coli, and without the requirement to supply sialic acid in the medium. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the production of such a terminally sialylated N-glycoprotein, with a sialic acid cap characteristic of human N-glycans (Neu5Ac-\u03b1-2,6-Gal\u03b2-1,4-GlcNAc-), in E. coli. The molecular properties of the sialylated FN3 protein are currently being investigated, including its susceptibility to proteolytic degradation, solubility, persistence in the circulation, and immunogenicity.\n\nAlthough the sialylated glycoprotein was successfully produced in E. coli, induction of the full sialylation pathway resulted in a detrimental effect on host cell growth and a greatly reduced yield of the sialylated protein, from 15 mg/L of unmodified FN3 to a maximum purified yield of 1.5 mg/L of the sialylated FN3. Similar observations have been noted in other studies of recombinant protein glycosylation (Lizak et al., 2011;Hu et al., 2013;Keys et al., 2017) and this effect is likely to be due to the increased metabolic burden associated with expression of the multiple additional genes required for glycosylation, particularly those under the control of strong promoters (Glasscock et al., 2018). Optimization of gene expression levels in the pathway through engineering of promoters and ribosome-binding sites will be important to better balance the protein expression, LLOs production and glycosylation processes, thereby reducing the metabolic burden. Plasmid loss has also been identified as a basis for reduced yields (Lizak et al., 2011;Hu et al., 2013), with host cells required to maintain two or three compatible plasmids with different selectable markers to accommodate the multiple genes necessary for protein expression and glyco-modification. Previous results from our group indicated that FN3 could be produced in considerably higher amounts",

We have selected E. coli to express the recombinant PEDV-S1 because it has been proven to be a very good host for the heterologous expression of recombinant proteins, and for many purposes E. coli is the best host [24][25][26]. The recent advances in physiology and genetics of the E. coli at molecular level offer a great opportunity for the rapid and economical production of recombinant proteins [27]. It has previously been shown that genetically fused purification tag enhances the level of purity and protein recovery [27,28]. \n\nHere in this study, we have optimized various growth parameters (cultivation temperature, inducer concentration, culture media, pre-and post-induction incubation), this study was successful in obtaining highly pure PEDV-S1 in milligram quantities from shake flask experiments.",

For recombinant protein expression in E. coli the HDA6 gene, which was previously subcloned into the Zero Blunt TOPO vector (above), was digested with BamH1 and Not1 restriction enzyme and ligated to a similarly digested pET24a plasmid (Novagen, Madison, USA), in frame with the C-terminus His-Tag coding sequence under the control of a strong bacteriophage T7 transcription and translation signals. The construct (pET24a-HDA6) and the control (empty vector control pET24) were then introduced into BL21 (DE3) E.  coli competent cells (EMD-Millipore) suitable for high-level production of proteins from target genes cloned into pET vectors. Five milliliters of LB media containing 30 mg/L kanamycin was inoculated with a single colony of the BL21 (DE3) harboring pET24-HDA6 or pET24a and allowed to grow overnight at 37 \u2218 C. One milliliter of the overnight culture was used to inoculate 180 mL of LB containing 30 mg/L kanamycin. The cultures were allowed to grow until the optical density (OD 600 ) reached 0.4-0.6. Protein expression was induced by adding 1 mM of isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY). Extraction of recombinant proteins was performed using the BugBuster protein extraction kit (Novagen, EMD-Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) following recommended procedures. The concentration of the crude recombinant protein was determined by the Lowry method using Spectra Max5 M5 reader (Molecular Devices LLC, VWR Corporate Headquarters, USA) [33].

The primer sequences used in the PCR and sequencing analysis are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. For recombinant protein production, the plasmid was first transformed into Escherichia coli strain HMS174(DE3)pLysS. Five colonies were then pre-cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin and 50 mg/ml chroramphenicol at 30 C for 4 h and supplemented with 0.4 mM isopropylthio-b-galactoside (IPTG). After 14 h of culture at 30 C, the cells were recovered by centrifugation (8000 rpm for 5 min at 4 C), and the recombinant protein extracted by sonication (0.5 min) in 1\u00c2 phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 10 mM imidazole. The extract was heat-treated at 50 C for 15 min to partially denature the endogenous E. coli proteins and then centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 C to remove debris. The recombinant ARMAN-2 tRNA splicing endonuclease was purified using a PROTEUS IMAC protein purification kit (Pro-Chem, Littleton, MA, USA).

            "text": "Consequently, researchers are investing considerable effort into developing enhanced methods for producing and purifying recombinant proteins [14,15]. While the host organism used for recombinant protein expression dictates the purification strategy, the downstream application of the purified protein dictates the choice of expression system used [16][17][18]. Bacterial expression systems are favored when copious amounts of recombinant proteins are required. These systems have proven to be cost effective and easy to handle, and their use follows well-established protocols [19]. However, these systems cannot perform the typical post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are essential to achieving the native and functional states of eukaryotic proteins [20]. Furthermore, removing bacterial endotoxins from samples can be challenging, potentially hindering specific biotechnological applications [21]. Bacterial systems may also struggle to produce soluble proteins, as many proteins with low solubility or aggregating tendencies sequester in bacterial inclusion bodies (IBs) [22,23]. \n\nEscherichia coli (E. coli) is the most common host organism used for recombinant protein production [24]. As an expression system, E. coli is easy to manage, cost effective, grows rapidly, and typically produces large quantities of the desired recombinant protein [25]. However, the lack of PTMs characteristic of eukaryotes on expressed recombinant proteins could hamper the proper folding of structural proteins or increase aggregation propensities of hydrophobic regions, especially those residing in IDPs that lack well-defined 3D structures [7,17,26]. E. coli circumvents the toxicity associated with aggregation-prone polypeptides massively produced in its cytoplasm by inclusion body formation [22]. But sequestering expressed recombinant proteins in IBs presents additional challenges in terms of their isolation from contaminating bacterial proteins during purification.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli can produce large amounts of heterologous protein. However, it makes misfolded proteins inactive or insoluble due to the difference in proteinfolding environment and inability to perform post-translational modifications. So far, filarial proteins have been expressed in E. coli, but this system does not maintain the proteins' native properties of post-translational modification. The purification of intracellular recombinant proteins from large-scale culture of E. coli is labour intensive and expensive for commercial vaccine production. An attempt has been made earlier to express BmALT-2 in a eukaryotic expression system such as tobacco plants without large-scale process optimization [23]. The methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris has also been developed for the commercial production of heterologous proteins [24][25][26]. P. pastoris has become important for the industrial production of therapeutic proteins owing to the availability of new strains with mammalian-type glycosylation capabilities [27]. Multiple copy integration of recombinant genes in Pichia increases the expression of desired proteins in Pichia strains [28][29]. Progressive increase in the expression of proteins such as glucoamylase, lipase, green fluorescence protein, influenza hemagglutinin and human serum albumin was achieved with up to seven gene copies [30]. Proteins such as cattle tick vaccine [31], endo-b-1,4-mannase [32] and hepatitis B surface antigen [33][34] have been successfully expressed in P. pastoris. \n\nIn the present study, we cloned Bmalt-2 in P. pastoris under an AOX1 promoter with an a-signal sequence for secretory expression. The expression of BmALT-2 was optimized in flask culture. This was a new attempt to express this vaccine candidate in a eukaryotic expression system such as P. pastoris. BmALT-2 was expressed in E. coli under a T7 promoter for intracellular expression. We compared the yield of BmALT-2 in both systems along with its glycosylation followed by their reactivity with human clinical sera samples.",

Cultures of recombinant Escherichia coli with orbital mixing (OM) have an oxygen limitation negatively affecting biomass growth and recombinant-protein production. With the aim to improve mixing and aeration in shake flask cultures, we analyzed cultures subjected to OM and the novel resonant acoustic mixing (RAM) by applying acoustic energy to E. coli BL21-Gold (DE3): a producer of recombinant phospholipase A2 (rPLA2) from Micrurus laticollaris snake venom.ResultsComparing OM with RAM (200\u00a0rpm vs. 7.5g) at the same initial volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (kLa\u00a0\u2248\u00a080\u00a0h\u22121) ~69% less biomass was obtained with OM compared with RAM. We analyzed two more conditions increasing agitation until maximal speed (12.5 and 20g), and ~1.6- and ~1.4-fold greater biomass was obtained as compared with cultures at 7.5g. Moreover, the specific growth rate was statistically similar in all cultures carried out in RAM, but ~1.5-fold higher than that in cultures carried out under OM. Almost half of the glucose was consumed in OM, whereas between 80 and 100% of the glucose was consumed in RAM cultures, doubling biomass per glucose yields. Differential organic acid production was observed, but acetate production was prevented at the maximal RAM (20g). The amount of rPLA2 in both, OM and RAM cultures, represented 38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% of the insoluble protein. A smaller proportion of \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheet of purified inclusion bodies (IBs) were appreciated by ATR-FTIR from cultures carried out under OM, than those from RAM. At maximal agitation by RAM, internal E. coli localization patterns of protein aggregation changed, as well as, IBs proteolytic degradation, in conjunction with the formation of small external vesicles, although these changes did not significantly affect the cell survival response.ConclusionsIn moderate-cell-density recombinant E. coli BL21-Gold (DE3) cultures, the agitation increases in RAM (up to the maximum",

The current source of HSA is human blood plasma which is a limited and unsafe source. Thus, there\u00a0exists an indispensable need to promote non-animal derived recombinant HSA (rHSA) production. Escherichia coli is one of the most convenient hosts which had contributed to the production of more than 30% of the FDA approved recombinant pharmaceuticals. It grows rapidly and reaches high cell density using inexpensive and simple subst-rates. E. coli derived recombinant products have more economic potential as fermentation processes are cheaper compared to the other expression hosts. The major bottleneck in exploiting E. coli as a host for a disulfide-rich multidomain protein is the formation of aggregates of overexpressed protein. The majority of the expressed HSA forms inclusion bodies (more than 90% of the total expressed rHSA) in the E. coli cytosol. Recovery of functional rHSA from inclusion bodies is not preferred because it is difficult to obtain a large multidomain disulfide bond rich protein like rHSA in its functional native form. Purification is tedious, time-consuming, laborious and expensive. Because of such limitations, the E. coli host system was neglected for rHSA production for the past few decades despite its numerous advantages.ResultsIn the present work, we have exploited the capabilities of E. coli as a host for the enhanced functional production of rHSA (~\u00a060% of the total expressed rHSA in the soluble fraction). Parameters like intracellular environment, temperature, induction type, duration of induction, cell lysis conditions etc. which play an important role in enhancing the level of production of the desired protein in its native form in vivo have been optimized. We have studied the effect of assistance of different types of exogenously employed chaperone systems on the functional expression of rHSA in the E. coli host system. Different aspects of cell growth parameters during the production of rHSA in presence and absence of molecular chaperones in E. coli have also been studied.ConclusionIn the present case, we",

            "text": "After the whole-genome sequences of thousands of organisms have been well documented, overexpressing genes to get highly pure proteins for further characterization and engineering becomes an indispensable part of biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, and synthetic biology. Moreover, among the 239 US-FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved therapeutic peptides and proteins, as well as their 380 drug variants, the majority are manufactured by recombinant protein production [1]. \n\nIn both basic research and drug production, Escherichia coli is one of the most widely-used hosts to express recombinant proteins due to a number of advantages. First, it grows quickly, with a doubling time of about 20 min in rich growth media [2], which means the total time of expressing target proteins, from inoculation to cell harvest, is only a few hours in most circumstances. Second, it readily reaches a high cell density for good protein yields. Commonly, 1 to 2 g dry cell weight or 10 13 cells could be obtained from 1 L of liquid Lysogeny broth (LB) medium [2]. Third, it is cheap and easy to make growth media for E. coli such as the LB medium and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium. Fourth, the genetics of E. coli is well known, and it is convenient to remove certain genes from the genome for different purposes [3]. Fifth, it is easy to introduce heterologous genes into E. coli by plasmid transformation. Last but not least, a large number of vectors, fusion tags, and mutant strains have been developed for optimal expression of target proteins in E. coli. Several review articles have been published recently to cover these topics [4,5]. \n\nA commonly encountered problem for recombinant protein production is impeded cell growth or reduced biomass accumulation. There are two major reasons for this phenomenon. The first is the general metabolic burden, which could be explained as the competition between biomass accumulation and recombinant protein production for metabolic materials such as cellular energy, ATP, and substrates, amino acids, [6]. This competition leads to stress responses including the stringent response and RNA polymerase subunit S-mediated stress responses, which could further decrease or even inhibit cell growth [7].",

This study utilized proteomics to investigate the dynamics of parent and recombinant cells induced at different time points for RPP. The results revealed significant changes in both transcriptional and translational machinery that may have impacted the metabolic burden, growth rate of the culture and the RPP. The timing of protein synthesis induction also played a critical role in the fate of the recombinant protein within the host cell, affecting protein and product yield. The study identified significant differences in the expression of proteins involved in fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis pathways between two E. coli host strains (M15 and DH5\u237a), with the E. coli M15 strain demonstrating superior expression characteristics for the recombinant protein. Overall, these findings contribute to the knowledge base for rational strain engineering for optimized recombinant protein production.",

To express the recombinant E Protein at a large scale, the recombinant strain pET28a + E-ZIKVre was inoculated into E. coli SHuffle cells grown in a 2 L bioreactor (New Brunswick, St Albans, UK). Biomass growth was induced at an OD 600nm of 0.8 with 1 mM IPTG at 37 \u2022 C for 4 h. Cell culture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min and the pellet resuspended in wash buffer I [20 mM Tris-HCl + 1 mM EDTA + 0.5% triton x-100 + 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), pH 8.0] in the proportion of 10 mL for each 1 g of pellet. The cell suspension was sonicated for two cycles for 15 s with an interval of 30 s on ice and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in washing buffer II (20 mM Tris-HCl + 1 mM EDTA + 0.5% triton x-100 + 1 M Urea + 1 mM PMSF, pH 8.0) and the processes of sonication and centrifugation were repeated. At the end, the soluble fraction was filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter and the recombinant protein was purified by IMAC, using the Ni 2+ loaded affinity columns of the His Trap HP model (GE Healthcare) in the AKTA P\u00fcre equipment (GE Healthcare). Purification took place in steps of increasing imidazole concentration. The purification fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel and those with the highest concentration were pooled and dialyzed in a step of desalination and refolding of the recombinant protein. The concentration of E-ZIKVre protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method, using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific).",

            "text": "Genomic data, even if functionally annotated, need to be complemented by experimental testing to allow successful enzyme discovery for biotechnology. Most industrial applications rely on recombinantly produced microbial proteins. The choice of the most suitable expression system for the efficient production of the recombinant protein depends on several factors, such as the growth characteristics of the host cell, expression levels, intracellular or extracellular-segregation expression, posttranslational modifications, and biological activity (Liu et al., 2013). However, the main parameters to consider are (i) the enzyme production rate and (ii) the yield of the expression system (Liu et al., 2013). \n\nThe most commonly used expression system is the heterologous host Escherichia coli (E. coli) because of the short doubling time and its arsenal of established expression protocols, cloning methods, and a broad range of available plasmid vectors. Proteins adapted to high temperature or harsh pH are generally well-expressed in E. coli. However, E. coli has proven to be poorly suited for the expression of some proteins from (poly)extremophilic microbes, in particular from halophiles (Grotzinger et al., 2018). To be active at low water and at high salt concentrations, halophilic proteins display multiple acidic amino acid residues, generating a negative surface charge and allowing their solubility in high salt (Danson and Hough, 1997;Mevarech et al., 2000;Siglioccolo et al., 2011;Sinha and Khare, 2014). This feature, however, promotes their misfolding and aggregation under conditions of low ionic strength, as prevailing in E. coli cells (Danson and Hough, 1997;Mevarech et al., 2000;Siglioccolo et al., 2011;Sinha and Khare, 2014;Grotzinger et al., 2018). \n\nNonetheless, expression protocols to produce and purify recombinant halophilic proteins from several haloarchaea in E. coli have been developed (Salin et al., 1988;Camacho et al., 2002;Esclapez et al., 2006;De Castro et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Expression may also be impaired by a strong mRNA secondary structure near the translational start site, inadequate GC content or presence of unwanted regulatory sequences recognized by the cellular expression machinery [7]. Although different studies have analysed how genes can be designed efficiently, there is still no information about the major factors affecting expression of genes encoding reticulated peptides in heterologous hosts. \n\nEscherichia coli is a highly robust bioreactor for heterologous protein expression. Several high throughput platforms have been developed using this bacterium [8,9]. E. coli is particularly adequate to generate large libraries of recombinant proteins to apply to functional screens with biomedical and biotechnological relevance. However, production of disulphide-bonded proteins in bacteria is hampered by the lack of an effective post-translational system. Thus, in E. coli reticulated peptides are especially prone to aggregation or degradation due to possible mispairing of cysteine residues or undesirable intermolecular disulphide bonds. In addition, gene expression in bacteria is regulated by strong promoters, leading to the accumulation of recombinant proteins as insoluble aggregates or inclusion bodies. Different technologies have been developed to promote the correct oxidation of cysteine residues in recombinant proteins expressed in bacteria [10]. \n\nExporting the proteins to the E. coli oxidative periplasm is a well-established strategy although levels of recombinant protein can be limited by protein export [11]. For successful expression, two challenges must be met; (i) the peptide of interest must be maintained in a soluble state, and (ii) the correct disulphide bonds must be formed within the peptide. Recently some fusion tags displaying not only a solubilizing effect but also redox properties, such as DsbA and DsbC, were described by our group to enhance the solubility of venom peptides while promoting correct disulphide bond formation [8,11]. However, the most effective high-throughput-compatible strategy to express a wide panel of correctly folded venom peptides in E. coli remains to be established. \n\nFusion tags are indispensable tools for protein expression and purification in bacteria [12].",

Counter-intuitively, the upstream section, which is technically easy to realize, thwarts industry plans as chemostat cultivations producing recombinant proteins within microbial hosts lack major instabilities (Diers et al., 1991); shifts in the transcriptome and proteome leads to enhanced acetate production, which seems to disturb RPP and decrease the overall specific productivity (q p ) as a consequence (Peebo et al., 2015;Peebo and Neubauer, 2018). As E. coli still is a beloved workhorse for industry as well as for research (Rosano et al., 2019), we, within this review, highlight recent achievements in fed-batch processing and the first steps that have been implemented for the ongoing transition toward a continuous recombinant production system. \n\nAdditionally, the first achievements in the continuous upstream applications of E. coli; and the continuous downstream processing of intracellular proteins are discussed.",

Two flasks were used everyday, in which one of the flasks was induced at mid exponential phase to study the production profile, and the uninduced flask was used for sub-culturing after 24 hours of growth. It was observed that the production levels as measured by culture fluorescence increased rapidly for the first six hours post induction after which it gradually tapered off. From the biomass profile it was clear that the slight increase in culture fluorescence after six hours post induction was primarily due to the equivalent increase in biomass concentration.

As a consequence, and because of the accumulated know-how on E. coli genetics and physiology and the increasing number of tools for genetic engineering adapted to this bacterium, E. coli is the preferred host when attempting the production of a new protein. Also, it is still the first choice for protein production at laboratory and industrial scales for an important number of proteins, being fast growth and simple culture procedures critical issues. When searching for an ideal system for protein production, this bacterial species is clearly far from offering, in generic terms, optimal conditions for protein production and downstream. Plasmid loss and antibiotic-based maintenance, undesired chemical inducers of gene expression, plasmid/ protein-mediated metabolic burden and stress responses, lack of post-translational modifications (including the inability to form disulphide bonds), none or poor secretion, protein aggregation and proteolytic digestion, endotoxin contamination and complex downstream are among the main obstacles encountered during protein production in E. coli. In the pharmaceutical scenario, proper protein glycosylation is often requested and simplest purification procedures become highly desirable when pursuing cost-effective bioproduction. In this context, the yeast Sacharomyces cerevisae, diverse mammalian cell lines, insect cells and whole plant and animals (as transgenic systems) are being incorporated to the protein production scenario [1], and many of these products have been already approved for use as protein drugs [2]. Other (less conventional) yeast species and a more limited number of species of filamentous fungi [3], molds [4], moss [5], algae [6] and protozoa [7] are also under development as potential suppliers of recombinant proteins. The engineering of such systems could represent a promising way to the cost effective production of high quality protein versions that biotechnology and biomedical industries are steadily demanding. The potential and versatility of these platforms as protein producers or in general, as cell factories for added value products such as chemicals, amino acids or vitamins has been stressed in recent experimental reports or reviews [8][9]",

            "text": "The most common E. coli-based expression system is the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and T7 promoter controlled gene expression combination. IPTGinduction of the chromosomally encoded bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase leads to high level expression of T7 promoter-controlled genes and correspondingly high recombinant protein titers. High level recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli frequently leads to an impact on host cell metabolism detectable through growth retardation and generally known as \"metabolic burden\" [1,2]. The factors contributing to the metabolic burden are multifaceted depending on the host/vector combination and on the properties of the encoded gene with its transcription and translation products as well as on the environmental conditions encountered during the production process [3][4][5][6]. The prime reasons for the protein production related metabolic burden have been attributed to protein translation and protein folding [1,6] as well as to transcription and plasmid amplification related processes [7][8][9]. However, production of the same protein under identical conditions in the same host/vector combination but with single codon exchanges can change the metabolic perturbations considerably [10][11][12][13] suggesting that the phenomenon is even more complex than anticipated. \n\nIn this contribution we analyze the impact of T7-promoter-controlled recombinant gene expression on the host cell metabolism using two different model proteins, the difficult-to-fold human basic fibroblast growth factor (hFGF-2) with its high propensity to form inclusion bodies in E. coli and the easy-to-fold green fluorescent protein (GFP) mainly produced as soluble protein. \n\nFor both examples we generated a set of expression vectors in which either the ribosome binding site (RBS) or the promoter region or both were removed in order to analyze if the plasmid itself, the transcription of the recombinant gene, the translation into the protein product and/or protein folding related processes have an impact on host cell metabolism.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most widely used organisms for protein production. Despite decades of progress in heterologous protein expression, the folding of many proteins, especially large multi-domain eukaryotic proteins, remains a significant challenge [1]. Heterologous protein production can account for up to 50% of E. coli's total cellular protein content and thus puts strain on the native transcriptional and translational machinery [2]. Additionally, the speed of coupled transcription and translation in bacteria can be problematic for producing large eukaryotic proteins. Key protein folding factors from the native host are also absent, causing further protein folding problems. Combined, these factors can lead to misfolding and/or aggregation of the recombinant protein [3]. Over the years many strategies have been developed to improve heterologous protein production [1,4,5]. \n\nFor each recombinant protein being expressed, numerous variables influence the amount of soluble protein being produced by the cell including the protein sequence, expression vector, cell line, and expression conditions. Many of these factors may need to be optimized to achieve expression of active, soluble protein in E. coli. Upon selecting the protein of interest (POI) to be expressed, several avenues to improve protein solubility can be explored. A protein sequence can be altered by eliminating rare codons, reducing stretches of hydrophobic residues, or simply by selecting alternative homologs of the desired protein to increase chances of successful expression. [6][7][8]. Any changes to the protein sequence itself come with the risk of altering the activity of the protein. Once a protein sequence has been selected, the appropriate expression system must be designed. The promoter, origin of replication, and the inclusion of solubility tags (MBP, DsbC, SUMO, NusA, etc.) can all be altered to enhance protein expression [6,[9][10][11][12]. After designing and building the vector harboring the POI, an E. coli expression strain must be chosen. There are many strains that have been engineered for the purpose of heterologous protein expression which are reviewed here [13].",

            "text": "Even at low levels, these errors may cause an impact on the tertiary structure, premature termination of protein synthesis or amino acid misincorporation which results in low protein expression (Gustafsson et al., 2004). One strategy to bypass the issue with codon bias is to synthesize the whole human gene based on codon usage in E. coli through site-directed mutagenesis, which is currently a preferred method; however, it is limited by the high cost of production and time consumption (S\u00f8rensen and Mortensen, 2005). An alternative method that is less time consuming utilizes the co-transformation of E. coli strains with a plasmid(s) containing a gene encoding the tRNA cognate to the rare codons (Dieci et al., 2000). Increasing the copy number allows for E. coli to be manipulated to match the codon usage frequency in heterologous genes (Dieci et al., 2000). Currently, there are numerous commercial E. coli strains available that harbor plasmids containing gene sequences encoding the tRNA for rare codons, such as BL21(DE3) CodonPlus-RIL, BL21(DE3) CodonPlus-RP and Rosetta (DE3) (Baeshen et al., 2015). Another common problem associated with recombinant protein expression in E. coli involve inclusion body formation, which refers to insoluble and inactive protein aggregates (Hartley and Kane, 1988). E. coli producing recombinant proteins have the ability to assemble in cells and form conglomerates of inclusion bodies as well as result in erroneous protein folding which hinder the extraction of proteins directly from the cell leading to costly purification of proteins (Zweers et al., 2008). Inclusion bodies formed from lack of proportion between protein solubilization and aggregation can be resolved by combining the desired protein with a solubility enhancer fusion partner acting as an intrinsic chaperone in order to ensure the production of soluble recombinant proteins (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014).",

            "text": "However, these strategies suffer from adverse effects, such as enhanced proteolysis, increased soluble aggregates, growth inhibition, and lack of scalability, and they are therefore difficult to employ during commercial production. [1,4,5] rotein expression in E. coli generally takes place in either cytoplasm or periplasmic space. Reductive environment of the cytoplasm tends to express the proteins into inclusion bodies due to inefficient formation of disulfide bridges, whereas periplasmic space is the preferred choice for the soluble expression due to presence of oxidizing environment for proper folding. Antibody fragments are engineered with signal sequence for directing them to periplasmic space for proper folding. [6,7] he resultant periplasmic extract is thereby already enriched for the recombinant protein of interest, with the periplasmic containing only around 4-8% of the natural E. coli cellular proteins, making purification simpler. The periplasmic extract is also of lower volume than a whole cell lysate. In addition, periplasmic protease activity is far lower than that in the cytoplasm, reducing proteolysis of the recombinant protein product. [6] arious reports have shown that increased production of recombinant antibody fragments have soluble expression below 30 C. Lowering the cultivation temperature during induction increases the refolding of protein and reduces aggregation due to the lowered translation rate. Control of the growth temperature during fermentation is a facile method that allows stable expression of heterologous proteins. A direct consequence of temperature reduction is the partial elimination of heat shock proteases that are induced under overexpression conditions. [8] A similar transcriptional effect is achieved when a moderately strong or weak promoter is used or when a strong promoter is partially induced. [3] Low induction levels have been found to result in higher amounts of soluble protein. [9] It was concluded that the low temperature was beneficial to folding and the system was suggested as a tool for expression and correct folding of recombinant proteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli. Temperature downshift to 15 or 23 C abolished degradation of the fusion protein and the toxic phenotype associated with expression at 37 C was suppressed.",

In this system, substrates are characterized by an Nterminal cleavable signal sequence. Protein folding takes place following signal peptide cleavage and translocation into the periplasmic compartment [13,16]. Numerous recombinant proteins have been successfully produced by utilizing the aforementioned system including Thermobifida fusca cutinase [17,18], phospholipase D [19], pullulanase [20] and archeal lipase [21]. Many factors such as protein stability, function, immunogenicity, and proper folding, etc. need to be considered in recombinant protein production. Unlike the cytoplasmic protein expression, extracellular protein secretion meets many of the above-mentioned requirements for the production of recombinant proteins. Protein secretion using type I and type II systems seems to be amenable to efficient and functional production of the rPF4, considering that it is small in size, bears two disulfide bonds, and is urgently needed to be produced in large scales. Therefore, a three-in-one system was designed enabling cytoplasmic protein expression or secretion via type I or type II systems through derivative constructs, allowing us to evaluate the potentiality of each system for large scale and functional production of the rPF4 protein.",

However, the former media do not feature the pH maintenance capacity of EnPresso media, which is of special importance for long term and economic large scale production as carried out in industrial applications.\n\nHigher expression levels of correctly folded recombinant antibody fragments may be achieved by modifying the culture conditions such as temperature and oxygen transfer. For example, Ukkonen and co-workers were able to increase the cell density as well as the active yield of a recombinant enzyme expressed in E. coli by the combined use of EnPresso medium and high-aeration shake flasks [52].\n\nCharacterizations of the cytoplasmically expressed and purified sdAbs demonstrate that the vast majority of the cysteine residues are in the oxidized state and almost no sdAb dimers are detectable (Table 2 and Figure 5). These results indicate that the desired intradomain S-S bond within the sdAb monomer is formed favorably over an aberrant intermolecular disulfide between two sdAb molecules. This is most likely attributable to the rather slow kinetics of protein oxidation in the cytoplasm as already discussed by Bessette and co-workers for the oxidation of alkaline phosphatase in the cytoplasm of a comparable E. coli strain. According to the authors, at slow oxidation rates, the native conformation of the recombinant protein determines the disulfide bond formation and leads to bridging of the proper cysteine residues [33]. Interestingly, a substantial fraction of oxidized sdAbs expressed in the reducing cytoplasm of the standard expression host E. coli BL21(DE3) could be detected. Similar findings were already described in literature, e.g. J\u00e4rviluoma and colleagues purified comparable amounts of functional sdAb derivative from E. coli BL21(DE3) and from trxB gor mutant Origami(",

            "text": "The use of recombinant proteins has increased with the advent of various expression hosts that facilitate their soluble, biologically active, and large-scale production. Although mammalian expression systems possess many advantages (Wurm 2004), the bacterial expression system is considered the most efficient host compared to other organisms for the production of protein-based pharmaceuticals because of its various attributes, including high expression yield, cost-effectiveness, rapid protein expression, and proficient scale-up. E. coli is considered the most promising bacterial strain for recombinant protein production; however, it lacks machinery for posttranslational modifications that can lead to inefficient protein folding and aggregation (in the form of inclusion bodies) (Stewart et al. 1998; Bessette et al. 1999). Aggregation can affect the biological activity and stability of therapeutic proteins and is considered a risk factor for increased immunogenicity. The major challenges in the production of therapeutic proteins from inclusion bodies are isolation, washing, solubilization, and refolding procedures (Clark 2001;Middelberg 2002). Much effort is required for the development of a robust procedure for producing industrial-grade proteins that are stable, properly folded, and free from aggregation. \n\nThe co-expression of target proteins with soluble fusion partners for heterologous protein production in E. coli can lead to enhanced expression and efficient purification. Exploiting its chaperoning properties, the SUMO tag allows high-level expression through proper folding of the target protein (Malakhov et al. 2004;Butt et al. 2005). A high soluble protein expression level can be attained using this fusion system, yielding approximately 30% of the total soluble protein fraction in E. coli (Wang et al. 2010). The SUMO protease recognizes the SUMO fusion partner, facilitating precise proteolytic cleavage, thus resulting in the production of native proteins. pET SUMO has been widely used to produce many therapeutically important proteins, including human interferon alpha-2a (Bis et al. 2014), BMP-14 (Li et al. 2011), human interleukin-11 (Nguyen et al. 2018), andFGF-21 (Wang et al. 2010).",

            "text": "The bacterium Escherichia coli is widely used to produce recombinant proteins. To fold properly, many recombinant proteins have to be targeted to the E. coli periplasm, but so far the impact of the targeting pathway of a recombinant protein to the periplasm has not been extensively investigated. Here, we show that the targeting pathway of a recombinant antibody fragment has a tremendous impact on cell physiology, ultimately affecting protein production yields in the periplasm and biomass formation. This indicates that studying the targeting and secretion of proteins into the periplasm could be used to design strategies to improve recombinant protein production yields. ABSTRACT Many recombinant proteins that are produced in Escherichia coli have to be targeted to the periplasm to be functional. N-terminal signal peptides can be used to direct recombinant proteins to the membrane-embedded Sec translocon, a multiprotein complex that translocates proteins across the membrane into the periplasm. We have recently shown that the cotranslational targeting of the single-chain variable antibody fragment BL1 saturates the capacity of the Sec translocon leading to impaired translocation of secretory proteins and protein misfolding/aggregation in the cytoplasm. In turn, protein production yields and biomass formation were low. Here, we study the consequences of targeting BL1 posttranslationally to the Sec translocon. Notably, the posttranslational targeting of BL1 does not saturate the Sec translocon capacity, and both biomass formation and protein production yields are increased. Analyzing the proteome of cells producing the posttranslationally targeted BL1 indicates that the decreased synthesis of endogenous secretory and membrane proteins prevents a saturation of the Sec translocon capacity. Furthermore, in these cells, highly abundant chaperones and proteases can clear misfolded/aggregated proteins from the cytoplasm, thereby improving the fitness of these cells. Thus, the posttranslational targeting of BL1 enables its efficient production in the periplasm due to a favorable adaptation of the E. coli proteome. We envisage that our observations can be used to",

            "text": "Since early recombinant DNA times, bacteria (especially E. coli) have been the most widely used microorganisms for recombinant protein production due to genetic simplicity, fast growth rate, high cell density production and availability of a spectrum of genetic systems, among others. For production processes being efficient, foreign genes are expressed from plasmids and under the control of inducible promoters, what results into non physiological and unusually high transcription rates. Strong production of recombinant proteins can lead to a stressful situation for the host cell, with the extent of the bacterial stress response being determined by the specific properties of the recombinant protein, and by the rates of transcription and translation [104]. This fact has a clear and profoundly negative impact on productivity and probably protein quality. In addition, recombinant proteins fail, very often, to reach their native conformation when produced in bacteria [105]. This is caused by a coincidence of diverse events impairing protein folding including bottlenecks in transcription and translation, undertitration of chaperones and proteases, improper codon usage and inability of disulfide-bond formation [106,107]. Misfolded protein species usually deposit as amorphous masses of insoluble material called inclusion bodies [108], recorded as by-products of bacterial protein production processes. Inclusion bodies are mainly formed by the deposition of unfolded or partially misfolded protein species that interact through hydrophobic patches unusually exposed to the solvent and with high amino acid sequence homology [109,110]. The specificity in protein aggregation makes inclusion bodies highly pure in composition and therefore enriched in the recombinant protein itself. However, also truncated versions of the recombinant product, other plasmid-encoded proteins, but also defined host cell proteins can get entrapped within bacterial inclusion bodies [111][112][113][114][115][116]. Moreover, the presence of folding assistant proteins in inclusion bodies [117-119] confirm that specific interactions lead to entrappment of cellular proteins in these aggregates. The high purity of inclusion bodies makes them a convenient source of easily extractable protein that must be refolded in vitro by denaturing procedures, a fact that has been largely exploited for biotechnology purposes",

We investigated the effects of the process parameters temperature and specific glucose uptake rate on physiology, productivity, lysis and leakiness. Two model proteins were used, Protein A and a VHH single-domain antibody, and performance was compared to the industrial standard strain BL21(DE3).ResultsWe show that inducible growth repression in the novel E. coli strain enGenes-X-press, the effect of the metabolic burden on host physiology can be greatly reduced compared to BL21(DE3). Furthermore, in both strains, increasing temperature and specific substrate enhanced productivity and leakiness. Using the enGenes-X-press strain, extracellular Protein A and VHH titer reached up to 349 mg/g and 19.6 mg/g, respectively, comprising between 80 and 90% of total soluble product, while keeping cell lysis to a minimum. BL21(DE3) leaked 198 mg/g and 3.9 mg/g of Protein A and VHH to the medium, accounting for only 56% and 34% of total soluble product, respectively.ConclusionsWe confined the parameter space in which outer membrane leakiness can be controlled, while maintaining cell viability.

            "text": "The majority of recombinant proteins is currently produced by genetic engineering, using a variety of expression systems: recombinant prokaryotic and eukaryotic strains (e.g. cell lines and yeasts), plants or transgenic organisms. These systems are readily available, safe and provide the possibility of changing the amino acid sequence of proteins in order to better adapt the final product to its function in the body. Choosing the right expression system (host and vector) is the key step in the production of biopharmaceuticals.\n\nThe features that support the use of microorganisms for the production of recombinant proteins are their diversity, metabolic potential and the ability to adapt to different environmental conditions [12]. Bacteria are the most frequently selected microorganisms, especially Escherichia coli. The use of bacteria is cost-effective due to low production costs, easy manipulation in the genome, fast growth rate and the possibility of using many molecular methods enabling to work with them at the cellular and molecular level. Bacteria are ideal for the production of low molecular weight proteins that do not require post-translational modifications [37].\n\nBacteria of the species E. coli strains are the most frequently the microbes of choice used for a large-scale production of proteins due to the well-known genome sequence, the best-defined transcription and translation system, the large selection of promoters described, the ease of genetic manipulation and the well-known metabolic and regulation pathways [23,36]. About 30% of proteins with therapeutic properties, approved for use by the FDA, are produced in this host [3]. A high level of protein expression can be obtained in E. coli strains, by applying strong promoters. Moreover, E. coli can accumulate recombinant proteins in an amount of up to 80% of its dry matter, and is characterized by the ability to survive in various environmental conditions [15]. These bacteria multiply quickly on relatively inex pensive substrates, and the large-scale recombinant protein synthesis process in bioreactors has been well studies and described [59]. Currently, the K-12 E. coli strain and its derivatives [49,75] are routinely used in production. Despite the use of E. coli strains as the system of choice, these microorganisms are",

Products of these industries, in turn, augment the fields of medicine, diagnostics, food, nutrition, detergents, textiles, leather, paper, pulp and plastics. 1 Enzymes are synthesized by all living organisms as part of their natural metabolism, serving as biocatalysts to increase the rate of the metabolic reactions. The enzyme production rate, yield, quality and functionality are the most important factors to be considered when industrial recombinant enzymes are produced in hosts. 2 The choice of an expression system for the high-level production of recombinant enzymes depends on many factors. These include cell growth characteristics, expression levels, intracellular and extracellular expression, post-translational modifications and biological activity of the protein of interest, as well as regulatory issues in the production of the therapeutic proteins. 3 Moreover, the cost breakdown in terms of process and design and other economic considerations is required for the selection of a particular expression system. 4 Recombinant enzymes have been expressed in Escherichia coli, Bacilli (e.g., Bacillus subtilis) and lactic acid bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus lactis), filamentous fungi (e.g., Aspergillus) and yeasts (e.g., Pichia pastoris).

            "text": "In this work, we performed a comparison, based on the same initial k L a, between RAM and OM in terms of production of a recombinant protein in E. coli (7.5g and 200 rpm in 250-mL conventional Erlenmeyer glass flasks with 20% of filling volume). Moreover, we analyzed the increase of agitation by RAM, without comparison to OM because k L a could not be reproduced in OM owing to its own limitations. Furthermore, this analysis helped us to determine that even in moderate-cell-density E. coli cultures, the agitation increase in RAM (up to the maximum) was not enough to circumvent the classical oxygen limitation that happens in shake flasks. \n\nAn increase in the specific growth rate, biomass per glucose yield, and maximal biomass was obtained when E. coli BL21-Gold (DE3)-rPLA2 cells were grown with RAM in comparison with OM. Moreover, an increase in recombinant-protein concentration was achieved, but with a decrease in rPLA2 yield per biomass. Those differences are likely to be associated with oxygen transfer rate differences between OM and RAM. \n\nThe information presented here supports the idea of indirect effects of agitation by RAM causing changes in a bacterial microenvironment in terms of availability of nutrients (e.g., glucose and oxygen), causing changes in organic acid production. Furthermore, an increase on secondary structural elements of rPLA2 IBs produced by RAM was appreciated by ATR-FTIR comparing with those IBs formed in OM. Moreover, alteration of bacterial morphology was observed, e.g., in vesicle-like bodies, when maximal agitation by RAM was used. \n\nOur findings should contribute to the improvement and use of new agitation tools in shake flasks that are widely used during clone selection of recombinant-protein bioprocesses. RAM has advantages over conventional shake flask OM: an increased oxygen transfer rate and a favorable effect on biomass production. \n\nThus, additional studies are needed to elucidate the spatiotemporal regulation of processes associated with the highest agitation by RAM and bacterial-cell morphology changes.",

            "text": "BackgroundEscherichia coli is, to date, the most used microorganism for the production of recombinant proteins and biotechnologically relevant metabolites. High density cell cultures allow efficient biomass and protein yields. However, their main limitation is the accumulation of acetate as a by-product of unbalanced carbon metabolism. Increased concentrations of acetate can inhibit cellular growth and recombinant protein production, and many efforts have been made to overcome this problem. On the other hand, it is known that E. coli is able to grow on acetate as the sole carbon source, although this mechanism has never been employed for the production of recombinant proteins.ResultsBy optimization of the fermentation parameters, we have been able to develop a new acetate containing medium for the production of a recombinant protein in E. coli BL21(DE3). The medium is based on a buffering phosphate system supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract for essential nutrients and sodium acetate as additional carbon source, and it is compatible with lactose induction. We tested these culture conditions for the production of MNEI, a single chain derivative of the sweet plant protein monellin, with potential for food and beverage industries. We noticed that careful oxygenation and pH control were needed for efficient protein production. The expression method was also coupled to a faster and more efficient purification technique, which allowed us to obtain MNEI with a purity higher than 99%.ConclusionsThe method introduced represents a new strategy for the production of MNEI in E. coli BL21(DE3) with a simple and convenient process, and offers a new perspective on the capabilities of this microorganism as a biotechnological tool. The conditions employed are potentially scalable to industrial processes and require only low-priced reagents, thus dramatically lowering production costs on both laboratory and industrial scale. The yield of recombinant MNEI in these conditions was the highest to date from E. coli cultures, reaching on average ~180\u00a0mg/L of culture, versus typical LB/IPTG yields of about 30\u00a0mg/L.",

            "text": "As the host, Escherichia coli is fundamentally important in the manufacture of a wide range of biotechnological and biomedical products, owing to its easy culture, fast growth, simple fermentation and easy genetic manipulation [1]. High production of recombinant protein in E. coli is a combination of several factors such as efficiency of transcription, mRNA stability, mRNA folding, codon usage, protein solubility and folding [2]. So, the strategies for optimizing expression greatly vary from gene to gene and are often determined by trial and error. \n\nIn E. coli, tRNA levels for rare codons AGG, AGA, AUA, CCC, CUA and GGA restrain high-level production of the recombinant proteins [3]. Codon optimization could enhance soluble protein production [4,5], but sometimes it also impaired protein folding and decreased activity [6,7]. Similarly, supply of deficient tRNAs increased expression levels of recombinant proteins, but decreased soluble production of some recombinant proteins [8]. So far, obtaining well-folded recombinant proteins with high yield remains a major challenge, as yield, solubility and conformational quality of soluble proteins could not be simultaneously optimized in E. coli [9]. \n\nFusion tags are frequently applied for improving protein solubility and facilitating rapid purification by affinity chromatography. To avoid potential interference with biological activity or crystallization, the fused tags need to be removed, which is often achieved by a specific protease that recognizes and cleaves the engineered sequence between the tag and target protein [10]. Tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) has been identified as a tool, owing to its stringent recognition sequence. Production of wild type TEVp or the mutant TEVpS219V with inhibition of auto-cleavage in E. coli is limited due to its low solubility [10].",

            "text": "Recombinant protein synthesis is the process of producing proteins in prokaryotic microorganisms or eukaryotic cells using recombinant DNA technology, and it is an important branch of the emerging synthetic biology. It is because of the development of recombinant DNA technology that people can produce a large number of protein products for research or treatment. Historical experience has continuously proved that the manufacture of a key protein molecule can quickly promote the rapid development of related fields, such as recombinant human insulin and recombinant human growth factors. \n\nAt present, the biggest bottleneck of recombinant protein manufacturing technology lies in \"manufacturing\". The first difficulty is whether the target proteins can be expressed in large quantities by microorganisms or cells, and the second is how to obtain high-quality and active proteins through a series of processes and purification. Nowadays, expression systems such as E. coli, yeast, mammalian cells, insect cells, transgenic plants and transgenic animals are often used to obtain recombinant proteins. Here we take E. coli as an example to introduce the expression process of the target proteins. Firstly, the target gene was determined and suitable vectors (Table 3) and competent cells (Table 4) were selected, then the target gene was linked to an empty vector to construct a recombinant expression vector, and then the recombinant vector was transformed into host cells for culture. When OD 600 reaches 0.4-0.6, an appropriate proportion of inducer was added to induce protein expression at a certain temperature, and finally the thalli were collected for purification (Figure 2). As an expression host, E. coli has become one of the best hosts for the production of recombinant proteins due to its rapid reproduction, low costs, and rapid expression of a large amount of target proteins (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). In order to avoid the influence of lack of post-translational modification systems, inclusion body formation, frameshift mutations and endotoxin production on subsequent purification, several means such as changing host, vector and target gene sequence constantly, optimizing culture conditions, and co-expressing target proteins with molecular chaperones are adopted by researchers to increase protein solubility and expression (Gopal and Kumar, 2013).",

A very large number of proteins, their mutants and variants have been produced recombinantly, and their structure and function determined at high resolution. The availability of entire genomes has made it possible to address the protein repertoire of cells on a system-wide scale, applying high-throughput technologies [ 35 ]. Recombinant protein expression in E. coli as a prokaryotic expression host has become prevalent in molecular biology laboratories world-wide. The recombinant production of protein complexes of eukaryotic origin, however, poses a number of challenges which frequently rule out prokaryotic expression hosts. Eukaryotic proteins are often large and can exceed the size range E. coli can overproduce effi ciently (typically up to ~100 kDa). Posttranslational modifi cations and processing are commonplace in eukaryotic proteins and can be essential for activity, but are generally not supported by a prokaryotic host. The eukaryotic pro-tein folding machinery differs signifi cantly from the chaperone system in E. coli , further restricting its utility for eukaryotic protein production. Much effort has been and is being devoted to improving prokaryotic host systems for heterologous production [ 36 -38 ]. However, in many cases eukaryotic proteins and their complexes will likely require a eukaryotic expression host system for their overproduction, and if a eukaryotic system can be applied with comparable ease as E. coli based expression, then this system will likely be a preferred choice. The MultiBac system has been developed precisely with this intention to put in place such a eukaryotic expression system that supports high-level and high-quality production of eukaryotic proteins and their complexes, by using standard operating protocols (SOPs) which make its application comparably facile and routine as E. coli -based expression [ 18 , 39 -41 ].",

            "text": "RpoS levels gives rise to different mutation rates and patterns. Increasing the levels of RpoS leads to a decrease of MutS levels and an increase of DNAP IV levels and vice versa [90,92,93]. These observations are highly relevant for the isolation of strains with improved protein production characteristics, since, during their isolation, cells are exposed to stress caused by the production of proteins.\n\nApart from the above-mentioned global regulators, molecular chaperones can also affect mutagenesis during the evolution of E. coli strains [94][95][96]. Indeed, several lines of evidence indicate that molecular chaperones can actually buffer mutations that compromise protein structure and function [96,97]. It has been shown that e.g., levels of the molecular chaperones GroEL and DnaK are increased in E. coli strains with elevated mutation rates. In keeping with previous observations [97], expression of groEL mitigated the growth defects in mutated strains but had no effect on their ancestor [96]. Recently, it has been shown that RNA chaperones can also act as mutation buffers for mutations affecting RNA structure [94].\n\nE. coli as a platform for the production of recombinant proteins Escherichia coli is the most widely used host to produce recombinant proteins. However, E. coli-based protein production can be hampered at many different levels.\n\nIt has been shown that the efficient production of proteins can be hampered by e.g., inefficient binding of the mRNA encoding the target protein to the ribosome, instability of the mRNA, secondary structures in the mRNA and non-optimal codon usage. These problems can usually be solved by modifying the target gene and its flanking regions in the expression vector [2,98]. Protein production can also be hampered by metabolic stress (e.g., [99][100][101][102]). This will negatively affect biomass formation and, consequently, may result in insufficient production yields. It has been shown that biomass formation can be improved by e.g., changing culture and/or target gene expression conditions as well as metabolic engineering (e.g., [2,103]). The production of sufficient amounts of functional protein can also be hampered by",

            "text": "Background Recombinant protein production can be stressful to the host organism. The extent of stress is determined by the specific properties of the recombinant transcript and protein, by the rates of transcription and translation, and by the environmental conditions encountered during the production process. Results The impact of the transcription of the T7-promoter controlled genes encoding human basic fibroblast growth factor (hFGF-2) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) as well as the translation into the recombinant protein on the growth properties of the production host E. coli BL21(DE3) were investigated. This was done by using expression vectors where the promoter region or the ribosome binding site(s) or both were removed. It is shown that already transcription without protein translation imposes a metabolic burden on the host cell. Translation of the transcript into large amounts of a properly folded protein does not show any effect on cell growth in the best case, e.g. high-level production of GFP in Luria\u2013Bertani medium. However, translation appears to contribute to the metabolic burden if it is connected to protein folding associated problems, e.g. inclusion body formation. Conclusion The so-called metabolic burden of recombinant protein production is mainly attributed to transcription but can be enhanced through translation and those processes following translation (e.g. protein folding and degradation, heat-shock responses).",

The transfer of plasmids causes transmission of genes involved in pathogenesis and survival, to the host bacteria leading to their evolution and adaptation to diverse environmental conditions. A large number of plasmids of varying sizes have been discovered and isolated from various microorganisms. Plasmids are also valuable tools to genetically manipulate microbes for various purposes including production of recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli is the most preferred microbe for production of recombinant proteins, due to rapid growth rate, cost-effectiveness, high yield of the recombinant proteins and easy scale-up process. Several plasmids have been designed to optimize the expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli. In order to circumvent the issues of protein refolding, the codon usage in E. coli , the absence of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and low recovery of functionally active recombinant proteins, various plasmids have been designed and constructed. This chapter summarizes the recent technological advancements that have extended the use of the E. coli expression system to produce more complex proteins, including glycosylated recombinant proteins and therapeutic antibodies. production of complex glycosylated biopharmaceuticals. Wacker and colleagues discovered a novel N-linked glycosylation pathway in bacteria Campylobacter jejuni and demonstrated the successful transfer of glycosylation pathway in E. coli to generate a strain with capability to produce recombinant glycosylated proteins [ 45 ]. These various technological advancements have demonstrated that E. coli can be engineered specifically for each heterologous protein to obtain high yield of biologically active products.",

            "text": "In 1988, a patent application was filed relating to the synthesis of a DNA sequence-encoding HRP C (Chiswell and Ortlepp 1988). The HRP gene was cloned into a vector and transformed to E. coli for expression. The staining of HRP expressing colonies with N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethylphenylene diamine was performed to demonstrate the successful production of active HRP by E. coli. An anti-HRP antibody confirmed the identity of the produced peptide. In 1989, two further studies were published in which a recombinant HRP was successfully produced in E. coli (Burke et al. 1989;Ortlepp et al. 1989). In 1990, a procedure for intracellular expression of a synthetic C1A gene in E. coli and a protocol for refolding were described (Smith et al. 1990). The gene was based on a C1A sequence of 308 amino acids lacking the N-terminal signal peptide and the C-terminal propeptide (Welinder 1976;Fujiyama et al. 1988). To date, variations of this protocol for refolding of intracellularly produced HRP from inclusion bodies in E. coli are most commonly used for recombinant HRP production. Alternatively, some efforts have been taken to improve the recombinant production of active HRP in E. coli without the need for refolding. For instance, Nterminal fusion to a pelB leader peptide was performed for periplasmatic targeting to yield active enzyme (e.g. Grigorenko et al. 1999;Ryan and O'F\u00e1g\u00e1in 2008). However, the yield of holo-HRP was as low as 0.5 mg/L (Grigorenko et al. 1999). The coproduction of the DsbABCD proteins was suggested to support the correct formation of protein disulfide bonds when HRP was targeted to the periplasm of E. coli and to enhance the yield of active enzyme (Kurokawa et al. 2000). Nevertheless, it has to be pointed out that the production of secreted HRP in E. coli is still by far not suitable for biotechnological applications due to the extremely low yields.",

            "text": "In 1988, a patent application was filed relating to the synthesis of a DNA sequence-encoding HRP C (Chiswell and Ortlepp 1988). The HRP gene was cloned into a vector and transformed to E. coli for expression. The staining of HRP expressing colonies with N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethylphenylene diamine was performed to demonstrate the successful production of active HRP by E. coli. An anti-HRP antibody confirmed the identity of the produced peptide. In 1989, two further studies were published in which a recombinant HRP was successfully produced in E. coli (Burke et al. 1989;Ortlepp et al. 1989). In 1990, a procedure for intracellular expression of a synthetic C1A gene in E. coli and a protocol for refolding were described (Smith et al. 1990). The gene was based on a C1A sequence of 308 amino acids lacking the N-terminal signal peptide and the C-terminal propeptide (Welinder 1976;Fujiyama et al. 1988). To date, variations of this protocol for refolding of intracellularly produced HRP from inclusion bodies in E. coli are most commonly used for recombinant HRP production. Alternatively, some efforts have been taken to improve the recombinant production of active HRP in E. coli without the need for refolding. For instance, Nterminal fusion to a pelB leader peptide was performed for periplasmatic targeting to yield active enzyme (e.g. Grigorenko et al. 1999;Ryan and O'F\u00e1g\u00e1in 2008). However, the yield of holo-HRP was as low as 0.5 mg/L (Grigorenko et al. 1999). The coproduction of the DsbABCD proteins was suggested to support the correct formation of protein disulfide bonds when HRP was targeted to the periplasm of E. coli and to enhance the yield of active enzyme (Kurokawa et al. 2000). Nevertheless, it has to be pointed out that the production of secreted HRP in E. coli is still by far not suitable for biotechnological applications due to the extremely low yields.",

            "text": "E. coli is one of the most widely used hosts for the production of recombinant proteins. Nevertheless, choosing an optimal expression system is vital for an efficient protein production process and is often dependant on recombinant protein itself. There are many different E. coli strains and vector systems, however B strains, such as BL21, combined with pET vectors, became popular due to their efficiency in recombinant protein production [2,12]. Because of well controlled promoters, this bacterial factory enables high recombinant protein production yields (up to 50% of total cell proteins). It proved to be a very efficient system also for the production of active protein particles called non-classical IBs (ncIBs) [7,[13][14][15]. \n\nHowever, as recombinant protein production represents stress for the host cell and thus the whole cell machinery has to adapt to an over-expression of foreign protein, quality product can only be produced when the whole bioprocess is optimized [15]. \n\nTherefore in addition to the host organism, a production media should also be optimized and quality inoculum prepared for the reproducibility of the production process. Addition of some essential microelements to the basic LB media enables higher accumulation of recombinant proteins [16]. Furthermore, lowering the cultivation temperature was proven to effectively limit the in vivo aggregation of recombinant proteins [17], hence higher amounts of soluble proteins are formed [18] and the quality of the proteins is improved, including the ones trapped inside IBs [10,13,14,19,20]. Suboptimal growth temperatures slow down all the cell processes, including transcription and translation [17] thus proteins have more time to fold properly. The extended time period between synthesis and deposition, as well as rapidly exceeded solubility of target protein, results in aggregation of better folded proteins [20,21]. \n\nWhile satisfactory protein yields could be achieved in the shake flask culture, extremely high yields could only be obtained by high cell density fermentation, using finely tuned expression systems [22].",

While there is still no panacea for folding problems, nor even a rational method to identify the optimal candidate(s) for co-production with a target of interest, researchers are increasingly turning to chaperone co-production systems, available both commercially and non-commercially, as their first port of call when looking to overcome folding bottlenecks. While such a multi-chaperone screening approach can bear fruit quickly and relatively painlessly, detailed mechanistic studies of individual folding modulators remain essential in order to better understand their molecular mechanisms for greater, longer term practical benefits to the field of E. coli recombinant protein production.\n\nFinally, though the merit of co-expression of some eukaryotic chaperones in E. coli is long recognised [185,186], the immense potential of chaperones from extremophilic species has only recently begun to be mined. Successes to date with GroESL homologues from Oleispira antarctica [187] and a novel trigger factor from another psychrophile, Psychrobacter frigidicola [188], suggest that these studies may represent the beginning of a new era in chaperone-assisted production of recombinant proteins in E. coli.",

In 2010, it was reported that the proportion of recombinant genes expressed in E. coli, compared with those expressed in all hosts had remained constant, at roughly 60% per year during the 15 year period 1995-2009 (S\u00f8rensen, 2010). Table 1 includes the corresponding data for the other commonly used host cells; it shows that the proportion of recombinant genes expressed in E. coli has remained high to date and that approximately half of these genes are eukaryotic. For all other hosts, the absolute numbers are much smaller, but it is notable that the proportion of recombinant genes expressed in Pichia pastoris has steadily increased from 1995 to date, in contrast to all other host cells (Table 1). Coupled with the beginnings of a decline in usage for E. coli over the last 8 years, this could suggest that researchers are beginning to recognize the capacity of P. pastoris to produce more challenging recombinant targets. \n\nEscherichia coli stands out as the pre-eminent host cell for producing recombinant proteins in both commercial [50% of proteins; (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009;Mattanovich et al., 2012)] and research (>70% of proteins; Table 1) laboratories; it is quick and inexpensive to culture, making it ideal in many respects.

Especially proteins with N-terminal hexa-histidine (His 6 ) tag are gluconoylated [11,14]. More importantly, the highly used E. coli BL21 strain accumulates 6-PGL under aerobic conditions [15]. Thus, protein glycation has to be considered, especially for recombinant protein production in E. coli BL21 strains. \n\nIn this follow-up study [3], we investigated the impact of bioreactor-related technical failures during recombinant protein production on (1) cell physiology and productivity of E. coli BL21(DE3) and (2) the quality of two recombinant, cytosolic model proteins. The recombinant proteins were chosen to generate results for (1) proteins with a simple fold that are easily expressed to high soluble titers (like green fluorescence protein plus (GFP) [16]); and for (2) proteins with a complex fold that are prone to form intracellular IBs upon overexpression, and thus have to be expressed at low growth rates (like pyranose-2-oxidase (P2Ox) [8]).",

            "text": "Nearly 50 years have passed since the first production of recombinant DNA molecules [1] and construction of bacterial plasmids in vitro [2]. However, there is still a shortage of manufacturing capacity due to the increasing demand of diverse recombinant proteins, which requires a much better approach in the optimization of production strategies and expression vector design. Efficient strategies for the development of recombinant proteins are becoming particularly important as more applications that demand significant amounts of high-quality proteins enter the industry. Moreover, expressing multiple proteins of diverse nature is the major thrust area to fulfill the goal of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. Plasmids are extrachromosomal highly folded circular self-replicating cytoplasmic DNA elements present in most bacteria. Since the advent of genetic engineering, they have been used as molecular vehicles for recombinant genes. Plasmid-based expression is the most common option when expressing genes in prokaryotes [3]. \n\nPlasmids are commonly found in variable copy numbers in bacteria and they inflict a metabolic burden on the host cells, as they utilize the cellular resources for their replication and recombinant protein production. This metabolic burden correlates with plasmid copy number and toxicity of the inducers toward the host, which influence the bacterial growth rate as well as its products [4]. A common observation is that low-and medium-copy plasmids provide much more benefits over high-copy plasmids, such as tighter control of gene expression, the ability to replicate larger genes, and lower metabolic burden on the host cells [5]. Additionally, use of high-copy plasmid to enhance gene expression may rather lead to limitation in gene expression due to plasmid metabolic burden. Moreover, protein expression at very high levels might be harmful and, in this case, low-or medium-copy plasmids may be sufficient or even desirable [6]. For the production of periplasmatically secreted proteins, it was found out that the expression rate should be optimized rather than maximized [7]. \n\nThere are many factors related to the expression vector that influence the recombinant protein production in E. coli.",

The oligonucleotide primers CotE-349F and CotE-712R (Table 1) were used to amplify a 1119 bp fragment from a pET-28b plasmid derivative harbouring a cotE sequence codon-optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. The fragment produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was inserted into the plasmid pETYSBLLIC3C (Fogg & Wilkinson, 2008) by the In-Fusion method (Clontech Laboratories) and the products were used to transform E. coli strain XL1-Blue. Plasmids from kanamycin-resistant colonies were prepared and their 'cloned' DNA inserts were sequenced to confirm the presence and authenticity of the expected inserts. The plasmid pETYSBLLIC3C-CotEC was used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. It encodes residues 349-712 of CotE fused N-terminally to the sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLEVLFQGPA comprising a human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C-cleavable hexahistidine tag (Table 1). \n\n2.1.2.

For this, subsequent efforts have focused on the search for better expression systems, with production being attempted with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (39), Bacillus subtilis (40), mammal cell cultures (41), as well as transgenic animals (42). Unfortunately, these expression systems do not offer a production level greater than that of E. coli and therefore in most cases they are not profitable. \n\nIn our laboratory, we succeeded in producing HGH22k in E. coli by fusing it with maltose binding protein (rHGH-MBP) in 1994 (unpublished results). However, due to the fact that to recover the hormone, whether from the periplasm or the cytoplasm, complicated strategies were needed, together with the limitations of the bacterial systems for folding and processing foreign proteins correctly, we proposed searching for an expression system that allows synthesizing the protein, purifying it with greater ease while retaining functionality. Thus, the evaluation of different expression systems was started in our laboratories, considering the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris as the best (43).",

E. coli grow rapidly in culture and can achieve high-density growth in a short period of time using inexpensive media that is suitable for continuous fermentation. The yield of recombinant protein per unit volume tends to be relatively high, and can represent up to 30% of the secreted protein. Recombinant lipase expressed in E. coli can be located in the cytoplasm or secreted to the extracellular environment; it can exist in the form of inclusion bodies or expressed as a fusion protein with a FLAG epitope tag or fluorescent protein in order to avoid intracellular degradation and to simplify the subsequent separation and purification processes (Yin et al., 2007). \n\nHowever, heterologous expression in E. coli is associated with the following disadvantages: (1) when eukaryotic proteins, especially heterologous proteins containing disulfide bonds, are expressed in E. coli, inactive cytoplasmic inclusion bodies can be formed due to improper protein folding; (2) Heterologous proteins that are not secreted often do not undergo proper folding and post-translational modification; this can lead to inactivation and degradation of heterologous proteins by the host; (3) the recombinant protein of interest needs to be separated from many background E. coli proteins, resulting in the need for complex separation and purification steps; (4) the E. coli expression systems involves contamination with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which is a proinflammatory molecule in mammalian hosts that plays a key role in host-pathogen interaction with the innate immune system. Other commonly used prokaryotic expression systems include those based in B. subtilis, Ralstonia eutropha, and Pseudomonas spp. Compared with the E. coli expression system, the B. subtilis system facilitates recombinant protein secretion, and has no Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide components; as such, this system is suitable for large-scale highdensity fermentation.",

In this last situation, incomplete maturation in vivo is most likely to occur, resulting in two types of the protein: one, major with an N-terminal Met, and the other, minor without an N-terminal Met. There are already a few well documented examples of such behavior (23). These simple rules account for 60% of the proteins displaying as yet unexplained Met retention in the proteome of E. coli.\n\nE. coli is widely used for the overproduction of recombinant proteins. In the last 20 years, many instances of improperly processed N termini have been reported. This recurrent issue, known as the \"methionine problem\" (49), has not yet been resolved. MAP cleavage is thought to become limiting because the amount of overproduced protein exceeds the capacity for MAP activity. Our findings are entirely consistent with MAP activity being the limiting factor for NME in vivo (Fig.  3C). They also suggest that the conclusions drawn from studies based on overproduced reporter proteins (17,18) should be interpreted with caution. Unexpected complete or partial Met retention is known to lead to many defects, including an increase in antigenicity or a decrease in biological activity. This is true for the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase (Ntn) family of enzymes, which use both the free N terminus and the corresponding Thr, Ser, and Cys side chains in the catalytic mechanism (50) as reviewed in Ref. 51. Before envisaging the production of a protein in E. coli, particularly for heterologous proteins, the NME behavior of the protein must be correctly predicted to ensure that the expected protein, with the expected N terminus, is produced. The data reported herein is particularly useful in this respect as illustrated by the following examples concerning the production of human proteins of therapeutic interest by recombinant DNA methods",

            "text": "In E. coli, many recombinant proteins, in particular the ones containing disulfide bonds, are targeted to the periplasm (4-6). We have previously shown that the production of recombinant secretory proteins that are cotranslationally targeted to the Sec translocon severely impairs protein translocation, resulting in low protein production yields and low biomass formation (13,14). We complemented our previous work with this study, where we investigated the consequences of producing a recombinant secretory protein that is posttranslationally targeted to the Sec translocon. Surprisingly, we found that the posttranslational targeting of the scFv BL1 does not significantly hamper protein translocation, if at all. Previously, we observed that the ratio of the core Sec translocon components SecY and SecE is affected upon the production of the cotranslationally targeted scFv BL1, and we proposed that this leads to the decreased availability of functional Sec translocons, thereby lowering the capacity of the Sec translocon (14). However, here we show that accumulation levels of SecY and SecE are affected in the same way if the scFv BL1 is targeted posttranslationally to the Sec translocon and that under this condition the capacity of the Sec translocon is not saturated. Therefore, it remains elusive how the  S3 in the supplemental material). The triangles represent proteins that were significantly changed in cells producing DsbA-BL1.

Recombinant antibody fragments, e.g., single-chain variable fragments (scFv) and fragment antigen-binding (Fab), have advantages for research and testing [4], because they can be tailored using protein engineering approaches to add desired functions [5]. The small size and monomeric nature of scFvs have led to their broad application, including penetration of tumors [6] and genetic and chemical modification [7]. \n\nAntibody fragments, mainly scFvs, can be expressed in microbial systems that are more suitable for large-scale expression than mammalian cells [8,9]. The gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli is the most widely used system for production of recombinant proteins, with cytoplasmic expression yields sometimes reaching more than 10 g/L. The expression of recombinant antibody fragments in the reducing cytoplasmic compartment mostly results in non-functional aggregates. Functional antibody fragments can sometimes be recovered from cytoplasmic inclusion bodies by refolding [10,11], but this method is not applicable to a variety of antibody fragments. Many functional antibody fragments are expressed in the oxidizing environment of the periplasmic space of E. coli, which allows correct formation of disulfide bonds [12]. \n\nPeriplasmic secretion can be achieved by fusing the signal sequence for E. coli proteins onto the N-terminus of the antibody sequence, e.g., pectate lyase B (pelB) and outer membrane protein A (OmpA) [13,14]. However, the small volume of the periplasmic space limits the yield of antibody fragments. To achieve higher expression yields, further improvements are needed.

            "text": "In order to avoid the influence of lack of post-translational modification systems, inclusion body formation, frameshift mutations and endotoxin production on subsequent purification, several means such as changing host, vector and target gene sequence constantly, optimizing culture conditions, and co-expressing target proteins with molecular chaperones are adopted by researchers to increase protein solubility and expression (Gopal and Kumar, 2013). For the problems encountered in the expression process, a series of effective solutions have been developed. For example, T7RNAP expression activity (Li Z. J. et al., 2022;Chee et al., 2022) or growth decoupling system (Li et al., 2016;Darlington et al., 2018) can be specifically regulated when expressing toxic proteins, but this method is not universally applicable. Zhang et al. (2022) developed a dynamic equilibrium system that can achieve the overexpression of basic growth-related genes (rRNA, RNAP core enzyme, sigma factor), accurately predict and express key proteins using an ec_iECBD_1354 enzyme constraint model, and dynamically regulate the expression intensity of key growth-related proteins based on a load-driven promoter. This system alleviates the host burden effect, improves the production of recombinant proteins, and is helpful to efficiently develop expression hosts based on the properties of target proteins. However, the E. coli expression system lacks post-translational modifications, which is not conducive to the expression of eukaryotic proteins and many enzymes (Gupta et al., 2019), and increases the subsequent purification processes. Currently, the modified E. coli expression system can achieve the simple glycosylation modification of proteins (Gupta and Shukla, 2016), but it still needs to be further optimized. Some rare codons exist in proteincoding genes of higher animals, but these rare codons are not common in E. coli. Therefore, the expression of these proteins by E. coli expression system may lead to the reduction of target protein expression or premature termination of protein translation (Owczarek et al., 2019).",

We demonstrate that a wide variety of structurally diverse proteins can be secreted as soluble proteins when linked to the autotransporter module.

            "text": "Large-scale production of recombinant proteins that maintain immunological activity comparable (or better) to the native parasite protein is another challenge for recombinant vaccine development. Therefore, correct folding and post-translational modification (i.e., glycosylation) will depend upon the protein production host used (prokaryotic vs. eukaryotic). Recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli is a popular approach, however, production of insoluble antigens (e.g., O. ostertagi rASP1) and unsuccessful application of such proteins in vaccination trials (e.g., OPA and H-gal-GP) have been observed Cachat et al., 2010;Matthews et al., 2016). In some cases production of antigens as fusion proteins with maltose binding protein (MBP) and glutathione-Stransferase (GST) in E. coli have resulted in excellent protection during vaccination trials, as exemplified by T. solium antigens, TSOL16 and TSOL45-1A (in QuilA adjuvant) (Gauci et al., 2012). However, these results might be due to ancillary factors aside from the chosen recombinant antigen that may contribute to the observed protection conferred by native preparations. Moreover, recombinant antigen quality (such as protein solubility, folding and glycosylation) produced by protein production hosts may influence the host immune response (e.g., isoform, specificity and avidity of antibodies produced) (Matthews et al., 2016). To mitigate such outcomes recombinant protein production can be attempted in parasite-derived cells or a closely related species (e.g., C. elegans and bacculovirus-insect cell expression systems) in order to produce a protein mimicking the native molecule (Nisbet and Huntley, 2006;Roberts et al., 2013;Hussein et al., 2015;Van Oers et al., 2015). However, for some antigens like H. contortus antigen H11, protein recombinantly produced in C. elegans was unsuccessful when applied in experimental va",

            "text": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been used as an integral host for production of recombinant proteins in biopharmaceutical industry; however, production of recombinant proteins in E. coli has been associated with serious challenges. One major part of challenges is related to the fact that the overexpression of recombinant proteins in E. coli often leads to the formation of misfolded protein aggregates, called inclusion bodies (IBs), mainly because of differences in folding pathways and physicochemical conditions between expression and natural hosts [1]. Although recombinant protein production via inclusion body formation system looks attractive due to attributes such as relatively straightforward IB generation to high yields, good supply of soluble protein after applying a solubilization treatment and potential clear-cut purification of target protein to high purities, IB proteins mostly contain non-functional target proteins which need to be solubilized by denaturants (e.g., high concentrations of chaotropic agents including urea and guanidinium chloride) and then refolded to functional (bioactive) counterparts [2,3]. The solubilization of IBs protein by denaturation is a simple process; however, the successful recovery of correctly-folded bioactive proteins from completely-denatured IB proteins is often a difficult step. For instance, large-scale refolding of recombinant streptokinase (rSK) from IBs separated from E. coli cells and solubilized in 4 M urea has led to a final product with biological activity much lower than the natural protein (i.e., the protein obtained from betahemolytic streptococci) [3].\n\nDue to the inefficiency of the aforementioned route of production for most proteins prone to forming IBs, directing such proteins into the periplasmic space (the region between the cytoplasmic and outer membrane) of E. coli has been considered as a potent alternative route of production [4,5]. Nevertheless, recombinant protein expression in the periplasm has been also come across with serious problems, relevant to the stress on the bacterial cells during cultivation process in bioreactor.

            "text": "The enterobacterium E. coli is the first-choice microorganism for the production of recombinant proteins, and widely used for primarily cloning, genetic modification and small-scale production for research purposes. This is not surprising as the historical development of microbial physiology and molecular genetics was mainly based on this species, what has resulted in a steady accumulation and worldwide use of both information and molecular tools (such as engineered phages, plasmids and gene expression cassettes). However, several obstacles to the production of quality proteins limit its application as a factory for recombinant pharmaceuticals. Recombinant proteins obtained in E. coli lack the post-translational modifications (PTMs) which are present in most of eukaryotic proteins [13]. Glycosylation is the most common PTM [14] but many others, such as disulfide bond formation, phosphorylation and proteolytic processing might be essential for biological activity. PTMs play a crucial role in protein folding, processing, stability, final biological activity, tissue targeting, serum half-life and immunogenicity of the protein; therefore PMT deficient version might be insoluble, unstable or inactive. Interestingly, it is possible to attach or bind synthetic PTMs in the case of pegylated products [15] such as human growth hormone, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, interferons alfa-2a and alfa-2b, which renders versions of the protein in serum more stable than the naked product. Also, the N-linked glycosylation system of Campylobacter jejuni has been successfully transferred to E. coli, making this approach a promising possibility for the production of glycosilated proteins in this species [16]. Furthermore, through genetic engineering of the underlying DNA, the amino acid sequence of the protein can be changed to alter its ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) properties, as it has been observed for insulin (Table 1) [17].\n\nOn the other hand, the frequencies with which the different codons appear in E. coli genes are different from those occurring in human genes, and this is directly related to the abundance of specific tRNAs. Therefore, genes that contain codons",

            "text": "As one of the most widely used organisms for production of the foreign proteins of scientific, pharmaceutical, or industrial importance, E. coli expression system has several obstacles. Ready formation of inclusion bodies, low expression level and toxicity of recombinant proteins are generally the representatives of these difficulties. Fusion protein technology provides an alternative approach to solve these problems. However, removal of fusion tags from the fusion proteins is often necessitated since the fusion partners may potentially interfere with the proper structure and functions of passenger proteins [22]. Typically, for production of the pure target proteins expressed in fusion form, the fusion proteins are first separated by Ni-chelating affinity chromatography, and then dialyzed to the reaction buffer of endoproteases, cleaved in vitro by addition of the His-tagged endoproteases, and lastly subjected to the second subtractive Nichelating affinity chromatography to remove the fusion tags and endoproteases [12]. \n\nThe procedure mentioned above is routinely utilized to purify the target proteins expressed in fusion form. Nevertheless, compared with one-step Ni-chelating affinity purification of target proteins from cell lysates, this procedure is time-costing, laborious and often brings about the lower productivity in light of the protein loss during dialysis and the second step of affinity chromatography. Otherwise, these purified endoproteases used for cleavage of the fusion proteins in vitro are very expensive. In large-scale production of the target proteins expressed in fusion form, the expense for use of the endoproteases constitutes a large portion of the total production cost [9]. The challenge facing us is how to develop a convenient procedure for production of the recombinant target proteins, which need to be expressed in fusion form. \n\nWhen expressed in an unfused form in E. coli, the expression level of protein GlcK and Amy is much lower than expected for undetermined reasons. In this report, we find that fusion tag ACP can increase their expression level significantly when fused to their N-terminus. Fusion tags are widely utilized as solubility-enhancer.",

            "text": "As early as 1978, genetically modified Escherichia coli was used for the synthetic production of human insulin [1]. In the recent past, E. coli became one of the most often used prokaryotic expression systems for production of recombinant proteins. This can be attributed to the today sequenced genome [2]. E. coli allows for an easy introduction of foreign genes [2][3][4]. Furthermore, this bacterium can grow fast on low-cost media reaching high cell densities which is advantageous for economical protein production [3]. \n\nIn the literature, it is known that the production of recombinant proteins can negatively affect the microbial growth by a process often termed metabolic burden [5]. To ensure sufficient biomass concentration for protein production, the culture is often divided into a growth phase and a subsequent production phase by applying controllable expression systems. Such expression systems are externally controlled, for example by temperature shift [6], certain levels of the dissolved oxygen tension [7] or chemical inducers [4]. The most popular inducer molecule in laboratory scale is probably isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). It was shown that the time-point of induction as well as the amount of added inducing compound have significant impact on the culture [8][9][10]. Thus, it is crucial to find optimal induction parameters revealing a balanced process. Insufficient or too strong induction have to be avoided to achieve high product yield. Unfortunately, optimal induction parameters found for a specific system are not universally valid and, thus, a direct transfer from bioprocess to bioprocess is not possible. The optimal combination of induction time and inducer concentration depend besides other factors on the E. coli host strain, the expression plasmid or the recombinant gene [11][12][13]. For each bioprocess, optimization of the induction parameters has to be carried out. This results in numerous cultivations that have to be conducted. Therefore, small-scale highthroughput screening devices are often applied that allow for cost-efficient studies of parallel cultures [14].",

            "text": "As early as 1978, genetically modified Escherichia coli was used for the synthetic production of human insulin [1]. In the recent past, E. coli became one of the most often used prokaryotic expression systems for production of recombinant proteins. This can be attributed to the today sequenced genome [2]. E. coli allows for an easy introduction of foreign genes [2][3][4]. Furthermore, this bacterium can grow fast on low-cost media reaching high cell densities which is advantageous for economical protein production [3]. \n\nIn the literature, it is known that the production of recombinant proteins can negatively affect the microbial growth by a process often termed metabolic burden [5]. To ensure sufficient biomass concentration for protein production, the culture is often divided into a growth phase and a subsequent production phase by applying controllable expression systems. Such expression systems are externally controlled, for example by temperature shift [6], certain levels of the dissolved oxygen tension [7] or chemical inducers [4]. The most popular inducer molecule in laboratory scale is probably isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). It was shown that the time-point of induction as well as the amount of added inducing compound have significant impact on the culture [8][9][10]. Thus, it is crucial to find optimal induction parameters revealing a balanced process. Insufficient or too strong induction have to be avoided to achieve high product yield. Unfortunately, optimal induction parameters found for a specific system are not universally valid and, thus, a direct transfer from bioprocess to bioprocess is not possible. The optimal combination of induction time and inducer concentration depend besides other factors on the E. coli host strain, the expression plasmid or the recombinant gene [11][12][13]. For each bioprocess, optimization of the induction parameters has to be carried out. This results in numerous cultivations that have to be conducted. Therefore, small-scale highthroughput screening devices are often applied that allow for cost-efficient studies of parallel cultures [14].",

The expression vector is also a key parameter. In this study, we proposed to test four E. coli expression strains, M15 and IqExpress strains, based on the T5 system with pQE30 expression vector and BL21 DE3 and Arctic Express DE3 based on the T7 system with pET19b expression vector. \n\nBesides the fact that the improvements depend on the genetic context of the recombinant cell and are protein-dependent, culture parameters that influence protein expression and folding must be systematically considered. The high concentration of nascent polypeptide chains in a recombinant cell promotes aggregation reactions at the expense of the productive reaction to the native state. The production of large amounts of the incorrectly folded protein, generating aggregates of proteins in a mostly biologically inactive state known as inclusion bodies, is the main trouble to the production of heterologous",

            "text": "Proteins are essential cellular components and play many roles in cell physiology, such as scaffolding cell structures, catalysis, signaling, transport and gene expression regulation. Investigating and assessing these roles often requires a deep understanding of protein structure and activity which demands sufficient quantities of the purified protein, which in many cases needs to be produced heterologously (Bill, 2014). Apart from fundamental research, recombinant protein production also represents a multi-billion dollar market , due to the use of proteins as biopharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes, e.g. anti-TNF and cancer antibodies, insulin analogs and proteases among others, constituting about 50-60% of the total market (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Huang et al., 2014).\n\nEscherichia coli is predominantly used as host for commercial production and research (Mattanovich et al., 2012), mainly because it is easy to cultivate and manipulate, due to the large number of molecular tools and genetic information available and, more importantly, due to the fact that the recombinant protein fraction in this organism can reach up to 50% of the dry biomass (Porro et al., 2011). There are, however, important drawbacks of using E. coli as a production platform for proteins, for example increased downstream processing costs due to the formation of inclusion bodies (Sorensen, 2010) and lack of correct posttranslational modifications of eukaryal proteins (Ferrer-Miralles et al., 2009). As an alternative, yeasts including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are being increasingly used as the preferred platform for protein production. Yeasts have all the advantages of a microbial system (easy of manipulation and cultivation) and possess eukaryal posttranslational machinery (Bill, 2014). Furthermore, the recombinant proteins can be secreted to the extracellular medium, thus facilitating subsequent purification (Nielsen, 2013).\n\nHowever, one of the limitations of using yeast as a production platform is the burden that secreting proteins at higher rates may represent for cell metabolism, especially for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), since protein folding is a very crucial step of the secretory pathway: a correct folding determines if the newly synthesized",

There are marked differences in codon usage between E. coli and humans. \n\nCodons that are found to be very common in human and other eukaryotic genes are very rare \n\nPlasmids for Optimizing Expression of Recombinant Proteins in E. coli 5 in E. coli. Presence of rare codons in heterologous genes can lead to errors in translation and cause low expression levels of recombinant protein in E. coli. The presence of rare codons in heterologous genes might cause translational errors due to ribosomal stalling at these positions. These translational errors include frame-shift mutations, amino acid substitutions or premature translation termination [22]. Some of the rare codons in E. coli that cause problems in recombinant proteins are AGA, CGG, CGA, AGG (arginine), AAG (lysine), GGA (glycine), CUA (leucine), AUA (isoleucine) and CCC (proline) [23]. In E. coli, CGG is a rare arginine codon which occurs at a frequency of 0.54%. McNulty and colleagues demonstrated that the presence of large number of rare arginine codon CGG in p27 protease domain from Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2) resulted in the synthesis of recombinant protein of molecular weight that was 3 kDa higher than the actual molecular weight when expressed in E. coli [22]. The resultant increase in molecular weight was found to be due to the +1 frame-shift mutation at one of the CGG codons at the C-terminus of the viral protein. Besides, glutamine residues were misincorporated instead of arginine due to misreading of CGG as CAG [22]. \n\nVarious strategies have been designed to circumvent the problem of codon bias in E. coli for enhancing the production of authentic, biologically active heterologous recombinant proteins.",

The medium was supplemented with 50 \u00b5g mL \u22121 ampicillin and 34 \u00b5g mL \u22121 of chloramphenicol to grow E. coli BL21 within desired recombinant vector. IPTG (isopropyl \u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside) was subsequently supplemented at concentration of 0.5 mM to induce the expression of target protein after achieving the absorbance of 0.4-0.5 at 600 nm of the cultured cells. Afterward, the culture was maintained at 4 \u2022 C for 30 min. The cells were further taken in incubation for large-scale recombinant EgGPXL-2, -3, -4 production at 15 \u2022 C for 20 h. Following completion of overnight incubation of culture, it was collected through centrifugation at 20,000\u00d7 g for 10 min (4 \u2022 C). The collected cells were first resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and disrupted by sonication for 5 min (10 kHz, using 30 s strokes with 30 s intervals) for purification. Consequently, the lysed cells were taken in centrifugation to obtain the recombinant protein lysate using 20,000\u00d7 g, 15 min (4 \u2022 C) centrifugation condition. TALON Metal Affinity resin (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used for purification of target recombinant Hexa-His-tagged protein and subsequently stored at 4 \u2022 C for further use. Refrigeration temperature was strictly maintained during protein purification. Each fraction obtained from protein purification was subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE to check the expression and presence of the purified recombinant protein. The purified protein was quantified by Bradford protein assay [28].",

            "text": "Expression of heterologous and autologous genes is a routine method employed in several biotechnological fields such as metabolic engineering, in vivo biocatalysis, or in recombinant proteins or other high-value metabolite production (Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2016;Badenhorst and Bornscheuer, 2018;McCarty and Ledesma-Amaro, 2019). Thus, the strategy followed in a biotechnological process usually includes the expression of enzymes or complete biosynthetic pathways necessary to achieve the compound of interest (Assenberg et al., 2013;Gallego Jara et al., 2015). E. coli has traditionally been, and still is, the most used host microorganism in biotechnology. E. coli has several advantages to be employed to express heterologous proteins such as fast growth, variety of culture broths, or high number of biology tools designed to obtain genetical modifications (Huang et al., 2012;Blount, 2015;Vargas-Maya and Franco, 2017;Chandran Sathesh-Prabu and Lee, 2018;Xu et al., 2020). \n\nThe expression of recombinant proteins is influenced by both physical and transcriptional conditions, such as temperature, shaking, promoter strength, or number of copies of the expression vector used (Aristidou et al., 1999;Balzer et al., 2013;Niu et al., 2014;Bernal et al., 2016;Lozano Terol et al., 2019;Wu et al., 2019). In spite of the advantages, some problems are also associated with the production of recombinant proteins in E. coli: the formation of inclusion bodies, the inefficient protein translocation, or the metabolic burden (Mairhofer et al., 2013;Baig et al., 2014;Marschall et al., 2017). Some current strategies developed to solve these drawbacks are focused on supplementation of essential precursors or use of co-cultures (Gurramkonda et al., 2018;Slouka et al., 2019;Chiang et al., 2020;Kumar et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020).",

There are few reports of co-production of molecular chaperones with membrane proteins in E. coli due to the paucity of reports of recombinant membrane protein produced successfully in the host in general. Amongst these, the expression and solubility of the HrcA repressor from Helicobacter pylori were dramatically increased upon induction of heat shock proteins by elevated temperature [109] while overexpression of GroESL led to significantly improved expression of the human liver cytochrome P450 2B6 [110] and a DnaK-DnaJ combination reduced inclusion body formation by the CorA bacterial magnesium transporter [66]. While the present body of literature does not make a particularly compelling case for adding chaperones to membrane protein production experiments in E. coli, screening of their influence in such set-ups is clearly advisable due to the simplicity and low cost of the approach, and their potential benefits on the passage through the cytoplasm and/or periplasm of these often highly hydrophobic and difficult-to-express proteins.",

The importance of Escherichia coli toward the production of inexpensive rapid tests will be explained in this review paper. Details about the different strains of E. coli, the strategies used for the insertion and the expression of recombinant proteins, and the challenges that still exist are provided. Afterward, the importance of the expression scale and culture parameters in the final yield of the antibodies are examined. From this analysis, it appears that for good yields of recombinant antibodies, aside from appropriate gene transfer and expression, the culturing parameters are of paramount importance. Larger scale production is more favorable, mainly due to the higher cell densities that can be achieved. Yields of functional Fab fragments in the range of 10\u201320\u2009mg/L are considered good in shake flasks, whereas in bioreactors can be up to 1\u20132\u2009g/L.

FimH is an adhesin positioned on the fimbrial tip which binds to mannosylated proteins on the urinary tract epithelium via its lectin domain (FimHLD). FimH is of interest as a target of vaccines to prevent urinary tract infections (UTI). Previously, difficulties in obtaining purified recombinant FimH from E. coli along with the poor inherent immunogenicity of FimH have hindered the development of effective FimH vaccine candidates. To overcome these challenges, we have devised a novel production method using mammalian cells to produce high yields of homogeneous FimH protein with comparable biochemical and immunogenic properties to FimH produced in E. coli. Next, to optimize conformational stability and immunogenicity of FimH, we used a computational approach to design improved FimH mutants and evaluated their biophysical and biochemical properties, and murine immunogenicity. This approach identified a highly immunogenic FimH variant (FimH-DSG TM) that is produced at high yields in mammalian cells. By x-ray crystallography, we confirmed that the stabilized structure of the FimHLD in FimH-DSG TM is similar to native FimH on the fimbrial tip. Characterization of monoclonal antibodies elicited by FimH-DSG TM that can block bacterial binding to mannosylated surfaces identified 4 non-overlapping binding sites whose epitopes were mapped via a combinatorial cryogenic electron microscopy approach. Novel inhibitory epitopes in the lectin binding FimH were identified, revealing diverse functional mechanisms of FimH-directed antibodies with relevance to FimH-targeted UTI vaccines. Author summary Escherichia coli is the primary cause of urinary tract infections. Adherence to uroepithelial surfaces is mediated by the pilus adhesin protein FimH, which is of interest as a vaccine candidate. We developed a method for producing recombinant FimH at bioprocess scale, previously a barrier to commercial development. Structure-based design and screening was used to identify a novel FimH vaccine candidate with improved stability and immunogenicity in mice. Structure of this full-length protein was determined by X-ray crystallography and shown to closely resemble the pilus adhesin present in its native form on the bacterial surface. Binding sites of biologically active FimH monoclonal antibodies were determined by X-ray crystallography or by cryo-electron microscopy, providing insights into mechanisms by which antibodies block binding of the bacteria to urinary tract receptors.

Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris are two of the most popular expression systems for producing isotope-enriched, recombinant protein samples for NMR investigations.

The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs (Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007). To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required.

This set of techniques was strengthened even further later on with the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction and allowed scientists to explore and understand essential life processes in an easy and straightforward way. It also marked the birth of the modern biotech industry. At that time, it was shown that eukaryotic DNA could be propagated in Escherichia coli (Morrow et al., 1974) and functional products could be synthesized from heterologous genes cloned in bacterial plasmids (Ratzkin and Carbon, 1977; Vapnek et al., 1977). After these successful cases, it was soon realized that the potential applications of these techniques were almost limitless. In fact, US patent 4,237,224 granted to Cohen and Boyer (1980) claimed to commercial ownership of the methodology for cloning virtually all possible DNAs in all possible vectors. While cloning any gene in any given vector is feasible, obtaining a functional product from its expression is not that simple. \n \nIn this series of articles, the authors describe the methods and technologies available for producing recombinant proteins in different microbes. They also introduce and discuss recent advances that attempt to tackle common pitfalls in the process. Taken together, this E-book will be of great importance for those entering the field as well as for experienced researchers that are looking for an update in the state of the art. \n \nBefore proceeding any further, it is necessary to clarify an important aspect of this topic. In biology, the universal accepted definition of \u201cexpression\u201d is \u201cproduction of an observable phenotype by a gene\u2014usually by directing the synthesis of a protein\u201d (Alberts et al., 2002). By this definition, the term \u201cgene expression\u201d is correct while \u201cprotein expression\u201d is basically lab jargon. We do think that correct usage of scientific language is of great importance, yet in this particular case, the usage of \u201cprotein expression\u201d in the scientific community is so pervasive that readers will immediately understand what we are talking about. So, considering that \u201cprotein expression\u201d found its way into journal names, book names and high-impact reviews (Sorensen and Mortensen, 2005) and research papers (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003) (>1800 citations in Scopus) we and other authors have used it interchangeably with more correct terms like protein production or protein synthesis.",
                    "[6392822 | Marco et al. | 2007 | Citations: 288]": "BackgroundThe overproduction of recombinant proteins in host cells often leads to their misfolding and aggregation. Previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful. We now assessed the effects of combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol on the solubility of recombinant proteins.ResultsA two-step procedure was found to show the strongest enhancement of solubility. In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.ConclusionThe engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology."

The aim of this study was to compare the soluble expression level of GM-CSF in three E. coli strains, BL21 (DE3), SHuffle\u00ae T7 and Origami\u2122 2 (DE3). Experimental approach: The effect of different temperatures and inducer concentrations on soluble expression of GM-CSF was evaluated. The soluble GM-CSF was subjected to endotoxin removal and purification using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography, ultrafiltration. The biological activity of produced GM-CSF was evaluated based on its growth promotion effect on TF-1 cell lines by MTT assay method. Findings / Results: A significant improvement of the soluble yield of GM-CSF (about 30% of GM-CSF was expressed as soluble proteins) was observed when protein expression was induced at 30 \u00b0C with 0.5 mM isopropyl \u03b2- d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in E. coli Shuffle T7. The soluble GM-CSF with a high purity up to 95 % and specific activity of 1.25 \u00d7 104 IU/\u03bcg was obtained. Conclusion and implications: The proposed strategy here can be used to improve the soluble expression of other hard-to-express proteins with similar structural properties (i.e., containing disulfide binds or cysteine)."

However, limitations have been observed in large-scale and microplate production, including toxicity, cost and culture monitoring. Here, we report the novel SILEX (Self-InducibLe Expression) system, which is a convenient, cost-effective alternative that does not require cell density monitoring or IPTG induction. We demonstrate the broad utility of the presented self-inducible method for a panel of diverse proteins produced in large amounts. The SILEX system is compatible with all classical culture media and growth temperatures and allows protein expression modulation. Importantly, the SILEX system is proven to be efficient for protein expression screening on a microplate scale."

Few genomic sites are routinely used, however, for efficient integration and expression of heterologous genes, especially in nonmodel hosts. Here, a data-guided framework for informing suitable integration sites for heterologous genes based on ATAC-seq was developed in the nonmodel yeast Komagataella phaffii. Single-copy GFP constructs were integrated using CRISPR/Cas9 into 38 intergenic regions (IGRs) to evaluate the effects of IGR size, intensity of ATAC-seq peaks, and orientation and expression of adjacent genes. Only the intensity of accessibility peaks was observed to have a significant effect, with higher expression observed from IGRs with low- to moderate-intensity peaks than from high-intensity peaks. This effect diminished for tandem, multicopy integrations, suggesting that the additional copies of exogenous sequence buffered the transcriptional unit of the transgene against effects from endogenous sequence context. The approach developed from these results should provide a basis for nominating suitable IGRs in other eukaryotic hosts from an annotated genome and ATAC-seq data."

Aggregated proteins, known as inclusion bodies, are generally misfolded and physiologically inactive [27]. In many cases, solubilization and refolding of insoluble proteins are time-consuming and labor-intensive procedures that add to the complexity of downstream processing [28,29]. Several methods have been developed to address these challenges to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins. For instance, an efficient and practical method is to modify culture conditions [30]. According to the accumulated evidence to accelerate the expression of target genes and develop solubility in E. coli, remarkable methods have been developed. Four substantial factors highly affect the production of soluble protein: timing of induction, inducer concentration, temperature, and duration of induction.",

Refolding of inclusion body proteins into bioactive forms is cumbersome, results in poor recovery and accounts for the major cost in production of recombinant proteins from E. coli. With new information available on the structure and function of protein aggregates in bacterial inclusion bodies, it has been possible to develop improved solubilization and refolding procedures for higher recovery of bioactive protein. Inclusion bodies are formed from partially folded protein intermediates and are composed of aggregates of mostly single types of polypeptide. This helps to isolate and purify the protein aggregates to homogeneity before solubilization and refolding. Proteins inside inclusion body aggregates have native-like secondary structures. It is assumed that restoration of this native-like secondary structure using mild solubilization conditions will help in improved recovery of bioactive protein in comparison to solubilization using a high concentration of chaotropic agent. Analysis of the dominant forces causing aggregation during inclusion body formation provides information to develop suitable mild solubilization procedures for inclusion body proteins. Refolding from such solubilized protein will be very high due to restoration of native-like secondary structure. Human growth hormone inclusion bodies were purified to homogeneity from E. coli cells before solubilization and refolding. Pure inclusion bodies were solubilized at alkaline pH in the presence of 2 M urea solution. The solubilized proteins were refolded using a pulsatile renaturation process and subsequently purified using chromatographic procedures. More than 40% of the inclusion body proteins could be refolded back to the bioactive native conformation. Mild solubilization is thus the key for high recovery of bioactive protein from inclusion bodies.",

Several toxins of this bacteria are components of different candidate vaccines, and have been considered as important factors in pathogenesis of NE. A fusion subunit protein composed of immunodominant segments of NetB, Alpha-toxin and metallopeptidase proteins (NAM) was designed. The high level production of NE subunit vaccine candidate is important for the in vitro and in vivo evaluation and later to decrease the production costs. Therefore, the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used for optimizing E. coli culture condition. To this end, induction conditions including cell optical density prior induction (OD600nm), IPTG concentration, post-induction temperature and time were modified. The statistical analysis revealed that all variables except IPTG had significant effects on production and solubility of rNAM. A 7.39 fold increase in production of soluble rNAM was achieved when the post induction temperature, IPTG concentration, the pre-induction OD and time were 19 oC, 0.55 mM, 0.8 respectively in 8 h after induction. Our study indicated that the RSM method is a simple and superior strategy for protein expression improvement which is considered as a major limitation in production of vaccine candidate and other recombinant proteins using different hosts. INTRODUCTION Necrotic enteritis (NE) is caused by clostridium perfringens type A, an anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria. Several virulence factors are involved in disease induction in chickens. In recent years protein based subunit vaccines have provided a safe and most attractive technology for protection against multifactorial disease like NE [10, 34]. Previous studies demonstrated that immunizing ability for protection against NE was associated with several virulence factors. The most important of these virulence factors are phospholipase C known as Alpha-toxin, \u03b2-pore forming toxin, NetB, and a zinc metallopeptidase protein [7,8, 28]. Utilizing a fusion of non toxic variants of these proteins as a recombinant subunit vaccine candidate could enhance protective immunity [31, 6].

Aggregated proteins, known as inclusion bodies, are generally misfolded and physiologically inactive [27]. In many cases, solubilization and refolding of insoluble proteins are time-consuming and labor-intensive procedures that add to the complexity of downstream processing [28,29]. Several methods have been developed to address these challenges to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins. For instance, an efficient and practical method is to modify culture conditions [30]. According to the accumulated evidence to accelerate the expression of target genes and develop solubility in E. coli, remarkable methods have been developed. Four substantial factors highly affect the production of soluble protein: timing of induction, inducer concentration, temperature, and duration of induction."

Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli is the popular choice, especially within the research community. While there is an ever growing demand for new expression strains, few strains are dedicated to post-translational modifications, such as disulfide bond formation. Thus, new protein expression strains must be engineered and the parameters involved in producing disulfide bonded proteins must be understood.ResultsWe have engineered a new E. coli protein expression strain named SHuffle, dedicated to producing correctly disulfide bonded active proteins to high yields within its cytoplasm. This strain is based on the trxB gor suppressor strain SMG96 where its cytoplasmic reductive pathways have been diminished, allowing for the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm. We have further engineered a major improvement by integrating into its chromosome a signal sequenceless disulfide bond isomerase, DsbC. We probed the redox state of DsbC in the oxidizing cytoplasm and evaluated its role in assisting the formation of correctly folded multi-disulfide bonded proteins. We optimized protein expression conditions, varying temperature, induction conditions, strain background and the co-expression of various helper proteins. We found that temperature has the biggest impact on improving yields and that the E. coli B strain background of this strain was superior to the K12 version. We also discovered that auto-expression of substrate target proteins using this strain resulted in higher yields of active pure protein. Finally, we found that co-expression of mutant thioredoxins and PDI homologs improved yields of various substrate proteins.ConclusionsThis work is the first extensive characterization of the trxB gor suppressor strain. The results presented should help researchers design the appropriate protein expression conditions using SHuffle strains.",

This phenomenon occurs when the codon usage of the mRNA coding for the foreign protein differs from that of the bacterium. The ribosome pauses upon encountering a rare codon and may detach from the mRNA, thereby the yield of protein expression is reduced. Several bacterial strains have been engineered to overcome this effect. However, the increased rate of translation may lead to protein misfolding and insolubilization. In order to prove this assumption, the solubility of several recombinant proteins from plants was studied in a codon bias-adjusted E. coli strain.ResultsThe expression of eight plant proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS and BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-pRIL was systematically studied. The CodonPlus strain contains extra copies of the argU, ileY, and leuW tRNA genes, which encode tRNAs that recognize the codons AGA/AGG, AUA and CUA, respectively (RIL codons). The level of expression and solubility of the recombinant proteins were analyzed by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. We found that for all proteins the solubility was at least 25% in the BL21(DE3)-pLysS strain. However, when expressed in the BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-pRIL strain, proteins having more than 5% of amino acids coded by RIL codons were localized mainly in the insoluble fraction. Also, their expression caused retarded growth and low cell yield in the codon bias-adjusted strain at all temperatures tested. On the contrary, the solubility of proteins containing less than 5% of amino acids coded by RIL codons remained unchanged in both strains and their expression caused no effect on cell growth.ConclusionOur results show that the expression of heterologous proteins coded by high RIL codon content coding sequences in a codon bias-adjusted strain is detrimental for their solubility. Our data support the hypothesis that the possible elimination of translational pauses that increase translation rate leads to protein misfolding and aggregation. This stresses the importance of strain selection according to codon content in any scheme where a large amount of biologically active product is desirable.",

Efficacy studies of PEDF in animal models are limited because of poor heterologous protein yields. Here, we redesigned the human PEDF gene to preferentially match codon frequencies of E coli without altering the amino acid sequence. Following de novo synthesis, codon optimized PEDF (coPEDF) and the wtPEDF genes were cloned into pET32a containing a 5\u2032 thioredoxin sequence (Trx) and the recombinant Trx-coPEDF or Trx-wtPEDF fusion constructs expressed in native and two tRNA augmented E coli hosts - BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL and BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RP, carrying extra copies of tRNAarg,ile,leu and tRNAarg,pro genes , respectively. Trx-PEDF fusion proteins were isolated using Ni-NTA metal affinity chromatography and PEDF purified after cleavage with factor X\u03b1. Protein purity and identity were confirmed by western blot, MALDI-TOF, and UV/CD spectral analyses. Expression of the synthetic gene was \u223c3.4 fold greater (212.7 mg/g; 62.1 mg/g wet cells) and purified yields \u223c4 fold greater (41.1 mg/g; 11.3 mg/g wet cell) than wtPEDF in the native host. A small increase in expression of both genes was observed in hosts supplemented with rare tRNA genes compared to the native host but expression of coPEDF was \u223c3 fold greater than wtPEDF in both native and codon-bias-adjusted E coli strains. \u0394Gs at \u22123 to +50 of the Trx site of both fusion genes were \u22123.9 kcal/mol. Functionally, coPEDF was equally as effective as wtPEDF in reducing oxidative stress, promoting neurite outgrowth, and blocking endothelial tube formation. These findings suggest that while rare tRNA augmentation and mRNA folding energies can significantly contribute to increased protein expression, preferred codon usage, in this case, is advantageous to translational efficiency of biologically active PEDF in E coli. This strategy will undoubtedly fast forward studies to validate therapeutic utility of PEDF in vivo.",

Results: A total of 342 antibody codon variants were identified, differing significantly in solubility and functionality while retaining the identical original amino acid sequence. Conclusion: Genetic codes control protein synthesis and folding. \u201cCodon-preferred\u201d DNA template(s) can be generated by functional screening. Significance: Protein properties can be considerably altered by synonymous codons without substituting amino acids. Universal genetic codes are degenerated with 61 codons specifying 20 amino acids, thus creating synonymous codons for a single amino acid. Synonymous codons have been shown to affect protein properties in a given organism. To address this issue and explore how Escherichia coli selects its \u201ccodon-preferred\u201d DNA template(s) for synthesis of proteins with required properties, we have designed synonymous codon libraries based on an antibody (scFv) sequence and carried out bacterial expression and screening for variants with altered properties. As a result, 342 codon variants have been identified, differing significantly in protein solubility and functionality while retaining the identical original amino acid sequence. The soluble expression level varied from completely insoluble aggregates to a soluble yield of \u223c2.5 mg/liter, whereas the antigen-binding activity changed from no binding at all to a binding affinity of > 10\u22128 m. Not only does our work demonstrate the involvement of genetic codes in regulating protein synthesis and folding but it also provides a novel screening strategy for producing improved proteins without the need to substitute amino acids."

The production levels of recombinant proteins synthesized in E. coli are no longer pointed as a limitation for the success of the overall process, but care should be taken with the protein solubility, which is still a major bottleneck in the field.\n\ncomplex proteins due to the lack of sophisticated machinery to perform posttranslational modifications, resulting in poor solubility of the protein of interest that are produced as inclusion bodies (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Kamionka, 2011). Previous studies (Bussow et al., 2005;Pacheco et al., 2012) reported that up to 75% of human proteins are successfully expressed in E. coli but only 25% are produced in an active soluble form using this host system. Other problems found within this host system include proper formation of disulfide bonds, absence of chaperones for the correct folding, and the miss-match between the codon usage of the host cell and the protein of interest (Terpe, 2006;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Pacheco et al., 2012).

It will set the context for why E. coli is widely used and the general scope of challenges. A synthesis format is appropriate to provide a coherent overview.\n\n2. \"Protein Folding and Inclusion Body Formation\": This appears to be a major challenge mentioned across numerous quotes. This should be a synthesis section because the content describes interconnected processes and mechanisms that need to be explained in a cohesive manner.\n\n3. \"Metabolic and Physiological Limitations\": Several quotes mention metabolic burden, acetate formation, and physiological stress. This should be a synthesis section as these are interconnected biological processes that affect protein production.\n\n4. \"Codon Usage and Translation Issues\": Multiple quotes discuss challenges related to codon bias and translation efficiency. A synthesis format is appropriate to explain these molecular mechanisms.\n\n5. \"Lack of Post-Translational Modifications\": This is a frequently mentioned limitation of E. coli. A synthesis format is best to explain these limitations comprehensively.\n\n6. \"Strategies to Overcome Expression Challenges\": Many quotes mention various approaches to address the challenges. This section would work well as a list format to clearly enumerate the different strategies available to researchers.\n\n7. \"Secretion and Localization Challenges\": Several quotes discuss issues with protein secretion and targeting.

                            "Escherichia coli is by far the most widely used host for the production of recombinant proteins. There are many protocols, a great number of expression plasmids, and engineered strains that can be used to obtain high protein yields (Rosano et al., 2014). Despite numerous advantages, biotechnological potential of E. coli also has its limitations including the risk of protein aggregation and accumulation of acetate as by-product. Upon high-level production, recombinant proteins may aggregate and form inclusion bodies (IBs) in E. coli cells. Formation of IBs is a complex and dynamic process affected by various factors involving molecular chaperones that control protein folding. The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs (Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007). To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required. Coexpression of molecular chaperones or lower production rate can prevent aggregation and facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins (Rosano et al., 2014)(Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007)."

                            "BackgroundThe overproduction of recombinant proteins in host cells often leads to their misfolding and aggregation. Previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful. We now assessed the effects of combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol on the solubility of recombinant proteins.ResultsA two-step procedure was found to show the strongest enhancement of solubility. In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.ConclusionThe engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology."

Here, we report the novel SILEX (Self-InducibLe Expression) system, which is a convenient, cost-effective alternative that does not require cell density monitoring or IPTG induction. We demonstrate the broad utility of the presented self-inducible method for a panel of diverse proteins produced in large amounts. The SILEX system is compatible with all classical culture media and growth temperatures and allows protein expression modulation. Importantly, the SILEX system is proven to be efficient for protein expression screening on a microplate scale."

Various strategies have been employed for the development of E. coli strains which are able to efficiently produce recombinant proteins [1,2]. Extracellular production of recombinant proteins has advantages over secretion into the periplasm [2].

                            "Escherichia coli is by far the most widely used host for the production of recombinant proteins. There are many protocols, a great number of expression plasmids, and engineered strains that can be used to obtain high protein yields (Rosano et al., 2014). Despite numerous advantages, biotechnological potential of E. coli also has its limitations including the risk of protein aggregation and accumulation of acetate as by-product. Upon high-level production, recombinant proteins may aggregate and form inclusion bodies (IBs) in E. coli cells. Formation of IBs is a complex and dynamic process affected by various factors involving molecular chaperones that control protein folding. The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs (Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007). To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required. Coexpression of molecular chaperones or lower production rate can prevent aggregation and facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins (Rosano et al., 2014)(Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007)."

                            "BackgroundThe overproduction of recombinant proteins in host cells often leads to their misfolding and aggregation. Previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful. We now assessed the effects of combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol on the solubility of recombinant proteins.ResultsA two-step procedure was found to show the strongest enhancement of solubility. In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.ConclusionThe engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology."

The production levels of recombinant proteins synthesized in E. coli are no longer pointed as a limitation for the success of the overall process, but care should be taken with the protein solubility, which is still a major bottleneck in the field.\n\ncomplex proteins due to the lack of sophisticated machinery to perform posttranslational modifications, resulting in poor solubility of the protein of interest that are produced as inclusion bodies (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Kamionka, 2011). Previous studies (Bussow et al., 2005;Pacheco et al., 2012) reported that up to 75% of human proteins are successfully expressed in E. coli but only 25% are produced in an active soluble form using this host system. Other problems found within this host system include proper formation of disulfide bonds, absence of chaperones for the correct folding, and the miss-match between the codon usage of the host cell and the protein of interest (Terpe, 2006;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Pacheco et al., 2012).

Despite decades of progress in heterologous protein expression, the folding of many proteins, especially large multi-domain eukaryotic proteins, remains a significant challenge (Sahdev et al., 2007). Heterologous protein production can account for up to 50% of E. coli's total cellular protein content and thus puts strain on the native transcriptional and translational machinery (Rosano et al., 2014). Additionally, the speed of coupled transcription and translation in bacteria can be problematic for producing large eukaryotic proteins. Key protein folding factors from the native host are also absent, causing further protein folding problems. Combined, these factors can lead to misfolding and/or aggregation of the recombinant protein (Baneyx et al., 2004)."

Considerable amounts of soluble protein are required for many analysis techniques such as circular dichroism, crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (Pacheco et al., 2012). However, due to high-level expression, many recombinant proteins form inactive insoluble aggregates in the cytoplasm called inclusion bodies which are devoid of biological activities. A high concentration of denaturing agents is needed to solubilize and recover functionally active proteins from these aggregates. This process is challenging procedure and may result in the loss of secondary structure and poor recovery of bioactive proteins (Ahmadzadeh et al., 2020)(Soheili et al., 2020). Moreover, a successful refolding process must be experimentally obtained for each protein."

                            "Inclusion bodies produced in Escherichia coli are composed of densely packed denatured protein molecules in the form of particles. Refolding of inclusion body proteins into bioactive forms is cumbersome, results in poor recovery and accounts for the major cost in production of recombinant proteins from E. coli. With new information available on the structure and function of protein aggregates in bacterial inclusion bodies, it has been possible to develop improved solubilization and refolding procedures for higher recovery of bioactive protein. Inclusion bodies are formed from partially folded protein intermediates and are composed of aggregates of mostly single types of polypeptide. This helps to isolate and purify the protein aggregates to homogeneity before solubilization and refolding. Proteins inside inclusion body aggregates have native-like secondary structures. It is assumed that restoration of this native-like secondary structure using mild solubilization conditions will help in improved recovery of bioactive protein in comparison to solubilization using a high concentration of chaotropic agent. Analysis of the dominant forces causing aggregation during inclusion body formation provides information to develop suitable mild solubilization procedures for inclusion body proteins. Refolding from such solubilized protein will be very high due to restoration of native-like secondary structure. Human growth hormone inclusion bodies were purified to homogeneity from E. coli cells before solubilization and refolding. Pure inclusion bodies were solubilized at alkaline pH in the presence of 2 M urea solution. The solubilized proteins were refolded using a pulsatile renaturation process and subsequently purified using chromatographic procedures. More than 40% of the inclusion body proteins could be refolded back to the bioactive native conformation. Mild solubilization is thus the key for high recovery of bioactive protein from inclusion bodies."

Aggregated proteins, known as inclusion bodies, are generally misfolded and physiologically inactive [27]. In many cases, solubilization and refolding of insoluble proteins are time-consuming and labor-intensive procedures that add to the complexity of downstream processing [28,29]. Several methods have been developed to address these challenges to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins. For instance, an efficient and practical method is to modify culture conditions [30]. According to the accumulated evidence to accelerate the expression of target genes and develop solubility in E. coli, remarkable methods have been developed. Four substantial factors highly affect the production of soluble protein: timing of induction, inducer concentration, temperature, and duration of induction."

This fact has a clear and profoundly negative impact on productivity and probably protein quality. In addition, recombinant proteins fail, very often, to reach their native conformation when produced in bacteria [105]. This is caused by a coincidence of diverse events impairing protein folding including bottlenecks in transcription and translation, undertitration of chaperones and proteases, improper codon usage and inability of disulfide-bond formation [106,107].

So, the strategies for optimizing expression greatly vary from gene to gene and are often determined by trial and error.\n\nIn E. coli, tRNA levels for rare codons AGG, AGA, AUA, CCC, CUA and GGA restrain high-level production of the recombinant proteins [3]. Codon optimization could enhance soluble protein production [4,5], but sometimes it also impaired protein folding and decreased activity [6,7]. Similarly, supply of deficient tRNAs increased expression levels of recombinant proteins, but decreased soluble production of some recombinant proteins [8].

                            "BackgroundThe expression of heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli is strongly affected by codon bias. This phenomenon occurs when the codon usage of the mRNA coding for the foreign protein differs from that of the bacterium. The ribosome pauses upon encountering a rare codon and may detach from the mRNA, thereby the yield of protein expression is reduced. Several bacterial strains have been engineered to overcome this effect. However, the increased rate of translation may lead to protein misfolding and insolubilization. In order to prove this assumption, the solubility of several recombinant proteins from plants was studied in a codon bias-adjusted E. coli strain.ResultsThe expression of eight plant proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS and BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-pRIL was systematically studied. The CodonPlus strain contains extra copies of the argU, ileY, and leuW tRNA genes, which encode tRNAs that recognize the codons AGA/AGG, AUA and CUA, respectively (RIL codons). The level of expression and solubility of the recombinant proteins were analyzed by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. We found that for all proteins the solubility was at least 25% in the BL21(DE3)-pLysS strain. However, when expressed in the BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-pRIL strain, proteins having more than 5% of amino acids coded by RIL codons were localized mainly in the insoluble fraction. Also, their expression caused retarded growth and low cell yield in the codon bias-adjusted strain at all temperatures tested. On the contrary, the solubility of proteins containing less than 5% of amino acids coded by RIL codons remained unchanged in both strains and their expression caused no effect on cell growth.ConclusionOur results show that the expression of heterologous proteins coded by high RIL codon content coding sequences in a codon bias-adjusted strain is detrimental for their solubility. Our data support the hypothesis that the possible elimination of translational pauses that increase translation rate leads to protein misfolding and aggregation. This stresses the importance of strain selection according to codon content in any scheme where a large amount of biologically active product is desirable."

Efficacy studies of PEDF in animal models are limited because of poor heterologous protein yields. Here, we redesigned the human PEDF gene to preferentially match codon frequencies of E coli without altering the amino acid sequence. Following de novo synthesis, codon optimized PEDF (coPEDF) and the wtPEDF genes were cloned into pET32a containing a 5\u2032 thioredoxin sequence (Trx) and the recombinant Trx-coPEDF or Trx-wtPEDF fusion constructs expressed in native and two tRNA augmented E coli hosts - BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL and BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RP, carrying extra copies of tRNAarg,ile,leu and tRNAarg,pro genes , respectively. Trx-PEDF fusion proteins were isolated using Ni-NTA metal affinity chromatography and PEDF purified after cleavage with factor X\u03b1. Protein purity and identity were confirmed by western blot, MALDI-TOF, and UV/CD spectral analyses. Expression of the synthetic gene was \u223c3.4 fold greater (212.7 mg/g; 62.1 mg/g wet cells) and purified yields \u223c4 fold greater (41.1 mg/g; 11.3 mg/g wet cell) than wtPEDF in the native host. A small increase in expression of both genes was observed in hosts supplemented with rare tRNA genes compared to the native host but expression of coPEDF was \u223c3 fold greater than wtPEDF in both native and codon-bias-adjusted E coli strains. \u0394Gs at \u22123 to +50 of the Trx site of both fusion genes were \u22123.9 kcal/mol. Functionally, coPEDF was equally as effective as wtPEDF in reducing oxidative stress, promoting neurite outgrowth, and blocking endothelial tube formation. These findings suggest that while rare tRNA augmentation and mRNA folding energies can significantly contribute to increased protein expression, preferred codon usage, in this case, is advantageous to translational efficiency of biologically active PEDF in E coli. This strategy will undoubtedly fast forward studies to validate therapeutic utility of PEDF in vivo."

                            "Background: Synonymous codon usage affects protein properties in a given organism. Results: A total of 342 antibody codon variants were identified, differing significantly in solubility and functionality while retaining the identical original amino acid sequence. Conclusion: Genetic codes control protein synthesis and folding. \"Codon-preferred\" DNA template(s) can be generated by functional screening. Significance: Protein properties can be considerably altered by synonymous codons without substituting amino acids. Universal genetic codes are degenerated with 61 codons specifying 20 amino acids, thus creating synonymous codons for a single amino acid. Synonymous codons have been shown to affect protein properties in a given organism. To address this issue and explore how Escherichia coli selects its \"codon-preferred\" DNA template(s) for synthesis of proteins with required properties, we have designed synonymous codon libraries based on an antibody (scFv) sequence and carried out bacterial expression and screening for variants with altered properties. As a result, 342 codon variants have been identified, differing significantly in protein solubility and functionality while retaining the identical original amino acid sequence. The soluble expression level varied from completely insoluble aggregates to a soluble yield of \u223c2.5 mg/liter, whereas the antigen-binding activity changed from no binding at all to a binding affinity of > 10\u22128 m. Not only does our work demonstrate the involvement of genetic codes in regulating protein synthesis and folding but it also provides a novel screening strategy for producing improved proteins without the need to substitute amino acids."

                            "Escherichia coli is by far the most widely used host for the production of recombinant proteins. There are many protocols, a great number of expression plasmids, and engineered strains that can be used to obtain high protein yields (Rosano et al., 2014). Despite numerous advantages, biotechnological potential of E. coli also has its limitations including the risk of protein aggregation and accumulation of acetate as by-product. Upon high-level production, recombinant proteins may aggregate and form inclusion bodies (IBs) in E. coli cells. Formation of IBs is a complex and dynamic process affected by various factors involving molecular chaperones that control protein folding. The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs (Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007). To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required. Coexpression of molecular chaperones or lower production rate can prevent aggregation and facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins (Rosano et al., 2014)(Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007)."

This is due to the difficulty and expenses to apply a controlled continuous glucose feed to shaken cultures. New ready-made growth media, e.g. by biocatalytic release of glucose from a polymer, offer a simple solution for the application of the fed-batch principle in shaken plate and flask cultures. Their wider use has shown that the controlled diet not only provides a solution to obtain significantly higher cell yields, but also in many cases folding of the target protein is improved by the applied lower growth rates; i.e. final volumetric yields for the active protein can be a multiple of what is obtained in complex medium cultures."

Previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful. We now assessed the effects of combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol on the solubility of recombinant proteins.ResultsA two-step procedure was found to show the strongest enhancement of solubility. In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.ConclusionThe engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology."

This approach has been shown to enhance protein expression levels, with some studies reporting up to 3-4 fold increases in yield <Paper corpusId=\"4579748\" paperTitle=\"(Fang et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"16261433\" paperTitle=\"(Gvritishvili et al., 2010)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe alternative approach involves using E. coli strains supplemented with extra copies of tRNA genes that recognize rare codons, such as BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-pRIL, which contains additional tRNAs for recognizing AGA/AGG, AUA, and CUA codons <Paper corpusId=\"4579748\" paperTitle=\"(Fang et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"10726877\" paperTitle=\"(Rosano et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>. While this strategy can increase overall expression levels, it doesn't always translate to improved functional protein yield.\n\nInterestingly, both approaches present an unexpected challenge: they can sometimes impair protein folding and decrease biological activity <Paper corpusId=\"4579748\" paperTitle=\"(Fang et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. Research has shown that proteins with high content of rare codons (more than 5% of amino acids coded by rare codons) expressed in codon bias-adjusted strains tend to localize mainly in the insoluble fraction <Paper corpusId=\"10726877\" paperTitle=\"(Rosano et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "BackgroundThe expression of heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli is strongly affected by codon bias. This phenomenon occurs when the codon usage of the mRNA coding for the foreign protein differs from that of the bacterium. The ribosome pauses upon encountering a rare codon and may detach from the mRNA, thereby the yield of protein expression is reduced. Several bacterial strains have been engineered to overcome this effect. However, the increased rate of translation may lead to protein misfolding and insolubilization. In order to prove this assumption, the solubility of several recombinant proteins from plants was studied in a codon bias-adjusted E. coli strain.ResultsThe expression of eight plant proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS and BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-pRIL was systematically studied. The CodonPlus strain contains extra copies of the argU, ileY, and leuW tRNA genes, which encode tRNAs that recognize the codons AGA/AGG, AUA and CUA, respectively (RIL codons). The level of expression and solubility of the recombinant proteins were analyzed by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. We found that for all proteins the solubility was at least 25% in the BL21(DE3)-pLysS strain. However, when expressed in the BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-pRIL strain, proteins having more than 5% of amino acids coded by RIL codons were localized mainly in the insoluble fraction. Also, their expression caused retarded growth and low cell yield in the codon bias-adjusted strain at all temperatures tested. On the contrary, the solubility of proteins containing less than 5% of amino acids coded by RIL codons remained unchanged in both strains and their expression caused no effect on cell growth.ConclusionOur results show that the expression of heterologous proteins coded by high RIL codon content coding sequences in a codon bias-adjusted strain is detrimental for their solubility. Our data support the hypothesis that the possible elimination of translational pauses that increase translation rate leads to protein misfolding and aggregation. This stresses the importance of strain selection according to codon content in any scheme where a large amount of biologically active product is desirable."

Efficacy studies of PEDF in animal models are limited because of poor heterologous protein yields. Here, we redesigned the human PEDF gene to preferentially match codon frequencies of E coli without altering the amino acid sequence. Following de novo synthesis, codon optimized PEDF (coPEDF) and the wtPEDF genes were cloned into pET32a containing a 5\u2032 thioredoxin sequence (Trx) and the recombinant Trx-coPEDF or Trx-wtPEDF fusion constructs expressed in native and two tRNA augmented E coli hosts - BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL and BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RP, carrying extra copies of tRNAarg,ile,leu and tRNAarg,pro genes , respectively. Trx-PEDF fusion proteins were isolated using Ni-NTA metal affinity chromatography and PEDF purified after cleavage with factor X\u03b1. Protein purity and identity were confirmed by western blot, MALDI-TOF, and UV/CD spectral analyses. Expression of the synthetic gene was \u223c3.4 fold greater (212.7 mg/g; 62.1 mg/g wet cells) and purified yields \u223c4 fold greater (41.1 mg/g; 11.3 mg/g wet cell) than wtPEDF in the native host. A small increase in expression of both genes was observed in hosts supplemented with rare tRNA genes compared to the native host but expression of coPEDF was \u223c3 fold greater than wtPEDF in both native and codon-bias-adjusted E coli strains. \u0394Gs at \u22123 to +50 of the Trx site of both fusion genes were \u22123.9 kcal/mol. Functionally, coPEDF was equally as effective as wtPEDF in reducing oxidative stress, promoting neurite outgrowth, and blocking endothelial tube formation. These findings suggest that while rare tRNA augmentation and mRNA folding energies can significantly contribute to increased protein expression, preferred codon usage, in this case, is advantageous to translational efficiency of biologically active PEDF in E coli. This strategy will undoubtedly fast forward studies to validate therapeutic utility of PEDF in vivo."

Results: A total of 342 antibody codon variants were identified, differing significantly in solubility and functionality while retaining the identical original amino acid sequence. Conclusion: Genetic codes control protein synthesis and folding. \"Codon-preferred\" DNA template(s) can be generated by functional screening. Significance: Protein properties can be considerably altered by synonymous codons without substituting amino acids. Universal genetic codes are degenerated with 61 codons specifying 20 amino acids, thus creating synonymous codons for a single amino acid. Synonymous codons have been shown to affect protein properties in a given organism. To address this issue and explore how Escherichia coli selects its \"codon-preferred\" DNA template(s) for synthesis of proteins with required properties, we have designed synonymous codon libraries based on an antibody (scFv) sequence and carried out bacterial expression and screening for variants with altered properties. As a result, 342 codon variants have been identified, differing significantly in protein solubility and functionality while retaining the identical original amino acid sequence. The soluble expression level varied from completely insoluble aggregates to a soluble yield of \u223c2.5 mg/liter, whereas the antigen-binding activity changed from no binding at all to a binding affinity of > 10\u22128 m. Not only does our work demonstrate the involvement of genetic codes in regulating protein synthesis and folding but it also provides a novel screening strategy for producing improved proteins without the need to substitute amino acids."

In addition straightforward recombinant DNA technology offers engineering tools to produce protein molecules with modified features. The lack of posttranslational modification mechanisms in bacterial cells such as glycosylation, proteolytic protein maturation or limited capacity for formation of disulfide bridges may, to a certain extent, be overcome with protein engineering. Protein engineering is also often employed to improve protein stability or to modulate its biological action. More sophisticated modifications may be achieved by genetic fusions of two proteins.

                            "BackgroundProduction of correctly disulfide bonded proteins to high yields remains a challenge. Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli is the popular choice, especially within the research community. While there is an ever growing demand for new expression strains, few strains are dedicated to post-translational modifications, such as disulfide bond formation. Thus, new protein expression strains must be engineered and the parameters involved in producing disulfide bonded proteins must be understood.ResultsWe have engineered a new E. coli protein expression strain named SHuffle, dedicated to producing correctly disulfide bonded active proteins to high yields within its cytoplasm. This strain is based on the trxB gor suppressor strain SMG96 where its cytoplasmic reductive pathways have been diminished, allowing for the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm. We have further engineered a major improvement by integrating into its chromosome a signal sequenceless disulfide bond isomerase, DsbC. We probed the redox state of DsbC in the oxidizing cytoplasm and evaluated its role in assisting the formation of correctly folded multi-disulfide bonded proteins. We optimized protein expression conditions, varying temperature, induction conditions, strain background and the co-expression of various helper proteins. We found that temperature has the biggest impact on improving yields and that the E. coli B strain background of this strain was superior to the K12 version. We also discovered that auto-expression of substrate target proteins using this strain resulted in higher yields of active pure protein. Finally, we found that co-expression of mutant thioredoxins and PDI homologs improved yields of various substrate proteins.ConclusionsThis work is the first extensive characterization of the trxB gor suppressor strain. The results presented should help researchers design the appropriate protein expression conditions using SHuffle strains."

The entering into the market of a progressively increasing number of protein drugs produced in non-microbial systems has not impaired the development of products obtained in microbial cells, proving the robustness of the microbial set of cellular systems (so far Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisae) developed for protein drug production.

Aggregated proteins, known as inclusion bodies, are generally misfolded and physiologically inactive [27]. In many cases, solubilization and refolding of insoluble proteins are time-consuming and labor-intensive procedures that add to the complexity of downstream processing [28,29]. Several methods have been developed to address these challenges to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins. For instance, an efficient and practical method is to modify culture conditions [30]. According to the accumulated evidence to accelerate the expression of target genes and develop solubility in E. coli, remarkable methods have been developed. Four substantial factors highly affect the production of soluble protein: timing of induction, inducer concentration, temperature, and duration of induction."

This is due to the difficulty and expenses to apply a controlled continuous glucose feed to shaken cultures. New ready-made growth media, e.g. by biocatalytic release of glucose from a polymer, offer a simple solution for the application of the fed-batch principle in shaken plate and flask cultures. Their wider use has shown that the controlled diet not only provides a solution to obtain significantly higher cell yields, but also in many cases folding of the target protein is improved by the applied lower growth rates; i.e. final volumetric yields for the active protein can be a multiple of what is obtained in complex medium cultures."

                            "Escherichia coli is by far the most widely used host for the production of recombinant proteins. There are many protocols, a great number of expression plasmids, and engineered strains that can be used to obtain high protein yields (Rosano et al., 2014). Despite numerous advantages, biotechnological potential of E. coli also has its limitations including the risk of protein aggregation and accumulation of acetate as by-product. Upon high-level production, recombinant proteins may aggregate and form inclusion bodies (IBs) in E. coli cells. Formation of IBs is a complex and dynamic process affected by various factors involving molecular chaperones that control protein folding. The vast increase in misfolded recombinant proteins exhausts the capacity of molecular chaperones leading to the formation of IBs (Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007). To recover biologically active proteins from IBs, additional steps in purification procedure such as solubilization of IBs and subsequent refolding of desired proteins are required. Coexpression of molecular chaperones or lower production rate can prevent aggregation and facilitate the proper folding of recombinant proteins (Rosano et al., 2014)(Schlieker et al., 2002)(Marco et al., 2007)."

                            "BackgroundThe overproduction of recombinant proteins in host cells often leads to their misfolding and aggregation. Previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful. We now assessed the effects of combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol on the solubility of recombinant proteins.ResultsA two-step procedure was found to show the strongest enhancement of solubility. In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.ConclusionThe engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology."

The remarkable increase in the availability of fusion partners offers a wide range of tools for improved protein folding, solubility, protection from proteases, yield, and secretion into the culture medium, as well as for detection and purification of recombinant proteins. Codon usage is known to present a potential impediment to high-level gene expression in E. coli. Although we still do not understand all the rules governing this phenomenon, it is apparent that \"rare\" codons, depending on their frequency and context, can have an adverse effect on protein levels. Usually, this problem can be alleviated by modification of the relevant codons or by coexpression of the cognate tRNA genes. Finally, the elucidation of specific determinants of protein degradation, a plethora of protease-deficient host strains, and methods to stabilize proteins afford new strategies to minimize proteolytic susceptibility of recombinant proteins in E. coli."

                            "BackgroundProduction of correctly disulfide bonded proteins to high yields remains a challenge. Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli is the popular choice, especially within the research community. While there is an ever growing demand for new expression strains, few strains are dedicated to post-translational modifications, such as disulfide bond formation. Thus, new protein expression strains must be engineered and the parameters involved in producing disulfide bonded proteins must be understood.ResultsWe have engineered a new E. coli protein expression strain named SHuffle, dedicated to producing correctly disulfide bonded active proteins to high yields within its cytoplasm. This strain is based on the trxB gor suppressor strain SMG96 where its cytoplasmic reductive pathways have been diminished, allowing for the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm. We have further engineered a major improvement by integrating into its chromosome a signal sequenceless disulfide bond isomerase, DsbC. We probed the redox state of DsbC in the oxidizing cytoplasm and evaluated its role in assisting the formation of correctly folded multi-disulfide bonded proteins. We optimized protein expression conditions, varying temperature, induction conditions, strain background and the co-expression of various helper proteins. We found that temperature has the biggest impact on improving yields and that the E. coli B strain background of this strain was superior to the K12 version. We also discovered that auto-expression of substrate target proteins using this strain resulted in higher yields of active pure protein. Finally, we found that co-expression of mutant thioredoxins and PDI homologs improved yields of various substrate proteins.ConclusionsThis work is the first extensive characterization of the trxB gor suppressor strain. The results presented should help researchers design the appropriate protein expression conditions using SHuffle strains."

                            "The most common and successful expression method of recombinant proteins is episomal expression. However, this method has some apparent weaknesses.\n\nThe metabolic load caused by the plasmid can lead to the reduction of the host bacteria's growth and instability of the plasmid encoding the recombinant gene (17).\n\nOn the other hand, overexpression under strong promoters such as T7 may, in many cases, lead to the formation of IBs that are sometimes difficult to refold. Although these intracellular bodies may protect the heterologous protein from the damage of cellular proteases and are also useful in the initial stages of protein purification, refolding some proteins is a serious challenge. This can increase the cost of the final product (18) and is documented in the case of human growth hormone. When this hormone was expressed in E. coli at 37\u00b0C, almost all the expressed protein was in the form of IB (19). Therefore, reducing or preventing the formation of IBs can facilitate the purification process of some proteins, including human growth hormones.\n\nThe instability of the recombinant plasmid and the metabolic load caused by the high copy number of the plasmid may be solved or reduced by integrating the heterologous gene in the appropriate position of the host genome (20)."

                            "Avian necrotic enteritis (NE) is a multi-virulence disease caused by the bacterium Clostridium perfringens. Several toxins of this bacteria are components of different candidate vaccines, and have been considered as important factors in pathogenesis of NE. A fusion subunit protein composed of immunodominant segments of NetB, Alpha-toxin and metallopeptidase proteins (NAM) was designed. The high level production of NE subunit vaccine candidate is important for the in vitro and in vivo evaluation and later to decrease the production costs. Therefore, the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used for optimizing E. coli culture condition. To this end, induction conditions including cell optical density prior induction (OD600nm), IPTG concentration, post-induction temperature and time were modified. The statistical analysis revealed that all variables except IPTG had significant effects on production and solubility of rNAM. A 7.39 fold increase in production of soluble rNAM was achieved when the post induction temperature, IPTG concentration, the pre-induction OD and time were 19 oC, 0.55 mM, 0.8 respectively in 8 h after induction. Our study indicated that the RSM method is a simple and superior strategy for protein expression improvement which is considered as a major limitation in production of vaccine candidate and other recombinant proteins using different hosts. INTRODUCTION Necrotic enteritis (NE) is caused by clostridium perfringens type A, an anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria. Several virulence factors are involved in disease induction in chickens. In recent years protein based subunit vaccines have provided a safe and most attractive technology for protection against multifactorial disease like NE [10, 34]. Previous studies demonstrated that immunizing ability for protection against NE was associated with several virulence factors. The most important of these virulence factors are phospholipase C known as Alpha-toxin, \u03b2-pore forming toxin, NetB, and a zinc metallopeptidase protein [7,8, 28]. Utilizing a fusion of non toxic variants of these proteins as a recombinant subunit vaccine candidate could enhance protective immunity [31, 6].

This is due to the difficulty and expenses to apply a controlled continuous glucose feed to shaken cultures. New ready-made growth media, e.g. by biocatalytic release of glucose from a polymer, offer a simple solution for the application of the fed-batch principle in shaken plate and flask cultures. Their wider use has shown that the controlled diet not only provides a solution to obtain significantly higher cell yields, but also in many cases folding of the target protein is improved by the applied lower growth rates; i.e. final volumetric yields for the active protein can be a multiple of what is obtained in complex medium cultures."

There is a wealth of knowledge and comprehensive tools for E. coli systems, such as expression vectors, production strains, protein folding and fermentation technologies that are well tailored for industrial applications. Hence, with its recent advancements, the use of E. coli has been a preferred choice and a workhorse not only for expression of non-glycosylated proteins in the biotech industry, but also a complex protein production, bacterial N-linked glycosylation, novel strain engineering and creation of E. coli cell-free systems (Huang et al., 2012). Varieties of promoters are used in the production of recombinant proteins. Some of the strong promoters are induced by isopropyl-\u03b2-Dthiogalacto-pyranoside (IPTG) (i.e. tac, trc, and lac), which however has been reported to the limitation of its toxicity for the host cells and also causing an ineffective production cost due to its expensiveness [1](Huang et al., 2012)(Retnoningrum et al., 2019)(Briand et al., 2016)."

Isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) is currently the most efficient molecular inducer for regulating this promoter\u2019s transcriptional activity. However, limitations have been observed in large-scale and microplate production, including toxicity, cost and culture monitoring. Here, we report the novel SILEX (Self-InducibLe Expression) system, which is a convenient, cost-effective alternative that does not require cell density monitoring or IPTG induction. We demonstrate the broad utility of the presented self-inducible method for a panel of diverse proteins produced in large amounts. The SILEX system is compatible with all classical culture media and growth temperatures and allows protein expression modulation. Importantly, the SILEX system is proven to be efficient for protein expression screening on a microplate scale."

The production levels of recombinant proteins synthesized in E. coli are no longer pointed as a limitation for the success of the overall process, but care should be taken with the protein solubility, which is still a major bottleneck in the field.\n\ncomplex proteins due to the lack of sophisticated machinery to perform posttranslational modifications, resulting in poor solubility of the protein of interest that are produced as inclusion bodies (Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Kamionka, 2011). Previous studies (Bussow et al., 2005;Pacheco et al., 2012) reported that up to 75% of human proteins are successfully expressed in E. coli but only 25% are produced in an active soluble form using this host system. Other problems found within this host system include proper formation of disulfide bonds, absence of chaperones for the correct folding, and the miss-match between the codon usage of the host cell and the protein of interest (Terpe, 2006;Demain and Vaishnav, 2009;Pacheco et al., 2012).
