Adamo\n## Abstract\nDespite the many advances that have occurred in the field of vaccine adjuvants, there are still unmet needs that may enable the development of vaccines suitable for more challenging pathogens (e.g., HIV and tuberculosis) and for cancer vaccines. Liposomes have already been shown to be highly effective as adjuvant/delivery systems due to their versatility and likely will find further uses in this space. The broad potential of lipid-based delivery systems is highlighted by the recent approval of COVID-19 vaccines comprising lipid nanoparticles with encapsulated mRNA. This review provides an overview of the different approaches that can be evaluated for the design of lipid-based vaccine adjuvant/delivery systems for protein, carbohydrate, and nucleic acid-based antigens and how these strategies might be combined to develop multicomponent vaccines.\n## Coadministration of Lipid-Based Nanoparticles,\nH56 tuberculosis antigen was adsorbed on the liposome surface (>90%), and avidin was intramuscularly injected 2 h prior to immunization. Their experiments demonstrated that the formation of avidin\u2212 biotin-coated liposome complexes resulted in higher accumulation of liposomes and their associated antigen in the draining lymph nodes, compared to DDA:TDB liposomes, followed by reduction of Th1-driven immune response. 78 Thus, the presence of PEG in the formulation not only controlled the biodistribution of the vaccine but also switched the type of T cell responses from a Th1 toward a Th2.\n\nOn the other hand, it has been demonstrated that an optimized degree of pegylation may reduce depot formation, enhance passive drainage to the lymph nodes, and eventually improve immunogenicity. In general, liposomes with a brushlike coverage (5\u221215% PEG) and with a molecular mass of 2000 Da have a more stable steric barrier and prolonged circulation time. 211,212 Studies by Schmidt et al. demonstrated that pegylation (10%) of CAF09 (DDA/monomycoloyl glycerol (MMG) analogue 1/poly(I:C)) with DSPE-PEG2000 resulted in drainage of a larger dose fraction to the lymph nodes, followed by an induction of stronger CD8+ T cell responses in the blood upon subcutaneous immunization, as compared to nonpegylated CAF09. 213 Goswami et al. observed that reduction of PEG from 2% to 0.3% resulted in increased mannose exposure on the LNPs but also resulted in a lower SAM encapsulation efficiency. 143 Thus, although pegylation increases liposome circulation time, the immunological profile of these particles needs to be balanced relative to the ligand/PEG content in order to achieve particle stability, high encapsulation, biodistribution, and presentation of attached ligands.\n\nAdditionally, the free end of PEG can be harnessed for chemical ligations with different targeting ligands, such as peptides, proteins, antibodies, carbohydrates, and polysaccharides. 214 The interaction between ligands on nanoparticles and",

Therefore, developing strategies for enhancing LNPs' ability to target diverse organs is of great clinical significance. On one hand, following systemic administration, LNPs interact with specific proteins and biomolecules in the bloodstream, forming a layer of adsorbed ''protein corona'' on their surface. 25 The composition of this protein corona varies based on the type and properties of LNPs, including factors, such as composition, charge, size, surface chemistry, etc., predominantly affecting cellular uptake and biodistribution. 26 On the other hand, LNPs modified with ligands (small molecules, peptides, antibodies, etc.) are widely employed as active targeting strategies.

Therefore, developing strategies for enhancing LNPs' ability to target diverse organs is of great clinical significance. On one hand, following systemic administration, LNPs interact with specific proteins and biomolecules in the bloodstream, forming a layer of adsorbed ''protein corona'' on their surface. 25 The composition of this protein corona varies based on the type and properties of LNPs, including factors, such as composition, charge, size, surface chemistry, etc., predominantly affecting cellular uptake and biodistribution. 26 On the other hand, LNPs modified with ligands (small molecules, peptides, antibodies, etc.) are widely employed as active targeting strategies. In this section, we summarize organ-targeted LNPs developed for nucleic acid delivery and discuss specific targeting strategies, providing readers with a contemporary overview of the development of targeted LNPs.\n\n## Liver-selective LNPs\nIn the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships. For example, a platform for mRNA delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) was reported, from which a promising lipid candidate CL15A6 with high affinity to aHSCs was identified, and the biosafety with an in vivo dose up to 2 mg/kg was proven. 37 In addition, Frederick Campbell and colleagues rationally designed an anionic LNP that switched neutral LNPs surface charge into anionic based on the formulation of Onpattro, 38 which preferentially targeted mRNA delivery to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) made up of LSECs and KCs through scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and -2 mediating anionic recognition of LNPs with LSECs. 39 elective targeting of liver cells by using ligand-modified LNPs is another potential strategy.

Therefore, reasonable design of LNPs in the future will help overcome these difficulties. \n\n(1) Although LNP therapies generally exhibit lower immunogenicity compared to conventional chemotherapy and protein therapy, they are not immune to potential toxicity arising from the accumulation of LNPs in the liver and spleen.

Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.",

                    "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

                    "text": "Unexpectedly, incorporation of mannose to LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid showed a similar increase in mRNA expression level in the presence or absence of serum. On the contrary, for 1.5% PEG-lipid, incorporation of mannose did not result in an increase in mRNA expression level in the presence of serum compared to that in the absence of serum. In the presence of serum, uptake of mannose-incorporated LNPs with 1.5% of PEG-lipid could be simultaneously internalized by ApoE-and mannose-mediated pathway. Therefore, mannose/CD206-mediated LNP uptake was less significant. However, higher PEG-lipid content (3%) could allow reduced absorption of ApoE and mediate LNP uptake mainly by mannose and CD206 interaction. To further figure out whether LNPs with mannose were internalized via CD206-mediated pathway, we performed a cellular uptake inhibition experiment (Fig. 6, E and F). Anti-CD206 antibody was pretreated to the cells, and LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid or galactose-PEG lipid were incubated with HepG2 cells. Galactose is the one of mannose enantiomers and adopted as a control. The significant decrease in luciferase expression was confirmed when LNPs were incorporated with mannose-PEG. In contrast, mRNA expression of LNPs with galactose moieties was not inhibited by anti-LDLR antibody. This result indicated that mannose moieties could play an important role in CD206-mediated intracellular uptake of LNPs. \n\nNext, to evaluate the selective targeting of mannose-incorporated LNPs to LSECs, we performed in vivo evaluation with two different mRNAs (mFLuc and mCre). LNPs were formulated with 3.0% PEG-lipid (with 2.5% mannose-PEG lipid). Since extrahepatic macrophages also express CD206, we first confirmed the liver-specific delivery of mFLuc-loaded LNPs with mannose.",

Previous studies have shown that targeting endothelial sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 and Bax in LSECs could also reduce apoptosis of LSECs and eventually reduced acute hepatic failure (43,44). The conjugation of hyaluronan, KLGR peptide, and mannose resulted in increased uptake of nano particles into LSECs compared to nonconjugated groups. Moreover, previously reported studies have confirmed that LNPs can be delivered to different tissue by changing LNP formulations. Some of these formulations showed increased mRNA delivery to LSECs without targeting ligands (45). Nevertheless, its selectivity remained not well understood (37). \n\nTo translate the targeted delivery to LSECs, ApoE-dependent cellular uptake must be replaced by alternative ligand selection and incorporation. Upon entering blood circulation system, LNPs can be readily delivered to hepatocytes and LSECs by ApoE-dependent cellular uptake. However, delivery efficacy of LNPs in LSECs is significantly less than that of hepatocytes (23). Here, we demonstrated a targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs by incorporating active ligands to LNPs. The mannose ligand can interact with specific receptors (CD206) expressed on LSECs. We have shown that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) allowed selective delivery of mRNA/siRNA only to LSECs through mannose-CD206 interaction. It is likely that, when PEGlipid content is high enough, the ApoE-mediated cellular uptake is mostly reduced, while mannose-CD206 interaction becomes predominant for the cellular entry of LNPs. Moreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae.",

In addition, we compared a ligand-dependent mRNA delivery efficiency of LNPs using mannose-PEG lipid with that of galactose-PEG lipid. As shown in fig. S8, LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid and galactose-PEG lipid resulted in slightly bigger size than LNPs with PEG-lipid only. This phenomenon was previously reported among saccharideconjugated nanoparticles (41,42). The prepared mFLuc-loaded LNPs were injected intravenously into C57BL/6 mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Whole-body image showed substantial bioluminescence in the mice liver with mannose-incorporated LNPs and supported the liver tissue-specific expression of mFLuc. \n\nWe then examined the ability of LSEC-specific gene editing using mCre. mCre-loaded LNPs with mannose were injected to mice at a dose of mRNA at 0.5 mg/kg. As shown in Fig. 7A, ex vivo organ images also confirmed robust liver-specific tdTomato fluorescence. Next, cell type-specific fluorescence was quantified by imaging tissue sections. Notable tdTomato fluorescence was detected along the liver vessel (LSECs), and Kupffer cells rarely expressed tdTomato fluorescence (Fig. 7B). We further quantified this phenomenon by counting tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells with MetaMorph image software. As shown in Fig. 7C, 15% of hepatocytes, 70% of LSECs, and 15% of Kupffer cells were tdTomato fluorescence positive. tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells were also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (fig. S9D). Notably, compared with LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid, mannose-incorporated LNPs showed the substantial decrease of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes.",

Kim, M. Jeong, S. Hur, Y. Cho, J. Park, H. Jung, Y. Seo, H. Woo, K. Nam, K. Lee, H. Lee\n## Abstract\nEngineered ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were developed for the LSEC-specific delivery of RNA therapeutics. Ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for in vivo delivery of RNA therapeutics into the liver. However, a main challenge remains to develop LNP formulations for selective delivery of RNA into certain types of liver cells, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol\u2013lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that engineered LNPs have great potential for the cell type\u2013specific delivery of RNA into the liver and other tissues.\n## Active targeting of LSECs using ligand-incorporated LNPs\nUpon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).\n...\nUnexpectedly, incorporation of mannose to LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid showed a similar increase in mRNA expression level in the presence or absence of serum. On the contrary, for 1.5% PEG-lipid, incorporation of mannose did not result in an increase in mRNA expression level in the presence of serum compared to that in the absence of serum. In the presence of serum, uptake of mannose-incorporated LNPs with 1.5% of PEG-lipid could be simultaneously internalized by ApoE-and mannose-mediated pathway. Therefore, mannose/CD206-mediated LNP uptake was less significant. However, higher PEG-lipid content (3%) could allow reduced absorption of ApoE and mediate LNP uptake mainly by mannose and CD206 interaction. To further figure out whether LNPs with mannose were internalized via CD206-mediated pathway, we performed a cellular uptake inhibition experiment (Fig. 6, E and F). Anti-CD206 antibody was pretreated to the cells, and LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid or galactose-PEG lipid were incubated with HepG2 cells. Galactose is the one of mannose enantiomers and adopted as a control. The significant decrease in luciferase expression was confirmed when LNPs were incorporated with mannose-PEG. In contrast, mRNA expression of LNPs with galactose moieties was not inhibited by anti-LDLR antibody. This result indicated that mannose moieties could play an important role in CD206-mediated intracellular uptake of LNPs. \n\nNext, to evaluate the selective targeting of mannose-incorporated LNPs to LSECs, we performed in vivo evaluation with two different mRNAs (mFLuc and mCre). LNPs were formulated with 3.0% PEG-lipid (with 2.5% mannose-PEG lipid). Since extrahepatic macrophages also express CD206, we first confirmed the liver-specific delivery of mFLuc-loaded LNPs with mannose.\n...\nSince extrahepatic macrophages also express CD206, we first confirmed the liver-specific delivery of mFLuc-loaded LNPs with mannose. In addition, we compared a ligand-dependent mRNA delivery efficiency of LNPs using mannose-PEG lipid with that of galactose-PEG lipid. As shown in fig. S8, LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid and galactose-PEG lipid resulted in slightly bigger size than LNPs with PEG-lipid only. This phenomenon was previously reported among saccharideconjugated nanoparticles (41,42). The prepared mFLuc-loaded LNPs were injected intravenously into C57BL/6 mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Whole-body image showed substantial bioluminescence in the mice liver with mannose-incorporated LNPs and supported the liver tissue-specific expression of mFLuc. \n\nWe then examined the ability of LSEC-specific gene editing using mCre. mCre-loaded LNPs with mannose were injected to mice at a dose of mRNA at 0.5 mg/kg. As shown in Fig. 7A, ex vivo organ images also confirmed robust liver-specific tdTomato fluorescence. Next, cell type-specific fluorescence was quantified by imaging tissue sections. Notable tdTomato fluorescence was detected along the liver vessel (LSECs), and Kupffer cells rarely expressed tdTomato fluorescence (Fig. 7B). We further quantified this phenomenon by counting tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells with MetaMorph image software. As shown in Fig. 7C, 15% of hepatocytes, 70% of LSECs, and 15% of Kupffer cells were tdTomato fluorescence positive. tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells were also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (fig. S9D). Notably, compared with LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid, mannose-incorporated LNPs showed the substantial decrease of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes.\n\n## DISCUSSION\nA platform technology that delivers RNA therapeutics to targeted cells has great potential for treating various liver diseases associated with different types of cells in the liver. In particular, LSECs participate in initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases by change in their pathological characteristics in response to chemical toxins, cytokines, and inflammatory stimuli (17,19). Previous studies have shown that targeting endothelial sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 and Bax in LSECs could also reduce apoptosis of LSECs and eventually reduced acute hepatic failure (43,44). The conjugation of hyaluronan, KLGR peptide, and mannose resulted in increased uptake of nano particles into LSECs compared to nonconjugated groups. Moreover, previously reported studies have confirmed that LNPs can be delivered to different tissue by changing LNP formulations. Some of these formulations showed increased mRNA delivery to LSECs without targeting ligands (45). Nevertheless, its selectivity remained not well understood (37). \n\nTo translate the targeted delivery to LSECs, ApoE-dependent cellular uptake must be replaced by alternative ligand selection and incorporation. Upon entering blood circulation system, LNPs can be readily delivered to hepatocytes and LSECs by ApoE-dependent cellular uptake. However, delivery efficacy of LNPs in LSECs is significantly less than that of hepatocytes (23). Here, we demonstrated a targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs by incorporating active ligands to LNPs. The mannose ligand can interact with specific receptors (CD206) expressed on LSECs. We have shown that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) allowed selective delivery of mRNA/siRNA only to LSECs through mannose-CD206 interaction. It is likely that, when PEGlipid content is high enough, the ApoE-mediated cellular uptake is mostly reduced, while mannose-CD206 interaction becomes predominant for the cellular entry of LNPs. Moreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae.\n...\nMoreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae. This additionally reduced the uptake of LNPs to hepatocytes and allowed more selective uptake into the LSECs. Collectively, our results successfully demonstrated the targeted delivery of RNA into different types of cells in the liver by controlling physical size of LNPs, PEG-lipid content, and incorporation of active targeting ligands. Overall, this approach may offer new strategies to develop cell type-specific delivery of RNA in the liver and other tissues.",

The COVID\u201019 mRNA vaccine and RSV mRNA vaccine have been approved on the market. Due to the inherent nuclease\u2010instability and negative charge of mRNA, delivery systems are developed to protect the mRNA from degradation and facilitate its crossing cell membrane to express functional proteins or peptides in the cytoplasm. However, the deficiency in transfection efficiency and targeted biological distribution are still the major challenges for the mRNA delivery systems. In this review, we first described the physiological barriers in the process of mRNA delivery and then discussed the design approach and recent advances in mRNA delivery systems with an emphasis on their tissue/cell\u2010targeted abilities. Finally, we pointed out the existing challenges and future directions with deep insights into the design of efficient mRNA delivery systems. We believe that a high\u2010precision targeted delivery system can greatly improve the therapeutic effects and bio\u2010safety of mRNA therapeutics and accelerate their clinical transformations. This review may provide a new direction for the design of mRNA delivery systems and serve as a useful guide for researchers who are looking for a suitable mRNA delivery system.\n## Liver-targeted delivery\nUsing ligands to actively target delivery vectors to the liver and other organs of interest is a potential research area. This approach holds the potential to mitigate the undesirable delivery of LNPs to extrahepatic organs, thereby minimizing the occurrence of side effects. The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) is overexpressed on the surface of hepatoma cells. It has been suggested that ASGPR-mediated endocytosis is an effective delivery strategy. 6][167][168] Another idea is to conjugate the LNPs with ASGPR mAb, which may be an attempt. 167 n a study by Kim et al., 169 it was found that achieving LSEC-specific RNA delivery, could not succeed by controlling the size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. Due to the specific expression of mannose receptors on human and mouse LSECs, they prepared LNPs doped with 0.5-4.5% mannose PEG-lipid, and found that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) has the best LSECs selective delivery effect. 169,170 Miao et al. 171 have proposed a glycolipid-like polymer named galactosylated chitosan oligosaccharide-SS-octadecylamine (Gal-CSSO). The galactosyl residues modified on it can selectively target HCs, the chitosan oligosaccharide is conducive to the endosomal escape, and the structure of -SS-can help the HC microenvironment respond to facilitate drug release. \n\nMany carriers with excellent liver selective delivery have been approved for drug delivery or have started clinical trials. Patisiran (ONPATTRO)\u2122, the first siRNA drug in the world. It is encapsulated in LNPs and delivered to hepatocytes, which specifically inhibits the hepatic synthesis of transthyretin. 172",

Several ligands (e.g., aptamers, sugars, antibodies and antibody fragments, vitamins, and aptamers) have been coupled on the LNP surface through various approaches, including direct conjugation of targeting ligands onto preformed LNPs and postinsertion of lipid conjugated molecules onto preformed LNPs, thus enabling targeted delivery. Antibodies and their various formats have been conjugated to LNPs, and the resultant conjugates have shown successful retargeting of LNPs to multiple extrahepatic cells and tissues, including immune cells, lymph nodes, bone marrow, cancer cells, and endothelial cells (Table 3). \n\nN-Acetyl Galactosamine. Conjugation of chemically stabilized siRNA to trivalent GalNAc has resulted in the FDA approval of five therapeutics that are administered sc for various liver indications. Trivalent GalNAc is conjugated to the 3\u2032 end of the sense strand using a pH labile hydroxy proline linker. GalNAc allows targeting to the liver where it binds to ASGPRs expressed on hepatocytes 134 (note that the ASGPR is conserved across species), and there are \u223c1 million ASGPRs on liver cells that recycle every 15 min. 31",

            "text": "In conclusion, pegylated surface and ligand modification largely determine the biodistribution and in vivo fate of LNPs, thus affecting the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of loaded mRNA medicines.Modulation of the pegylated lipid alone may have limited impact on LNPs without clarified mechanism.While antibody modification might have provided solution by boosting the mRNA targeted delivery to specific cell type, this strategy remains in the preclinical stage for several reasons including limited antibody selection with low specificity, difficulties in process development, and quality control.Moreover, antibodies may harbor the potential to comprise the cell functions.Further efforts are expected to precisely control the conjugation density among LNPs to balance the targeting efficiency and biofunctions of target cells.Additionally, fostering new target ligands with high specificity and low toxicity is demanded.Small molecules and peptides serve as ligand alternatives for LNP to facilitate targeted delivery, including neurotransmitter for brain targeting [71], mannose for APC targeting [83,84], angiopeptide2 for glioblastoma targeting [85], and CPP peptide RGD (RRRRRRGGRRRRG) [86] and Epi-1 peptide (D-WRPTRURLLPWWICGSGSK) for tumor targeting [87].\n\nAmong the preliminary research, few have been applied on LNP for mRNA delivery.Another pivotal aspect is the in vivo fate of the surface-modified LNPs.Although several groups unveiled the parameters that may affect the biodistribution and degradation of pegylated LNP, the antibody-conjugated PEG shedding, protein corona absorption, tissue biodistribution, and degradation in the circulation remain obscure.In this case, no defined protocols could guide the rational design of ligand-conjugated LNPs to facilitate and enhance the targeted delivery of mRNA in specific organ and cell.In summary, additional and continuous endeavors are anticipated to fill the niche and provide LNP for precisely targeted delivery to assist mRNA therapeutics to treat specific disorders.",

            "text": "Although LNPs can be used to efficiently deliver nucleic acids in vivo, their preferential accumulation in the liver tissue poses a significant limitation. Strikingly, as much as 30-90% of systemically administered LNPs accumulate in the liver, which would constitute a severe off-target effect if treating non-hepatic diseases [251,252]. In order to transition mRNA-LNPs from prophylactic to therapeutic applications, researchers must overcome the crucial challenge of delivering mRNA payloads to non-hepatic tissues. Considerable efforts have been devoted to guiding mRNA-LNPs to specific tissues, as selective targeting remains a key obstacle to the advancement of precision medicine and mitigation of off-target and adverse effects associated with RNA-based therapeutics [185,186]. \n\nWhile non-targeting mRNA-LNPs tend to primarily accumulate in the liver after administration via intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous routes, targeting ligands may be used to more precisely direct LNPs to hepatocytes or other specific liver cell types. For example, one study utilized LNPs decorated with mannose ligands to deliver mRNA encoding epitope peptides of Arachishypogaea protein 2 (Ara h2), a primary allergen in peanuts, to LSECs [253]. In C3H/HeJ mice sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract, the prophylactic administration of the LSEC-targeted mRNA-LNP could inhibit anaphylaxis. This effect was mediated by suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis and mast cell release of inflammatory factors. In other work, antibodies against the endothelial cell surface marker, PCAM-1 (platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; CD31) were utilized for LNP targeting [195]. Intravenous administration of anti-PCAM-1-conjugated mRNA-LNPs led to low levels of hepatic uptake accompanied by an approximately 200-fold elevation of mRNA delivery and 25-fold increase of protein expression in the lungs compared to non-targeted counterparts.",

Huge peptide/protein libraries including phage display [121] and bar-coding assays [122] are used to identify strong affinity binders. These and other efforts will hopefully reveal effective active targeting ligands that will advance the LNP targeting capabilities beyond the liver.\n\nIn addition to LNP composition and overall design, administration route also affects LNP biodistribution and which cell types are exposed to LNPs [30]. Relatedly, current clinical trials highlight that local administration, when possible, is a simple and efficient way to deliver LNPs to the right tissues and cells (Fig. 7A).\n\nIn sum, several new strategies for enhancing LNP uptake beyond liver cells are being developed and tested, with more expected to come. The success of these targeting strategies will be linked not only to how strongly the targeting ligand (either synthesized or adsorbed in the biological fluid, as in Onpattro \u00d2 ) binds to its receptor but also how well the ligand integrates into the matrix of conventional LNP lipids and how well these new multicomponent LNPs evade the immune system.",

            "text": "The usage of the fast-shedding PEG-lipid allowed more hepatocyte targeting compared with Kupffer cells, the liver macrophages, thus improving the effectivity of LNP-siRNA drug [60]. This study is in agreement with the previous study by Judge et al. where the authors found less formed anti-PEG antibodies and a substantial reduction of side effects upon repetitive dosing in mice when PEGylated liposomes containing a shorter alkyl chain (C14) PEG-lipid versus a longer alkyl chain C16 PEG-lipid were used [151]. Studies directly examining the effects of anti-PEG antibodies on the efficacy and safety of LNP-mRNA drugs containing PEG lipids are still very limited. Recently, Nogueira et al. examined diverse chain lengths and molar fractions of stealth lipid Polysarcosine (PSar) and found efficient mRNA delivery with a lower cytokine pro-inflammatory profile, reduced complement activation, and liver toxicity markers, compared with PEG-containing LNPs [59]. \n\nLocalization to particular tissues and the active targeting of LNP-mRNA therapeutics to specific cell types and organs are a topic of particular interest that can improve current off-target effects and pave a route for novel applications in difficult-to-target tissues. As already discussed, localization to particular tissues can be achieved by optimization on the mRNA level by introducing cell type specific miRNA target sites to 3 UTRs leading to the degradation of the mRNA, leading to the loss of translation efficacy of LNP-mRNA in selected cell types [128]. However, optimization on the level of LNP is the main focus with diverse approaches based on changing LNP structural components and optimizing LNP composition or those actively targeting specific cells using a functionalized surface, for example, with targeting ligands or antibodies. Most of the currently developed LNPs largely localize to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-mediated uptake [152]. ApoE binds to LNP in circulation and facilitates binding to low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes, allowing the endocytosis of LNP-mRNA to the cell.",

            "text": "Unexpectedly, incorporation of mannose to LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid showed a similar increase in mRNA expression level in the presence or absence of serum. On the contrary, for 1.5% PEG-lipid, incorporation of mannose did not result in an increase in mRNA expression level in the presence of serum compared to that in the absence of serum. In the presence of serum, uptake of mannose-incorporated LNPs with 1.5% of PEG-lipid could be simultaneously internalized by ApoE-and mannose-mediated pathway. Therefore, mannose/CD206-mediated LNP uptake was less significant. However, higher PEG-lipid content (3%) could allow reduced absorption of ApoE and mediate LNP uptake mainly by mannose and CD206 interaction. To further figure out whether LNPs with mannose were internalized via CD206-mediated pathway, we performed a cellular uptake inhibition experiment (Fig. 6, E and F). Anti-CD206 antibody was pretreated to the cells, and LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid or galactose-PEG lipid were incubated with HepG2 cells. Galactose is the one of mannose enantiomers and adopted as a control. The significant decrease in luciferase expression was confirmed when LNPs were incorporated with mannose-PEG. In contrast, mRNA expression of LNPs with galactose moieties was not inhibited by anti-LDLR antibody. This result indicated that mannose moieties could play an important role in CD206-mediated intracellular uptake of LNPs. \n\nNext, to evaluate the selective targeting of mannose-incorporated LNPs to LSECs, we performed in vivo evaluation with two different mRNAs (mFLuc and mCre). LNPs were formulated with 3.0% PEG-lipid (with 2.5% mannose-PEG lipid). Since extrahepatic macrophages also express CD206, we first confirmed the liver-specific delivery of mFLuc-loaded LNPs with mannose.",

            "text": "The liver is the primary region where mRNA NPs tend to accumulate upon intravenous administration, which can be attributed to three main factors. First, the liver's hemodynamics and unique sinusoidal fenestrated capillary structure increase the likelihood of mRNA NPs being captured by the liver. Second, the liver serves as the primary site for the metabolic clearance of mRNA nanoparticles, resulting in a significantly higher distribution of nanomaterials in the liver than in other organs. Lastly, due to the high expression of ApoE receptors in the liver, systemically administered mRNA NPs readily adsorb ApoE, leading to preferential liver accumulation. Therefore, the primary challenge in successfully delivering mRNA NPs to extrahepatic organs like spleen and lungs is overcoming the liver homing tendency of mRNA NPs. \n\nVarious approaches are employed to target mRNA NPs to extrahepatic organs, such as incorporating stealth components into mRNA NPs, with PEG being the most widely used stealth element to avoid liver uptake. Additionally, by modulating the physicochemical properties of mRNA NPs, such as size, pKa, charge, or adding active targeting ligands, different organs can be targeted. Moreover, for specific organs like the lungs or brain, selecting appropriate delivery routes can greatly enhance the targeting efficiency of mRNA NPs. Notably, some recent studies have achieved extrahepatic targeting by directly inducing the adsorption of other plasma proteins. Alternative stealth shells to PEG, such as poly(adenine), poly(2-oxazoline), and poly(amino acids), have been proposed to circumvent the side effects of PEG-specific antibody responses and PEG's non-biodegradability. The extrahepatic targeted mRNA NP development provides valuable insights into overcoming liver homing tendencies, which contribute to design novel nanocarriers for other organs and cells.",

            "text": "Currently, the next breakthrough in the field of LNP is the ability to divert the nucleic acid payload away from the liver and allow access to extra-hepatic sites that would enable treatment of any genetic diseases from cancer to Alzheimer's. The major issue to be addressed is the propensity of LNP accumulating in the liver upon systemic administration [59,60]. The current gold standard LNP based on DLinMC3DMA and ALC-0315 are lipids known to associate with ApoE, which are readily taken up by the liver. In order to escape the liver, the strategy whereby increasing PEG-lipid content to prevent the ApoE binding and deviate the endogenous targeting away from the liver has shown limited success in prolonging circulation and redistributing the LNP to extrahepatic sites [59,60]. A potential strategy is to use a targeting ligand to facilitate the uptake of LNP to specific organs [162,163]. Studies led by the Muzykantov laboratory have demonstrated the successful conjugation of antibodies targeting vascular adhesion molecule PECAM-1 or ICAM-1 and re-directing the LNP accumulation away from the liver to the lung [164,165] or VCAM-1 and targeting to the cerebral endothelium during brain edema [165]. A similar approach, using CD-4 antibody conjugated to the surface of the LNP, directed uptake into all T cells (na\u00efve, central, memory, and effector) in both spleen and lymph enabling the possibility to conduct chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in vivo [166]. Targeting ligands can re-distribute the LNP to extrahepatic sites; however, these examples are only demonstrated in small research scale settings. The current commercial manufacturing of mRNA-LNP is dependent on multiple steps that are not necessarily amenable to adding the targeting aspect. To ensure the manufacturing success of targeting LNP, two processes must be optimized: large scale production of the ligand, often a biological drug substance that is difficult and costly to manufacture, and the conjugation step to couple the ligand to the LNP.",

In addition, we compared a ligand-dependent mRNA delivery efficiency of LNPs using mannose-PEG lipid with that of galactose-PEG lipid. As shown in fig. S8, LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid and galactose-PEG lipid resulted in slightly bigger size than LNPs with PEG-lipid only. This phenomenon was previously reported among saccharideconjugated nanoparticles (41,42). The prepared mFLuc-loaded LNPs were injected intravenously into C57BL/6 mice at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Whole-body image showed substantial bioluminescence in the mice liver with mannose-incorporated LNPs and supported the liver tissue-specific expression of mFLuc. \n\nWe then examined the ability of LSEC-specific gene editing using mCre. mCre-loaded LNPs with mannose were injected to mice at a dose of mRNA at 0.5 mg/kg. As shown in Fig. 7A, ex vivo organ images also confirmed robust liver-specific tdTomato fluorescence. Next, cell type-specific fluorescence was quantified by imaging tissue sections. Notable tdTomato fluorescence was detected along the liver vessel (LSECs), and Kupffer cells rarely expressed tdTomato fluorescence (Fig. 7B). We further quantified this phenomenon by counting tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells with MetaMorph image software. As shown in Fig. 7C, 15% of hepatocytes, 70% of LSECs, and 15% of Kupffer cells were tdTomato fluorescence positive. tdTomato fluorescence-positive cells were also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (fig. S9D). Notably, compared with LNPs with 3.0% PEG-lipid, mannose-incorporated LNPs showed the substantial decrease of tdTomato fluorescence in hepatocytes.",

            "text": "LNPs loaded with non-PEGylated mRNA formed aggregates immediately after the injection, leading to rapid clearance of the LNPs from the blood circulation. Notably, the non-PEGylated LNPs were deposited in the lung tissues, indicating the occlusion of lung capillary by the aggregates. Importantly, such lung embolism can cause the death of mice [26]. On the other hand, LNP PEGylation through PEG-OligoRNA hybridization to mRNA is effective in preventing LNP aggregation in the blood, and LNP deposition in the lung, demonstrating high structural stability of the LNPs in biological milieu and their improved safety for in vivo usage. Such structural stabilization after PEGylation may be explained by PEG steric repulsive force preventing the association of LNP with surrounding proteins, blood cells or LNPs in the blood [30]. \n\nThe mRNA introduction efficiency to the cultured cells decreased after LNP PEGylation, which may be explained by PEG steric repulsive force inhibiting the non-specific interaction of LNPs to cells and LNP uptake to the cells (Figure 7). The PEGylation of the LNPs can also induce inhibitory effect on intracellular processes, such as endosomal escape [31]. Several strategies were reported for solving these issues of PEGylation, so called \"PEG dilemma\", and facilitating cellular uptake and endosomal escape, including the installation of ligands to PEG, the optimization of surface PEG density and the selective cleavage of PEG in target tissues or cells [32][33][34][35][36]. We plan combinational use of these strategies with the mRNA PEGylation approach, to achieve efficient in vivo mRNA introduction in the future study. \n\nThe use of PEGylated lipids is an alternative strategy to prevent the aggregation after mRNA addition to LNPs, and feasibility of this strategy was well studied in LNP preparation for pDNA delivery. Although this strategy showed some effect on steric stabilization of LNP, PEGylated LNPs still aggregate after pDNA addition, depending on their formulations [37,38].",

            "text": "administration [54]. Moreover, it has been extensively demonstrated that the physicochemical similarity of the commonly referred to as LNPs to VLDL and the propensity to adsorb ApoE in blood plasma, enhances the accumulation of this kind of lipid systems in the liver and the internalization into hepatocytes via the LDL receptor [81]. Although the reports identified here for active liver targeting highlight the extensive efforts and strategies employed to efficiently deliver therapeutic nucleic acids to hepatocytes, LNPs have emerged as the most advanced non-viral carriers for delivering nucleic acids to liver. However, the hepatocyte-targeting ability of LNPs relays on endogenous mechanisms, and for this reason, scarce studies involving LNPs have been identified in this systematic review, focused on active targeting. In this regard, LNPs lacking any active targeting ligand have been studied to deliver mRNA encoding \u03b1-Gal A to hepatocytes of Fabry mice and non-human primates after i.v. administration [82,83]. Despite further studies with these LNPs have not been reported up to date, initial results showed the production of functional \u03b1-Gal A in the liver, which then was secreted into the circulation. Secreted \u03b1-Gal A was taken up by distal tissues such as kidney, heart, and spleen and attenuated substrate accumulation in affected tissues. These hallmarks, while valuable for liver hepatocyte applications, severely limit the use of these LNP technologies beyond the liver. Recently, a methodology termed selective organ targeting (SORT) has been developed, which enables controllable delivery of nucleic acids to target tissues [65]. SORT LNPs involve the inclusion of SORT molecules, such as chargebased lipids, that accurately tune delivery to extrahepatic tissues after i.v. administration. This strategy, added to the recognized efficacy of LNPs, represents a great advance in the development of systems targeting extrahepatic organs, and it has been included in at least two patents [84,85].",

            "text": "Upon entering the blood stream, nanoparticles rapidly absorb serum proteins on their surface. The effects of protein corona heavily control the biodistribution of nanoparticles. For some LNPs, ApoE adsorption is essential for the cellular uptake of LNPs. Akinc et al. (15) have described the role of ApoE in the in vivo uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes. They compared the uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes in wild-type and ApoE knockout mice. The activity of LNPs was remarkably reduced in ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) mice compared to wild-type mice. Since the major cell population in the liver is hepatocytes and they overexpress LDLR, an alternative targeting ligand is necessary for LSEC-specific delivery of RNA other than the ApoE. Previously, specific targeting ligands were evaluated for enhancing the selective delivery of LNPs to target cells (15). Kumar et al. (36) showed decreased activity of LNPs with higher PEG-lipid content in hepatocytes due to reduced association of ApoE with LNPs. They showed that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid have a lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to LNPs with 1.5% PEG-lipid. By introducing unique targeting ligands to the highly PEGylated LNPs, ApoE-mediated cellular uptake can be blocked and selective delivery of LNPs can be achieved. \n\nAmong various liver cells, LSECs are substantial targets for RNA therapeutics because LSECs are closely related to fetal liver diseases resulting from LSECs-derived gene products (17,19). To achieve the selective delivery of LNPs to LSECs, we introduced LSEC-specific ligands to highly PEGylated LNPs. Mannose receptor is one of the receptors that specifically expressed on human and mice LSECs (17). Mannose-conjugated nanoparticles have been investigated in various targeted delivery studies, and these nanoparticles have been proven to be safe (37,38).",

            "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

[195] reported a novel modifiable LNP platform called selective organ targeting (SORT) LNP, which adds a fifth lipid component to the established LNP formulation.SORT LNPs delivered different CRISPR cargoes, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA-sgRNA, and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, for efficient genome editing in the liver, lungs, and spleen after i.v.administration.Although this strategy is very promising in expanding the usefulness of LNPs, the possible reason why SORT LNPs preferentially accumulate in the liver is that they are easily opsonized and captured by the hepatocytes, partially due to ApoE binding to the LNPs in the blood steam [196].In addition, selective delivery to the lungs may result from the positive surface charge of intravascular SORT LNPs [195].Therefore, to achieve more success in other tissues, such as the brain, stealth SORT LNPs will be needed [195].This could potentially be a promising start for the application of precision LNPs to target the brain.",

            "text": "As in hepatic targets, there are no direct carrier (ApoE) mediated targeting avenues for extra-hepatic targets. Several approaches, therefore, have been employed for non-hepatic targets. In this regard, selective organ targeting (SORT) has been explored by Dillard and coworkers [59], where a fifth component (or SORT molecule), in addition to the conventional four-lipid composition of LNPs, enables extrahepatic targeting of LNPs. The authors hypothesized that after desorption of PEG lipids on the LNP surface, the underlying SORT molecules are exposed and recognized by distinct serum proteins. These serum proteins then adsorb onto the LNP surface and lead the LNPs to the targeted organ by interacting with cognate receptors expressed by cells in the target organs, akin to the ApoE-based LNP accumulation in the liver. The group successfully demonstrated liver, spleen, and lung delivery, and has shown potential for other important delivery targets. The SORT molecule library also consists of lipids of diverse pKas. It was determined that 6-7 pKa lipids are best suited to liver targeting, greater than 9 pKa lipids are ideal for lung targeting, and 2-6 pKa lipids are best suited to spleen targeting [59]. \n\nMeyer et al. [60] have also thoroughly reviewed extrahepatic targeting for mRNA delivery, which was found be in concurrence with the SORT approach, where positively charged lipids and negatively charged LNPs were found to preferentially accumulate in the lungs and spleen, respectively. Additionally, poly-beta amino ester (PBAE) polymer [61,62], 1,2-di-O-octadecenyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTMA) lipid, 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) lipid [63], and polyacrylic acid (PAA) polymers [64] were found to target the lungs by altering the PEG lipid, helper lipid, and N/P ratio.",

Currently, various strategies have been developed to overcome such challenges. To further improve the stability and protect the drug from leaking, the lipidic structures have been modified that effectively form complex with the encapsulated chemotherapeutic via ionic attraction. Further stability of LNPs in systemic circulation was accomplished by PEGylating the LNPs, which safeguard them by reducing their recognition via RES. However, such approach leads to the production of anti-PEG antibodies which reduces the therapeutic efficacy of the LNPs. This incidence results in finding an alternative for PEGylation upon repeated administration. In addition to establish safety and therapeutic efficacy during prolonged circulation, the LNPs must also exhibit enhanced targetability and cellular internalization at the site of action [105]. To accomplish such objectives, the LNPs are fabricated with selective ligands which enables release of drug on targeted site when triggered by aberrations in pH, temperature, oxidation, or reduction within the tumor microenvironment [105,161].",

(132) altered LNPs with selective organ targeting molecules that interact with distinct serum proteins that in turn recognize specific receptors in targeted tissues (e.g., liver, lung, spleen). Other groups are modifying LNPs with ligands that directly interact with receptors on target tissues or that help the LNPs transit biological barriers (reviewed in Ref. (133)). \n\nSeveral studies have shown that cationic and ionizable lipids can stimulate the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (reviewed in Ref. (134)), which can interfere with drug efficacy. Lokugamage et al. (135) observed that LNP-mediated Toll-like receptor 4 activation blocked mRNA translation in all the cell types they tested, and yet, it did not disrupt LNP uptake by cells. Others have noticed that the attachment of PEG to enhance LNP performance may also induce hypersensitivity reactions, accelerating blood clearance of pegylated LNPs and thereby reducing their efficacy. \n\nThe transient nature of RNA therapeutics is both a distinct advantage of the modality and a potential drawback as it impacts dosage and dosing frequency. Many disease states will require repeat dosing of the RNA, making the overall tolerability of LNP-encapsulated RNA an absolute necessity. This need is driving drug developers to find the ideal lipid composition for efficient targeting, reduced hepatotoxicity and immunogenicity, and fast biodegradability (reviewed in Ref. (136)), without compromising the required potency or stability.",

            "text": "In vivo transfection studies demonstrated that particles with the shorter Tween 20 were able to target the lymph nodes more efficiently. The longer Tween 80, on the other hand, formed LNPs that targeted the spleen but with lower efficiency. LNPs with the linear DSPE-PEG showed predominantly localized transfection at the injection site. Altogether, this study demonstrated that PEGylation of LNPs with branched PEG is a viable approach to target organs with effective transfection selectively [52]. It is hypothesized that, aside from the molecular weight and structure, the PEG density on the particle is also an important factor. Across the three types of LNPs, PEGylation of positively charged lipid nanoparticles showed much difference than bare ones [52]. PEGylation prevented positively charged lipid nanoparticles from high retention at the site of administration. Whilst PEGylation has been proven useful to prevent premature clearance of particle from the systemic circulation, the production of anti-PEG antibodies has emerged as detrimental co-lateral damage. Recently, efforts have been directed towards alternative strategies with biocompatible polymers to prevent the production of anti-PEG antibodies after the first dose that would otherwise lead to a loss of therapeutic efficacy with potential for adverse effects upon subsequent doses [53]. Concurrently, Chen et al. \n\nfound that incorporation of 4 mol% dexamethasones in lipid-based nanoparticles was able to suppress the immune responses and antibody production after injection [26], which might be promising for the development of pegylated lipid nanocarriers. Aside from relying on prolonged circulation and passive cellular uptake of nanoparticles, formulation scientists have realized that, by conjugation of a receptor ligand to the particle surface, uptake into target cells could be enhanced. Modification of lipidbased nanoparticles with targeting ligands is a key strategy for efficiently targeting delivery systems into the lymph nodes or other desired tissues/cells. For example, Vu et al. functionalized liposome surface with Hemagglutinin Antigen (HA) to improve antibody production efficiency [54].",

            "text": "owever, it should be underlined that one of the main challenges in using LNPs as drug delivery vehicles is their tendency to aggregate. By coating LNPs with PEG, the hydrophilic PEG chains create a steric hindrance that hinders the interaction of LNPs with each other, thus preventing aggregation. Hence, if effective strategies are developed to produce stealth LNPs without relying on PEGylation, it will also be essential to devise methods to reduce their tendency to aggregate. \n\nAnother constraint of the approved LNPs is their untargeted nature, resulting in a lack of specificity regarding their delivery to cells or tissues. This lack of targeting capability increases the potential for unwanted, off-target accumulation of the vaccine components, which can potentially lead to unpredictable side effects. LNP optimization for the efficient transfection of APCs, having a crucial role in the immune response, might improve the efficiency of the current mRNA vaccines. \n\nOne of the primary goals of future research will be to enhance LNP vaccines with a distinct targeting ability, specifically directed toward APCs. Among possible targeting strategies (reviewed in ref 21), one of the most consolidated approaches involves the conjugation of ligands to PEG moieties, creating stealth and targeted nanomedicine. This strategy aims to combine the supposed benefits of PEGylation with the specific binding capabilities of ligands, enabling targeted delivery to specific cells or tissues. However, issues related to ligand specificity, stability, and binding affinity play crucial roles in the success of targeted delivery. Other challenges include the heterogeneity and dynamic nature of target cells, which can exhibit variations in receptor expression and internalization mechanisms. Furthermore, the immune system's response to targeted NPs, such as the development of antidrug antibodies or immune clearance, poses additional hurdles to successful delivery. Despite extensive research in this field, the translation of targeted NP delivery into clinical applications has been therefore hindered, resulting in limited success. 22 In recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs.",

            "text": "But the consistent detection of the LNPs and transgene products in the circulation suggests that mRNA LNPs and their activities in tissues other than the injection sites should be addressed for a complete evaluation of their safety and efficacy profiles. Furthermore, it is found in this study that the biodistribution of LNPs was not linearly in agreement with the transgene expression by the encapsulated mRNAs due to the difference in the efficiency of mRNA release in tissues (Fig. 3). The distribution of LNPs in muscle tissues is more than three times that in liver when intramuscularly injected (Fig. 2). Yet, the mRNA expression efficacies were equivalent (Fig. 6). This indicates that even fewer LNPs captured in liver can result in a comparable amount of transgene proteins with that in muscles. The LNP exposure and the transgenic protein level were not linearly correlated. This non-linear relationship between the LNP exposure and the protein expression level varies in different tissues and organs. In addition, as shown in Fig. 6, even when more small particles could accumulate in the liver than the medium particles, the luciferase activities in the liver did not become stronger. Such difference could result from the size preference of endocytosis by cells. \n\nSystemic exposure of mRNA-LNPs may lead to off-target expression of transgenes and elicit various adverse reactions including inflammation, allergic, hemolysis, etc. (27,28). The duration and kinetics of the transgene expression are affected by the PK and biodistribution of the delivery systems. The PK-PD relationship of mRNA LNPs is highly complex, making the prediction of gene expression and efficacy (PD) unlikely just based on the LNP exposures in tissue (PK). Nevertheless, it is prudent to fully characterize the PK in order to optimize the PD and minimize the toxicities of a gene delivery product (29,30).",

In addition, immunoglobulins in immune plasma make up a higher percentage of the total precipitated proteome for LNP36 compared with LNP34 ( Figures S6C  and S6D). We hypothesized that both LNP types bind anti-PEG antibodies, but that anti-PEG is released faster from LNP34 than from LNP36 due to the shorter acyl chain of its PEG lipid. Indeed, LNP34 and LNP36 showed a comparable initial opsonization by anti-PEG antibodies in vitro. However, upon incubation with mouse serum, the amount of anti-PEG antibody bound to LNP34 decreased over time, Ighv8-5  whereas it remained constant in the case of LNP36 ( Figure S6E). The gradual loss of anti-PEG from LNP34-presumably due to shedding of the PEG lipid-coincided with an increase in LNP size ( Figure S6F). In contrast, LNP36 size was relatively unaltered after 2 h incubation with serum, indicating DSG-PEG2000 was still incorporated in LNP and bound to anti-PEG antibodies. Taken together, these data strongly indicate that LNP36 becomes increasingly opsonized by antibodies upon repeated administration, potentially altering its biodistribution. In contrast, LNP34 shows only short-lived immunoglobulin opsonization.\n\nThe spleen-centered biodistribution of mRNA deposition is retained in non-human primates\n\nTo exclude species-specific differences in the biodistribution of LNPs that could hamper clinical translation, we assessed the biodistribution of LNP36-delivered mRNA in female and male cynomolgus monkeys.

For instance, for nanoparticles containing anionic phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidic acid, researchers have observed more specific delivery to the spleen (60%, 50%, and 75%, respectively) than to the liver (20%, 45%, and 5%, respectively) (LoPresti et al., 2022). On the other hand, another group of authors (Pattipeiluhu et al., 2022) has reported that for LNPs containing phosphatidylglycerol, accumulation in the liver occurs predominantly in sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, in contrast to phosphatidylcholine-containing LNPs, whose accumulation takes place equally in hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells. \n\nThe introduction of an additional charged helper lipid as a fifth component also enables investigators to alter targeting efficiency of LNPs. Not so long ago (Dilliard et al., 2021), scientists achieved almost 100% reporter mRNA expression in the liver, spleen, or lungs by means of an additional neutral, negatively, or positively charged lipid, respectively. Targeting to an organ depended there on apparent pK a of nanoparticles: at pK a < 5, the particles accumulated mainly in the spleen; at pK a of 6.2-6.4, mainly in the liver; whereas at pK a > 11, mainly in lungs. It is noteworthy that at pK a of 6.5-11, there was selective distribution of LNPs into the lungs and spleen at different levels, indicating a nonobvious dependence of the LNP biodistribution on the charge. It is likely that pK a can serve as a good predictor of bioactivity. For classic fourcomponent LNPs, apparent pK a was 6.3-6.6 in the above study, depending on the ionizable cationic lipid used.",

            "text": "In the case of LNPs, PEG length and alkyl chain affect both surface chemistry and PEG shedding rate [67], thereby influencing the surface coronation and targeting tissues.Pegylation plays a crucial role in determining the in vivo destination of LNPs and their payloads, suggesting its significance for LNP-mRNA therapeutic applications.Despite all the strides made, the underlying mechanisms and relationships between tissue targeting properties of LNP and protein corona formation remain elusive.Certain occurrences, such as the alteration of corona formation, have resulted in changes in tissue accumulation, yet a proper explanation is lacking [70].\n\nPrevious attempts illustrated that specific protein may serve as the nutrition or major supplement for the organs or the cells.There is also an explanation related to the receptor-mediated recognition, for which the most commonly acknowledged one is LDLR-corona protein-ApoE assisted liver targeting of LNP.However, various LDL receptors were identified other than ApoE, such as ApoA1.Basic knowledge related to physiology and pharmacodynamics remains to be explored.Therefore, while we appreciate the creativity of the concept of corona, it currently serves no more than a hypothesis in a long journey to promote LNP-mRNA into clinical stage.The lack of a liable detection technique also hinders the understanding of the protein corona phenomenon and stalls its development.Enabling in situ analysis of protein corona formation is crucial since current post-analysis via centrifugation separation and mass spectrometry is insufficient to unveil the authentic situation of protein adsorption around LNPs in the blood circulation.In a recent work, Zhan and colleagues [97] optimized the extraction of the corona in incubating serum by applying chromatography containing PEG-scFv (single-chain variable fragment).This facilitated the separation of pegylated nanoparticles and proteins while minimizing the depletion of protein corona components.Last but not least, predicting the in vivo performance of the corona protein formation around LNP, especially the stereochemistry and conformation of the absorbed proteins, which are essential to the cell-specific internalizations and successful translation of actively targeted LNP-mRNA, remains challenging.",

            "text": "A platform technology that delivers RNA therapeutics to targeted cells has great potential for treating various liver diseases associated with different types of cells in the liver. In particular, LSECs participate in initiation and progression of chronic liver diseases by change in their pathological characteristics in response to chemical toxins, cytokines, and inflammatory stimuli (17,19). Previous studies have shown that targeting endothelial sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 and Bax in LSECs could also reduce apoptosis of LSECs and eventually reduced acute hepatic failure (43,44). The conjugation of hyaluronan, KLGR peptide, and mannose resulted in increased uptake of nano particles into LSECs compared to nonconjugated groups. Moreover, previously reported studies have confirmed that LNPs can be delivered to different tissue by changing LNP formulations. Some of these formulations showed increased mRNA delivery to LSECs without targeting ligands (45). Nevertheless, its selectivity remained not well understood (37). \n\nTo translate the targeted delivery to LSECs, ApoE-dependent cellular uptake must be replaced by alternative ligand selection and incorporation. Upon entering blood circulation system, LNPs can be readily delivered to hepatocytes and LSECs by ApoE-dependent cellular uptake. However, delivery efficacy of LNPs in LSECs is significantly less than that of hepatocytes (23). Here, we demonstrated a targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs by incorporating active ligands to LNPs. The mannose ligand can interact with specific receptors (CD206) expressed on LSECs. We have shown that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) allowed selective delivery of mRNA/siRNA only to LSECs through mannose-CD206 interaction. It is likely that, when PEGlipid content is high enough, the ApoE-mediated cellular uptake is mostly reduced, while mannose-CD206 interaction becomes predominant for the cellular entry of LNPs. Moreover, mannoseincorporated LNPs showed bigger physical size than the diameter of the fenestrae.",

This helped to drive the optimization of SORT-LNP for therapeutic applications in tissues and organs such as lung, liver, and spleen, greatly expanding the scope of mRNA vaccines and drugs as well as CRISPR gene editing therapies. This study found that the chemistry of the added SORT molecule controlled the organ-level biodistribution, acid dissociation constant (pKa), and serum protein adsorption of SORT-LNP. Specifically, PEGylated lipids dissociate from the LNP surface and expose SORT molecules, different serum proteins recognize the exposed SORT molecules and adsorb to the LNP surface, and surface-adsorbed proteins interact with cellexpressed cognate receptors in target organs to facilitate mRNA delivery to these tissues (Figure 10(b)). These findings establish a critical link between the molecular composition of SORT-LNP and its unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that recruitment of specific proteins to the LNP surface can enable targeted delivery outside the liver. The results of this study suggest that endogenous targeting, that is, tuning the molecular composition of nanoparticles to bind to specific proteins in the serum so that they can be delivered to the target site may be an effective strategy for achieving extrahepatic delivery of nanocarriers.",

In particular, mannose receptors (CD206) have been attracting attention because they are expressed on immunocompetent cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as on vascular endothelial cells [90]. Applying this strategy, an attempt to modify the cell selectivity in the liver by mannose modification was also reported in LNPs [49]. The pharmacokinetics of general LNPs is determined by the formation of protein corona especially after systemic administration, as described above. To make active targeting dominant, it is necessary to inhibit the formation of protein corona. It has been reported that increasing the amount of PEG-lipids reduced the interaction with ApoE and the LDLR-mediated delivery to hepatocytes. Therefore, in the LNPs based on ionizable lipids, DOPE, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid, the amount of PEG-lipid was increased to 3%, which is higher than general LNPs, and 2.5% of it was replaced with mannose-modified PEG-lipid. In the evaluation of firefly luciferase mRNA as a reporter, the mannose modification of LNPs did not change the liver-specific protein expression. The cellular pattern of protein expression in the liver, however, changed significantly in an evaluation using LSL-tdTomato mice. In the original LNPs, the percentage of tdTomato-positive cells was~70% for hepatocytes,~10% for liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and~5% for Kupffer cells; in the mannose-modified LNPs, the percentage was~15% for hepatocytes,~70% for LSECs, and~15% for Kupffer cells.

However, PEGylation is still not well understood and the best strategy remains unclear. In this work, we established a new PEGylation strategy to investigate the PEGylation effect on in vivo biodistribution. The PIC micelles were labeled with 125 I using the chloramine-T method. By monitoring the radioactive count with a Gamma counter, the in vivo fate of the PEG-0, PEG-25, PEG-50, and PEG-75 was systematically studied over 48 hours. Simultaneously, the Gamma camera images of different micelles were recorded using a small-animal in vivo imaging system. After IV administration with a dose of 5 mg micelles/kg (weight of BALB/c mice), various tissues including the heart, liver, spleen, lung, renal, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, genitalia, skeletal muscle, brain, and blood were harvested; the accumulation of micelles in these tissues is shown in Figure 8. generally decreased with time. This could be attributed to the clearance effect of the RES organs. When the micelles entered blood circulation, opsonic proteins would be adsorbed onto the micelles and form a protein corona, which could be recognized by receptors on the surface of macrophages of the liver, spleen, and other RES organs. 29 Thus, most of the micelles could be efficiently phagocytosed by these cells and cleared under degradation by various enzymes in these cells. In Figures 8A and 10, the blood concentration of PEG-0 gradually decreased, while concentration in the liver and spleen first increased and then decreased, indicating the balance of deposition and clearance of micelles in these organs. PEG-0 showed the longest circulation time in the bloodstream and the least accumulation in liver and spleen. For example, the amount of PEG-0 remaining in the bloodstream (33.7%ID) was more than ten times higher than that of PEG-25 (2.9%ID), PEG-50 (0.9%ID), and PEG-75 (2.7%ID) at 8 hours after",

            "text": "EGFR is reported to be widely expressed (e.g. liver and kidney) [47,48], and hence the higher kidney uptake could be due to receptor mediated binding of 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG6000 NP, which would be expected to increase due to the reduction in non-specific uptake by MPS. Targeting ligands have often been conjugated to the distal end of PEG, to ensure access of the ligand to the targeted cell-surface molecule [49][50][51][52]. However, since the purpose of PEG is to provide a stealth effect, the presence of the targeting ligand at the distal end of PEG could introduce a new target for opsonins [25,53]. EGF, which is a small peptide, was directly attached to the Au NP surface and 'hidden' by the long-chain PEG (i.e. PEG6000). Interestingly, although PEG had a modest inhibitory effect on EGF-EGFR interaction, PEGylated EGF-Au NP targeted EGFR and were efficiently taken up by MDA-MB-468 cells/xenografts without compromising the PEG stealth effect. \n\nPEGylation can help prevent sequestration of NP by the MPS. However, accumulation in the liver and spleen is still commonly observed for NP with hydrodynamic size of over 8 nm, representing a general challenge for targeted drug delivery nanosystems. This phenomenon may be further compounded by the interaction of the EGF moiety with EGFR in normal tissues, particularly the liver. \n\nWe investigated whether coadministration of unlabelled targeting ligands (i.e. EGF) could mitigate this effect and found that the in vivo fate of 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG6000 NP, as seen from SPECT scans (Figure 5 and S6) and biodistribution data (Figure 7C and 7D), was indeed altered. Unlabelled EGF (30 \u00b5g) inhibited the accumulation of radioactivity in liver, spleen and kidney.",

            "text": "Chemical modification with polyethylene glycol (PEGylation) is one strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of biotherapeutics including monoclonal antibodies, cytokines and immunotoxins. PEGylation is routinely used in the pharmaceutical industry to increase the serum halflife and stability of drugs, as evidenced by 14 PEGylated drugs approved by the FDA and many others in human clinical trials [39]. However, such a strategy did not lead to improved clinical efficacy in immunotoxin treatments, even though efficacies observed in preclinical models suggested it a viable option. Site-specific PEGylation of LMB-2 on the lysine residues (anti-CD25-PE38 immunotoxin) led to about a 20-fold increase in therapeutic efficacy, including a 3-4-fold higher anti-tumor activity and about 6-fold reduction in normal tissue toxicity in preclinical mouse models [40]. PEGylation, on one hand, reduced offtarget toxicity caused by the nonspecific binding of LMB-2 to normal tissues such as liver cells [41]. PEGylation of the cytotoxic moiety shields the ionic interactions thus reducing the nonspecific cellular absorption and uptake by normal tissues. The increased molecule size also limits the transport of PEGylated immunotoxin from blood to normal tissues like the lung, kidney and liver [42]. On the other hand, PEGylation increases serum half-life and stability of immunotoxin while reducing immunogenicity. The same strategy was used to reduce the antigen-independent toxicity of a non-binding ADC with a hydrophobic MMAE payload [43]. Similarly, shielding of the hydrophobic payload with optimal PEGylation reduced systemic toxicity by slower clearance and dramatically decreased nonspecific cellular uptake in normal tissues (Fig. 1A) [43]. Even though PEGylation improves the therapeutic efficacy of a drug, this technology is also facing many challenges [44]. The steric hindrance caused by long PEG chains may either interfere with the targeting moiety binding to its receptor or limit the furin cleavage efficiency of pseudomonas exotoxin.",

            "text": "By adjusting the ratio of lipids in LNPs, the targeting ability of LNPs to different organs can be tailored. Siegwart et al. [62] discovered that modifying the composition and components of LNPs allows for the selective targeting of organs. These passively targeted LNPs are termed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles, facilitating controlled nucleic acid delivery to specific tissues. Lung-targeting SORT LNPs feature a notably different protein corona from liver-targeting LNPs, with a reduced enrichment of ApoE, complement components, and immunoglobulins as well as increased enrichment of vitronectin (Vtn) among other proteins [63] (Figure 4). SORT LNPs contain SORT molecules and can accurately regulate delivery to the mouse liver, lungs, and spleen after intravenous injection [64] (Table 2). Siegwart et al. [65] conducted an exploration of the targeted mechanism of SORT LNPs. They speculated that different SORT molecules may cause LNPs to absorb different plasma proteins, thereby achieving tissue-specific mRNA delivery. Mass spectrometry analysis of the protein corona of different SORT LNPs revealed that the main proteins adsorbed by LNPs from the liver, lungs, and spleen were apolipoprotein E (apoE), vitronectin, and \u03b2-2-glycoprotein I, respectively. This suggests the potential to elucidate the targeting mechanism in extrahepatic tissues. Flux screening represents another method for developing tissue-specific LNPs. Dahlman et al. [66] developed a research strategy called the Joint Rapid DNA Analysis of Nanoparticles, utilizing DNA barcodes and sequencing techniques. This strategy enables the high-throughput screening of LNP formulations by encapsulating unique DNA sequences. Each LNP formulation is associated with a unique DNA barcode sequence. Using flow cytometry and nextgeneration sequencing techniques, hundreds of LNP formulations can be simultaneously analyzed to identify the relationship between LNPs and tissue-or cell-specific delivery [67]. \n\ngeneration sequencing techniques, hundreds of LNP formulations can be simultaneously analyzed to identify the relationship between LNPs and tissue-or cell-specific delivery [67].",

            "text": "However, it is worth pointing out that these alterations do not completely ablate the Fc effector function. In addition, it is crucial for mAbs to retain FcRn binding since this interaction sequesters the mAb in the acidic pH of endosomes, thereby preventing catabolism of the antibody in the lysosomes. 221 ubsequently, the antibody is recycled back to the surface of the cell and into circulation, which ultimately results in an increase in its half-life. 221 To further increase the PK property of mAbs, introduction of a triple substitution M252Y/S254T/T256E (YTE) into the Fc region has been proposed to enhance the affinity of mAbs for FcRn at pH 6.0. 219 Taken together, the aim of these antibody-engineering approaches for oligonucleotide delivery is to attenuate the binding of mAb to Fc\u03b3R without adversely affecting FcRn binding. \n\nImprovements in Oligonucleotide Delivery via LNPs. Delivery of oligonucleotides via LNPs also requires further refinement. \u2212229 In addition, due to their physiochemical properties, LNPs tend to be taken up by the liver, 108,230 meaning there is a need for effective detargeting strategies. 107,231,232 etargeting is characterized as the inhibition of LNP delivery to the liver, whereas retargeting is defined as the furthering of LNP delivery to the desired extrahepatic tissue. Some detargeting approaches that have shown success include coating of nonfouling materials (to resist APOE binding) 233\u2212235 or the addition of SORT molecules (to facilitate the binding of LNPs to other serum proteins). 118,119 However, these technologies have their own limitations since nonfouling materials may inhibit endosomal escape 112,113 and SORT molecule composition may need to be optimized across different species and populations for appropriate serum protein binding. 236,237 pproaches for the improvement of detargeting and retargeting may involve innovations in lipid chemistry for lipid components in LNPs or LNP formulation, or the engineering of appropriate protein corona on the LNP surface.",

            "text": "LNP typically consists of four components, including ionizable lipids, cholesterol, helper phospholipid, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids [86].\n\nThese four components can form stable nanoparticles to encapsulate and protect vulnerable mRNA. Upon entering the cells through endocytosis, they become positively charged in the acidic environment of endosomes, facilitating the subsequent release of the RNAs into the cytoplasm. However, LNP-formulated mRNAs tend to accumulate in the liver, possibly due to the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) onto the LNP surface followed by the ApoE receptor-mediated uptake to hepatocytes [50]. Most of the LNP-mRNA drugs are concentrated in the liver and spleen after tail vein administration, while a small amount is preserved in adipose tissues [87]. When administered intramuscularly, the expression of mRNA drugs is mainly found in the liver, muscle, and lymph nodes [88,89].\n\nIn addition, non-liver delivery of LNP may be achieved by modifying lipid compositions, which includes changing the lipid identities and/or adjusting lipid ratios. The LNP composition can substantially affect the intracellular delivery efficiency, determine cell specificity of delivery, and modulate immunogenicity.\n\nFor instance, the addition of SORT lipids to LNP changed the organ-targeting properties of LNP in vivo and achieved mRNA delivery to a lot of organs other than the liver [90]. Moreover, SORT is compatible with various gene-editing technologies, such as Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Changes in LNP surface chemistry through modulating PEG-lipid structure were found to assist LNP targeting of bone marrow endothelial cells in the hematopoietic stem cell niche [91], which may also be used in mRNA delivery. Interestingly, LNP technologies can achieve targeted delivery by adjusting the stoichiometry of LNP components, which was exemplified by the success in lymph node-targeting delivery of mRNA in mice [92].\n\nOther strategies, like additional non-lipid components in LNP formulation, also contribute to the",

            "text": "LNPs are effective in targeting the liver; however, to understand their localization, it is important to distinguish biodistribution from functional delivery. This distinction helps clarify how LNPs can target specific organs such as the liver while guaranteeing the therapeutic cargo is effectively delivered in the target cells. 32,52 Biodistribution is the process of LNPs accumulating in specific tissues after entering circulation, while functional delivery depends on the successful release and action of the therapeutic cargo (e.g., mRNA or small interfering RNA [siRNA]) in target cells. 53 This distinction is important because LNPs can accumulate in tissues such as the liver without producing intended therapeutic effects. \n\nFunctional delivery may be impaired by factors such as inadequate endosomal escape or protein corona, 54 which can drive LNP accumulation in non-target cells while hindering cellular uptake and effective intracellular delivery in target cells. Proteomic analyses have shown that the composition of the protein corona can affect nanoparticlecell interactions, altering both the distribution and efficacy of the delivery system by influencing receptor recognition and endocytosis mechanisms. 55 Functional delivery is also impacted by challenges in intracellular trafficking and cargo release once inside cells. [58] Several studies have demonstrated rapid liver accumulation of LNPs within minutes of administration, largely due to the liver's extensive blood flow and porous endothelium. 24,35,59 However, this high level of accumulation does not directly translate to efficient functional www.moleculartherapy.org Review delivery. Recent work by Lam et al. 60 showed that while LNPs of different sizes can accumulate similarly in the liver, their functional delivery to hepatocytes varies between species. In non-human primates, smaller LNPs (50-60 nm) showed approximately 5-fold higher protein expression in liver compared with conventional larger particles (70-80 nm). More importantly, both formulations exhibited similar pharmacokinetic profiles and liver accumulation. This finding demonstrates that the liver microarchitecture, for example, the size of liver fenestrae, which are smaller in primates than rodents, is important for efficient delivery. This result is further supported by Sato et al., 61 who showed that uptake mechanisms in hepatocytes vary based on ionizable lipid structure.",

            "text": "This LNP selectively adsorbs plasma proteins following intravenous injection and specifically edits liver macrophages to enhance phagocytosis and initiate immune responses within tumors, thereby effectively halting the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma [131]. As a pivotal nanocarrier system, LNPs offer numerous advantages, including a simple structure, versatile compositions, and notable benefits [132][133][134][135]. The efficiency of drug loading and targeted release is influenced by the adjustment of lipid composition and structure, which enhances drug bioavailability and efficacy. LNPs also exhibit excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, rarely causing immune or toxic reactions. Despite the widespread use of LNPs in drug delivery, especially in gene therapy and vaccine development, their immunogenicity remains a concern. LNP formulations, particularly those used for mRNA vaccines, have been shown to trigger inflammatory responses. These immune responses can vary based on the composition of the lipids, with some ionizable lipids being more immunogenic than others [136]. Modifying lipid structures or incorporating additional excipients to reduce immunogenicity is an ongoing area of research aimed at improving the clinical safety profile of LNP-based therapies [137]. Targeting can be improved by modifying surfactants or lipid molecules, reducing drug toxicity to normal tissues, and enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. The size, shape, and surface properties of LNPs can be precisely tailored to meet various drug requirements through adjustments in formulation and processing conditions. Recent advancements in LNP technology have focused on the development of new lipid materials to enhance stability and functionality. For instance, the incorporation of ionizable lipids in LNPs has dramatically improved the efficiency of nucleic acid delivery by facilitating endosomal escape. Additionally, functionalizing the LNP surface with targeting ligands, such as peptides or antibodies, enables precise targeting of specific cell types, further enhancing therapeutic potential. PEGylation (the attachment of polyethylene glycol chains) is another widely used strategy to extend the circulation time of LNPs in vivo by reducing their recognition by the immune system [138].",

Therefore, we proposed the following hypotheses: enhanced liver-targeting transfection is the result of (1) the tissue-specific biodistribution of LNPs, (2) the differential cellular uptake profiles of LNPs following distribution into the local tissue, and (3) the differential endosomal escape or DNA release abilities of LNPs, even between formulations with similar biodistribution and cellular uptake levels. \n\nTo test our hypotheses, we first examined the serum stability and biodistribution of the four top-performing LNPs at 6, 12, and 24 h after i.v. injection using Cy5-labeled pDNA. For comparison, we included two LNP formulations (DI-6 and FIII-1) that were less effective but possessed similar characteristics (size and zeta potential) to the topperforming ones (Supplementary Fig. 7). As Supplementary Fig. 8 showed, there was no significant difference between top-performing LNPs and low-performing ones observed in terms of size change in serum containing PBS. IVIS imaging showed that all six selected formulations, independent of transfection performance, had similar biodistribution profiles at all time points (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Fig. 9). In all cases, ~60% of LNPs were distributed to the liver at 6 h after i.v. administration. In addition, similar uptake levels by hepatocytes were seen for all six formulations, with flow cytometry assessment indicating that the high transfection by the top formulations was not caused by differences in biodistribution nor cellular uptake level (Fig. 6b). To verify that the transfection efficiency of LNPs was not related to biodistribution, we checked the transfection efficiency of six LNPs by administering the same dose of the six LNPs via intrahepatic injection. The results in Fig. 6c and d showed that although the same dosage was delivered to the liver, the local transfection efficiency was significantly different.",

This approach holds the potential to mitigate the undesirable delivery of LNPs to extrahepatic organs, thereby minimizing the occurrence of side effects. The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) is overexpressed on the surface of hepatoma cells. It has been suggested that ASGPR-mediated endocytosis is an effective delivery strategy. 6][167][168] Another idea is to conjugate the LNPs with ASGPR mAb, which may be an attempt. 167 n a study by Kim et al., 169 it was found that achieving LSEC-specific RNA delivery, could not succeed by controlling the size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. Due to the specific expression of mannose receptors on human and mouse LSECs, they prepared LNPs doped with 0.5-4.5% mannose PEG-lipid, and found that incorporation of mannose to LNPs with high PEG-lipid content (3%) has the best LSECs selective delivery effect. 169,170 Miao et al. 171 have proposed a glycolipid-like polymer named galactosylated chitosan oligosaccharide-SS-octadecylamine (Gal-CSSO). The galactosyl residues modified on it can selectively target HCs, the chitosan oligosaccharide is conducive to the endosomal escape, and the structure of -SS-can help the HC microenvironment respond to facilitate drug release. \n\nMany carriers with excellent liver selective delivery have been approved for drug delivery or have started clinical trials.

We focused on studies using intravenous administration into mice or rats as model systems, which are the systems likely to be studied for initial evaluation of VLP-based targeted therapeutics.\n\nThe distribution of MS2 VLPs, labeled internally with 64 Cu or 18 F, was determined in mice at 24 hr and rats at 3 hr after intravenous administration. In both cases, MS2 accumulated primarily in the liver and the spleen. 114,121 PEGylation of MS2 was also studied since PEG has been shown to act as a \"stealth agent\" to avoid immune clearance. 121 PEGylated MS2 VLPs behaved similarly, except retention in the spleen was significantly reduced. 121 This ability to avoid the immune system is extremely valuable as it will likely increase the effective dose that reaches the targeted tissue. Furthermore, work has shown that the CD47 ectodomain or the CD47 \"self-peptide,\" which has been displayed on VLPs, can also be used to avoid the immune system. 106 Qb, labeled externally with gadolinium, was also studied in mice at 4-5 hr after intravenous administration. 97 Qb VLPs accumulated in the liver, but unlike MS2, accumulated at lower levels in the spleen. 97 The biodistribution of the plant virus-based VLPs, CCMV, and CPMV, intravenously injected in mice at various times, are mostly similar. They primarily accumulate in the liver, spleen, kidney, and GI tract. 61,103,[133][134][135] CCMV, labeled with 125I, also showed significant retention by the thyroid, probably due to the iodine. 61 PEGylation of CPMV VLPs greatly reduced accumulation in the liver and spleen, which suggests CCMV and CPMV could also benefit from the CD47 ectodomain displayed on the surface to avoid the immune system. 106,134 Because developing VLP-based targeted therapies for cancer is a primary application, biodistribution studies in mice possessing",

            "text": "PEG-lipids reduce aggregation of the LNPs and prolong the circulation time of the particles once administered. The molar ratio at which the lipid components are mixed is not uniform across mRNA therapeutic products and may impact the biological activity of the drug product. Roces et al. demonstrated that altering the lipid molar ratios impacts both size and zeta potential of the LNPs [200]. These characteristics of the LNP impact the biodistribution and immunogenicity of the drug product and should therefore be optimized according to the application. Studies evaluating lipid-based systems administered through subcutaneous and intramuscular injection have shown clear effects of the size on their uptake [201,202]. \n\nA study originating from Moderna demonstrated that LNP sizes between 60 and 150 nm were found to produce strong immune responses in non-human primates [201]. Thus, immunotherapeutic mRNA LNP products are likely to be produced within this range [201]. \n\nAs previously established, administration of LNPs through intravenous and intramuscular methods leads to non-specific accumulation of the particles in the liver [203]. Consequently, this accumulation may lead to side effects of the vaccine including hepatic inflammation and hepatic necrosis [204], and could limit access for patients with preexisting inflammatory conditions [205]. The ability to redirect mRNA LNP therapeutics to their target tissue is therefore critical in order to reduce off-target effects [206]. Further work to improve the distribution of LNPs to target-specific tissues is ongoing [207]. Most prominently, selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles, developed by Cheng et al., demonstrated that supplementing currently established LNP compositions with specified percentages of charged molecules can alter tissue tropism [208]. Furthermore, the spleen has been shown to be effectively targeted through the use of mRNA coated lipoplexes by adjusting the charge ratio (lipid to RNA) to 1.3:2 [209]. Coating strategies for mRNA LNPs have also been explored [210], including new avenues being PEG coatings for redirection of other nanoparticles from the liver to the target tissue [211,212].",

            "text": "Evidence from a study using Fabry disease model mice also confirmed that solid LNPs can act as carriers for nonviral therapy (Figure 4). (Rodr\u00edguez-Castej\u00f3n et al., 2021) Fabry mice were treated with a non-viral vector (plasmid) based on solid LNPs, and then \u03b1-GLA enzymatic activity was evaluated in plasma, liver, spleen, and brain. Mice treated with the GLA-expressing plasmid showed higher \u03b1-GLA activity than those treated with the naked plasmid. The biosafety of the LNPs was verified via the measurement of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities. These results support that developing nanocarriers for the delivery of nonviral vectors has the potential for markedly improving the therapeutic efficacy of endogenously delivered mRNA. \n\nA key challenge facing the use of LNPs for mRNA delivery lies in that LNPs are mainly confined to hepatocytes, and a lack of cell or organ specificity limits their application (Loughrey and Dahlman, 2022). mRNA taken up by hepatocytes is robustly cleared from the liver, highlighting the importance of improving mRNA delivery to non-liver tissues for systemic mRNA therapy. For Fabry disease, kidney, heart, and CNS are suffering severe pathologies. Therefore, organ targeting and selectiveness are of critically importance for effective mRNA therapy (Knott et al., 2019). To satisfy such demand, LNPbased systems that specifically transport mRNA to specific tissues or organs are urgently demanded. Various LNPs with structural features and biological properties have been developed for organ-targeted mRNA delivery (Li et al., 2019). Notably, LNPs can be modified with various targeting ligands, including active targeting ligands and stimuli-responsive groups. For example, LNPs with RGD modifications can precisely bind vascular endothelial cells, thus improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing off-targeted effects. Moreover, specific organ-targeting LNPs have been developed to facilitate precise mRNA delivery to different organs for treatment (Dilliard et al., 2021;Qiu et al., 2022).",

            "text": "One primary reason is that they strongly interact with Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) upon administration, leading to lowdensity lipoprotein receptor-mediated cellular uptake to hepatocytes. 94 \u2212100 Although capable of potent RNA delivery, the best lipid nanocarriers still only escape the endosome about 1\u22122% of the time. 54 Enhancing the cellular uptake and endosomal escape of nanocarriers is crucial for improving the effectiveness of RNA therapies, decreasing dosages, and minimizing material waste. 101 urthermore, an assortment of challenges stemming from using PEG-lipids can be classified as the \"PEG dilemma.\" PEGylation is used to prolong the circulation of NPs in vivo and help them reach their target destination to perform their intended function. 79,102 However, there are several potential drawbacks to using PEG-lipids, which may stem from developing anti-PEG antibodies in humans after repeated exposure to PEG. 79,102 First, it has been observed that PEGylated liposomes can lose their circulating properties and be rapidly cleared from the blood after repeated doses. 103 \u2212106 The presence of PEG in cosmetics, cleaning products, and therapeutics contributes to the increase in anti-PEG antibodies being developed in humans. Given that anti-PEG antibodies can stunt the efficacy of PEGylated lipid-based carriers, there is a need for solutions to the \"PEG dilemma\". 102 o help address the targeting limitations of LNPs, Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) was recently developed to deliver LNPs to extrahepatic tissues such as the lung and spleen. 56 owever, SORT LNPs rely on using either toxic cationic lipids for lung targeting, which severely limit the dosage and narrow the therapeutic window, or anionic lipids for spleen targeting, which to some extent attenuate the RNA transfection potency. 107 Moreover, only two extra-hepatic tissues, the lung, and spleen, can be targeted by this approach. 56 Hence, there is a need to develop nontoxic and more potent LNPs for the precise and effective delivery of RNA therapeutics across a broader range of different target tissues.",

            "text": "The role of the PEG-lipid in stabilizing lipid nanocarriers like liposomes and LNPs is clearly demonstrated in the literature [8,26]. However, the structural conformation and the shedding nature of the PEG and their effect on the LNP biodistribution are among the less evaluated characteristics of the LNPs. Our initial comparisons of Fluc-PS80 LNPs against conventional DMG-PEG2K LNPs revealed a pronounced shift in organ distribution, with PS-80-containing formulations displaying a three-to five-fold higher accumulation in the spleen and reduced liver uptake (Figure 2). DMG-PEG2K was chosen as a standard of comparison, given that it is one of the commonly used PEG-lipids for LNP formulations. Also, DMG-PEG2K is part of the marketed drug products like Spikevax \u00ae , Onpattro \u00ae , and mRESVIA \u00ae . Nevertheless, these findings suggest that modifying the PEG-lipid structure can meaningfully alter LNP tropism, thereby improving vaccine relevant delivery to immune organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes. Notably, imaged capillary electrophoresis (iCE) measurements (see the Supplementary File, Section 2.6 and Figure S7) revealed that DMG-PEG LNPs have a slightly higher isoelectric point (pI) than PS80-based LNPs (7.96 vs. 7.63), indicating that the net charge of LNPs might have contributed to the observed LNP's biodistribution change. However, we speculate that alongside the lower net charge, PS-80's branched PEG-like headgroup can additionally alter how serum proteins adsorb to the LNP surface. This modified protein corona may favor spleen localization over hepatic clearance. In addition, PS-80 LNPs might have a reduced rate or extent of opsonization due mainly to their closer to the neutral charge relative to PEG-DMG LNPs, thereby promoting extrahepatic uptake. This hypothesis aligns with other reports indicating that subtle differences in PEGlipid structure can significantly impact biodistribution [27].",

The results showed that intravenous delivery is the most commonly used route, demonstrating its effectiveness in targeting liver cells. Key observations, listed below, show the influence of lipid components, surface chemistry, and target cell interactions. \n\n(1) Ionizable lipids contributed to increased endosomal escape and liver-specific delivery. Lipids, such as MC3 and cKK-E12, had specific pKa values optimized for hepatocyte uptake. 32,67 Importantly, tail length affected organ distribution. For example, shorter tails targeted the spleen, and longer tails favored liver uptake. 67 Formulations such as 5A2-SC8 and 3A5-SC14 showed different targeting behavior; e.g., 5A2-SC8 enhanced ApoEmediated hepatocyte delivery, while 3A5-SC14 favored Kupffer cell uptake. 36 2) Helper lipids, such as DOPE and DSPC, impacted biodistribution. For example, DOPE improved ApoE-mediated liver uptake, while DSPC directed transport to the spleen, showing how fine-tuning LNPs allowed for specific targeting. 23,24 3) Cholesterol stabilizes LNPs and also influences targeting. Esterified cholesterol improved endothelial delivery, while oxidized cholesterol favored Kupffer cells and immune cells, reducing hepatocyte interaction. 68,69 Cationic cholesterol further facilitated delivery to both the liver and extrahepatic tissues, e.g., the lungs and heart. 70 (4) Surface chemistry was important for targeting efficiency. PEG lipids improved circulation, while sheddable variants (e.g., pH-sensitive or enzymatically cleavable PEG) helped target the liver. Mannose-PEG, on the other hand, enhanced receptor-specific delivery to LSECs. 23 pH-sensitive PEGylated lipids increased the stability of the formulation and enabled efficient liver genome editing. 71 Siloxane-incorporated lipidoids also improved endosomal escape and liver-specific mRNA delivery. 72",

Whether the biodistribution of LNPs without active-targeting ligands is associated with passive targeting is hard to determine, as Onpattro \u00d2 shows that active targeting via apoE can be achieved by controlling the interaction between LNPs and proteins in blood.\n\nIn the fast-growing field of cancer immunotherapy, the focus is on modifying and activating immune cells. A recent study [117] showed that conjugating CD4 antibody to LNPs enables specific targeting to and mRNA interventions in CD4 + cells, including T cells. After systemic injection in mice, CD4-targeted radiolabeled mRNA-LNPs accumulated in spleen, providing $ 30-fold higher signal from reporter mRNA in splenic T cells, as compared with nontargeted mRNA-LNPs. Another recent study specifically targeted gut-homing leukocytes in experimental colitis. To do this, they fused two integrin-binding domains of MAdCAM-1, the natural ligand of a4b7 integrin, to an IgG-Fc and devised a strategy to efficiently conjugate this fusion protein to the LNP surface [118].\n\nThe current LNP-based clinical trials, including the approved LNP products, illustrate both the general challenges related to targeting LNPs beyond the liver and the lack of effective targeting strategies (Fig. 7A). Searching https://www.clinicaltrials.gov for ''lipid nanoparticle\" shows, after filtering, 14 LNP hits. Since not all LNP-based clinical trials include information on the LNPs, some trials do not appear in this search. Additional LNP-based clinical trials were therefore identified from Moderna, BioNTech, and Cur-eVac pipelines as well as current literature [14,114]. These searches identified a total of 40 LNP clinical trials. Of these 40 clinical trials, 22 used local injection, including i.m. for vaccines and intratumoral for cancer. Three trials used i.m. injection to treat cancer. Eleven clinical studies used i.",

            "text": "The liver is the primary organ of LNP accumulation following intravenous administration and is also observed to varying degrees following intramuscular and subcutaneous routes, with larger LNP having less liver uptake [26]. For example, after intramuscular administration of an mRNA LNP vaccine to mice, branched DNA analysis of tissue mRNA identified muscle > lymph node > liver > spleen > testis as the primary organs of LNP accumulation in descending order [27]. Interestingly, mRNA LNP uptake does not necessarily correlate with mRNA protein expression [26]. The cell populations involved in liver uptake are dependent upon the underlying uptake mechanism. A common mechanism of uptake for most nanoparticles, including LNP, is scavenger receptor-mediated uptake into the hepatic Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelium following opsonization by non-specific absorption of plasma proteins [28]. Alternatively, Akinc et al. discovered that adsorption of endogenous apolipoprotein E (ApoE) can direct the uptake of LNP to hepatocytes through interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) located in these cells [29]. These researchers characterized this uptake mechanism by using LDLR knockout mice and hepatocytes in vitro and went on to show that the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand covalently attached to LNP could also target hepatocytes through the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Table 1). The utility of GalNAc-mediated hepatocyte targeting of LNP is demonstrated by the recent approval of Onpattro transthyretin siRNA for hereditary amyloidosis mentioned above. Clearly, delivery of nucleic acid to hepatocytes by LNP has therapeutic potential, but there are many disease indications that would benefit from non-hepatic LNP tissue and cell population targeting, such as cancer and neurological and cardiovascular disease. \n\nAlthough reducing hepatic uptake of parenterally administered LNP has been a challenge, alterations in LNP composition and physicochemical characteristics have been shown to influence liver distribution (Table 1).",

            "text": "Here, \u03b1-mannose containing an aminopropyl succinate spacer was conjugated to cholesterol via an amide bond and formulated into LNP to deliver saRNA to dendritic cells [12]. An example of introducing a targeting ligand directly into the formulation is whereby DSPE-PEG2000-mannose was incorporated into the formulation at 2.5 mol% (at 3 mol% total PEG-lipid) to allow selective delivery of LNP to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells [13]. \n\nPassive targeting is governed primarily by the size and charge of the LNP, which is acquired through changes in the molar compositions of the four types of lipids used in the formulation. One such example is the use of increasing amounts of DMG-PEG2000 from 0.004 \u00b5mol to 0.12 \u00b5mol to reduce the LNP size from 200 nm to 30 nm. The latter was shown to have enhanced cellular uptake by CD+ dendritic cells in lymph nodes [14]. The same report showed the use of CHEMS at ~20 mol% to obtain negatively charged LNP to further enhance cellular uptake. Replacing traditional linear PEG-lipids with 3% Tween 20, which contains three PEG chains and a single lipid chain, Zukancic et al. was able to demonstrate targeted delivery of pDNA LNP to draining lymph nodes, however at the expense of reduced encapsulation efficiency, ~50% [15]. On occasion, an additional lipid is introduced to achieve passive targeting, which has been termed selective organ targeting (SORT) lipids [16,17]. These SORT lipids are introduced to the LNP formulation by dissolution in THF or ethanol at different molar ratios before mixing with the RNA to obtain liver, spleen and lung targeting [17][18][19][20].",

            "text": "The lion's share of various LNPs gets distributed to the liver and to a lesser extent to the spleen, and the reason is the presence of a sinusoidal discontinuous endothelium with pores of a ~100-200 nm diameter in these organs (Kumar et al., 2023). After intravenous administration and entry into the bloodstream, a protein corona forms on the surface of LNPs, and this topic is investigated in detail in Dilliard et al. (2021). The protein corona is capable of influencing the biodistribution of nanoparticles among tissues in various organs owing to the adsorption of the proteins on the tissue surface, leading to internalization via specific receptors. The best-studied mechanism of targeting of LNPs involves their uptake by hepatocytes via binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their surface (Paunovska et al., 2022). The ApoE protein present in blood plasma is a ligand of LDL receptors and binds to cholesterol on the nanoparticles' surface and ensures their predominant accumulation in liver cells (Paunovska et al., 2022;Da Silva Sanchez et al., 2022). This mechanism is confirmed by experimental data where LNPs incubated with ApoE have been found to be targeted to hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022); on the other hand, particles with a protein corona composed of albumin are distributed preferentially into Kupffer cells instead of hepatocytes (Johnson et al., 2022). Overall, the delivery of LNPs into cells by an ApoE-independent mechanism leads to their accumulation in cells other than hepatocytes (Wadhera et al., 2016). A decrease in the proportion of cholesterol also impairs the delivery of LNPs to hepatocytes (Kawaguchi et al., 2023). Because of the fairly widespread expression of LDL receptor in human tissues (https:// www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130164-LDLR/tissue),",

            "text": "We conducted a biodistribution study of siAR-LNPs in athymic nude mice subcutaneously engrafted with PC346C tumors. Since this previous study with siAR-LNPs (Quick et al., 2022) demonstrated that most of the dose was still cleared by liver and spleen, we additionally investigated whether pre-treatment with liposomes or dextran sulfate could enhance LNP accumulation in the tumor. For this experiment, we prepared and characterized siAR-LNPs labeled with a Cy5.5 fluorescent lipid (Table S1) and validated that the LNPs and liposomes we used were stable at 4 \u2022 C over the course of 60 days (Fig. S2). The experimental plan to quantitatively assess the pharmacokinetic characteristics and biodistribution of siAR-LNPs with and without pre-treatment of liposomes or dextran sulfate is shown in Fig. 2a. As we aimed to combine the RES blockade strategy with the nanoparticle dose threshold for tumor delivery (Ouyang et al., 2020), we determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) that the liposome treated animals were intravenously injected with ~1.2 \u00d7 10 14 liposomal particles, approximately two orders of magnitude above the suggested 10 12 particles threshold for enhanced tumor accumulation (Ouyang et al., 2020). \n\nWe first determined the effect of liposomes and dextran sulfate pretreatment on the circulation time of PEG-DSG LNPs by measuring the Cy5.5 fluorescent signal in serum at multiple time points after injection. The percentage of the LNP dose (% ID) remaining in circulation after 4 h was similar for the liposome group compared to the control, but significantly lower for the dextran sulfate group (Fig. 2b). When comparing the areas under the curve (AUC) of LNP-serum detection for the different treatments over the course of 4 h, the calculated AUCs were 375.7 (A.U.) for the control group, 333.7 (A.U) for the liposome and 175.3 (A.U.) for the dextran sulfate group.",

For example, LSECs have been proposed as a target for immunomodulation owing to their physiological role in antigen presentation and innate immunity 164 . Because LSECs highly express the mannose receptor, which recognizes and binds endogenous glycoproteins and infectious microorganisms, functionalizing nanoparticles with mannose Review article moieties promotes targeting of LSECs. In one example, conjugating mannose to the end of the PEG lipid component of an LNP shifted mRNA delivery from hepatocytes to LSECs for Cre recombinase gene editing 165 . Further cell specificity was achieved by increasing the PEG density on the LNP surface to reduce ApoE binding and subsequent hepatocyte targeting.\n\nManipulating the molecular composition of nanoparticles also leads to LSEC delivery. For example, altering the pK a of LNPs away from 6.4, which is optimal for hepatocyte delivery, to approximately 7.1 corresponded to a shift in the intrahepatic biodistribution and gene-silencing efficacy of LNPs from hepatocytes to LSECs.

However, no functional mRNA targeting was observed, whereas PV1-targeted LNPs predominantly accumulated in the lungs (lung-to-liver ratio of 2:1); a two-fold higher luciferase expression in the liver over the lungs was detected, indicating a difference in the biodistribution and expression of targeted LNPs. They used larger LNPs of 160 nm to overcome this lack of selective mRNA expression in the lungs. Their assumption was based on the fact that the flexibility of the LNPs would be able to overcome the 100 nm size limit of PV1-mediated endocytosis [51]. With conjugation of the anti-PV1 antibody to 160 nm, the LNPs increased their lung accumulation, and this resulted in a 50-fold increase in luciferase expression in the lungs over untargeted 160 nm LNPs. Interestingly, 160 nm targeted LNPs showed a lung-to-liver accumulation ratio of 2.5-and 40-fold more expression of mRNA in the lungs over the liver. These data demonstrate that functional mRNA targeting the lungs requires selection of the ligand and of the NP size.\n\nNote that most complexes between chemical vectors and nucleic acids are positively charged, and, depending on the type of vector, they would be internalized by clathrindependent endocytosis or by caveolae after electrostatic interactions with proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, which are anionic macromolecules present on the external face of the plasma membrane [52,53].\n\nAmong the different techniques available to study the cellular uptake and trafficking of nanoparticles, flow cytometry appears fast and informative [54]. Using fluoresceinlabeled NP, different information can be obtained regarding particle localization on the cell surface, inside the cell or into acidic compartment, in which the acidic pH quenches the fluorescence of fluorescein [55]. For that, cells must be transfected with mRNA/vector complexes bearing fluorescein (i.e., fluorescein lipid or fluorescein-labeled mRNA)",

Given this well-established relationship, we sought to investigate whether the differences in our extrahepatic lipid library were reflected in distinct protein corona compositions, which could potentially explain their selective accumulation in non-hepatic tissues. With that purpose, we selected and purified the two top-performing ionizable lipids for lung targeting (A1T2C3, also named CP-LC-1067, and A3T2C7, also named CP-LC-1495) and the highestperforming lipid for spleen targeting (A2T2C9, also named CP-LC-1465). As controls, we included MC3-DOTAP and MC3-18:1 PA, well-established SORT formulations known for targeting the lung and spleen, respectively, with previously characterized protein coronas [12]. Additionally, we incorporated liver-targeting LNPs using SM-102 as the ionizable lipid and a control without LNPs. Subsequently, to mimic the in vivo environment, we incubated LNPs with human plasma, allowing the natural formation of a protein corona similar to that occurring in the bloodstream (Figure 4A). After purification and LNP proteincorona isolation, we performed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to identify and quantify the adsorbed proteins. \n\nPharmaceutics 2025, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 potential was identified as a key factor in organ targeting by our ionizable lipid library, we further analyzed its influence on related protein properties such as isoelectric point (pI) and overall charge. We found that in lung-targeting LNPs, the isoelectric point distribution of adsorbed proteins was slightly shifted toward pI ~5.5 compared with liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs (Figure 4C). This may be attributed to their higher zeta potential, which likely influences protein binding. Notably, vitronectin [12], a key mediator of lung uptake, has a pI of ~5.5, suggesting a potential explanation for this enrichment.",

When their properties are not satisfactory for systemic drug delivery, almost all LNPs injected are captured by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and rapidly eliminated from the blood, resulting in poor accumulation in a target tissue [108]. To avoid such unfavorable biorecognition, the particle size of LNPs is commonly in the range of 30 to 150 nm; and the surface of LNPs is often covered with PEG. Modification of LNPs with PEG is well known to enhance their dispersibility in aqueous solution and to improve their stability in the blood. On the other hand, the presence of PEG on the surface of LNPs reduces the interaction between LNPs and target cells, which reduction diminishes their internalization into the cells. Therefore, the formulation of PEGylated LNPs should be optimized for the purpose of PEGylation. The amount of a PEG-lipid conjugate for modifying the surface of LNPs strongly influences the physicochemical properties and gene-silencing efficiency of the LNPs [112,113]. It has been reported that the size of LNPs decreases as the proportion of the PEG-lipid conjugate in LNPs increases [31]. Increased PEG density on the surface of LNPs has been shown to reduce the immune response [114]. The structural differences in the length of PEG, fatty acids, and linker of the PEG-lipid conjugate used for modification of LNPs also strongly affect the potential of LNPs. LNPs modified with (R)-3-[(\u03c9-methoxy-PEG-carbamoyl)]-1,2-di-Ooctadecyl-sn-glyceride (C18) showed high blood retention but dramatically reduced gene-silencing effects in the liver [112,113]. This is probably because the interaction between LNPs and cells is reduced or the ability of LNP to adsorb ApoE is reduced, resulting in difficulty in uptake into hepatocytes.

For liver-specific targeting, the addition of an ionizable cationic lipid, e.g., DODAP, has been shown to enhance liver accumulation. The SORT LNP mechanism uses serum protein adsorption, where proteins (e.g., ApoE) can bind to the nanoparticle surface and mediate uptake by target cells, such as hepatocytes via LDL receptors or through other tissue-specific pathways, depending on the recruited proteins. \n\nThe mechanism of tissue-specific targeting of SORT LNPs is illustrated in Figure 4. This proposed three-step consists of (1) desorption of PEG lipids from the nanoparticle surface, (2) binding of specific plasma proteins to the exposed SORT molecules, and (3) receptormediated uptake in target tissues. The figure shows how modifying the PEG-lipid properties (e.g., using less-sheddable PEG lipids like C18-PEG2K) significantly reduces targeting efficiency, as demonstrated by decreased bioluminescence in target organs. Additionally, the plasma protein binding profiles shown in the figure emphasize how the molecular structure of SORT molecules influences the protein corona composition and isoelectric point distribution, directly affecting organ-specific biodistribution. 65 SORT nanoparticles also can be designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells, and hepatocytes, using various gene-editing modalities, e.g., mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA, and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. 66",

            "text": "The biodistribution profile of a given drug is important for its therapeutic efficacy and safety. Although studies on the biodistribution of intratracheal and intravenous injection of PEGylated GNPs have been reported [28], our study herein presented a systematic comparison on the biodistribution of a therapeutic nanoparticle among i.t., i.v. and i.p. administration to establish the correlation between the biodistribution profiles and their therapeutic effectiveness. Our results demonstrated that the i.t. administration allowed P12 mainly to be accumulated in the lung, while i.v. and i.p. administration let P12 primarily target the liver and the lymph nodes, respectively (Fig. 5a-c). Such a favorable biodistribution of P12 via i.t. administration is probably why it is more effective than other routes of administration to reduce LPS-induced ALI (Figs. 2, 3, 4). \n\nIt should be mentioned that although the amount of P12 in the lung (dark color) seemed to be high at 4 h post administration (Fig. 5i), we found that P12 could be quickly excreted out of the ALI mice 24 h after administration at which only about 5% of the injected dose were remained in the lung; this value was further decreased to about 0.5% after one month [19]. Furthermore, P12 was not toxic to human and murine macrophages (i.e. THP-1 cell derived macrophages and BMDMs) at the concentration used in this study [16,18], and no obvious in vivo toxicity was observed throughout the experiments. Currently, we are conducting a more thorough in vivo biosafety studies to provide more insights for its future translational potentials. \n\nAlthough nanotherapeutics are known for their better tumor targeting capability to treat cancer, extensive studies have shown that nanoparticles can still largely accumulate in the liver because they are easy to be trapped by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS, also known as RES) [29]. Even with PEGylation strategy, there are still about 60% of GNPs trapped in the MPS organs like liver and spleen after i.v.",

            "text": "In the recent past, one approach, and also the most common one, has been the use of lipid library screening, which allows for the identification of structurally analogous targeting lipid candidates or the discovery of new structure-activity relationships. For example, a platform for mRNA delivery to activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) was reported, from which a promising lipid candidate CL15A6 with high affinity to aHSCs was identified, and the biosafety with an in vivo dose up to 2 mg/kg was proven. 37 In addition, Frederick Campbell and colleagues rationally designed an anionic LNP that switched neutral LNPs surface charge into anionic based on the formulation of Onpattro, 38 which preferentially targeted mRNA delivery to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES) made up of LSECs and KCs through scavenger receptors stabilin-1 and -2 mediating anionic recognition of LNPs with LSECs. 39 elective targeting of liver cells by using ligand-modified LNPs is another potential strategy. Mannose-modified LNPs can achieve selective delivery of nucleic acids to LSECs through the mannose receptor, which is specifically expressed on LSECs. 30,40 This strategy was employed by Andre E. Nel and his team, where they used mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid moiety of LNPs (Figure 1A), enabling LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA at the cellular level (Figure 1B), and also enhancing in vivo lung gathering of man-LNPs with the dose of 1 mg/kg (Figure 1C). 41 onventional LNPs mostly enrich the liver due to natural characteristics, making it difficult and necessary to target extra-hepatic tissue. Inspired by the four-component formula of classical LNPs, the selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy, first reported by Daniel J. Siegwart's group, has been reported, which involves the incorporation of a complementary component, known as the SORT molecule, in classical fourcomposition LNPs (Figure 1D). 42",

Recent studies have shown that changing the apparent acid dissociation constant (pK a ) of LNPs can enable LNPs to target extrahepatic tissues (such as the spleen or lungs). 103 The pK a of LNPs enriched in the liver is generally between 6 and 7; when the pK a is between 2 and 6, LNPs exhibit good spleen enrichment ability. 104 The surface pK a \u2248 5.7 of spleen-targeted OF-Deg-Lin FLuc mRNA LNPs also provides a good example. 105 The above phenomenon may be due to the different head groups of different ionizable cationic lipids determining the pK a , which determines the surface charge difference of LNPs, affects their ability to interact with different types of serum proteins, and ultimately leads to their different distributions in the body. The negative surface charge of LNPs is related to their uptake in the spleen. 106 Cheng et al. recently found that the presence of a fifth component, called \"selective organ targeting (SORT)\", can alter the organ targeting effect of LNPs in vivo. 107 Studies have shown that SORT lipids can affect the apparent pK a values of LNPs and the interaction between LNPs and serum proteins. Changing the quantity and type of SORT lipids can endow LNPs with different targeting selectivities. Interestingly, when the lipid 18PA, which has a negative surface charge, is added to LNPs, spleen targeting can be achieved.",

These findings could be useful for treating hepatocellular carcinoma [78]. Similarly, Singh et al. used hyaluronan-conjugated DSPE-PEG-amine using carbodiimide chemistry for tumour targeting [79], and Parhiz et al. used DSPE-PEG-maleimide for conjugating antibodies using thioester linkages [80]. \n\nBeyond the usual components of LNPs (ILs, cholesterol, amphipathic phospholipids, and PEG-lipids), the addition of supplemental components (known as a SORT molecule) could also alter the in vivo delivery of cargo thereby helps in the improvement of tissuespecific delivery. Cheng et al. studied the effect of SORT NPs for tissue-specific mRNA delivery, wherein different classes of LNPs were engineered systematically via the addition of a supplemental SORT molecule to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues. The four mDLNP formulations consisted of 5A2-SC8 (degradable dendritic cationic IL), cholesterol, DOPE, DMG-PEG (15/15/30/3 molar ratio), and mRNA. In this system, varying concentrations of permanent cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) were added. It was observed that the varying concentration of DOTAP was a key factor in determining tissue specificity, wherein 0% of DOTAP showed liver delivery, 10-15% showed spleen specific delivery, while 50% was optimal for lung-specific delivery. Similarly, the incorporation of 10-40% anionic lipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (18PA) as a SORT molecule showed spleen selective delivery [81].",

Another work accomplished by Whitehead and co-workers got a similar conclusion. Further investigation by Siegwart revealed that this selective organ targeting effect was related to the categories of serum proteins that bind with LNP after intravenous injection. 73 gure 3. Design of selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles and their organ-specific targeting delivery after intravenous injection. Traditional four-component LNP with fixed ratios is proved to be mainly delivered to the liver, which is caused by the interactions between adsorbed ApoE on LNP and LDL receptors on hepatocytes. To realize organ-specific drug delivery, the fifth component SORT lipid (DOTAP, 18PA, DODAP) was added to the prescription of LNP. By changing the SORT lipid with different charges or adjusting the percent of SORT lipid, organ-specific systemic delivery of LNP can be realized. Briefly, cationic lipid (DOTAP), anionic lipid (18PA), and ionizable lipid (DODAP) help LNP target to lung, spleen, and liver, respectively. Reprinted with permission from ref 72.

            "text": "Although this strategy showed some effect on steric stabilization of LNP, PEGylated LNPs still aggregate after pDNA addition, depending on their formulations [37,38]. Moreover, mRNA-loaded LNPs have been prepared by using PEGylated lipids and organic solvents, leading to the assembly of particles with several hundred nanometer diameter and highly cationic \u03b6-potential [39]. Our strategy has potential to prepare sub-100 nm-sized LNPs with neutral surface charge, by mRNA PEGylation alone or by combination with PEGylated lipids. \n\nOur strategy can potentially be applied to polymer-based mRNA carriers, which provide promising alternatives to lipid-based carriers for targeting various tissues other than the liver and the spleen [40][41][42][43], while the liver and the spleen can be more efficiently targeted using LNPs due to their tropism to these organs. By using PEGylated mRNA, the complicated processes of PEG conjugation to polycation can be avoided. Furthermore, as is the case in LNPs, PEGylation of polyplexes is beneficial for their steric stabilization in biological milieu [35,44] and alleviation of mRNA immunogenicity [45]. \n\nIn conclusion, we developed a simple, robust and versatile procedure of mRNA-loaded LNP preparation, providing a smart solution to so far complicated procedures. The PEGylation of mRNA allowed the preparation of size-controlled LNP by mixing two aqueous solutions of mRNA and parent LNP by using pipetting. Importantly, mRNA was successfully PEGylated with minimal influence on its translational activity by hybridizing mRNA with PEGylated short RNA oligonucleotides. The PEGylated LNP thus obtained exhibited high structural stability in blood after intravenous injection, while non-PEGylated LNP rapidly aggregated in blood, presumably causing lung embolism. By providing methods for easy preparation of mRNA LNP for in vivo usage, our approach has the potential to accelerate the widespread clinical use of existing and newly developed mRNA LNP formulations.",

            "text": "One major challenge is how to translate the in vitro performance of LNP formulations into in-vivo efficacy. The efficacy disparity between in vitro and in-vivo experiments was considered to be related to the formation of serum protein corona and anti-PEG antibodies on LNPs in vivo, which activated the host immune systems. 100,101 The pH discordance between the lab and in-vivo environment also contributed to the efficacy disparity. 102 Moreover, the heterogeneity of cancer cells and the TME in liver metastasis would limit the targeting ability of active targeting LNPs in vivo. 103 nother challenge remaining for active-targeting LNPs was the choice of targeting ligands. For instance, GA has been widely used as a ligand for liver-targeting LNPs. 92 However, it has been reported that GA would interfere with the drug metabolism process by modulating the enzymic activity of several CYP450 isoforms, which may lead to drug safety concerns. 104 Excessive GA uptake was also found to correlate with pseudo-hyperaldosteronism, which was characterized by severe hypertension and hypokalemia. 105 The example of GA reminded the importance of exploiting the physiological function of common targeting ligands in LNPs. \n\nFinally, the efficacy of LNP-based in clinical trials might be confounded by the anti-tumor effect of drug-free liposomes. In that, future clinical trials should incorporate an extra controlled group with drug-free liposomes to better evaluate the exact effectiveness of LNP-based formulations.",

            "text": "Ensuring the safety and biodistribution throughout the body and elimination pathways of GNPs is paramount for their clinical applications, necessitating rigorous assessment of their toxicity profiles. After being administered systemically, GNPs are distributed throughout the body, with the spleen and liver identified as the main sites of accumulation, followed by the lungs and kidneys [100]. The biodistribution of nanoparticles within biological systems is notably impacted by their dimensions, morphology, surface properties, and modifications. Nanoparticles below 6 nm in size can penetrate the renal filtration barrier and undergo renal excretion, leading to shorter circulation periods and rapid clearance from the bloodstream. On the other hand, larger GNPs are primarily absorbed by the liver and spleen through the mononuclear phagocyte system, facilitated by macrophages in these organs that identify and engulf the nanoparticles. The morphology of GNPs also influences their biodistribution as a result of their unique surface characteristics and interactions with cell membranes. The presence of a surface charge on GNPs affects their interaction with serum proteins and cell membranes, wherein positively charged nanoparticles have a greater tendency to bind to cell membranes, potentially resulting in a higher cellular uptake, while negatively charged or neutrally charged nanoparticles may persist longer in the bloodstream [101]. In addition, surface modification can appreciably impact the distribution of GNPs in biological systems. The addition of targeting ligands, such as peptides or antibodies, to functionalize GNPs can guide them to specific cells or tissues, potentially reducing off-target accumulation and improving therapeutic effectiveness [102]. For instance, PEGylation has the capability to improve the longevity of nanoparticles in the bloodstream and their overall stability through the reduction in opsonization and subsequent uptake by the mononuclear phagocyte system. \n\nThe mechanisms for clearance are essential in assessing the safety and effectiveness of GNPs in clinical applications. Nanoparticles below the size limit for renal filtration are mainly excreted through the kidneys, passing through the glomerulus, and then removed in urine, minimizing long-term exposure and potential harm.",

One recent publication compared a series of synthesized ionizable LNPs in terms of their ability to target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs); the LNPs had varied PEG percentages and nanoparticle sizes [120]. In another study, Siegwart's group designed Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) nanoparticles by incorporating certain molecules into lipid nanoparticles comprised of ionizable lipids, cholesterol, DSPC and PEG. The resulting SORT nanoparticles tuned mRNA release based on modulation of internal charge and thereby facilitated delivery to specific tissue types [141]. Since tuning ionizable lipids based on organ or cell type may be difficult to achieve in clinical practice, targeting of LNPs with specific ligands may be the best strategy. Ligand-mediated targeting has been shown to mediate delivery nucleic acid cargos to specific cell types overexpressing the receptor [192]. Targeting of mRNA-LNPs can be achieved by introducing the targeting ligands during LNP production or by post-insertion of targeting ligands into the mRNA-LNP. Recent studies have shown that different targeting ligands can be inserted into mRNA-LNPs to specifically target immune cells, cardiac cells and liver cells. The research field of targeting mRNA-LNPs is still in its infancy, with relatively few publications available. Table 7 summarizes the different ligands utilized to target mRNA-LNPs to different cell types.",

            "text": "Despite constituting the smallest molar percentage of lipids in LNPs, typically around 1.5 mol%, PEG-lipids exert a substantial impact on the critical properties of LNPs. Specifically, they localize on the surface of lipid particles and maintain the spatial stability of the delivery system. Furthermore, the presence of PEG chains prevents LNP aggregation, serum protein adsorption, and uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system in vivo, thereby prolonging the circulating half-life of LNPs in the bloodstream [54,55]. Alternatively, extended circulation times lead to a higher number of nanoparticles interacting with the blood-brain barrier. Importantly, the size of LNPs must be carefully controlled during preparation, as it plays a pivotal role in determining their pharmacokinetics, delivery efficiency, and transfection efficacy. Studies have shown that increasing the molar ratio of PEG-lipids results in significantly smaller LNPs, independent of other lipid components [56,57]. These findings underscore the importance of optimizing the PEG-lipid ratio to achieve the desired size and functionality of LNPs. Moreover, beyond their influence on structural properties such as size and stability, variations in the molar ratio and composition of PEG-lipids also markedly affect the biodistribution and cellular interaction of LNPs, which are critical in determining the efficiency of cargo delivery to target cells [58]. PEGylated polymeric nanocarriers were developed by Nance and colleagues for the targeted delivery of the anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) to brain tissues. They demonstrated that PEGylation significantly enhanced the brain-targeting ability of the nanocarriers, improving PTX delivery to brain regions compared to uncoated polymeric nanocarriers [59]. Therefore, the careful optimization of these parameters is essential to create a balanced LNP structure that maximizes the therapeutic potential of PEGylated lipids. In conclusion, PEGylated lipids serve a crucial role in enhancing the stability, tissue penetration, and targeting efficiency of LNPs as drug delivery systems. These advancements in PEGylation strategies offer significant potential for developing precise and efficient delivery platforms.",

            "text": "One challenge in developing NP delivery systems is the rapid clearance of NP from the circulation via the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). Blood plasma proteins become adsorbed on to the surface of NP, a process termed opsonisation, which renders the particles visible to phagocytic cells in the liver and spleen. The surface coating of NP can significantly influence the opsonisation process [24,25]. PEGylation, for example, has been shown to inhibit opsonisation [26,27]. \n\nHere we report the synthesis of PEGylated 111 In-EGF-Au ( 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG) through direct sequential attachment of EGF and PEG onto the surface of Au NP. Due to its relatively small size, directly tagged EGF is not expected to compromise surface coating with long-chain PEG. PEGylation, in turn, is expected to result in improved pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of 111 In-EGF-Au-PEG. The targeting properties of PEG-coated NP were validated in vitro and in vivo. To further optimise biodistribution, one approach, which has been used in both preclinical research and in the clinic, is to pretreat with an unlabelled analogue of the radiopharmaceutical. In the clinic, Bexxar\u00ae ( 131 I-tositumomab) and Zevalin\u00ae ( 90 Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan) have been administered following pretreatment with unlabelled tositumomab or rituximab [1,28]. The unlabelled antibody binds to CD20 expressed on normal tissues, which has the effect of reducing the binding of the labelled antibody. This results in decreased accumulation of radioactivity in normal tissues and so reduces the risk of adverse effects. In preclinical studies involving radiolabelled EGF, such strategies have also been exploited to increase tumour uptake while reducing liver uptake [29][30][31].",

            "text": "The use of LNPs to actively deliver agents to diseaseassociated cells (tumor sites) based upon molecular interaction with cell-surface receptors is an attractive diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Good results have already been achieved, especially in combination with targeting moieties such as RGD peptides and those derivatized with PEG to improve pharmacokinetics. [35][36][37] Bound radioligand [% of total activity] The current study investigated LNPs carrying RGD and PEG building blocks and their ability to target \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrin receptors overexpressed during tumor-induced angiogenesis. Several 111 In-labeled RLPs derivatized with varying amounts of RGD and PEG building blocks were prepared to investigate their performance in vitro and in vivo using biodistribution experiments and micro-SPECT/CT imaging studies.\n\nUntil now, research on both in vivo and in vitro properties of targeted liposomes has been limited and concentrated on different targeting moieties. 38,39 Previous studies have described the influence of PEG loading on targeting properties in vivo; 7 therefore, it was decided to investigate this behavior in vitro with RLPs carrying varying amounts of PEG. In vitro binding to isolated \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrin receptors revealed the highest binding when no PEG building block was used ( Figure 3) and binding decreased with higher PEG loading of the RLPs. Given the fact that Torchilin et al showed that higher PEG loading (10 mol%) of immunoliposomes caused steric hindrance and resulted in lower accumulation in the target tissue in vivo, the same phenomena might well occur in vitro. 40 On the other hand, PEGylation is advantageous when using LNPs in vivo as it prolongs their circulation time and reduces    Concerning the effect of peptide loading of liposomes, initial studies with a tyrosine-3-octreotide peptide attached to LNPs have already been performed by the authors' group with promising results. 22 Based on these findings, the different RLPs were evaluated with respect to their RGD loading. In the competition assay, the half-maximal inhibitory values of the RLPs showed a clear relationship between RGD loading and replacement of 125 I-cyclo-(-",

A few reports mentioned that the endocytosis of spherical nanoparticles is relatively easier in comparison to other shapes. Alternatively, non-spherical nanoparticles are more inclined to flow through capillaries. The exact mechanism of action underlying the shape and structure and its role in vivo remains obscure to date. Due to the involvement of many technological challenges, the actual mechanism of action stemming from shape and structure remains widely unexplored. Therefore, the research needs to be accelerated towards understanding their activity in deforming membranes and therapeutic efficiency. \n\nSurface Composition: Efficient delivery and the biodistribution of LNPs can be influenced by the surface composition of delivering vectors. Well-known examples include the surface modification of LNPs by incorporating the PEG-Lipids by PEGylation. This process of PEGylation is known to alter nanocarrier trafficking and extend circulation half-life. Nevertheless, along with improving biodistribution and circulation, PEGylation can also result in reducing the uptake of LNPs by steric hinderance and limits interactions with the plasma membrane. Hence, the PEG-lipids detach into the serum and alleviate the steric hinderance to favor endosomal uptake [72,76].",

            "text": "LNPs containing ionizable lipids have been studied for the systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics, but designing nanoparticles that can be delivered to target tissues beyond the liver remains challenging [38]. Most of the currently studied LNPs show affinity for the liver because it is a well-perfused organ that can take up intravenously injected cargo, and the slow blood flow and sinusoidal vasculature of the liver also play a role in aiding LNP distribution [39,40]. In addition, neutrally charged LNPs that enter the bloodstream bind to apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is taken up through low-density lipoprotein receptors distributed in the liver [41]. Thus, neutral LNPs can rapidly accumulate in the liver without using ligands for molecules overexpressed by hepatocytes. Even if the LNP surface is PEGylated, it has been reported that PEGylated lipids and ApoE proteins are exchanged after injection into the bloodstream [42]. \n\nThe challenge in expanding the use of LNPs is evolving them to have different tropisms in vivo [39]. Attempts have been made to modulate the surface charge of LNPs in order to deliver drugs to organs other than the liver. Lung-specific mRNA delivery has been achieved by increasing the proportion of persistent cationic lipids in LNPs; conversely, spleen-specific mRNA distribution has been observed when the surface negative charge is high [32]. \n\nThe method of reducing the diameter of the nanoparticles for tumor penetration has also been studied. Using a microfluidic mixing technique, siRNA-LNPs with sizes of less than 50 nm were prepared and efficiently invaded the tumor microenvironment [20]. In another study, improved penetration into diseased tissues, such as tumors, was observed using LNPs with a diameter of 30 nm [18]. Recently, it was shown that LNPs as small as 20 nm in diameter can be produced by increasing the PEGylation ratio using microfluidic technology. These small LNPs are applicable not only to tumors but also to metastatic lymph nodes.",

            "text": "RNA interference represents a highly attractive alternative to current treatment regimens, however, extrahepatic delivery of siRNA using LNPs has proven difficult due to high liver accumulation. Modification of the LNP surface with targeting ligands could potentially improve LNP uptake beyond the liver. Here we show that targeting the VLA-4 receptor using the LDV motif on the surface of LNPs improved the cellular uptake of LNPs in HSPCs ex vivo and in vivo. These combined data thereby provide evidence for the use of LDV-LNPs for the treatment of hematological disorders. \n\nHigh liver accumulation is commonly reported for both liposomes and LNP-based therapies. Both LNPs, targeting and non-targeting, used in this study displayed a short circulation time of 45 min. However, longer circulation times are desired as this will improve the passive accumulation of LNPs in extrahepatic tissues [48]. The circulation time is dictated by the lipid components of the nanoparticle formulation and can be finetuned modifying the length of the PEG-lipid chain, as longer lipid chains will increase the circulation time [49,50]. Since longer circulation times of PEG usually result in reduced endosomal release and will also increase the chances of evoking an anti-PEG immune response [51], PEG does not seem to possess ideal characteristics for being incorporated in LNPs for in vivo usage. As an alternative, PEG could be replaced with polysaccharides, naturally occurring membrane lipids, or stealth-providing compounds such as polysarcosine to shield the nanoparticle from rapid removal by opsonization [52][53][54][55][56]. Additionally, an attractive concept is passive targeting by changing the lipid formulation, however, little is known about the optimal lipid composition for bone marrow targeting [57][58][59]. For liposomes, it is reported that cholesterol aids in bone marrow uptake by phagocytic cells via selective opsonization such as C3 complement protein-an interesting point for future studies on targeting the bone marrow with LNPs [60,61].",

            "text": "As described previously, LNP systems exhibiting long circulation characteristics are essential to achieving enhanced accumulation at tumor sites. In this context, it was important to establish that the presence of the (Glu-urea-Lys)-PEG-DSG did not negatively impact the circulation lifetime of the PEG-DSG LNP systems employed here. This is of potential concern since (Glu-urea-Lys)-PEG-DSG contains three carboxylic acid chemical groups at its hydrophilic terminal end (Figure 3). The pKa values of these carboxylic acid groups are predicted to be 3.11, 3.69, and 3.99 (Marvin, ChemAxon, http://www.chemaxon.com/products/marvin/), indicating that this PSMA-targeting ligand will possess a strong negative charge at physiological pH. Consistent with these estimates, the zeta-potential of LNP containing 1 mol% of (Glu-urea-Lys)-PEG-DSG was determined to be \u221214.97 \u00b1 9.34 mV, whereas nontargeted LNP exhibited a zeta-potential of \u22124.91 \u00b1 11 mV. LNPs exhibiting negative charges can be rapidly cleared from the bloodstream via opsonization by serum proteins and subsequent accumulation in the reticuloendothelial cells of the liver and spleen. 39,40 he circulation lifetime of the PSMA-targeting LNP was determined following i.v. administration of tritiated ( 3 H) PSMA-targeted or nontargeted LNP to mice at 1 mg siRNA/ kg body weight (see Materials and Methods). Blood was collected via intracardiac sampling at 0.5, 2, 8, 24 hours postinjection and the percentage of the injected LNP remaining in the circulation was determined (Figure 5). Importantly, the   PSMA-targeted and nontargeted LNPs exhibited very similar circulation properties; both formulations had t 1/2 values of approximately 10-12 hours.",

            "text": "Intravenous administration of mRNA-LNPs 28 has been reported to trigger antibody production against the PEG moiety, a response driven by the activation of splenic PEG-specific B cells. [29][30][31] Presence of anti-PEG antibodies has presumably opposing impacts on the T cell response: it results in decreased expression of the delivered mRNA but also shifts LNP uptake from hepatocytes to phagocytic cells 14 that can function as APCs. We therefore determined whether the optimized LNPs we identified-characterized by different PEG-lipid chemistries-induce the generation of anti-PEG antibodies and whether this impacts the intensity and biodistribution of mRNA expression upon repeated administration. I.v. administration of LNP34 and LNP36 provoked a pronounced B cell activation, as evidenced by a strong upregulation of the B cell activation markers CD69 ( Figure 5A), CD86, and CD40 ( Figure S5C), with the presence of mRNA in the LNPs being a clear prerequisite for B cell activation.\n\nAnti-PEG immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG became detectable in the serum of mice after respectively the first and second immunization with E7-TriMix LNPs ( Figure 5B), and antibodies were still readily detectable 40 days after the last immunization ( Figure S6A). Titers were more elevated after treatment with LNP36 compared with LNP34, especially at the later time point ( Figure S6A). We observed reduced mRNA expression upon weekly administrations of Fluc mRNA in LNP34 and LNP36, both in liver and spleen ( Figure 5C).\n\nIn the case of DSG-PEG2000-containing LNP36, this reduced expression was accompanied by a relative shift in mRNA expression from liver to spleen, with the spleen/liver ratio increasing from 0.8 at the first injection to 3 after the third injection. The relative increase in splenic expression observed after the third injection was mirrored by an increased association of Cy5-mRNA with splenic macrophages, monocytes, DCs, and B cells ( Figure 5D).

The resulting LNPs showed encapsulating efficiencies exceeding 90%, hydrodynamic diameters ranging from 70 to 110 nm, and a narrow size distribution (PDI < 0.3). No clear trends were observed in the LNP encapsulation efficiencies, sizes, or PDIs. However, significant variations in the LNP zeta potential were evident across different ionizable lipid structures, displaying positive, negative, and near-neutral values (Table S2). To evaluate the organ selectivity ex vivo, we defined organ-specific hit rates based on a 50% protein expression threshold. Consequently, an LNP was deemed organ-selective if at least 50% of its total expression occurred in a single organ (Figure 2D,E). Notably, 36.6% of the lipids demonstrated selectivity for lung tissue, highlighting that a significant proportion of the tested compounds effectively targeted pulmonary cells. Remarkably, our screening revealed that as few as 7.3% of the ionizable lipids tested demonstrated selectivity for hepatic tissue. This key finding establishes a foundation for developing novel strategies for extrahepatic delivery, particularly considering the liver's predominant role in mRNA-LNP biodistribution (Table S3). \n\nCloser examination of the chemical structures of the tested tails revealed that T1 derivatives barely achieved lung selectivity (only one ionizable lipid in that group; 2.4% hit rate), suggesting that a minimum level of branching is required to enhance targeting to lung tissue (Figure 2E). This lack of selectivity in T1 may also stem from the removal of one of the biodegradable beta-propionate linkages in its final structure, which could impact both its stability and biodistribution. In contrast, the branched thiolactone-sulfur derivatives (T2, T3, T4) were designed to contain eight carbons post-ester linkage, making them structural isomers and allowing us to assess how tail structures influence extrahepatic delivery.",

This approach significantly reduced off-target distribution to non-target tissues, such as the liver [98]. Similarly, a study on LNP-mediated mRNA delivery for treating hereditary retinal disorders employed M13 phage display technology to identify retinal-targeting peptides for LNP modification.

Drug delivery systems for mRNA delivery aim at protecting the genetic cargo while ensuring lower construct immunogenicity and successful delivery of the cargo to target cells and tissues for protein expression. 29 Therefore, evaluating the LNP performance in vivo is essential, since different applications might require different administration routes. With this in mind, LNPs' toxicity and biodistribution were assessed in vivo in C57BL/6J mice using four different administration routes: (i) intravenous (IV), (ii) subcutaneous (SC), (iii) intramuscular (IM), and (iv) intraperitoneal (IP). In detail, mice were administered Luciferase mRNA loaded LNPs, so that two readouts could be ) as well as their combination effectively protected the mRNAs from degradation. This was evident from the absence of bands corresponding to lower molecular weights than those of the constructs. Furthermore, agarose gel analysis confirmed the presence of both constructs when LNPs were loaded with a combination of Tc24 and ASP-2. P-values of \u22640.05, \u22640.01, \u22640.001, and \u22640.0001 are represented as one, two, three, and four symbol characters, respectively. gathered from the experiment: fluorescently labeled LNPs allowed us to appreciate the biodistribution of nanoparticles in different organs (representative images in Figure 4a), while a luminescence signal was used to confirm the success of mRNA translation upon administration of the luciferase substrate (representative images in Figure 4b). Results from the fluorescence reading at 18 h postinjection showed significant differences in LNPs biodistribution for the four administration routes (Figure 4c). As expected for vesicles of \u223c100 nm size, (i) IV administration revealed the highest accumulation in the liver (1.12 \u00d7 10 9 \u00b1 3.19 \u00d7 10 8 p/s/cm 2 /sr), spleen (5.33 \u00d7 10 8 \u00b1 1.91 \u00d7 10 8 p/s/cm 2 /sr), and lungs (1.22 \u00d7 10 8 \u00b1 2.43 \u00d7 10 7 p/s/ cm 2 /sr), respectively. 30",

[67] revealed the influence of PEG shedding rate on the blood clearance of PEGylated LNPs.",

Cheng et al. studied the effect of SORT NPs for tissue-specific mRNA delivery, wherein different classes of LNPs were engineered systematically via the addition of a supplemental SORT molecule to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues. The four mDLNP formulations consisted of 5A2-SC8 (degradable dendritic cationic IL), cholesterol, DOPE, DMG-PEG (15/15/30/3 molar ratio), and mRNA. In this system, varying concentrations of permanent cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) were added. It was observed that the varying concentration of DOTAP was a key factor in determining tissue specificity, wherein 0% of DOTAP showed liver delivery, 10-15% showed spleen specific delivery, while 50% was optimal for lung-specific delivery. Similarly, the incorporation of 10-40% anionic lipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (18PA) as a SORT molecule showed spleen selective delivery [81]. unmodified LNP) was ~3-folds higher in late endosomes/lysosomes, indicating improved siRNA delivery [76]. The modified LNPs resulted in the efficient delivery of siRNA-EpCAM when targeted against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) Epi-1, positive cells in vitro and also minimized the progression of tumour in mice [77]. PEGylation can also serve for the functionalization of LNP bioconjugation with biomolecules or ligands. For example, Chen et al. reported that GalNAc conjugated with LNP-siRNA-PEG formulation, a single dose of administration displayed a significant gene silencing effect on hepatocytes Factor VII (FVII).",

However, PEG can inhibit cellular transfection, so PEG lipids are designed to rapidly diffuse from LNPs after administration, allowing ON drugs to reach target cells without interference [288]. LNPs primarily accumulate in the liver, targeting liver cells responsible for targeted protein synthesis through apolipoprotein E-mediated surface adsorption via low-density lipoprotein receptors [288,289]. This allows the LNPs to specifically target liver cells responsible for the synthesis of the targeted protein [288,290].

            "text": "Generally, nanoparticles encounter difficulties reaching their target as they must navigate through various barriers to achieve effectiveness.While injection is often considered for targeted nanoparticles [125], oral administration has historically been considered impractical [126] despite being the most commonly used method.Drugs administered orally encounter obstacles such as tight junctions, mucus, digestive juices, immune components, and microbial substances in the intestinal barrier [127].Following oral administration, particles may leak through lymphatic vessels, entering the systemic circulation.Non-intravascular methods, like IM injections, encounter barriers such as extracellular and vascular endothelial obstacles before reaching systemic circulation [128].\n\nOrgan distribution highly depends on the route of administration and understanding how LNPs distribute throughout the body is crucial for effective administration.For example, when mRNA-LNPs were administered through various routes in vivo, evidence indicated widespread mRNA activity in all injected regions and most of routes showed systemic spread in mice, however, intradermal and subcutaneous injections exhibited localized activity.Furthermore, delivered mRNA-LNPs demonstrated consistent protein levels 5-10 days postadministration [129].From this evidence, it is obvious that mRNA-LNPs can reach other organs and tissues via systemic circulation.However, the proliferation of smaller LNPs was more than that of LNPs of larger size.Moreover, further RNA activity may be affected by the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of LNPs [58].IVadministered LNPs accumulate in liver and there has been an increased uptake of LNPs by hepatocytes [130] which greatly limits the delivery efficiency of LNPs to other organs.As mentioned earlier, Chen et al., 2020 introduced an additional component in the structure of LNPs for selective organ targeting (SORT) to delivery mRNA for therapeutic editing of non-hepatic cells via IV administration [70]; however, the detailed insights in its mechanism remained to be elusive.The same group, later on, demonstrated mechanistic insights on how SORT-LNPs beat the barrier of liver accumulation.",

            "text": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics have demonstrated significant potential in treating cancer, genetic disorders, and infectious diseases, as exemplified by the approval of COVID-19 mRNA or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines [1][2][3][4]. A critical factor in their success is the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which are among the most advanced and effective delivery systems for nucleic acid therapeutics. LNPs are formulated with a lipid mixture that usually includes an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a phospholipid, and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid [5,6]. However, systemic administration of LNPs leads to predominant mRNA expression in the liver, highlighting the need for novel strategies capable of efficiently targeting extrahepatic tissues for therapeutic applications beyond liver-related diseases or vaccines [7][8][9]. \n\nSeveral approaches have been explored for achieving organ-specific mRNA-LNP delivery beyond the liver, focusing on passive (endogenous) and active (ligand-mediated or exogenous) targeting strategies [10]. Active targeting strategies rely on the addition of targeting ligands to the LNP surface, such as antibodies, peptides, or small molecules, to direct the LNP toward certain cell receptors [11]. Conversely, passive targeting depends on the meticulous design of LNPs, adjusting lipid ratios or incorporating additional lipids to promote the formation of a specific endogenous protein corona upon their introduction into the bloodstream. This protein corona effect has been attributed to different LNP properties such as size, apparent pKa, zeta potential, and PEGylation [12,13]. The passive targeting strategies are particularly promising, as they leverage a controlled structure without the need for additional ligands or modifications, hence reducing costs and regulatory hurdles and simplifying the scale-up process [14]. \n\nA well-established approach for passive targeting involves adding a fifth permanently charged lipid-cationic for lung targeting or anionic for spleen targeting-to enable selective organ targeting (SORT) [15,16]. However, this strategy has resulted in limited protein expression levels in targeted organs, indicating potential for further optimization.",

We included IV administration of DMG-PEG LNPs as a baseline control to highlight the well-known liver accumulation typically seen with conventional PEG-lipid LNPs via IV injection. We showed that with the change of the administration route from IV to IM, the DMG-PEG2K LNPs' liver accumulation pattern did not change. Following IM injection of ~12 \u00b5g mRNA per mouse, ex vivo IVIS imaging (Figure 2) revealed that independent of the PS-80 percentage, Fluc-PS80 LNPs yielded, on average, a 3-to-5-fold higher luciferase signal in the spleen relative to DMG-PEG2K formulations (Figure 2c). Moreover, the spleen-to-liver expression ratio exceeded 50-fold in the PS-80 groups (Figure 2d), suggesting substantially enhanced extrahepatic uptake. Based on these promising results, we next refined the formulation buffer, cryoprotectant concentration, and lipid composition, to then evaluate the long-term stability of the optimized PS-80 LNP platform for the SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccine.",

As outlined in the section 'Lipids and lipid-based nanoparticles' , research has demonstrated that LNPs originally developed for liver siRNA or mRNA delivery can be redirected to other organs without the need for antibody fragments, peptides, aptamers or other active targeting ligands that bind specific receptors on the surface of target cells 173 . For the purposes of this Review, we define such retargeting, probably driven by interactions between the nanoparticle and serum proteins in endogenous trafficking pathways, as a process termed 'passive targeting' or 'endogenous targeting' (Fig. 4a). As a sphere becomes smaller, its surface area to volume ratio increases; as a result, nanoparticles have large surface areas 174 and when a nanoparticle comes into contact with a biological milieu, many biomolecules can coat its surface 175 . By covering the nanoparticle surface, these coronas (proteins that bind to the nanoparticle surface) change the chemical and biological molecules at the surface of the nanoparticle, thereby altering how the nanoparticle interacts with immune cells 176 and on-target tissues 177 . In one clinical example 178 , apolipoprotein E (ApoE) adsorption was required for ionizable, but not cationic, lipids to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes 179 . Researchers have found LNPs that can be trafficked via an albumin-dependent mechanism 180 as well as LNPs with variable dependence on low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and caveolin-1 receptors 136,181 . In addition to the effect that the protein corona can have on LNP tropism, LNP size can also contribute to passive tissue targeting.\n\nIn one example,",

Conjugation of targeting ligands on the LNPs surface proved to be effective in facilitating the uptake by specific organs in small-scale settings. For instance, conjugated antibodies targeted against vascular cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1 or PECAM-1 and CD-4 were employed to redistribute the LNPs from liver to lung, cerebral endothelium during brain oedema and in all T cells (na\u00efve, memory, central, and effector) in both lymph and spleen, respectively [120].

            "text": "Selective organ targeting (SORT) is a new technique for the regulated delivery of siRNA to specific targets with the help of LNPs. In conventional LNPs nanocarrier systems, the balance of ionizable groups and hydrophobicity of lipid nanoparticles determines the effective intracellular delivery. Such nanocarriers, may not show efficient targeting for various organs, except for liver. However, the SORT approach uses the unbalanced charge of lipids to alter the tissue tropism through the functional groups present and physiochemical properties of SORT molecules (Cheng et al., 2020). The design of the SORT includes introducing a fifth component into the formulation of LNPs without destabilizing the actual structure. The added SORT molecule controls the  biodistribution, apparent pKa, and interaction with serum protein. \n\nThe change in tissue tropism depends on surface charges of SORT molecules and their amount, which may help to predict the targeting of the LNPs for expression of load in particular organs (Wang et al., 2022). Compared to other targeting strategies such as aptamers or antibodies, SORT molecules offer innate targeting without any surface modifications. During the circulation, PEGlipids of SORT-LNPs get desorbed, exposing the SORT molecules, followed by the adsorption of distinct serum proteins. These protein-adsorbed LNPs interact with specific receptors expressed by cells of the target organ (Cheng et al., 2020;Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nCheng et al. used an engineered degradable dendrimer-based ionizable cationic lipid to target the lung, spleen, and liver. Here, the 5A2-SC8 SORT lipid fraction (0%-100%) was added to DOTAP. The shift in target from the liver to the spleen to the lungs was observed as an expression of luciferase protein, as shown in Figure 12. Another SORT molecule, 4A3-SC8, was used with 20% DODAP for liver targeting, 50% DOTAP for lung targeting, and 10% 18 PA for spleen targeting (Wang et al., 2022). \n\nEffects of incorporation of SORT molecules in LNPs formulations visible from luminescence profile for tested mice models.",

            "text": "The in vivo biodistribution of DX-loaded LNPs in a C57BL/6 na\u00efve mice was assessed. The mice were intramuscularly injected with Luc mRNA-LNP at a dose of 7.0 \u00b5g per mouse. After 6 h, bioluminescence throughout the body was quantified (Figure 11). All LNP and DX-loaded LNP formulations exhibited Luc expression. There were no significant differences in Luc expression between the LNP and DX-loaded LNP formulations (p > 0.05), suggesting that DX does not affect in vivo expression. While the DSPC formulation exhibited an average radiance of approximately 2 \u00d7 10 7 , the DOPE formulations showed bioluminescence values that were 2-fold lower (p < 0.05). \n\nRegarding organ biodistribution, ex vivo imaging was also performed (Figure 12). The imaging of various tissues revealed the strongest signal in the liver. Although a lower Luc expression on the order of 5 \u00d7 10 5 luminescent units was observed in the spleen and inguinal lymph nodes of mice treated with both LNP and DX-loaded LNPs, these values were not significantly different compared to liver values, which were nearly 100 times higher. These results suggest that almost all the DX-loaded LNPs target liver tissues, making them a promising tool for expressing target proteins and potentially reducing inflammatory effects associated with liver-related pathologies. The change in lipid composition from DSPC to DOPE did not appear to affect the final biodistribution of the DX-LNPs following intramuscular administration. Regarding organ biodistribution, ex vivo imaging was also performed (Figure 1 The imaging of various tissues revealed the strongest signal in the liver.

Adding permanently negatively charged SORT molecules to LNPs directed them to the spleen, while the conventional (with close to neutral surface charge) LNPs homed to the liver. It may be that changes in the apparent pK a values endow distinct protein coronas [34,111] that could alter LNP fate. Along these lines, studies of polystyrene nanoparticles have determined that positively charged particles preferentially adsorb proteins with isoelectric points less than 5.5 (such as albumin), while negatively charged particles (and particles with surfaces bearing acidic functional groups) predominantly bind proteins with isoelectric points greater than 5.5 (such as IgG) [112]. To achieve true organspecific delivery, however, the SORT approach still needs improvements to prevent leakage to other organs. Further, using wholeorgan IVIS imaging for quantitative analysis, as in the SORT study, requires caution, because scattering and absorption effects from incoming and emitted light as well as quenching effects may impact the readout from the isolated organs, and these effects will hamper the quantitative value of these measurements [113]. Further, the liposome field has learned that successfully clinical translating liposomes requires low surface charge [56].\n\nAnother lesson learned from the liposome field is that enhanced circulation time can improve accumulation in cancer tissue. Defects in cancer tissue's rapidly growing vasculature may lead to passive extraversion/accumulation of liposomes in tumors, an effect sometimes referred to as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [18]. This proposed phenomenon is, however, heavily debated in the nanomedicine field [116]. Both the nanoprimer approach described above [106] and including longchained PEG-DSPE lipids (known from the Doxil \u00d2 formulation) that are less prone to dissociation than PEG-DMG [51] are strategies that could enhance LNP circulation time and thus improve LNP accumulation in non-liver organs.\n\nAs explored above, size and surface charge are parameters that partly control LNP biodistribution. Whether the biodistribution of LNPs without active-targeting ligands is associated with passive targeting is hard to determine",

Despite these advantages, PEG plays a double-edged sword role. It inhibits the conversion of the bilayer to hexagonal form and eliminates targeted cellular uptake due to biodistribution reduction. Thus, PEGylation prolongs the circulation half-life, improves transfection efficiency and bioavailability, and decreases MQ uptake of LNP [95][96][97][98]. Following the first administration, the secretion of anti-PEG-IgM, which is responsible for the accelerated blood clearance (ABC), results in the more rapid clearance of LNP [99,100]. Similarly to Cruz-Leal group researches which PC lipids had directly activated B-1 cells to induce natural IgM [78,79], recently it demonstrated that interaction between B-1 cells and LNP leads to anti-PEG IgM response, both humoral responses being critical in driving the clearance of the LNP from the blood and into the MPS of the lymphoid (and other) tissues. Extending these findings to other delivery technologies that might similarly be subject to natural IgM opsonization is tempting. For instance, gene therapies often rely on viral vectors that include repeating PC-like epitopes and other oligonucleotide therapeutics that use LNP like those described in this study [15,40].",

            "text": "The design and selection of organ-targeted LNPs should primarily prioritize effectiveness, stability, and safety. This is achieved by adjusting their physicochemical properties, including charge, size, pKa, etc. Besides, fine variations in the IL structure within LNPs, rather than relying on charge or ligand modifications, alter the overall delivery characteristics and facilitate precise targeting of specific organs and cells. 108 The structure of IL can be divided into three key components: head group, linker, and hydrophobic tail. \n\nThe head group of ILs typically carries a positive charge, which enhances the encapsulation of nucleic acids and promotes intracellular escape by improving interactions with negatively charged endosome membranes. Typical head groups include amines, ranging from primary to quaternary, guanidine, and various heterocyclic groups. 109 It is worth noting that ILs with different head group structures often exhibit varying pKa values. These pKa values determine the surface charge of LNPs and subsequently impact their ability to interact with diverse types of serum proteins, leading to discrepancies in distribution within the body. Notably, studies by Moderna have claimed that LNPs with a pKa range of 6.6-6.9 contribute to the induction of adaptive immune responses in the context of mRNA vaccines. Additionally, an optimal pKa range of 6.2-6.8 has been identified for achieving effective protein expression in the liver following intravenous delivery of LNPs. 110 Regarding organ-selective targeting, LNPs with a pKa range of 6-7 mainly accumulate in the liver. When the pKa exceeds 9, LNPs primarily reach the lungs, while LNPs with a pKa within 2-6 tend to accumulate in the spleen. 42 A study by Dan Peer and colleagues demonstrated that LNPs with piperazine head key lipids exhibited a greater tendency to accumulate in the spleen than in the liver, whereas LNPs with tertiary amine (F) GFP expression in fetal livers 24 h after injection with LNPs A-3.GFP.

            "text": "To fully realize the magic bullet potential of LNPs, site-selective mRNA translation (i.e., decoding mRNA to build a chain of amino acids) exclusively at the injection site is highly preferable because such localized protein expression drastically decreases systemic toxicity and immunogenicity concerns. However, current FDA-approved mRNA-loaded LNP-based vaccines fail to achieve 'on-target' protein expression in immunologically-active tissues due to their high propensity for liver accumulation even after local intramuscular administration (Pardi et al., 2015;Lindsay et al., 2019), which limits their magic bullet-like properties. Disappointingly, organ biodistribution studies confirmed that a significant portion of injected mRNA-LNP migrates to the liver despite its intended muscle localization (injection site) (Lindsay et al., 2019). This high hepatic offtargeting was reported to induce adverse effects in the liver, such as unwanted necrosis of liver cells and T cell-dominant immunemediated hepatitis, possibly due to the undesired expression of antigens in the liver (Chen et al., 2022). Furthermore, such hepatic off-targeting limits the application potential of mRNA to people with predisposed inflammation and immune-challenged conditions such as chronic or acute systemic infections and exacerbates inflammation (Parhiz et al., 2022). Hence, reducing the liver uptake and rerouting mRNA vaccines to immunologically-active lymphoid organs will benefit widespread vaccine applications. Considering this Research Topic, the current research paradigm is heading in several directions. One direction intensively focuses on pursuing other delivery carriers, such as (lipo) polyplexes (Thalmayr et al., 2023) and polyplex micelles (Uchida and Kataoka, 2019). The other direction focuses on developing liver-RES blockade strategies such as transient and selective in situ stealth coating of liver scavenger sinusoidal wall cells using two-armed poly(ethylene glycol)-conjugated oligo(l-peptide) to prevent the unwanted liver uptake of nanoparticles and thereby rerouting the nanoparticles to target organs (Dirisala et al., 2020).",

            "text": "In this study, we investigated the influence of LNP formulations with varying PEG lipids and ionizable lipids on the repeated administration of mRNA-loaded LNPs (mRNA/LNP).Our investigations demonstrated that ionizable lipids exhibited negligible effects on the outcomes of repeated dosages.In contrast, the lipid structure and molar ratio of PEG lipids exerted a substantial influence on the protein expression of mRNA/LNP.It became apparent that PEG molecules linked to LNPs, as opposed to free PEG, played a pivotal role in the generation of anti-PEG IgM antibodies.Within the biological milieu, PEGincorporated LNPs assumed the character of large PEG entities, potentially provoking antibody production.Upon subsequent injections, this phenomenon culminated in a diminution of protein expression by mRNA/LNP.Specifically, successive administrations of firefly luciferase (fLuc) mRNA caused a large decline in luminescent expression within the liver.The assessment of gene editing effects following repeated administrations yielded variations contingent upon the specific PEG lipid used.\n\nNotably, our investigation revealed that an increase in the lipid tail length of the PEG lipid corresponded to a reduction in PEG shedding rates and an escalation in anti-PEG IgM production, ultimately triggering the ABC phenomenon.This observation confirmed previous studies of PEG-NPs [33].Upon exposure to blood, PEG lipid shedding commenced within the LNP, with the process culminating in the spleen.Within the splenic marginal zone, B cells are responsible for the synthesis of antibodies.Consequently, it is suggested that LNPs exhibiting diminished PEG shedding would augment the synthesis of anti-PEG IgM.From this perspective, C14 DMG-PEG 2000, characterized by a shorter lipid tail length, exhibited a higher likelihood of shedding within LNPs compared to C16 PEG 2000 ceramide.\n\nThis study also provided a comparative investigation of the protein expression efficiency exhibited by C16 PEG ceramideincorporated LNPs as opposed to DMG-PEG LNPs during their initial administration.The results revealed that the first administration of C16 PEG ceramide-conjugated LNPs yielded relatively higher protein expression efficiency in comparison to DMG-PEG LNPs.",

            "text": "In the context of systemic delivery for protein replacement therapy, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in blood serum has been identified to facilitate liver homing of intravenously injected lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). LNPs, particularly those with ionizable lipids, exhibit tissue tropism influenced by their charge, as observed in ApoE-dependent hepatic uptake [64]. To address excessive liver homing, a selective organ-targeting (SORT) strategy has been explored, incorporating specific lipid classes into LNPs for tissue-specific gene delivery [65]. Manipulating the charge of formulated LNPs using SORT molecules, such as DOTAP or 18PA, allows for lung-or spleen-specific gene delivery, demonstrating adaptability for therapeutic goals. Additionally, strategies for targeting specific cell subsets in the liver, such as hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, have been pursued by adjusting particle size and incorporating targeting ligands [65]. \n\nNovel ionizable amino lipids and an ASSET system, utilizing cell-targeting antibodies, have been employed to enhance tissue specificity [66]. Although challenges persist in achieving systemic delivery into tumors, RNA-lipoplexes (RNA-LPX) have shown promise in cancer immunotherapy by targeting antigen-presenting cells and inducing T-cell activation. The modRNA, such as 1-methylpseudouridine (m1\u03a8) RNA, contributes to reduced inflammatory responses and improved therapeutic outcomes in autoimmune disease models [22,67]. These studies underscore the importance of careful LNP design and RNA modification for tissue-specific delivery and therapeutic efficacy, providing valuable insights for advancing RNA-based therapeutics.",

            "text": "Next, we validated LNP biodistribution and LNP-mediated mRNA expression patterns in mice, focusing on cell-specific LNP distribution and mRNA expression within the murine liver, the largest RES organ in mammals. For all wild-type mouse experiments, LNP-mRNA formulations were injected (i.v.) in 8-10 week old C57BL/6 mice (Figure 6a). To assess LNP distribution and functional mRNA delivery within individual hepatic and nonhepatic (i.e., spleen and bone marrow) RES cell types, mice were anesthetized, a trans-cardiac collagenase perfusion performed, (parenchymal and nonparenchymal hepatic) cells separated, and individual cell types detected using cellspecific antibodies (see Figure S7 in the Supporting Information for representative flow cytometry density plots). To monitor LNP biodistribution across RES cell types and tissues, LNP-mRNA formulations, containing a nonexchangeable, fluorescent lipid probe (1,1dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD), 0.5 mol%), were administered ( Figure 6b). Importantly, this allowed us to full decouple and independently assess cellspecific LNP targeting and resultant mRNA expression. At 2 hpi, for both DSPC-LNPs and srLNPs (42.75 mg kg \u22121 total lipid), we observed extensive LNP accumulation within the mouse liver (Figure 6c,d) as compared to accumulation in other RES organs, namely bone marrow and spleen ( Figure S8, Supporting Information), the latter being a smaller but highly efficient unit of the mononuclear phagocyte system. [83] Notably, both LNP formulations distributed to all hepatic cell types, as has previously been described for LNP formulations based on Onpattro, [82,84] however, srLNPs showed significantly enhanced uptake (p < 0.001) in all liver cell types ( Figure  6c). Most strikingly, srLNPs yielded an approximately fivefold and an approximately threefold targeting",

However, there were 29.1% more DiR-loaded ASP 6 -LNPs detected in the femur and tibia. The results showed that ASP 6 -LNPs can reduce the capture of LNPs by the liver and spleen, thereby reducing the toxic side effects of LNPs on other organs. This may be an important piece of evidence that ASP 6 -LNPs can target bone tissue and accumulate at bone sites. Therefore, the biodistribution results revealed the potential of ASP 6 -LNPs for bone-targeted delivery. \n\n2.5.2 Intrabone distribution of ODA-FITC-labeled LNPs and ASP 6 -LNPs. The intrabone distribution of ODA-FITC-labeled LNPs and ASP 6 -LNPs in the distal femur and proximal tibia is shown in Fig. 6D. As reported, xylenol orange can selectively accumulate on the osteoid surface. 30 Therefore, the osteoid surface of undecalci\ue103ed tissue sections was stained red by xylenol orange. In addition, ODA-FITC-labeled LNPs were scarcely detected in the tissue sections.

            "text": "In addition, PGs, being a major component of the ECM in the alveolar wall [60], are prevalent on the surface of lung capillary endothelium [61]. Nevertheless, the enhanced uptake in the lungs could be, at least in part, due to the abundant interstitial monocytes in this organ [62][63][64]. This is corroborated by the finding (Figure S4) that targeted NPs are engulfed to a higher extent than non-targeted NPs by white blood cells (WBCs), specifically by monocytes. This in turn is most likely because of the different PEGylation type of the NPs. PEG in non-targeted NPs (PLGA-PEG) is expected to be entirely functional in structure in comparison to that in targeted NPs since the PEG moiety is blocked at the end by the peptide (PLGA-PEG-ApoB-P). Taken together, the enhanced accumulation in the lungs of targeted NPs represents a significant potential for lung metastases therapy. \n\nThe major MPS organs responsible for particulate system sequestration and disposal are the liver and the spleen [21,65,66]. Indeed, in both mammary carcinoma models, substantial amounts of both targeted and non-targeted NPs were observed in these clearing organs, and similar levels were observed after 24 h (Figures 4 and 5a,b). Similarly, no difference in the disposition of targeted and non-targeted NPs was observed in kidneys, which exhibited the lowest level of biodistribution, probably because the size of the NPs was too large for renal filtration [65]. \n\nFinally, a significantly higher amount of the targeted vs. non-targeted NPs (1.4 times) was detected in the primary tumor site (Figure 5c,d). Of note, both targeted and non-targeted NPs were distributed throughout the tumor tissue, located in between the tumor cells (ECM) and inside the cells (Figure 5e). We anticipate that after reducing the uptake of targeted NPs by WBCs, higher levels in the tumor would be obtained.",

By adding entirely new components, alteration of the stoichiometry of the classical components, or both, intravenously administered LNPs can be redirected from the liver to accumulate specifically in either the lungs or spleen, likely due to alteration of the protein corona content (59). In this selective organ targeting (SORT) system, the addition of the permanently cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) changed the target organ of one LNP formulation from the liver to the lungs in a concentration-dependent fashion in mice-the higher the percentage of DOTAP in the LNP, the more specific the localization to the lungs. Similarly, the inclusion of a negatively charged component in another LNP formulation led to LNP variants that were efficiently and specifically taken up by the spleen. Encapsulation of Cas9 mRNA with sgRNA by these LNP formulations successfully edited the targeted organs with minimal editing in nontarget tissues (82). Further research into LNP formulations may enable the delivery of genome editing machinery to an even wider array of tissues. \n\nA clinical trial is currently ongoing using LNPs packaging an adenine base editor for the treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), a primary cause of which is the decreased expression or function of LDL-R. As a result, patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) are not amenable to passive hepatocyte targeting by traditional LNPs, which rely heavily on ApoE binding to LDL-R. To circumvent this, PEG lipids were conjugated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to generate LNPs that bind the asialoglycoprotein receptor, most highly expressed on hepatocytes. Using a custom HoFH nonhuman primate model, GalNAc-LNPs demonstrated efficient editing of the liver independent of LDL-R expression (83).",

            "text": "Further, CL15A6-LNP uptake by HSCs occurs through platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2)-mediated CME. This process is associated with elevated serum PDGF levels during liver fibrosis and overexpression of PDGFR\u03b2 in HSCs. The reports on receptor-ligand active targeting strategy in mRNA delivery are nevertheless scarce because of the small proportion of HSCs in the liver. Mitchell et al. studied the active targeting strategy of mRNA delivery based on the neutral anisamide, a high-affinity ligand for the sigma receptor highly expressed in activated HSCs [112]. The anisamide-LNPs actively target HSCs, demonstrating potential in liver fibrosis treatment. \n\nNPs larger than 150 nm can interact with LSECs effectively due to the fenestration size of hepatic vascular endothelium. Sato et al. [124] found that increasing the size of LNPs to 200 nm and raising the pKa to around 7.1 improve the targeting efficiency of LSECs by LNPs. Moreover, stabilin and mannose receptors were highly expressed on the LSEC membrane [125]. Roy et al. [109] demonstrated that mRNA-LNPs with a negative surface charge, achieved by replacing DSPC with distearoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DSPG), could be specifically absorbed by LSECs with the participation of stabilin receptors. Kim et al. [16] suggested that mannose-modified mRNA-LNPs could actively target LSECs and that increased PEG-lipid content (3%) in the formula could inhibit ApoE-mediated endogenous targeting. Xu et al. [113] employed mannosylated mRNA-LNPs to target LSECs and modulate the immune response in mice, successfully suppressing their allergic reactions to a peanut allergen, offering a promising intervention therapeutic approach to allergic diseases (Fig. 7C). \n\nInterestingly, Dahlman et al. [110,126] noted that altering the cholesterol structure of LNPs could regulate the ability of mRNA-LNPs to target organs and cells.",

            "text": "PEGylation involves the attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to molecules, such as drugs, proteins, or nanoparticles to improve systemic circulation time and reduce immunogenicity. PEG-lipids create a 'stealth' effect by shielding the surface of nanoparticles to limit the adsorption of serum proteins onto the nanoparticle's surface and minimize their recognition by the immune system (Hossian et al., 2019;Labatut and Mattheolabakis, 2018;Mattheolabakis et al., 2014;Suk et al., 2016). The steric hindrance introduced by the brush-like PEG molecules from the surface of the nanoparticles can result in prolonged residence time in the circulation of the nanoparticles, and potential accumulation to specific tissues, such as tumors, due to the enhanced permeation and retention effect (EPR) (Lahooti et al., 2023). Similar to other lipids, PEG-lipids have a hydrophobic portion that is usually made of alkyl chains, which is integrated into the lipid layer, and a hydrophilic part that also contains the PEG, which extends from the surface of the LNPs. While PEGylation enhances circulation time and reduces immune recognition of nanoparticles, excessive PEGylation might hinder the efficient interaction of LNPs with target cells, leading to reduced therapeutic effects (Kumar et al., 2014), and fusion of the LNPs with the endosomal membrane due to steric hindrance, leading to therapeutic inefficacy (Aldosari et al., 2021;Kulkarni et al., 2019). More importantly, the PEG-lipids significantly impact LNP formulation and size (Kulkarni et al., 2019;Samaridou et al., 2020). In two studies by Belliveau et al. and Ryals et al., particle size decreases upon PEG lipid content increase in the formulations (Belliveau et al., 2012;Ryals et al., 2020).",

            "text": ", the expected longer circulation time of LNPs coated with C18 compared to C14 PEG-lipids do not change final transfection efficacy and/or apoE adsorption levels. These data lead one to question whether PEG-lipid desorption (when using 1.5 mol% PEGlipid) is essential for apoE adsorption to LNPs.\n\nIn addition to the indirect active targeting properties obtained via the association between apoE and LNPs in blood, more passive targeting could be attained by preserving the steric barrier of the LNP in vivo. A PEG-lipid like the PEG-DSPE (C18) (Fig. 3B) used in Doxil \u00d2 inhibits rapid desorption and thus limits protein binding and clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic system, thereby prolonging circulation time of the PEGylated nanocarrier. Approaches [72-74] using a persistent PEG-lipid to improve LNP accumulation elsewhere employ a formulation with compromised activity and therefore require higher doses to achieve silencing at the target tissue. A slow PEG desorption rate will also minimize specific uptake in the liver and further increase circulation time, enhancing LNP accumulation in tumor tissues [51].\n\nTaken together, the research detailed above shows that the choice of PEG-lipid greatly influences key LNP properties such as size, stability, in vivo distribution, and transfection efficiency. PEG-lipids stabilize LNPs during preparation and storage by providing a steric barrier that both drives self-assembly and prevents aggregation. Further, the type of PEG-lipid partly controls LNP circulation time and cellular interactions. Which PEG-lipid to choose highly depends on therapeutic purpose, target organ and/or cell type, and administration route, and should include considerations regarding both molar ratios and length of the akyl/acyl chain(s) constituting the lipid tail, as these parameters have all shown to influence key properties of LNPs.\n\n3.2.1.2. Do PEG-lipids stimulate an immune response?. Grafting PEG to long chained lipids onto liposomes grants them stealth-like properties that prolong their half-life in circulation.

            "text": "The highly specific liver localization most likely results from the permeability of the capillaries in this organ, which exhibit no lamina propria and 100-200 nm channels along the endothelial wall [68]. A similar observation was described using poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) as the polymer and adsorbed polyethyleneimine (PEI) as the cationic molecule on the surface to obtain positively charged PLGA nanoparticles. These 200 nm cationic particles accumulate in the liver and spleen after intravenous administration for at least 24 h [69]. The sustained accumulation of NP T-B in the liver is important for achieving therapeutic effects with a few doses, which is highly desired in a clinical setting. In the liver, autophagy induction has been shown to be beneficial for hepatocytes, Kupffer macrophages and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), while in stellate cells, it is believed to be fibrinogenic [70]. Given the low population of stellate cells in the liver [71], induction of autophagy in the whole liver is most likely beneficial. To elucidate in greater detail which organs are targeted by fluorescent NP and NP T-B, we isolated the major organs in the 24 h following a single IV injection. While NP accumulated mainly in the liver 24 h after IV injection, NP T-B accumulated mainly in the liver and spleen, in both models. The difference in the organ biodistribution is most likely due to the difference in the surface charge of NP and NP T-B. To further promote liver targeting and avoid spleen accumulation, galactosyl or folate or transferrin could be co-adsorbed on the NP T-B surface to facilitate active liver targeting. Co-adsorption of peptide or proteins has been reported before on such PLA particles, for example by p24 and RGD proteins on PLA NPs, for vaccine development purposes [72].",

            "text": "As previously mentioned, there are many barriers to extrahepatic delivery of NPs, which makes in vivo gene delivery to immune cells that reside in lymphoid organs like the spleen and lymph node very challenging. Upon intravenous injection, the serum protein ApoE often adsorbs to the surface of LNPs, thereby directing these particles to the liver. [34] Additionally, many PNP complexes show poor stability in serum, which in turn hinders their efficacy. [35] To mitigate these endogenous barriers to passive immune cell targeting, a variety of NP engineering approaches have been employed to functionalize these biomaterials with different targeting ligands specific to a variety of immune cells, including antibodies, different types of sugars, and other macromolecules that interact with receptors on specific immune cells. Here, these broad classes of active targeting ligands are discussed. Additionally, the major challenges associated with ligand-mediated targeting are outlined, highlighting the need for alternative engineering strategies to address these shortcomings.",

            "text": "influences the interaction with blood proteins [105]. Therefore, together with active targeting for tissue-or cell-specific nucleic acid delivery by ligand-receptor specific interaction, chemical adjustment of the carrier system can be also utilized to generate organ-specific delivery. It could be observed that slight changes of the chemical or physicochemical properties of the formulation such as particle size and surface charge have a remarkable impact on the biodistribution and accumulation in certain tissues or cell types. Chemical targeting has shown great potential for ligandindependent, but yet organ-specific delivery of nucleic acids. For example, Kowalski et al. observed organ-selective distribution of mRNA-LNPs with a library of amino-polyesters either in liver, spleen, or lung after i.v. injection [106]. Localization of structurally different LNPs after systemic administration was investigated by Dahlman et al. by developing a barcode tool in order to track biodistribution in vivo [107]. Furthermore, the group of Siegwart synthesized libraries of lipids for LNP formulations for delivery of mRNA as well as Cas9 with different properties by variation of charge, hydrophobicity and pKa, respectively, resulting in so-called \"selective organ targeting\" (SORT) lipids and studied the accumulation of these formulations in different tissues and cell types. For example, it was demonstrated that particles with higher amounts of positively charged dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) preferably accumulated in the lung, whereas the addition of negatively charged lipids led to selective delivery to the spleen [108,109]. Recently, the mechanism behind SORT was studied, revealing both global and apparent pKa as well as the composition of the serum protein corona of the LNP formulation determining the selective delivery. The study revealed first that particles with a pKa around 6-7 accumulated in the lung, while LNPs with lower pKa from 2 to 6 were preferably delivered to the spleen and second that different serum proteins bind to LNPs dependent on the component composition, therefore representing pioneering results for understanding LNP delivery beyond hepatocytes for future fields of applications [110].",

[69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

            "text": "If the influence of NP PEGylation on biodistribution is known for years [69][70][71][72], the thorough characterization and consequences of a biomolecular corona formed in vivo has not been investigated yet. However, of interest are several studies dealing with a pre-coating of the NP with proteins, namely with serum albumin and apolipoprotein E [53,73,74]. Whatever the nature of the NP core, polymeric or metallic, it seems that such a pre-coating increases the blood circulation time and reduces the clearance speed. For example, a 6-fold increase of half-time was reported by Peng for BSA-precoated NP compared to \"bare\" NP [53]. Based upon in vitro experiments, the authors proposed as an explanation a weakened opsonization and a reduced phagocytosis. In all these studies, liver stays the main organ of NP accumulation (more than 90% of the injected dose after 19 h [74]). Still, the protein used for pre-coating seems to nuance the amounts of NP in other organs, albumin targeting lungs preferentially, and brain to a lesser extent, compared to apo-E [74]. One could take advantage of this improved retention when pre-coating NP with albumin in cancer therapy as specific factors account for the accumulation of this protein in solid tumors: a decreased level of HSA in cancer patients, inducing a need for albumin digestion to cover the need in amino acids for tumor growth and the presence of two albumin receptors, gp60 in tumor endothelium and SPARC in tumor interstitium [75].",

In Luozhong et al. (2022), it was found that when 1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DOPS) served as the anionic lipid, aside from the accumulation of LNPs in the spleen, their specific accumulation was registered in superficial cervical lymph nodes, in contrast to LNPs containing phosphatidic acid. Authors of Gomi et al. (2023). demonstrated that phosphatidylserine-containing LNPs are mainly taken up by hepatic phagocytes. In this context, the presence of an ionizable lipid in the LNPs enhanced the uptake of the nanoparticles by cells. It is worth mentioning that specific delivery of phosphatidylserine-containing LNPs to lymphoid organs was achieved there only with intravenous administration. \n\nAs stated above, targeted delivery of LNPs to organs is determined by the charge, not by the nature of the polar group in a helper lipid.",

Although the LNPs described here, similar to other nanoparticle delivery systems, yield liver delivery, our top LNP A10 resulted in the lowest liver:placenta ratio compared to the other formulations tested. In the future, we will incorporate targeting ligands into LNPs to improve placental targeting and minimize off-target effects to maternal tissues. Finally, our biodistribution results using luciferase mRNA encapsulated in LNPs demonstrated no delivery of LNPs to the fetus. This, combined with our toxicity analysis, suggests no adverse effects of LNPs to fetuses. These results support the use of LNPs, and in particular, LNP A10, for mRNA delivery to the placenta to treat diseases that originate from placental dysfunction.",

            "text": "Specifically, we investigate the effects of bile acid incorporation into LNPs on the relative expression of mRNA cargo in various organs following IV or IP injection.Previous work has investigated cholesterol analogs in vitro and ex vivo for their ability to hinder endosomal recycling within cells and improve transfection of mRNA cargo [37,38].For example, the use of hydroxycholesterols has been shown to improve delivery of luciferase-encoding mRNA to immortalized T cells and human primary T cells [39].This work explores bile acids -the final product of cholesterol metabolism that engages in an active exchange between the liver and gastrointestinal tract [40].Primary bile acids, such as cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), are produced by the liver and converted to secondary bile acids, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), by bacteria in the intestines [41].Therefore, following mRNA delivery, the bile acids within the BA-LNPs can be readily processed by the liver.Notably, bile acids are naturally present in blood at micromolar concentrations and can be commercially purchased in bulk quantities at lower costs than most synthetic lipids and cholesterol analogs, making them an appealing option for LNP formulation modification.\n\nTherefore, we explored the effects of bile acids on functional mRNA biodistribution, using a library of 4 bile acid substitutes replacing cholesterol at varied replacement percentages.We screened these modified BA-LNP formulations in vitro and in vivo and identified CA-100 -a 4-component BA-LNP formulation, containing an ionizable lipid, helper lipid, PEG, and CA -that induced differential mRNA expression in the spleen following IV or IP injection.The replacement of cholesterol with CA, therefore, serves as a novel and promising LNP modification strategy to achieve functional extrahepatic mRNA delivery.",

            "text": "RNA interference represents a highly attractive alternative to current treatment reg mens, however, extrahepatic delivery of siRNA using LNPs has proven difficult due high liver accumulation. Modification of the LNP surface with targeting ligands cou potentially improve LNP uptake beyond the liver. Here we show that targeting the VLA 4 receptor using the LDV motif on the surface of LNPs improved the cellular uptake LNPs in HSPCs ex vivo and in vivo. These combined data thereby provide evidence fo the use of LDV-LNPs for the treatment of hematological disorders. \n\nHigh liver accumulation is commonly reported for both liposomes and LNP-base therapies. Both LNPs, targeting and non-targeting, used in this study displayed a sho circulation time of 45 min. However, longer circulation times are desired as this will im prove the passive accumulation of LNPs in extrahepatic tissues [48]. The circulation tim is dictated by the lipid components of the nanoparticle formulation and can be finetune by modifying the length of the PEG-lipid chain, as longer lipid chains will increase th circulation time [49,50]. Since longer circulation times of PEG usually result in reduce endosomal release and will also increase the chances of evoking an anti-PEG immune r sponse [51], PEG does not seem to possess ideal characteristics for being incorporated These results clearly show that LDV-LNPs associate with both VLA-4-positive immature and mature HSPCs resulting in higher LNP accumulation and longer retention in the bone marrow. Consequently, these findings strongly support the concept of augmented retain and improved uptake in leukemic cells including leukemic stem cells in vivo.",

By targeting specific receptors, nanoparticles may be directed into intracellular trafficking pathways that protect the mRNA load against degradation [99]. The concept of targeting mRNA nano-vaccines towards different C-type lectin receptors, such as DEC-205 [100], CLEC9A [101], and mannose [102] receptors, can be utilized to induce the uptake of mRNA-LNPs by these specific receptors. In addition, endocytic protection of the nucleic acid from degradation and regulation of the cross presentation of dead cell-associated antigens were achieved by inclusion of targeting moieties [100][101][102]. \n\nThe group of Parhiz et al. [103] investigated the binding of nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNPs to antibodies against vascular cell adhesion molecules (PECAM-1 or platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1). The results revealed a 200-fold enhancement of mRNA delivery and a 25-fold elevation of protein expression in endothelial cells of the lungs after systemic administration in mice compared to the non-targeted LNPs [103]. \n\nIn addition, incorporation of mannose motifs into nanoparticles led to increased transfection of mRNA mannosylated histidylated lipopolyplexes into the dendritic cells of the spleen following intravenous injection in mice [102]. Further, a modular targeting platform based on inclusion of a lipoprotein inside siRNA-LNPs was proposed by Kedmi et al. [104]. The formulated nanoparticles were designed for diverse leukocytes and to interact non-covalently with the antibody crystallizable fragment domain of a selected targeting antibody. The therapeutic efficiency of these LNPs in treating inflammatory bowel disease was demonstrated, where targeted expression of interleukin 10 was observed in inflammatory leukocytes that are only present in inflamed tissues [104,105].",

            "text": "Release took place primarily at the EE/LE conversion step rather than from lysosomes. These studies provide important insights into the mechanistic basis of oligonucleotide delivery via LNPs and attest to the overall inefficiency and transience of oligonucleotide delivery even when using effective nanocarrier systems. \n\nAn important issue is whether it is possible to target LNPs to particular cells or tissues. An obvious approach is to decorate the LNP surface with antibodies. However, long experience with targeting of drug-loaded liposomes suggests that it is quite difficult to find the right balance between PEG shielding and availability of the antibody (183). Recently however, there have been some interesting reports using antibody-targeted siRNA LNPs. Thus a scFv was used to target LNPs to dendritic cells in vivo. Good 'knock down' of several co-stimulatory surface antigens and inhibition of mixed lymphocyte reactions were observed (184). In another study LNPs decorated with antibody to CD20 delivered Bcl-2 ASO to B-cell tumors in vivo with good antitumor effect (185). Additionally an anti CD4 monoclonal was used to target siRNA LNPs to CD4 positive T-cells resulting in knock-down of the intended mRNAs both in cell culture and in vivo (186). \n\nProgress has also been made using small molecule ligands to target LNPs. For example, in a series of publications, Huang et al. have used anisamide as a ligand to assist in the delivery of siRNA LNPs to tumors (187,188). Finally aptamers are also being explored as a targeted delivery approach for LNPs (189). Some of the above mentioned studies on LNP targeting are also of interest because they involve delivery of oligonucleotides to non-hepatic sites. \n\nFinally, there have been some impressive recent preclinical studies using LNPs. Thus LNPs prepared using a novel lipid from a chemical library selectively delivered oligonucleotides to the lung. When used with si-KRAS and miR-34a, significant inhibition of lung cancer was attained in a genetically engineered mouse tumor model (190).",

            "text": "To assess the effect of size and pegylation on the distribution of the nanoparticles, liver and spleen were selected as representative organs of the MPS. 15,41,42 It is generally accepted that nanoparticles ranging from 30 to 100 nm in diameter can be captured by the macrophages of the liver and spleen. Liver uptake of the larger particles is faster than for smaller ones. Recent observations indicate that very small particles can pass through the sinusoidal fenestrations in the liver and gain access to the parenchymal cells of the liver. 43,44 Sonavane et al prepared gold nanoparticles of different particle sizes (15, 50, 100, and 200 nm) and distribution in organs like the liver, lung, and spleen and showed that tissue distribution of gold nanoparticles is size-dependent. 45 The smallest gold nanoparticles (15 nm) show the most widespread organ distribution.\n\nThe distribution of pegylated and nonpegylated (control) nanoparticles has been evaluated on these tissues in rats. The fluorescence microscopy images of liver and spleen tissue sections are shown in Figures 6 and 7, respectively. Twentyfour hours after IV injection of pegylated nanoparticle suspension ( Figures 6C and 7C), only a negligible fluorescence was detected in the liver and spleen when compared with nonpegylated nanoparticles (Figures 6D and 7D). A strong green fluorescence due to the accumulation of nonpegylated nanoparticles could be clearly observed, especially in Kupffer cells, which are located mainly in the periportal region of  the liver, and few very bright spots were observed, probably because of aggregation. Green fluorescence along the lining of the liver sinusoids identified endocytosed nanoparticles by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. On the contrary, the observed weak yellow fluorescence in tissues following injection of pegylated nanoparticles suggests that pegylation of the PBLG nanoparticles was efficient for avoiding capture by the MPS. Similarly, macrophages of the spleen were much less deeply stained after injection of pegylated nanoparticles when compared with nonpegylated nanoparticles ( Figure 7C and",

Gref et al. demonstrated that an increase of the MW of PEG from 2000 to 5000 Da led to a severe decrease in protein adsorption but they could also show that a further increase was not beneficial [68]. In contrast to that, a study investigating the influence of PEG chain length and density on biodistribution in mice using PEGgrafted nanocapsules found that 20,000 Da PEG provided the longest circulation time and the lowest liver uptake [72]. The chain length of 1000 Da PEG in the presented study was used to minimize the enlargement of the particle diameter. However, the results indicate that PEGylation had a definite stealth effect compared to the non-PEGylated NP variant but it might not be sufficient to strongly prolong the circulation time and enhance the accumulation at the implants. \n\nAlthough surface functionalization with polymers often yielded promising results [55,67,69,70,73], concerns about the safety of polymers were rising. Due to the fact that an accelerated blood clearance phenomenon can be seen after repeated injections of PEGylated nanocarriers, non-immunogenicity of PEG is questioned [74]. It is also discussed whether PEGylation may negatively influence nanoparticles' performance as drug carriers because it hinders nanoparticle-cell interactions [67]. To further improve the half-life of nanoparticles in the bloodstream whilst avoiding PEGylation shortcomings some more biologically inspired strategies have been evolved, like coating with cell membranes [31,32,75,76] or functionalization with CD47 [30,55,77,78]. \n\nAlthough PEGylation and concurrent depletion of macrophages by clodronate injection decreased the amount of retained nanoparticles in the liver to nearly the half, this effect was recognizable neither in the spleen nor at the implants.",

            "text": "BP-LNPs exhibited much lower biodistribution in the liver and spleen and higher bone marrow/surface accumulation and cellular uptake than LNPs without BP. Intriguingly, histological staining showed that enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transfection signaling was mainly detected in the bone marrow, especially in the endosteum, rather than on the bone surface. BP-LNPs encapsulating BMP-2 mRNA showed a prominent increase in BMP-2 expression on the bone surface and bone marrow compared with LNPs without BP. Although lacking verification in a disease model, these results indicate that BP-modified nanoparticles can be a promising method for bone-targeted drug delivery. Moreover, the BP ligand can also exhibit an additional anti-resorption effect in the delivery system by inhibiting osteoclasts or farnesyl diphosphate synthases. \n\nOwing to these properties, BP ligands have been broadly exploited in targeted drug delivery in preclinical studies for multiple bone diseases. 245 In targeted antimicrobial therapy for bone infection, BP-antibiotic conjugation prominently decreased minimum inhibitory concentration and prolonged the duration of the therapeutic effect. 249 In bone tumor-targeted drug delivery, BP conjugation can greatly increase the concentration of antitumor drugs in bone and reverse bone mechanical properties by inhibiting bone resorption. 250 Nevertheless, despite the higher accumulation in bone and lessened side effects on other tissues, it still cannot avoid the toxicity of antineoplastic drugs to normal bone cells for lack of tumor cell specificity. In view of this, an improvement strategy was recently proposed by TIAN et al. 251 By conjugating alendronate with HER2-targeted antibody Tras using pClick technology, bone metastasis-targeted Tras-Alen was synthesized. Administration of it in mouse models showed a significantly higher accumulation of Tras-Alen in bone than in other organs, but a prominently decreased distribution in healthy bone tissue than in cancer-bearing bones, which not only confirmed the role of bone-targeted ligands for bone diseases but also indicated the feasibility for drugs to further target specific site after reaching bone by dual-targeting or multiple-targeting.",

LNPs with high transfection ability in previous data were pooled and formulated with mFLuc to confirm their biodistribution and FLuc expression. Sizes of mFLuc-loaded 244C10, 245C10, 246C10 LNPs were validated before injection. The mean particle size of LNPs remained relatively similar (60 to 70 nm). Formulated LNPs were intravenously injected to C57BL/6 mice. Luminescence was evaluated 3 hours after injection via live-animal and ex vivo organ imaging. As shown in Fig. 3, 244C10, 245C10, and 246C10 LNPs mediated the liver-specific delivery and expression of mFLuc. Like the in vitro cellular study, 246C10 LNPs showed the highest luciferase expression in the liver. In addition, ex vivo imaging of five different organs (liver, kidney, lung, spleen, and heart) supported the liver tissue-specific expression of mFLuc using 246C10 LNPs. \n\nTo figure out the impact of ApoE on the cellular uptake of 246C10 LNPs in vivo, we also evaluated luciferase expression in ApoE knockout mice (fig. S5, A to D). By injecting ApoE-associated 246C10 LNPs in the ApoE knockout mice, luciferase expression was substantially increased in the liver. The result was consistent with in vitro cellular uptake results and demonstrated that ApoE association could facilitate the delivery of 246C10 LNPs to the liver. Next, we investigated the biodistribution of mRNA-loaded LNPs. Given the fact that injected LNPs (<100 nm) were mostly distributed to the liver, the question was which types of liver cells mostly uptake these LNPs. Previously, Chen et al. (22) reported on the size-dependent gene silencing of LNPs in hepatocytes, following intravenous injection. Upon entering systemic circulation, LNPs (<100 nm) were mostly accumulated in the liver.",

Both systems contained NanoLuc mRNA (N/ P = 6). As shown in Fig. 2A, markedly different transfection profiles were observed for the liposomal LNP compared to the formulation with the Onpattro-like composition. The luminescence signal for the liposomal LNP originated from the liver, spleen and pancreas rather than predominantly in the liver as shown in Fig. 2B and S3. This result was consistent with the data from the homogenized organs (Fig. 2B-C and S4). Liposomal LNP displayed higher luminescence than LNP with the Onpattro-like lipid composition in the heart, lungs, spleen, kidney, muscle, inguinal lymph node and pancreas. In particular, 50-fold and 150-fold increase in luminescence in the spleen and inguinal lymph node, respectively, were observed for the liposomal LNP mRNA systems (Fig. 2C and S4). In order to understand factors leading to enhanced extrahepatic transfection, we characterized the LNP circulation lifetimes and biodistribution using SPECT/CT imaging. A 3% wt/wt ratio of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-diethylenetriaminepen taacetic acid (DTPA-PE) was incorporated into NanoLuc-containing LNPs with the Onpattro-like lipid composition and the liposomal lipid composition (R B/I = 4).

            "text": "PEG is a kind of hydrophilic, non-ionic polymer with good biological compatibility. At this stage, they are the most commonly used reagents to prevent the clearance of MPS and prolong the residence time of liposomes in the blood. The PEGylation of LNPs can effectively reduce the amount of LNP and serum proteins through the PEGylation of LNP. In addition, PEG-modified anionic liposomes can better diffuse into the lymphatic system after subcutaneous injection, reducing the retention at the injection site, and better aggregation and retention in the lymph nodes. Furthermore, shorter PEG modified chains allow for better particle retention and retention against lymph [26]. The modification of branched-chain PEG polymer and straight-chain PEG polymer can give the liposomes significantly different targeting and transfection ability [27]. However, recent studies have shown that the human body produces corresponding antibodies against PEG, which has always been associated with reduced vaccine effectiveness and further adverse reactions. For this reason, efforts are being made to find a better, equally biocompatible polymer to replace the PEG modification. However, some studies have found that adding a specific amount of dexamethasone into liposomes can effectively inhibit the adverse reactions caused by PEG modification [28]. \n\nDue to the inherent properties of lipid nanoparticles, most LNP-based vaccines target the liver if they rely on passive targeting by continuous circulation of the particles in the body and cellular uptake. \n\nChen and his colleagues have developed a positively charged PTX-LNP based on paclitaxel (PTX), modified with folic acid-modified bovine serum albumin (FB) to enable dual targeting of tumours [29]. Veiga and his colleagues achieved selective targeting of inflammatory leukocytes in the organism by combining anti-Ly6C antibodies with lipid nanoparticles loaded with siRNA. After inoculation solid tumours tend to show higher levels of p32 expression than non-cancerous tissues.",

            "text": "Controlling the distribution of LNPs is critical for the treatment of diseases occurring in specific organs. Apart from optimizing the intrinsic properties of LNPs, targeted delivery to extrahepatic areas can be regulated through various strategies, including the choice of administration routes, active targeting and passive targeting associated with the surface protein corona of LNPs. 122 ocal administrations, such as intradermal, intramuscular, intratracheal injections etc., prolong protein expression at the injection site. Intramuscular and subcutaneous injections of RNA-LNPs, the most common vaccination routes, effectively migrate to LNs through lymphatic vessels and induce stronger immune responses. 134 Pulmonary deliveries, mainly including intratracheal, intranasal, and inhalation routes, allow LNPs to bypass pre-exposure to the systemic circulation before reaching the lung, thus avoiding liver metabolism and enhancing LNPs selective delivery to the lungs and LNs. Additionally, intraperitoneal administration, intravitreal, or subretinal injection provide personalized treatment options for pancreatic diseases such as cancer and diabetes, as well as genetic retinal degeneration. 135 Overall, local drug delivery generally offers highly selective delivery of therapeutic agents to the disease site while minimizing systemic side effects. Notably, local administration is only suitable for diseases with known and accessible pathological sites, such as tumors or traumatic injuries. 127 ommonly, active targeting of LNPs is achieved through specific recognition and binding between ligands modified on the surface of LNPs and receptors on the surface of the target cell. Similar to the challenges mentioned earlier in this review, while active targeting tactics enhance delivery efficiency and residence time of nucleic acids, progress in targeted delivery has been limited due to the personalized nature of this process, which is influenced by the heterogeneity of diseases. 133 he passive targeting of LNPs can be mediated by the protein corona formed by non-specific adsorption on their outer surface. 136 The adsorption of proteins is influenced by various physical properties of LNPs, including charge, composition, and size, among others. Changes in the surface properties of LNPs may compromise the stability of RNA-LNPs through corona. 25",

All identified Lung SORT LNPs targeted the lungs effectively and hold promise for further development and optimization. Following an analysis of both lung delivery efficacy and specificity, DOTAP40 LNPs and DDAB30 LNPs were selected for further consideration. \n\nDuring the evaluation process, we found that DDAB LNPs exhibited some toxicity after treatment. To further confirm this, in vivo toxicity of DOTAP40 and DDAB30 LNPs treatments were evaluated by measuring serum biomarkers relating to liver function (ALT and AST) and kidney function (BUN and CREA). Higher toxicity in the liver was observed in the DDAB30 LNP treatment group after 24 h (Fig. 2g, Supplementary Fig. 2). We also monitored the body weight changes and noted increased weight loss in mice treated with DDAB30 LNPs, suggesting higher acute toxicity (Fig. 2h). At the end of the study, mice were sacrificed, and organs (liver, spleen, and lung) were excised and weighed. The liver/body weight ratio and spleen/body weight ratio were increased with DDAB30 LNP treatment, suggesting higher toxicity (Fig. 2i). Immunohistochemistry (H&E staining) results showed that obvious tissue damages were detected in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mouse organs and DDAB30 LNP-treated mouse organs (such as heart and liver), but not from DOTAP40 LNP treated mouse organs (Supplementary Fig. 3).

            "text": "The PEGylated stealth improves the residence times in the blood and ultimately the efficiency of PNPs. However, the rate of clearance and final biodistribution in the organ is dependent on multiple factors. First and foremost, the particle size plays a crucial role in defining the final distribution and blood clearance of the PEGylated PNPs. Particles with a hydrodynamic size over 200 nm typically exhibit a more rapid rate of clearance than particles under 200 nm, regardless of PEGylation [165]. In addition to the blood clearance rate, the final biodistribution is also affected by particle size. For instance, PEGylated NPs sized less than 150 nm was shown to exhibit a higher uptake in the bone marrow of rabbits, whereas particles sized 250 nm mostly sequestered in the spleen and liver, with only a small fraction of uptake by the bone marrow [165]. Moghimi et al. [166] suggested that the size-dependent biodistribution might be attributed to a filtering effect, whereby the spleen and liver removes larger particles more rapidly, while the smaller particles are directed to the bone marrow. However, the exact reason for these size dependencies is yet to be understood. Like particle size, molecular weight also plays an important role. Molecules that have a molecular weight less than 5000 kDa, or even more conservative for dense polymers like dendrimers, can be removed from the body via the renal system [167]. \n\nDue to the hydrophilic nature and capability to modulate NP size, PEGylation has been shown to reduce liver accumulation by half to one-third [167,168]. This feature is attributed to the stealth effect, i.e., diminished random protein binding during circulation [168]. Moreover, macrophages and liver Kupffer cells, which are the major limiting factors, hinder the circulation times of NPs. Hydrophilicity of PEG on the NP surface reduces its tendency to attach opsonin proteins, thus reducing their recognition and transport to the liver for excretion via these cells [120]. One such example is the PEGylation of gadolinium oxide, a fluorescent NP utilized for both imaging and phototherapy [169].",

For example, Daniel J.'s group [149] reported a strategy termed Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) that allowed accurate delivery of diverse cargoes including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes to the lungs, spleens and livers following intravenous (i.v.) administration through incorporation of differentially charged phospholipids into the LNP formulation. (Fig. 9A). The results found that with an increasing molar percentage of permanent cationic lipid SORT moleculSes DOTAP, the resulting LNP moved progressively from liver to spleen, and then to lung, demonstrating a clear and precise organ-specific delivery trend. When added 50% of DOTAP into the formulations, 80% of the LNPs accumulated in lung. Whereas with the incorporation of 10-40% anionic lipid SORT molecules (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate, 18PA), LNPs mediated completely selective delivery to the spleen. With the addition of ionizable cationic lipid (1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammoniumpropane, DODAP), the LNPs significantly enhanced liver delivery > tenfold at 20% incorporation and transfected ~93% of hepatocytes. The results suggested that altering the internal and/or external charges of NPs may be a key and universal strategy in tuning tissue tropism. In addition, determining the precise mechanisms that explain how SORT enables tissue targeting will be the next research point.\n\nIn a follow-up to this study, Daniel J. et al. [153] synthesized a library of zwitterion ionizable phospholipids, termed \"iPhos\", which consist of one ionizable amino group and one phosphate head group with three hydrophobic lipid tails.

When administered intramuscularly, the nanoparticles end up in the liver and spleen, especially if the LNP size is less than 100 nm (Di et al., 2022). Larger nanoparticles, 320 nm, remain at the injection site because they do not seem to be able to penetrate capillaries effectively (Di et al., 2022). Furthermore, the biodistribution of LNPs may differ among animal species (Lam et al., 2023). It is believed that the optimal particle size for nonhuman primates (50-60 nm) is smaller than that for rodents (70-80 nm), possibly indicating a need for further optimization of LNP size for use in humans (Lam et al., 2023;Hassett et al., 2021).",

Ultimately, however, the discrete pathways by which tuning the physicochemical properties of formulation components directs LNPs to selectively traffic and express in certain organs and tissues require more detailed mechanistic studies to establish.\n\nThe physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo . A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [ 203 ]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [ 46 , 204 ]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171] , with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205] , and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [ 206 ]. Varying the proportion of charged and zwitterionic lipids at the surface of a lipid system has been reported to change the quantity and identity of the most abundant serum proteins [207] ; as such, controlling protein corona formation could present a strategy for specific targeting in vivo .\n\nLNPs may also be directly modified with a specific targeting agent in order to facilitate localization to the desired tissue or organ for more effective immunization.

The tissue-specific distribution could potentially be facilitated by multiple factors, including LNP particle size, lipid components, and incorporation of specific targeting proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies on the LNP surface (Veiga et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2021;Di et al., 2022). Although these properties of LNPs are enticing for future drug development, reports have identified variability in delivery of these constructs with greater inflammatory responses associated with the use of xenobiotic lipids which is not apparent with naturallyoccurring LNP components (Ndeupen et al., 2021). As naturally occurring LNP components (e.g., lipids, cholesterol, cholesterol esters) undergo in vivo processing similar to that of endogenous analogs and xenobiotic lipid clearance routes are typically unknown (Scioli Montoto et al., 2020), a thorough assessment of safety and reactogenicity after LNP administration is needed. It is thus crucial that studies focus on both the primary biodistribution of the intact mRNA-LNP as well as the redistribution of its constituents and metabolites to evaluate the immunogenic potential of the intact mRNA-LNP formulation, its constituents, and their metabolites.\n\nStudies investigating mRNA-LNP biodistribution have traditionally used methods such as intracellular enzymatic reporters to track the delivery of intact encapsulated mRNA into host cells (Hassett et al., 2019;Aldosari et al., 2021;Delehedde et al., 2021;Yang et al., 2021). Such methods provide information on the biodistribution of intact mRNA-LNPs, but because the reporting capacity of these techniques is dependent solely on the viability and successful delivery of the intact mRNA, this method has limited use in determining the in vivo fates of constituents, metabolites, or of damaged mRNA-",

For example, Perche et al. showed that mannosylated lipopolyplex can target splenic dendritic cells more efficiently than control lipopolyplex [159]. Similarly, Kim et al. found that LNPs with ionizable lipids 241C10 to 246C10 can efficiently target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) [108]. Moreover, Liu et al. observed that ionizable lipids with different lengths of hydrocarbon tails or helper lipids with different charges can be used to guide organ-selective mRNA-LNP distributions [130]. Chen et al. also applied the lipid 113-O12B to formulate LNPs that can specifically target lymph nodes [36]. Researchers also observed that tuning the content of PEG lipids in LNPs causes mRNA-loaded LNPs to target different types of liver cells in vivo. The same study offered evidence that mRNA-LNPs with mannose-PEG lipid specifically target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells [108]. Additionally, it has been reported that encapsulating additional molecules in LNPs can direct the complexes to different tissues. For example, inclusion of DODAP, 18PA or DOTAP causes the LNPs to respectively target liver, spleen or lung [38,50]. Moreover, Veiga et al. intravenously injected leukocyte-targeted IL-10 mRNA encapsulated in an anti-Ly6c-antibody-decorated LNP into a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This treatment increased the expression of IL-10 in colon, consequently reducing intestinal inflammation and preventing colitis pathogenesis [233]. Using a similar LNP design, Rosenblum et al. intraperitoneally injected anti-EGFR-antibody-decorated LNPs encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and PLK1 single guide RNA (sgRNA) to disseminated ovarian-tumor-bearing mice.",

Recently, surface engineering strategies were also utilized to improve the performance and other properties of LNPs beyond the targeted delivery (supplementary Table S3). It was found that LNP accumulation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) activated endothelial cells and neutrophilic inflammation, which might induce both hepatic and systemic toxicity. To address this issue, LNPs were modified with GalNAc ligands to maximize their hepatocyte specificity while reducing uptake by LSECs (Sato et al. 2017). The results showed that systemic administration of GalNAc-LNPs carrying siRNA against hepatitis B virus (HBV) circumvented hepatotoxicity and systemic toxicity in mice with no loss of therapeutic activity in persistent HBV infections (Fig. 5A). To improve the safety profile of LNPs, the \"stealth\" shell of PEG was replaced by a synthetic non-ionic hydrophilic polypeptoid, pSar 23 (polysarcosine) (Nogueira et al. 2020;Wilhelmy et al. 2023). Analysis of in vivo systemic toxicity revealed that pSar-LNPs induced similar or lower liver enzyme levels (e.g., alanine aminotransferase/ALT, aspartate transaminase/AST, lactate dehydrogenase/LDH, and total bilirubin) and reduced cytokine induction compared to their PEG-LNP counterparts (Nogueira et al. 2020). Furthermore, a higher and prolonged erythropoietin (EPO) secretion was observed in mice treated with pSar-LNPs containing DPL14 ionizable lipid (Fig. 5B). Enhanced transfection efficiency and cell-binding affinity to monocytes were also achieved with pSar-LNPs in vitro (Wilhelmy et al. 2023). \n\nIntracellular kinetics of nucleic acid-LNPs can also be affected through the surface engineering.",

Their results indicated that LNC clearance from the blood was mainly due to the liver. This could be due to the action of hepatic macrophages that captured the nanoparticles. 79 In addition, the smallness of the prepared LNCs (<100 nm) helped them to diffuse from blood to hepatocytes through fenestration of the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium. 79 Another finding ( Figure 7B) was that there were significant 1.4-and 1.6-fold increases (p\u22640.05) in hepatic accumulation after IP administration of DiI-PS-LNCs and DiI-HA-LNCs, respectively, compared to untargeted DiI-LNCs. This strongly reflected the role of both PS and HA as suitable ligands for LNCs achieving active targeting to hepatic fibrosis. These results are in agreement with Wang et al, 27 where curcuminloaded PS-modified nanostructured lipid carriers displayed an enhanced liver-targeting ability compared to an unmodified formulation. This could be due to anionic PS actively targeting hepatic macrophages. 27 The role of HA in actively targeting overexpressed CD44 receptors in liver fibrosis was demonstrated by Thomas et al. 22 They prepared losartan-loaded HAmodified micelles and studied their biodistribution in both a normal and hepatic fibrotic mouse model. They found that accumulation of their prepared system in the liver was significantly higher for fibrotic mice than normal ones, due to the overexpression of CD44 receptors on activated HSCs, which mediated endocytosis of the HA-decorated micelles. 22 To sum up, the results of tissue biodistribution study proved the active targeting achieved by both PS and HA-LNCs to fibrotic liver and further confirmed the enhanced antifibrotic effect of these formulations compared to the untargeted one.",

In WT NHPs, we compared GalNAc-LNPs versus standard LNPs (N = 3 in each treatment group), both administered a single intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg. A mean reduction in blood ANGPTL3 protein of 90% was noted for animals treated with the GalNAc-LNP versus 75% in those treated with a standard LNP (Fig. 3h). This reduction was durable when assessed six months following dosing. To determine the extent of on-target ANGPTL3 editing in the liver and other tissues, targeted amplicon sequencing was performed in animals at time of scheduled necropsy six months following dosing. GalNAc-LNPs yielded 64% editing in WT animals, while standard LNPs yielded 58%. Assessment of 17 additional sites and tissues noted minimal editing in non-hepatic tissues with both standard and GalNAc-LNPs, less than 2% for each (Fig. 4). These data suggest that GalNAc-LNPs are effective in enabling base editing in NHPs with normal or reduced LDLR activity and that the reduction is durable. \n\nLiver safety monitoring noted transient increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) for GalNAc-LNP treated NHPs, with similar results observed with standard LNPs (Supplementary Fig. 5).

            "text": "Notably, the hepatic uptake process dynamics of LNPs differs between the ApoE-LDLR-mediated endogenous targeting pathway and the GalNAc-mediated active targeting pathway [92]. Specifically, in the endogenous targeting pathway, LNPs rapidly enter the Disse space from the blood and gradually accumulate, then being slowly absorbed by the cells. In contrast, in the active targeting pathway, LNPs exhibit slower and more sustained cellular uptake, remaining in the blood for a longer period. Although active targeting can enhance the specificity of the mRNA-LNPs by incorporating additional targeting ligands, its implementation for hepatocyte targeting is less common due to increased formulation complexity. Currently, liver-specific delivery research predominantly employs passive and endogenous targeting. \n\nBesides hepatocytes, other cells also play important roles in liver diseases and can serve as the target cells of mRNA NPs [121]. For example, HSCs are important effector cells in liver fibrosis [122], while liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are significant in immunotherapy and a proposed target for immunomodulation [113,123]. \n\nHowever, HSCs are difficult to transfect, and the complexity of the liver microenvironment during liver fibrosis further compounds the difficulty of targeting HSCs. To address these challenges, Younis et al. designed a ligand-free mRNA-LNP containing CL15A6 lipid of hydrophobic scaffold structure (Fig. 7B) [108]. This formulation achieved successful transfection of over 80% of HSCs in vivo in liver fibrosis mice. The CL15A6-LNP had a diameter of approximately 80 nm, allowing it to pass through the fenestrated liver sinusoidal endothelium. Additionally, the LNP pKa was about 7.25, which made LNPs unrecognizable by ApoE, thus avoiding substantial interactions with hepatocytes. Further, CL15A6-LNP uptake by HSCs occurs through platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2)-mediated CME.",

            "text": "They found that the composition of the protein crown of the LNPs could be adjusted via simple chemical methods to regulate the in vivo organ targeting of the LNPs, which provides new ideas for the rational design of organ-and cell-selective LNP@mRNAs with a high specificity and that in the future could even target other organs such as the heart, brain and pancreas. In addition, by analyzing the protein crown components on the surface of liver-targeting and lung-targeting LNPs, the scientists identified 14 proteins that may influence the lung targeting of LNPs, including albumin, ApoE, fibrinogen \u03b2, and fibrinogen \u03b3. It remains to be further investigated which protein or proteins play the decisive role. In addition, changes in lipid species or alternative approaches such as LNPs that contain bound phospholipids [136] and engineered LNPs [137] can also alter the targeting of LNPs. \n\nIn the future, achieving targeted delivery of mRNA will become more challenging and critical, which may accelerate the widespread use of mRNA technology in precision medicine. The combination of tissue-and cell-targeting strategies may be a good method, but there are still some issues to be addressed. For example, ligand/antibody-modified LNPs may disrupt the balance of internal components and the recruitment of protein crowns in the blood, thus affecting the established tissue specificity of the LNPs. We believe that with further research on targeted delivery, more-precise targeting strategies will emerge and be applied in precision medicine in the future.",

            "text": "Although alternative strategies are proposed, like cleavage of a PEG moiety (72), this problem is majorly addressed by a strategy based on \"reversible PEGylation\", where a lipid-containing PEG slowly detaches from the NP surface once administered. This allows to take advantage of the disposing of the high PEG concentration needed for small and monodisperse synthesis and distribution, and the lower PEG concentration needed to have a good cellular uptake at the moment when the NP reaches the target organ. Note that an increase in the concentration of PEG also influences its conformation and protective effects, increasing the circulation time of the iLNPs (71). Indeed, a completely PEG-covered iLNP surface will dramatically inhibit the interaction with cells and serum proteins, modifying circulation time and biodistribution (68,71). Such PEG-lipids remain integrated into the LNP structure during formation and under storage conditions, but in the presence of a lipid sink like in plasma, these PEG-lipids are stripped off the particle and into de medium, leaving the surface of the iLNP gradually unshielded (45). These PEG-lipids have short alkyl chains -which act as \"hydrophobic anchors\"-allowing a reasonable desorption rate once they enter blood circulation (71). The proper balance between a fully protected surface for iLNP synthesis and distribution, and a relatively unshielded surface for interactions with cell membranes, is achieved by finding a compromise between alkyl chain length and PEG-lipid surface concentration. \n\nSpecial mention deserves the interaction of NPs with proteins, adjusted by the size and concentration of PEG at the NP surface. When NPs are administrated into the body, they first interact with biological fluids. Depending on the administration site, the biomolecules that will interact with the NPs can vary: from lung surfactants when inhaled to the interstitial fluid when locally injected into blood plasma following intravenous administration (73).",

            "text": "Having identified a common backbone in the structure of our lipids, we then performed structure-activity studies to explore how chemical modifications in specific moieties of these lipids could affect their extrahepatic delivery performance, particularly in their targeting to the lungs. \n\nHydrophobic tail regions are known to play a pivotal role in determining the LNP biodistribution, impacting factors such as lipid packing, LNP stability, and their cellular However, given the known influence of LNP surface charge on protein corona formation [12,29], we hypothesized that some of our ionizable lipids forming LNPs with zeta potential values outside the typical range for liver targeting might express preferentially in other organs. To test this hypothesis, we retrospectively re-evaluated these lipids, selecting the screened candidates that yielded LNPs with physicochemical properties deviating from the liver-targeting norms. We specifically focused on the zeta potential as this reflects the overall surface charge, which can influence interactions with serum proteins, the biodistribution, and passive organ targeting. \n\nThus, for this selection, we applied two criteria. First, we focused on LNPs with a zeta potential equal to or greater than \u22122 mV, inspired by previous findings that suggested that an increased surface charge could enhance lung targeting [10,12]. Second, we included LNPs that demonstrated strong protein expression, specifically those exceeding a total flux of 1 \u00d7 10 7 p/s in the original intramuscular screening, ensuring that only high-performing candidates were considered (chemical structures can be found in Figure S1). Additionally, we incorporated thirteen lipids that exhibited exceptionally high protein expression despite having more negative zeta potentials, allowing us to explore potential outliers with unique targeting properties (Figure 1B). \n\nAfter intravenous administration of LNPs formulated with the selected ionizable lipids and encapsulating luciferase mRNA, ex vivo analyses revealed that, while most of the selected ionizable lipids still showed liver tropism, eight of them demonstrated lung-selective expression exceeding 10% selectivity (Figure 1C,D).",

            "text": "Owing to its simple, flexible, and effective preparation process, the post-insertion method is widely adopted for the production of targeted lipid-based vesicles, including LNPs. For example, micelles consisting of \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-targeted cyclic RGD-PEG-DSPE (Sakurai et al. 2016) or epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-targeted Epi-1 peptide-PEG-DSPE (Sakurai et al. 2017) were synthesized and used to prepare targeted LNPs for treating metastatic lung tumors or Hep-3B hepatocellular cancer, respectively. In a more recent study, the optimized multi-valent GalNAc targeting ligand GL6 was rationally designed and utilized to fabricate the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR)-targeted LNPs for the delivery of the CRISPR base editing drug to the liver of patients lacking sufficient LDLR activity (Kasiewicz et al. 2023). Moreover, the post-insertion method is preferred for the incorporation of long peptide-and polyanionic macromolecule-based ligands, since the long peptide (e.g., RVG peptide) usually contains multiple hydrophobic amino acids that may interfere with the self-assembly process of LNPs, and the polyanionic macromolecule, such as the CH6 aptamer (Liang et al. 2015), is highly negatively charged and would be entrapped in the inner core of LNPs, thereby losing the possibility of being displayed on the surface. Apart from the traditional post-insertion method, presynthesized ligands can also be dissolved in aqueous solutions and then directly mixed with preformed LNPs, bypassing the micelle formation step (Fig. 2C). The prerequisite for using this method is that the ligands should be soluble in water and not precipitate during the modification process.",

            "text": "In general, the large amount of systemically injected AuNP tend to be eliminated from the blood by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and accumulated in several organs such as the kidney, spleen, and liver [47][48][49][50][51]. Especially, liver and spleen are considered two main organs for the biodistribution and metabolism of AuNP. Moreover, the distribution of AuNP to those organs depends on their size, and particles with a size  of 5-15 nm have a wider distribution than larger ones [52,53]. Therefore, we measured the biodistribution of orally administered Lf-PEG-AuNP and AuNP. Despite of low absorption, the amount of AuNP was accumulated similarly to that of Lf-PEG-AuNP at kidney, spleen, and liver (Table 1). Interestingly, the amount of Lf-PEG-AuNP was significantly accumulated at the heart and lung compared to that of AuNP itself. Recent studies have shown that the LfR-like intelectin is prominently expressed in pericardium mesothelial cells, intestinal epithelial cells, and lung epithelial cells [54][55][56][57]. Therefore, the orally absorbed Lf-PEG-AuNP could be slightly accumulated at the heart and lung tissue. On the other hand, although Lf-PEG-AuNPs were administered orally five times in succession, there was no damage of the kidney, liver, lung, or spleen tissue based on the histological analysis (Fig. S7). In addition, there was no change in spleen tissue size when monitoring strong immunogenicity, even though Lf-PEG-AuNP was repeatedly administered orally. Furthermore, there was no adverse behavior among the experimental animals in terms of food intake or weight loss during oral administration of Lf-PEG-AuNP. Therefore, Lf-PEG-AuNP can be reliably used to target GBM tissue in the brain without damage to other tissues.",

However, the non-PEGylated conjugate showed a high accumulation in liver and spleen while this accumulation effect was considerably decreased in these dose-limiting organs when the tracer was conjugated with a PEG linker. The accumulation in liver and spleen can be explained by non-specific uptake of the conjugates through cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system particularly by Kupffer cells and splenocytes. \n\nRegarding the retention in circulation of the two different biotin derivatives, the tumor to heart ratio is also not significantly changed (SI Figure S8). This indicates that a prolonged circulation due to PEGylation is not responsible for the different amount of accumulation detected in liver. Therefore, the significantly reduced accumulation of the PEGylated biotin in the liver is more likely related to a lower uptake by Kupffer cells 42 . This results in a favored biodistribution for future diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

            "text": "Due to individuals' metabolic variability, those with pre-existing liver dysfunction exhibit reduced capacity to clear LNPs or inflammatory mediators, increasing susceptibility to cumulative toxicity [26]. Secondly, PEG-mediated allergic reactions (rare) were observed. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of LNPs, may rarely induce IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. Notably, PEG is widely used in consumer products (e.g., cosmetics and skincare), leading to pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies in some individuals. These antibodies heighten the risk of post-vaccination allergic responses [27]. Finally, localized immune reactions occur. Transient injection-site pain or swelling arises from LNP-or mRNA-driven activation of local immune cells (e.g., macrophages), which release inflammatory mediators such as histamine. To overcome these shortcomings, hepatic exposure can be mitigated through several approaches. LNP design parameters and component ratios can be optimized to enhance target specificity, tissue-specific delivery vectors targeting extrahepatic sites, such as skeletal muscle, could be engaged. PEG-free LNPs or alternative stabilizers to reduce allergenic potential can be developed, and individualized vaccination protocols that adjust dosage regimens for patients with pre-existing hepatic conditions or immunocompromise should be implemented. Complementary to these interventions, systematic hepatic function monitoring should be integrated throughout the vaccination process, incorporating baseline assessments and post-administration surveillance to ensure therapeutic safety. The mRNA vaccine platform elucidates convenient, flexible, and versatile vaccine antigen design, the robust cellular immune response induced by exogenous mRNA, self-adjuvant lipid nanoparticles (LNP) causing an innate immune response, and the ability to be easily scaled up for massive manufacturing. Most recently, Pfizer/BioNTech initiated a phase I/II clinical study of VZV mRNA vaccine candidates in February 2023 [28]. Moderna's mRNA-1468 has initial data from phase I/II of the study in March 2024 [29].",

[122]LNPs are known for their highly effective RNA delivery to liver hepatocytes.For example, Onpattro, an LNP formulation of siRNA, which was approved by FDA for treating polyneuropathies in 2018, delivers siRNA to hepatocytes with high potency. [123]To translate the clinically approved delivery platform to mRNA-based therapy, Wang et al. used liver-homing MC3 LNPs to selectively deliver mRNA to the liver with a high transfection efficacy while drastically less in other organs. [124]Similarly, Rybakova et al. used liver-targeting LNPs to deliver modified mRNA encoding an anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibody, trastuzumab, into the liver which reached the expression of full-size therapeutic antibodies to elicit potent antitumor effect. [125]Apart from targeting hepatocytes, transporting mRNA to liver microenvironmental cells represents an attractive strategy for treating liver cancer.Paunovska et al. formulated LNP with oxidized cholesterol which preferentially delivered mRNA into liver microenvironmental cells (e.g., liver endothelial cells, Kupffer cells), with a five-fold transfection rate than hepatocytes. [126]These liver-targeting mRNA-delivering platforms hold great potential in hepatoma immunotherapy.\n\nGiven that most of the systemically administrated mRNA delivery systems are intended to accumulate in the liver, [58,86c,124,127] transporting mRNA outside the liver is urgently needed for certain extrahepatic diseases, such as extrahepatic cancers. [128]By varying the lipid-to-mRNA weight ratio and subsequently adjusting the surface charges of LNP, Kranz et al. reported a pioneering study for surfacecharge dependent organ tropism of mRNA-LNP, opening the prelude to using LNP to deliver mRNA in vivo.

            "text": "an intermediate near-neutral net charge [153]. Consistent with the above findings, highly positive LNPs targeted the lungs and highly negative LNPs targeted the spleen, while intermediate charge levels predominantly targeted the liver. Liver targeting has been shown to depend on Apo-E binding to near-neutral liposomes or LNPs [154], which does not occur for negatively charged liposomes [155].\n\nNotably, all of the above charge-mediated targeting studies have been done using IV administration and the routes typically used for vaccination, such as the intramuscular or intradermal routes, have not been examined. Most studies that analyze expression after intramuscular injection do, however, detect the systemic trafficking of mRNA LNPs, which are rapidly and strongly expressed in the liver, at the same time as they are expressed in muscle and draining lymph nodes [97,156,157]. These particular LNPs therefore seem to enter the vasculature and are subsequently expressed in liver hepatocytes due to passive ApoE-mediated targeting, which is not surprising since they were designed for hepatocyte targeting. This systemic distribution and expression of immunogens could, however, generate systemic cytokines, complement activation and lead to other potential undesirable effects that could amplify the frequency or severity of adverse events and/or impair immune response generation. Finally, only a limited number of studies have been carried out with ligand-mediated targeting of LNPs. Lung endothelial cell targeting was achieved by conjugating CD31 (PECAM) antibodies to the LNP and injecting intravascularly [158]. The liver hepatocyte-directed LNP then became largely redirected to the lung. A similar approach using a VCAM ligand successfully targeted LNPs to inflamed regions of the brain and alleviated TNF-\u03b1-induced brain edema [159]. Dendritic cells in vitro were also more efficiently transfected using a mannosylated liposome, which may be a strategy applicable to vaccination [160]. Higher throughput screening methods to identify ligands targeting specific cell types have also been developed and may be applicable for the targeting of specific dendritic cell subsets [161",

Recently, for the first time, we were able to elucidate the pH-induced changes in the bilayer structure in LPXs comprising ionizable lipids in situ by using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) [17], where we could reveal clear differences as a function of lipid structure and the composition of the systems. \n\nAs helper lipids, typically phospholipids comprising either a phosphatidyl ethanolamine (-PE) or phosphatidyl choline (-PC) head group are used, where lipids with saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon chains may be selected. The helper lipids may have an important influence on the activity and the targeting selectivity of the LNPs. For example, it has been shown that by using dioleyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) in LPXs as a helper lipid, the mRNA expression in the liver could be reduced to very low levels [18,19]. For many future applications of mRNA, therapeutics such as extrahepatic targeting, or more generally speaking, organ-selective targeting, is still an unmet need, since classical LNPs typically result in the highest expression in the liver. The selection of appropriate helper lipids and lipid compositions may allow the better adjustment of targeting selectivity according to the therapeutic requirements [20]. \n\nThe use of PEG-functionalized lipids (PEGylated lipids) as an excipient for drug and mRNA delivery has been widely adopted in various nanoparticulate systems, including liposomes, proteins and LNPs. In addition to modulating circulation in the bloodstream, PEGylation is necessary for LNP engineering to avoid aggregation during the mixing of the RNA with the lipid solution.",

With respect to tumor accumulation, all groups showed equal accumulation in the tumor (Fig. 2c,d). The tumor accumulation percentage of the control group LNPs (~2.5 % ID/g tissue) is consistent with reported results from a study that investigated similar LNPs in mice with subcutaneously engrafted prostate cancer (van der Meel et al., 2021). We also analyzed the siRNA levels in tissue lysates by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2e).

Leveraging liver biodistribution, Onpattro\u00ae LNPs (ionizable lipid = MC3 with noncleavable lipid tails) are designed to treat liver hATTR amyloidosis [123,176]. The high liver accumulation of MC3 LNPs sparks the development of ionizable lipids with cleavable ester tails. Ester lipid tails have been used in clinically approved SM-102, ALC-0315 ionizable lipids, and many other structural derivatives sharing liver biodistributions for improving the biodegradability of ionizable lipids in liver [177]. On the lipidoid side, the classic lipidoid 5-tail piperazine-based C12-200 is known to target both liver and spleen when given intravenously [177]. The 4-tail piperazine-based 246C10, however, showed liver-only distribution in a CRISPR/Cas gene editing study targeting antithrombin (mAT) for treating hemophilia [11]. With 2 extra carbons in the lipid chain in 246C10, LNPs based on piperazine-based IC8 (246C12) were shown to distribute to the liver and spleen when delivering mRNA encoding B7H3 \u00d7 CD3 bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) antibodies. The liver was targeted as an in vivo antibody factory for BiTEs expression and secretion to treat hematologic malignancies and melanoma [178]. LNPs based on modified diketopiperazine (DKP)-based lipidoids, e.g., cKK-E12 (non-cleavable saturated tails) and OF-02 (non-cleavable unsaturated tails), showed a highly liver-focused distribution with higher protein translation efficiency by OF-02 compared to cKK-E12 [153].",

Furthermore, the LNP structure gives a unique opportunity to promote tissue-selective delivery. Firstly, an adjustment of particle size through variation of PEGlipids content supports targeting the tissue of interest. For example, LNPs with low PEG percentage (0.5%; $150 nm in size) achieved highest transfection efficiencies in the eye [155], whereas liver cells preferably internalized smaller particles (1.5% PEG; $68 nm) [160]. Secondly, it is possible to incorporate cellspecific antibodies or receptor ligands into the exterior layer of an LNP. Thus, Li et al. (2020) succeed in targeting murine caveolae (part of endothelial membrane in lung capillaries) using antibodyconjugated LNPs. Although these antibody-modified LNPs were applied systemically, a tremendous increase of protein expression (40-fold rate related to unconjugated control) was detected specifically in lungs [161]. Another example of a successful selective delivery was provided by , who accomplished specific transfection of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells by interlinking mannose molecules with PEG lipids [160].\n\nThe peculiar advantage of an LNP system lays in almost unlimited latitude of modification possibilities. At the same time, the complexity of these particles makes it difficult to predict the actual molecular organization of its ingredients. Whereas some groups believe that LNPs build a lipid bilayer [162], thereby PEG-lipids reside at the outside and DSPCs are turned towards the inside of the particle [163], other scientists tend to consider a monolayer arrangement of outward lipids [158,164]. The latter point of view assumes that the DSPC layer diverges upon attraction to the mRNA molecules, which leads to a formation of multiple aqueous ''bleds\" containing mRNA within the core of an LNP [165]. Yet, the precise location of these mRNA vesicles remains elusive [166]. Therefore, despite the already proven efficacy and safety of L",

            "text": "Understanding the mRNA loading mechanism and biobarriers helps us to identify the useful groups in carriers. However, the specific delivery of mRNA to tissues and cells in vivo remains a significant challenge. 98 Much research has reported the complicated interactions between nanoparticles and cells, as such information is key to rationally designing particles for biological applications, which may determine the cellular uptake leading to the specific accumulation. It was reported that the surface charge of LNPs at physiological pH can influence their plasma protein adsorption and in vivo behavior (e.g., tissue distribution). 14,98 A classic example is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), generally recognized as an endogenous ligand targeted to the liver. 99 One explanation is that the neutral surface vehicle will absorb more ApoE, resulting in a stronger tendency to distribute in the liver. 100 The dissociation constant (pK a ) that determines the surface charge of LNPs at different pH is one of the important factors to consider when designing ionizable lipids. Other pieces of evidence also suggest that surface charge has an impact on the targeting ability of LNPs: the inclusion of neutral ionizable lipids enhanced liver targeting, anionic lipids resulted in retargeting of delivery to the spleen, and permanently cationic lipids bearing a quaternary ammonium headgroup specifically deliver mRNA to lung. 101,102 Interestingly, the above two nonliver targeting effects occur independently of ApoE, which suggests that there is a correlation between the components of protein corona and surface charges of nanoparticles, resulting in the differences in the tissue-targeted ability 103 . 104 recent study found that LNPs prepared with the structurally similar ionizable lipids 306-O12B and 306-N16B showed slight negative charges without significant differences. 105 However, 306-O12B containing the ester linker led to liver targeting, while 306-N16B with an amide linker tended to lung targeting. Compared with ester bonds, amides tend to combine with proteins via hydrogen bonds. 106 Thus, the protein corona coating in 306-N16B LNPs is completely different from that in 306-O16B LNPs, which has been proven. 105",

These changes have the effect of producing LNPs that are typically larger (in the 120-160nm range as compared to 60-100nm range) and which are more negatively charged than standard LNPs. By considering the available surface area and availability of PEGylated lipids, we estimate that, before administration, our LNPs have a reduced mantle of PEG at the LNP-water interface, which may affect uptake by phagocytic cells. However, we recognize that the surface properties of DMG-PEG2000-coated LNPs will be substantially changed, by interaction with lipoproteins and plasma proteins, when they reach the blood circulation after IM injection (30). \n\nThe modifications in lipid molar ratios we made to the standard LNP formula were based on our previous, as yet unpublished, observations (27,31). Prior to our work on the COVID vaccine we were investigating the effect of size, charge and PEGylated lipid content on biodistribution. We found that after intravenous (IV) injection, larger, more negatively charged particles are extracted to a lesser extent by the mouse liver. This results in a higher extent of mRNA translation in spleen versus liver (27,31). We posit that this redistribution, and reduction in liver uptake, is desirable for vaccination, in contrast with the aim of the Onpattro product which was designed for delivery of siRNA to the liver (28). \n\nThe spleen/liver redistribution is evident when the PEGylated lipid content is reduced within the range 0.15-0.25 mole% PEGylated lipid and with N/P ratio = 5 (27,31). We found that redistribution correlated with improved translation of reporter mRNA in phagocytic cells in the spleen and improved cell-mediated responses to vaccination of mice with mRNA encoding ovalbumin.",

            "text": "Dose escalation of systemically administered IL10 leads to adverse effects due to its inherent biological actions (Fedorak and others 2000;Schreiber and others 2000). In accordance with this, clinical studies reported beneficial effects of long-term IL10 therapy to treat HCV-associated liver fibrosis but this was accompanied by an immunosuppressive action, as noted in a flare-up of the viral burden, and low therapeutic efficacy (Nelson and others 2000) (Meijer and others 2001). Liver-selective delivery of this cytokine may prevent these clinical problems and create biological effects within relevant cells. \n\nUpregulation of mannose-6-phosphate/IGF-II receptors during liver injury on HSC (de Bleser and others 1995) offers an excellent target for receptor-mediated antifibrotic drug delivery as shown with albumin substituted with mannose-6-phosphate groups (Beljaars and others 1999). We therefore modified IL10 with the sugar mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) to selectively deliver this cytokine to HSC in fibrotic livers (Rachmawati and others 2007). We showed that after modification of IL10 with mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) a compound was generated that binds to the M6P/IGF-II receptor which is highly present on activated HSC. Our chemically engineered cytokine, M6P-IL10, displayed good pharmacological activity in vitro in freshly isolated HSC. We now performed biodistribution studies of radiolabeled-M6P-modified IL10 using gamma-camera techniques to examine the active delivery of this compound to the diseased tissue. Furthermore, we studied the pharmacological activities of this conjugate in rats at an early stage of liver fibrosis and compared this to the effects of unmodified IL10.",

            "text": "The targeting ability of LNP to different organs can be controlled by adjusting the proportions of lipids in LNP. Recently, Siegwart groups found by changing the component and composition of LNP could realize the selective organ targeting ability, and they named this passive targeting LNP as SORT nanoparticles (Figure 3). 72 With the advancement of organic synthesis, a lot of ionizable cationic and anionic lipids are commercially available. Adding the fifth lipid in the existing prescription of traditional four-component LNP and adjusting the proportion of this lipid could realize the selective targeting ability to different organs, including the liver, lung, and spleen. After in vivo screening, they found that the traditional fourcomponent LNP will accumulate mainly in the liver and partially in the spleen, while the incorporation of the fifth lipid will change the distribution, and this effect was related to the proportion of the fifth lipid. When using cationic lipid as the fifth component, the distribution of LNP to the liver decreases when the proportion of the fifth lipid increases. As for the distribution of LNP to the lung and spleen, when the proportion of cationic lipids is higher than 50%, more than 90% of LNP is accumulated in the lung. While if the anionic lipid was chosen as the fifth lipid, the amount of LNP distributed to the liver decreased when the proportion of anionic lipid increased, and almost no LNP distributed to the lung. For the distribution of LNP to the spleen, the maximum distribution to the spleen was with the use of around 30% anionic lipid. If the fifth lipid was ionizable cationic lipid, the LNP distributed to the liver will increase and then decrease with the proportion of the fifth lipid increased. The 20% addition of ionizable cationic lipid realized the maximum distribution to the liver. Together, the incorporation of the fifth lipid will greatly affect the biodistribution of LNP to main organs, and 50% cationic SORT lipid, 30% anionic SORT lipid, and 20% ionizable cationic SORT lipid will facilitate the distribution of LNP to lung, spleen, and liver, respectively.",

In the same work (Kawaguchi et al., 2023), it was noted that with a decrease in the cholesterol amount, the nanoparticles tend to increase in size over time, and they also have a higher PDI and their encapsulation efficiency declines over time. \n\nFor subcutaneous and intramuscular administration of the LNPs, a decrease in the cholesterol content reduced the biodistribution of the nanoparticles to the liver and the expression of the reporter protein there, whereas at the injection site, the level of reporter protein expression did not change. This evidence suggests that the creation of LNPs that do not end up in the liver requires reducing the amount of (or replacing) cholesterol, in agreement with the results from Radloff et al. (2023), which indicates that the use of cholesterol-free three-component LNPs when administered intravenously leads to reporter protein expression almost exclusively in lungs, with small levels in the spleen. Reducing the cholesterol content also improved the targeting of LNPs to the spleen when the LNPs were based on known lipids and were administered intravenously (Radloff et al., 2023). In the optimized composition of LNPs in Shimosakai et al. (2022), which showed >95% efficiency of LNP delivery to the spleen, the cholesterol content was reduced to 10 mol%, whereas the concentration of a helper lipid was increased to 60 mol%. Among splenocytes, the LNPs got successfully distributed into antigen-presenting cells but not T lymphocytes (Shimosakai et al., 2022). \n\nModified cholesterol can also be employed for LNP targeting. In Paunovska et al. (2019), scientists assessed the effect of cholesterol modifications on the delivery of Cre mRNA within LNPs into different types of cells of Ai14 mice in seven organs: the liver, spleen, heart, kidneys, lungs, pancreas, and bone marrow.",

            "text": "Background/Objectives: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are leading mRNA delivery vehicles, with ionizable lipids (ILs) as their key component. However, the relationship between the IL structure and LNP endogenous organ-targeting is not well understood. In this study, we developed a novel library of biodegradable ILs featuring beta-propionate linkers, which, when incorporated into a four-component LNP formulation, show excellent extrahepatic selectivity and high protein expression. Methods: We explored the impact of structural modifications in the hydrophobic chains and polar-head groups in the ILs while keeping the linkers unchanged. In vivo results were evaluated to examine how structural changes influence the biodistribution to spleen or lungs. LNP formulations were assessed for their protein expression levels and organ-specific targeting. Additionally, protein corona formation by the best-performing LNPs was examined to provide further mechanistic insights. Results: Organ targeting was significantly influenced by structural changes in the ILs, allowing for precise control of the biodistribution between the spleen and lungs. Branched hydrophobic chains demonstrated a higher propensity for spleen targeting, while modifications in the polar-head group could drastically shift biodistribution from the lung to the spleen. This led to the identification of LNPs\u2019 zeta potential as a key determinant of their extrahepatic targeting properties. Notably, ionizable lipid A3T2C7, also known as CP-LC-1495, displayed strong lung selectivity (97%) and high protein expression in lung tissue (1.21 \u00d7 108 p/s). Similarly, several promising candidates for spleen-targeting LNPs displayed protein expression levels exceeding 1 \u00d7 107 p/s (selectivity >80%). Conclusions: This study elucidates the structure\u2013function relationships of ILs in passive organ-specific mRNA delivery, highlighting how the fine-tuning of hydrophobic chains, polar-head groups, and surface charge (zeta potential) allows for the precise control of LNP endogenous biodistribution, a mechanism influenced by protein corona formation. These findings enable the rational design of targeted LNP systems, enhancing their therapeutic potential for specific organs, such as the spleen and",

Katakowski et al. showed effective tar geting and knockdown of murine DCs with siRNA-LNPs coated with a nanobody targeting DEC-205 after i.v. administration, a targeting strategy that could be adapted for delivery of mRNA vaccines [ 215 ]. Mannosylated liposomes and lipoplexes have also provided successful delivery of mRNA to DCs [ 216 , 217 ]. Though mannose-based targeting approaches have been underutilized for mRNA-LNPs, Zhuang et al. recently demonstrated that intranasal (i.n.) administration of mannosylated LNPs can provide complete protection against influenza in mice challenged with a tenfold LD50 H1N1 influenza virus dose. The response to the mannosylated LNPs was also superior to cationic mRNA-LNPs lacking mannose [ 218 ]. Veiga and colleagues have also developed a monoclonal antibody-based targeting system in LNPs, dubbed ASSET, to direct RNA delivery to leukocytes after i.v. injection [219] , and demonstrated that mRNA-LNPs could specifically target Ly6c + inflammatory leukocytes and elicit a therapeutic effect in mice, though this system was not utilized in the context of infectious disease [ 220 ]. Direct targeting of APCs therefore represents a dual approach for effective vaccine delivery in lymph-directed mRNA-LNP vaccines, or an alternative pathway for candidates should their physicochemical properties prove unfavorable for uptake into the lymph.",

Downstream processing consists of either dialysis, tangential flow filtration or centrifuge filtration against PBS to remove ethanol and for buffer exchange. \n\nTissue targeting LNP can be obtained by introducing targeting ligands directly to the formulation in ethanol, chemically conjugating to the LNP surface, or by modifying the composition of the lipids in the formulation. Herein, active targeting refers to LNPs that contains a target-specific ligand in the formulation, whereas passive targeting refers to constructs lacking chemically conjugated targeting moieties. \n\nActive targeting of LNP using antibodies was adopted by several groups, where a functionalized DSPE-PEG was introduced during LNP formulation at 12.5-25 mol% of total PEG, followed by chemically grafting the antibody [7][8][9]. For example, a simple amidation was used to conjugate \u03b1CD34 antibody to DSPE-PEG-carboxyl [8], and thiol-maleimide conjugation was employed to attach anti-CD4 antibody [9,10] and mAb specific for PECAM-1 [11] to DSPE-PEG-maleimide containing LNP. Caveolae targeted delivery to the lungs was achieved by conjugating Fab-C4 to DSPE-PEG-maleimide via a Diels-Alder reaction, where the Fab-C4 contains a cyclopentadiene lysine derivative to allow the Diels-Alder transformation [7]. A different strategy was utilized by Goswani et al. where the targeting ligand was attached to cholesterol instead of PEG-lipid. Here, \u03b1-mannose containing an aminopropyl succinate spacer was conjugated to cholesterol via an amide bond and formulated into LNP to deliver saRNA to dendritic cells [12].",

Although YSK05-LNP and YSK05/12-LNP have a similar biodistribution, as shown in Figure S2, in which the lipids and siRNA of both types of LNPs were visualized by Fluo-rVivo imaging and were found to be largely distributed to liver tissues, the intrahepatic distribution of those LNPs varied and was determined by their pKa value. The intrahepatic distribution was shifted substantially from hepatocytes (with YSK05-LNP [pKa 6.50; Figure 6, upper]) into LSECs (with YSK05/12-LNP [pKa 7.15; Figure 6, lower]). However, we observed that traces of the YSK05/12-LNP were distributed into hepatocytes and liver resident macrophages (Kupffer cells). Furthermore, the biodistribution of YSK05/12-LNP to the lung and spleen was minimal (only a weak siRNA fluorescent intensity was detected in lungs [Figure S2]) and its silencing activity in lung and spleen endothelia was weak (Figure S1). The selectivity of the YSK05/12-LNP for the liver endothelium over the lung or spleen endothelium can be attributed to the special scavenging character of LSECs, which have a very high endocytic capacity and are responsible for the uptake of soluble or colloidal materials and nanoparticles that are not large enough to be phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. 16,17,20,46,47",

            "text": "LNP formulations primarily target hepatic tissues when systemically administered. Because of this inherent advantage, the first clinical trials for both LNP\u2212siRNA and LNP\u2212Cas9 mRNA delivery target a liver-related genetic disease. However, additional lipids have been incorporated into LNPs to achieve extrahepatic delivery in mice. The overall charge and size of the LNPs determine their biodistribution in vivo. For example, LNPs containing novel degradable ionizable lipids can facilitate splenic delivery and transfect B lymphocytes. 41 The addition of a negatively charged lipid (18PA) can also result in spleen targeting. 76 Lung specificity can be achieved in formulations with PEG-lipids at 7 mol % that encapsulate mRNA. 45,46 igand conjugation of lipids can further achieve target specificity in in vitro in multiple cell lines 69 including those representing cancer cells, 87 as well as in lung tumors in vivo. 67 ddition of permanently cationic lipids in SORT can also achieve delivery to the lung, spleen and liver. 76 Nanoparticle size is another important factor in determining the biodistribution of LNPs after intravenous injections. Nanoparticles that are less than 10 nm in diameter may be removed by the kidneys via the glomerular capillaries whereas those larger than 200 nm will activate the complement system and are removed from the blood, accumulating in the liver and spleen. 96,97 However, LNPs of \u2264150 nm in size are capable of escaping fenestrated capillaries in the liver. 97 LNP formulations of an appropriate size are necessary to achieve optimum CRISPR/Cas9 delivery and subsequent genome editing efficiency. Particle size further plays a role in colloidal formulation stability. Ultimately, the overall charge, particle size, lipid ratio, and receptor-mediated ligand or antibody conjugations emphasize the versatility of LNPs as a delivery platform suitable for gene therapy that can achieve desired target specificity in vivo. \n\nThe format of LNP-encapsulated cargo also plays a role in determining the most suitable approach to CRISPR/Cas9 delivery.",

            "text": "In recent years, LNPs have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their potential as drug delivery systems. Thanks to their lipophilicity, these nanoparticles demonstrate the ability to overcome challenging physiological barriers, such as the bloodbrain barrier, even without surface modification. However, these lipids can also lead to some side effects. Ionizable lipids are key components of LNPs, but they carry potential toxicity. These lipids can activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs), particularly TLR4, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [184]. This immunostimulatory effect has been observed with ionizable lipids such as DLin-MC3-DMA and C12-200. Metabolites derived from ionizable lipids, such as fatty acids, can induce toxicity by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). The activation of these pathways may result in inflammation and liver toxicity [185]. Another potential source of toxicity is PEGylated lipids. The long-term safety of PEGylated lipids is a concern due to their ability to alter the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of LNPs. Repeated administration of PEGylated LNPs can trigger immune responses, leading to the production of anti-PEG antibodies. These antibodies can accelerate the clearance of subsequent doses of PEGylated LNPs from the bloodstream, reducing their therapeutic efficacy and increasing the risk of adverse reactions due to the rapid and unexpected distribution of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, LNPs are recognized by the body's immune system as foreign substances, which triggers the innate immune response and subsequently impacts adaptive immunity [186]. The rapid drug release observed with some oral LNPs may raise toxicity concerns, while excessively slow drug release can lead to suboptimal therapeutic effects. Therefore, the development of novel LNP formulations with an optimized release profile is crucial. This depends on the selection of appropriate cargo drugs, as different drugs exhibit distinct physicochemical properties and interactions with nanoparticles. Prolonged drug circulation is a common characteristic of oral LNP delivery; however, this extended circulation can result in slower tissue accumulation, including in the targeted tissues.",

Recently, advances were made in discovery of new lead ionizable lipids with enhanced bio-degradability, new combinations with alternative helper lipids, such as cholesterol analogues and polysarcosine, as an alternative surface modification to PEG [42][43][44][45]. When administered systemically, LNPs provide an excellent approach for direct delivery of mRNA therapeutics to liver cancers, or to exploit the liver as a factory site for the systemic secretion of mRNA-encoded proteins [46,47]. Moreover, LNP formulations can be designed to also target organ (cancer) tissues beyond the liver, maybe even to achieve cell-specific delivery. Early reports showed that LNP design can be optimized for the targeting of inflammatory monocytes and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in spleen and bone marrow [48,49]. Other studies have focused on the use of antibody conjugates to promote receptor-mediated uptake by specific target cells, and as a means to re-target LNPs to the lungs [50][51][52]. Cheng et al. [53] presented an alternative approach called Selective Organ Targeting (SORT), where they showed that by the inclusion of an additional cationic or anionic lipid (i.e., SORT molecule), activity profiles of mRNA LNPs could be shifted from the liver to the lungs and spleen. Although the authors could clearly demonstrate organ-specific mRNA expression, it remains to be elucidated whether this can be the result of different cellular uptake patterns for each of the investigated mRNA LNPs.",

The results identified LNP size and the PEG-DMG/phospholipid ratio as critical factors, which was similar to other lipid formulations, and that the optimized mRNA-loaded LNPs promoted liver-specific gene expression. Moreover, mRNA-loaded CL4H6-based LNPs showed higher protein expression in hepatocytes than the mRNA-loaded MC3-LNPs [35].\n\nSpecific organ targeting and protein expression are essential advantages of LNP-based RNA-delivery technology; therefore, the development of mRNA-delivery technology for targeted organs is strongly desired for protein-replacement therapy. B lymphocytes play an important role in antibody production, and dysregulation of B-cells induces autoimmune disorders. B-cells are attractive targets for gene delivery in order to modulate their functions; however, in vivo mRNAdelivery systems targeting B-cells to allow sufficient protein expression have not been demonstrated. Fenton et al. [85] synthesized a novel lipid (OF-Deg-Lin) for spleen-selective mRNA delivery and confirmed that OF-Deg-Lin-based LNPs could specifically produce proteins in Bcells. OF-Deg-Lin is an ionizable lipid that contains degradable linkers. The authors prepared Cy5-labeled mRNA-loaded LNPs and evaluated their biodistribution and luciferase expression, revealing that OF-Deg-Lin-based LNPs were mainly delivered to the liver; however, luciferase-expression efficiency was lower than that of the spleen, which demonstrated >85% of detected luciferase expression (Fig. 9). They hypothesized that the organ-dependent degradation of OF-Deg-Lin ester linkers affected spleen-specific luciferase expression and tested this hypothesis by preparing non-degradable OF-02-based mRNA-loaded LNPs. They found that OF-02-based mRNA-loaded LNPs were primarily distributed in the liver along with observed luciferase expression. Their findings suggested the importance of designing lipid molecules for selective targeting and protein expression [85]. Additionally, Cheng et al",

            "text": "The technology behind mRNA-based medicines has developed rapidly over the last decade and, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA medicines have demonstrated their safety and effectiveness as vaccines (Polack et al., 2020;Baden et al., 2021). While there now exists a greater understanding regarding the utility of mRNA-based medicines, the biodistribution profiles of LNPs and their constituents as well as the drivers influencing their biodistribution are less well understood. With the development of novel therapeutic and prophylactic mRNA-LNP modalities, many of which incorporate xenobiotic constituents, an in-depth biodistribution profile analysis is necessary to understand the in vivo fates and factors that influence the in vivo exposure of these medicines and their constituents. These data will inform the evolving clinical evaluation strategy as well as providing insight into future mRNA-LNP product development. In this study, we showed that after intravenous administration of Lipid 5, a xenobiotic amino lipid used in LNP formulations rapidly distributes throughout rat tissues in vivo, with exposure directed primarily toward the liver, spleen, lung, and kidneys. In addition, we showed that Lipid 5 and its [ 14 C]metabolites are undetectable in most tissues within 7 days (168 hours). Our findings showed similar distribution profiles in both male and female, pigmented and nonpigmented rats, suggesting minimal influence of sex or pigmentation in exposure of Lipid 5 and its [ 14 C]metabolites. The findings support the use of non-radioactive analyses in rat biodistribution models to assess the efficacy and safety of Lipid 5-containing LNPs in a preclinical setting.\n\nThe tissue distribution analysis using [ 14 C]Lipid 5-containing LNPs showed rapid distribution of Lipid 5 and its [ 14 C]metabolites throughout all tissues tested within the first hour, localizing primarily in the digestive and urinary systems (Figs. 2 and 3). Ten hours after intravenous LNP administration, the majority of the remaining radioactivity was eliminated from the peripheral tissues and was concentrated primarily in the digestive system (intestines, intestinal lumen, and other organs that facilitate metabolism and excretion of xenobiotic",

            "text": "Dr. Tam's remarks are summarized as follows:\n\nFor the PK and biodistribution in both mouse and non-human primates, approximately 60-80% of an intravenous administered mRNA-LNP dose arrives at the liver.On a percent per tissue weight, similar levels reach the spleen and adrenal glands as well.The majority of mRNA-LNP is cleared from the circulation in mouse in <1 hour, while approximately 1-2 hours in the non-human primate.With respect to PD, expression in mice is typically detectable by <1 hour, reaches a maximum by approximately 8 hours, and declines thereafter.\n\nLiver toxicity can be attributed to the dose of lipids and is associated with high mRNA-LNP doses.However, in our studies at the relatively low dose 0.5 mg/kg encapsulated mRNA, we would not expect any detectable liver toxicity.As dose increases around 3-5 mg/kg, effects on the liver are typically shown by dose dependent increases in serum transaminases (ALT, AST), increasing histopathology (hepatocyte vacuolation, single cell and focal necrosis, immune cell infiltration), and some impacts on liver associated clinical chemistry readouts (albumin, alkaline phosphatase) and immunology readouts secondary to liver insult.However, depending on dose, most effects are reversible and return to baseline.\n\nTo support the comments above, we conducted further experiments regarding the potential of LNP-induced hepatotoxicity.We injected 10ug of Luc mRNA-LNP into NSG-PiZ mice and analyzed 48 hours later.We measured ALT levels to determine if there is any hepatotoxicity from LNP administration.We also did TUNEL and cleaved caspase 3 stains to examine hepatocyte apoptosis.The results are included in Supplementary Fig. 1a and are summarized in the Results section with the following text: \"We confirmed that there was no hepatotoxicity related to mRNA-LNP injections, demonstrated by no change in liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzyme levels (Supplementary Fig. 1a) 48 hours following control firefly luciferase (Luc) mRNA-LNP treatment.",

            "text": "One limitation of the current LNP formulations is that they mainly accumulate in the liver.While it is acceptable for treating liver diseases and producing antigens or proteins that are missing in inherited metabolic and hematological disorders, effective LNP delivery to other tissues remains challenging but has shown good improvements in preclinical studies by modifying the formulation and coating LNPs with tissue-targeting macromolecules [188,[198][199][200][201]. Using lung tissue as an example, numerous efforts are spent on developing inhalable or nebulized LNPs to maximize therapeutic concentration in the lungs while limiting systemic exposure [202].To withstand the shear stress during nebulization, LNP formulation is being optimized by modifying lipid components and composition as well as incorporating additional elements such as DNA hydrogel [203][204][205].In addition to LNPs, other synthetic carriers include polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, dendrimers, and liposomes [188,197].Altogether, synthetic carriers are continuing to be optimized for composition as well as synthesis methods [206][207][208][209].Other RNA therapeutic delivery strategies include directly conjugating nucleic acids to tissue-targeting macromolecules, for example, GalNAc for FDA-approved liver targeting.Asialoglycoprotein receptor that GalNAc binds to is an ideal receptor for active targeting since it is specifically expressed in liver cells and can lead to rapid endocytosis of nucleic acids upon GalNAc binding [188].Ongoing research has reported that ligands, in the forms of sugars, proteins, aptamers, lipids, and more, can increase delivery to other organs, such as the kidney, lung, and heart [210][211][212].This review offers an overview of some of the common chemical modifications and delivery strategies, however, ongoing research and upcoming technologies extend far beyond the material covered here and will likely transform the clinical application of RNA therapeutics in coming years.",

            "text": "The classic composition of LNPs for RNA delivery contains a zwitterionic (neutral) helper phospholipid. In the last few years, many studies were focused on targeted delivery of LNPs to organs (mainly to the spleen and lungs) via changes in the charge of the nanoparticles, which is determined by the helper lipid. This strategy is called Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT), and the lipid responsible for the selective delivery of nanoparticles to organs is Lipids ensuring targeting of LNPs to desired organs. \n\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 05 Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 08 called a SORT-lipid (Cheng et al., 2020). Besides, the SORT strategy can be applied in two ways: complete replacement of a helper lipid or partial replacement (introduction of a fifth component). \n\nIn LoPresti et al. (2022), it was found that complete replacement of a zwitterionic helper lipid with an anionic one induces greater accumulation of LNPs in the spleen as compared to the liver, whereas replacement with a cationic helper lipid leads to LNP accumulation in lungs. It must be noted that the nature of the helper lipid in that report did not have as much influence on nanoparticle biodistribution as did the charge of the lipid's polar head. \n\nIn Cheng et al. (2020); LoPresti et al. ( 2022); Radmand et al. (2023), it has been convincingly proven that the use of a cationic helper lipid drives the accumulation of LNPs in lungs. Besides, in Radmand et al. (2023); Kauffman et al. (2018), it has been demonstrated that the greatest accumulation of LNPs occurs in endothelial cells, which are most accessible to the bloodstream. The effect of cationic lipid DOTAP's proportion in LNPs on the biodistribution of nanoparticles is intriguing, as described in Cheng et al. (2020).",

LNPs were directly labeled with 125 I prior to conjugation with anti-mouse CD4 or control IgG; therefore, measured radioactivity only showed distribution of particles without any detached targeting antibodies affecting the outcome. To measure tissue uptake, the amount of radioactivity in various tissues (percent of injected dose per gram of tissue: %ID/g) was calculated. \n\nAs expected, a substantial number of control IgG/mRNA-LNPs were still circulating in the blood (19.35%ID/g \u00b1 2.2%ID/g) 0.5 h post injection, representing a significant change in the biodistribution with a reduction in liver targeting of control IgG/ LNPs (Figure 3A). For anti-CD4/mRNA-LNPs, lower numbers of particles were circulating (10.84%ID/g \u00b1 0.42%ID/g). The majority of the anti-CD4/mRNA-LNP uptake occurred in the spleen (131.59%ID/g \u00b1 9.71%ID/g), representing a 3.5-fold increase in splenic uptake compared to the control IgG/mRNA-LNPs (37.6% ID/g \u00b1 8.67%ID/g). The localization ratio (LR), defined as the ratio of %ID/g of a given organ to that in the blood, was also calculated for both CD4-targeted and control IgG/mRNA-LNPs. The spleen being part of the reticuloendothelial system contributes to non-spe-cific splenic uptake that is observed with the untargeted mRNA-LNPs. Anti-CD4/mRNA-LNPs were localized in spleen at a 6-fold higher level than their control IgG counterparts (Figure 3B; Figure S2A).",

This phenomenon aligns with other studies noting the quick de-PEGylation of C14-PEG-containing LNPs in serum. [14,16,93] Furthermore, the low EF is indicative of low extravasation of all formulations into the adjacent tissue (i.e., muscle of the ZFL tail) (Figure S12f, Supporting Information).

            "text": "Although several mRNA therapeutics have been commercialized beyond clinical trials, achieving targeted mRNA delivery to specific organs remains elusive. Most delivery systems predominantly home to the liver upon intravenous administration due to the low hepatic blood flow rate as well as the highly vascular and leaky nature of liver endothelium [134]. Moreover, serum apolipoprotein E (ApoE) binds to the surface of circulating LNPs and induces receptor-mediated uptake by hepatocytes [135], which can cause immune-mediated hepatitis or liver toxicity due to undesired protein expression [136]. Two major strategies have been developed to achieve extrahepatic organ-targeted delivery. \n\nPassive targeting is based on modifying the physicochemical properties, such as the structure, molar composition, and charge of the components used in NPs. One of the best-known examples, named selective organ targeting (SORT), is characterized by the addition of a fifth SORT lipid to a conventional LNP to alter the internal charge and promote tissue-specific targeting [69]. Chen et al. synthesized 113-O12B, a lymph node-targeting lipid for cancer treatment, [136], and its relatively short tails ( 12 carbons),an ester bond linker, and methyl-free head amine increased mRNA expression in the lymph nodes. Compared to ALC-0315, a synthetic lipid in FDA-approved vaccines, 113-O12B showed higher expression in the lymph nodes and reduced mRNA expression in the liver after subcutaneous injection. Moreover, 113-O12B LNPs carrying full-length proteins or short peptide-encoding mRNAs exhibited a CD8 + T-cell response and excellent tumor inhibition in vivo [136]. In another study, LNP uptake switched from the liver to the lungs when the ester bond of the lipid tail linker was replaced with an amide bond [137]. They found that the tail structure altered the serum proteins adsorbed onto the particle surface, thereby affecting organ-selective delivery.",

            "text": "In vivo, LNPs quickly adsorb plasma proteins to form a protein corona, showing a particular affinity for soluble apolipoprotein E (ApoE). This interaction promotes the binding of LNPs to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr), which are highly expressed on the hepatocytes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for the internalization of LNPs by hepatocytes, partially explaining the preferential targeting of the liver by intravenously administered LNPs (Liu et al., 2023). The widespread clinical application of gene therapy has been impeded by the absence of delivery vectors capable of inducing protein expression in extrahepatic organs and tissues (LoPresti et al., 2022). Recent efforts have redirected nucleic acid delivery towards tissues beyond the liver (Kimura and Harashima, 2023). The type and proportion of helper lipids can modify the LNP structure, are essential for the stability and tissue targeting of LNPs. For instance, ester and amide bonds in lipid compounds enhance targeting to the liver and lungs, respectively. Samuel T. LoPresti et al. observed that the complete substitution of conventional helper lipids with anionic or cationic lipids led to significant and consistent transfer of lipid nanoparticles specifically to the spleen or lung, respectively (LoPresti et al., 2022). Beyond their role as delivery components, lipids may exert therapeutic effects synergistically with mRNA-encoded proteins. Multifunctional lipid materials encompass self-adjuvant lipids that enhance vaccine efficacy and paclitaxel-derived lipids enabling the combined treatment of chemotherapy and gene therapy for cancer (Hou et al., 2021;Johnson et al., 2022).",

            "text": "Delivery efficiency and biodistribution of mRNA vectors are affected by the surface composition of vectors. A prominent example of surface modification is the incorporation of PEG-chains. PEGylation of nanoparticles changes the trafficking of nanocarriers, extends half-life of delivery vectors in vivo by preventing interactions with serum proteins and phagocytes, and enhances the solubility and stability of delivery vectors by increasing hydrophilicity [264]. While PEG moiety plays a key role in biodistribution and half-life of nanocarriers, it hinders efficient uptake of nanoparticles by cells because of steric hindrance and inhibited interactions with the plasma membrane [218]. Therefore, PEG-chains are designed to detach in the serum to alleviate the steric hindrance and allow the nanocarriers to interact with ApoE and to subsequently enter the cells by ApoE-mediated endocytosis [218,265,266].\n\nAs with ApoE-mediated nanoparticle uptake, there is interest in biomolecular surface modification that may facilitate nanoparticlemediated gene transfer. A recent report by Sch\u00f6ttler et al. suggests that the \"stealth\" effect of PEG-coating may be due to the formation of a biomolecular corona via attractive interactions [267]. Although the formation of the protein corona is a well-known fact [268], studies considering and exploiting this aspect in the context of mRNA gene therapy have been limited [165]. This circumstance could explain why there has been a weak correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies of LNPs since biomolecular corona can cause particle agglomeration, premature release of LNP content, or lipid dissociation depending on the content of the corona [269,270].\n\nIncorporation of carbohydrates (such as mannose) on the nanocarriers can also influence the trafficking to the LNs and uptake to immune cells [271,272]. Tokatlian et al. demonstrated that trimannosylation of the HIV nanoparticle immunogens leads to strong GC reactions because of the facilitated accumulation in LNs with a complement-, mannose-binding lectin-mediated, immunogen glycandepen",

However, preventing a rapid clearance of circulating NPs is an acute issue for their application to full potential; therefore, it is imperative to understand the factors influencing their circulation time and biodistribution. These factors define the ability to overcome body's defense mechanisms and include tailorable physiochemical properties, such as composition, configuration, size, core properties, and surface functionalization (PEGylation, charged moieties, and targeting ligand functionalization) [157]. The interaction of the NPs with the biological environment is mainly influenced by opsonization, where opsonin proteins found in the blood serum interact and expose the NPs to macrophages in the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), triggering their removal from the biological system [120]. After opsonization, phagocytosis occurs, which involves the engulfing and destruction of foreign material from the bloodstream. PNPs that cannot be eliminated by phagocytes are sequestered in the MPS organs (liver and spleen). Here it is important to note that in the case of non-biodegradable PNPs, accumulation in these target organs may result in negative outcomes [158][159][160]. Overall, the process of in vivo trafficking in the blood stream compromise their designed therapeutic function. \n\nThere are no straight-forward strategies to completely avoid opsonization of NPs. However, significant research in this area over the last 35 years have identified patterns and method for",

            "text": "Using an adult zebrafish model for an in vivo study [138] Sangabathuni et al. compared three different shapes of PEGylated and mannose-AuNPs (sphere, rod, and star) after being intraperitoneally injected into the fish. Very low toxicity was detected, indicating the potential use of these nanoparticles for drug delivery and imaging studies. PEGylated-AuNPs had less sequestration than the mannose-AuNPs. Mannose-AuNPs were present in the digestive system, heart, and swim bladder, but not in the muscles, brain, or the eyes. After 24 h and 48 h, the shape-dependent accumulation of nanoparticles appeared. Initially, rods accumulated in a higher number and were cleared after 48 h, whereas, the star-shaped particles accumulated in a steady state and were sequestered for a longer time when compared to the spheres. Talamini et al. [128] analyzed the biodistribution profile of AuNPs with different shapes and sizes. Their biodistribution study revealed that the same amounts of spherical and star-like AuNPs accumulated in the liver, however in different locations. Additionally, only star-like AuNPs were found to accumulate in the lung. The accumulation of larger AuNPs (50 nm) was fast in the liver and spleen, and their increase with time was significant. On the other hand, smaller AuNPs (10 nm) showed a progressive increase of levels in tested animals. In a review by Schmid G et al. [139] ultra-small AuNPs (usAuNPs), with a size smaller that smaller than 2 nm, exhibited remarkably distinct biodistribution and enhanced circulation times compared to larger AuNP. In contrast to larger particles, which accumulate rather quickly in the liver, usAuNPs tend to distribute over all other organs as well. \n\nAs we have seen, the safety/toxicity of AuNPs is a multifactorial process. The concentration, size, shape, and surface charge/functionalization of the particle, as well as other factors, all play a major role in determining how toxic a specific conjugate is and where it is distributed throughout the body.",

The Siegwart group investigated PEGylated BODIPY dyes (PBDs), which structurally resemble the conventional PEG-lipids used in LNPs [157]. The authors proposed that PBDs could serve as desirable surface-stabilizing agents in LNPs, given that their pH-responsiveness may aid in the release of mRNA during endosome maturation. LNPs formulated with pHresponsive PBD-lipids could mediate efficient delivery of mRNA to cells, resulting in significantly higher cytoplasmic protein production (~ 5-to 35-fold increases) compared to PEG-DMG LNPs. These PBD-based LNPs also exhibit better mRNA delivery in vivo, with the highest protein expression observed in the liver of animals treated with LNPs that had a pKa ~ 6.3. In a different study, PEG2k5d (Table 5) LNPs could be used in a theranostic application to achieve robust mRNA expression in tumors while also enabling pH-responsive near-infrared tumor imaging [157]. Altering the functionality of PEG lipids in LNPs can influence tissue targeting specificity. Lee et al. achieved selective targeting of LSECs by incorporating mannose into the PEG lipid [120]. This design capitalizes on the high expression of the mannose receptor on human and murine LSECs. Compared to unmodified PEG-containing LNPs, the mannose-PEG-containing LNPs demonstrated enhanced transfection efficiency in LSECs. Moreover, inclusion of the mannose-PEG-lipid in siRNA-loaded LNPs led to more pronounced FVIII inhibition in LSECs, while galactose-PEG-lipid LNPs showed no significant effect [120].",

Another recent example confirmed the advantages of surface pegylation by utilizing thiolated gelatin nanoparticles (\u223c300 nm) to improve passive tumor targeting in an orthotopic human breast adenocarcinoma xenograft mouse model. 60 Despite the fact that these particles were twice the size of those in the previous study, the results showed a lower rate of uptake of the PEG-modified nanoparticles by the liver, indicative of the stealth properties of pegylated nanoparticles. In general, pegylated nanoparticles were found to have longer circulation time and higher levels of tumor accumulation than nonpegylated nanoparticles. In summary, much has been learned about PEG molecular mass and PEG density on nanoparticles which has led to reduced plasma protein adsorption, opsonization, and nonspecific uptake. In turn, this has resulted in increased nanoparticle circulation half-life and improved therapeutic efficacy of drugs delivered using pegylated nanocarriers. Effect of Size. On the basis of physiological parameters such as hepatic filtration, tissue extravasation, tissue diffusion, and kidney excretion, it is clear that, along with surface composition, particle size is a key factor in the biodistribution of long-circulating nanoparticles and achieving therapeutic efficacy (Figure 2). In one study, in vivo biodistribution results of polystyrene nanoparticles with consistent composi-tion and varying particle sizes of 50 and 500 nm showed higher levels of agglomeration of the larger nanoparticles in the liver. 56 It was suggested that the mechanism of hepatic uptake was mediated by surface absorption of proteins leading to opsonization. However, the effect of temperature (37\u00b0C vs 4\u00b0C) on hepatic elimination showed unexpectedly faster uptake of the 50 nm polystyrene nanoparticles at the lower temperature. Similarly, the size of the nanoparticle was shown to have a substantial effect on the protein absorption. Small (<100 nm), medium (100-200 nm), and large (>200 nm) pegylated PHDCA nanoparticles incubated with",

            "text": ". 97 As analyzed in vivo by Grenier et al. 98 on PEGylated liposomes and polymeric NPs, using anti-PEG antibodies can have a signi\ue103cant neutralizing effect. Comparing the corona formed in naive mice, the exact impact of these antibodies on PC was found. The changes were analyzed according to the Ig deposited on the surface of NPs from the serum of PLGA-PEG NPs (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid))-sensitized animals. This also alters the deposition of PC as apolipoproteins were found to be deposited on the surface of PLGA-PEG NPs compared to free methoxy-PEG chains and poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (PEG5k-PLGA). This might be relevant for nanomedicine given the implication of these proteins on the clearance of NPs in the bloodstream.\n\nA solution was proposed by Wang et al. 99 They suggested that adding a-glutamyl at the end of PEG should increase the circulating time of the polymeric micelles compared to bare PEG. Another challenge is the clearance of PEG-NPs as their accumulation in the spleen and the liver is signi\ue103cant. The work of Esposito et al. 100 shows a method to overcome this issue. The in vivo biodistribution in mice was regulated by mixing aminogroups and PEG on the surface of polycaprolactone NPs. The accumulation of NPs in lungs, spleen and liver was investigated, lungs being the targeted organ containing cancer cells (B16F10 cells). This NH 2 /PEG coating was compared with PEG-coated NPs and with a human albumin layer (NH 2 /PEG-NPs@HA).\n\nThe results indicate that NH 2 -NPs accumulate more in the lungs, than other NPs, as shown in Fig. 4. Additionally hemolysis calculated for all the NPs were less than 20% and showed no effect in in vivo studies.",

            "text": "One major feature, and limitation at times, with LNP delivery is their propensity for liver accumulation, where they are taken up by the RES [105]. Upon systematic administration [106], various serum electrolytes, proteins, and lipids will adsorb onto the LNP's surface and form the so-called \"biomolecular corona\" [107]. This corona can significantly influence the journey of systematically administered NPs from biodistribution and cellular uptake [108] to systematic circulations and nano-bio interactions [109]. The composition of ionizable lipid particles can have a considerable effect on the formed corona [110]. ApoE is one of the most implicated serum proteins that play a significant role in the clearance and endogenous LNPs targeting to hepatic cells [72]. The delivery of nucleic acids to the liver is partly attributed to the organ's well-perfused nature and its fenestrations as well [100]. It has been recognized that LNPs accumulate in different cells present within the liver [111][112][113]. Particle size, lipase sensitivity, and apparent pKa are some characteristics that govern the intrahepatic distribution of LNPs [114]. Chen et al. investigated the effect of particle size on influencing the tissue penetration and potential of LNP formulations of siRNA. They injected the LNPs intravenously into mice and found that regardless of the size, the majority of LNPs were found 24 h after injection in the liver. Less than 1% of the LNP formulations were found in the kidney, pancreas, lung, heart and femur. However, ~10% of the 80 nm size LNPs was found in the spleen. Since the particle size did not seem to be heavily involved in liver accumulation, they further investigated other parameters that can reduce the potency of small LNPs for silencing. In the end, they concluded that there was a clear hierarchy of LNP formulated siRNAs' capability for gene silencing (78 > 42 > 38 > 27 > 117 nm).",

This is probably because the interaction between LNPs and cells is reduced or the ability of LNP to adsorb ApoE is reduced, resulting in difficulty in uptake into hepatocytes. The length of fatty acid chains of the PEG lipid is responsible for the time of dissociation from the LNPs. Since PEGylated lipids with myristoyl (C14) chains are rapidly dissociated from the LNPs in the blood circulation, they do not interfere the process of FVII knockdown. We previously showed in mice that long circulation of siRNA-loaded pH-sensitive liposomes modified with PEG was observed only when DSPE-PEG but not distearoylglycerol (DSG)-PEG was used. Our results suggest that the electrostatic interaction between lipid molecules on the surface of the liposomes is a critical determinant for the in vivo effect of PEGylation [115].\n\nPEGylation of LNPs and chemical modification of siRNA reduce their immunogenicity, but it is difficult to completely eliminate the possibility of immune reactions, especially in susceptible individuals [116]. Recently, Chen et al. reported that incorporation of a small amount (4 mol% of total lipid content) of dexamethasone into LNPs can suppress the immune response [117]. Such an approach provides a positive perspective for future clinical trials and commercialization.",

            "text": "The size and composition of LNPs can help the endothelium-specific delivery; however, the detailed mechanism of cell-specific uptake is not well understood. Therefore, targeting specific cells in the liver requires an alternative strategy other than adjusting the physical size and composition of the LNPs. Ligand incorporation can be an ideal approach for selective delivery of RNA therapeutics to targeted liver cells. LSECs play an important role in scavenger system and express selective receptors such as stabilin receptors, mannose receptors, and Fc-\uf067RIIb2 (17). These receptors are involved in the removal of blood-borne antigens by active endocytosis. For example, phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides or hyaluronic acid-conjugated nanoparticles were successfully delivered to LSECs by targeting the scavenger receptors (24,25). \n\nIn this study, we report the engineered LNP formulations for the targeted delivery of RNA into different types of cells in the liver. Hepatocytes and LSECs are two major cells involved in various liver-related diseases. Hepatocytes are often associated with rare diseases in metabolism and endocrine dysfunctions, while LSECs are closely related with chronic liver diseases such as liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (19,26,27). It is important to selectively target the liver cells in different diseases, and its selectivity becomes more critical when introducing in vivo gene regulation and editing. Here, ionizable lipids were first synthesized and screened for their pK a (where K a is the acid dissociation constant) and endolytic activities. Selected lipid candidates were further evaluated for in vitro and in vivo gene expression after formulating LNPs with reporter mRNA [firefly luciferase (FLuc)]. Targeted delivery of LNPs with mRNA (Cre) in different types of cells in the liver was examined by controlling the particle size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs. In addition, engineered LNPs with mannose moieties were prepared for active targeting of LSECs. Optimized condition for the targeted delivery of mRNA to LSECs was lastly confirmed.",

While myocytes are thought to be the main target of intramuscularly injected LNPs, transgene expression in the liver has been observed (10). As such, this study examined the PK and biodistribution of LNPs containing mRNAs, which encode the firefly enzyme luciferase and are mostly intracellularly expressed and systemically non-immunogenic. Luciferase activities were measured from the perspective of pharmacodynamic evaluation. Additionally, ovalbumincoded mRNA (OVAL) was used in our study of the cellular distribution of mRNAs. LNPs of varying sizes were prepared under different mixing concentrations. Biodistribution and PK of the LNPs and the resulting luciferase activities were analyzed in a murine model.

            "text": "The lipid components of these benchmark LNPs for siRNA and mRNA delivery to the liver are: (i) DLin-MC3-DMA (an ionizable cationic lipid that contains amine functions with an acid dissociation constant of ca. 6.5, neutral at physiological pH and relatively non-toxic and non-immunogenic because of a low surface charge in the physiological environment), (ii) distearoyl phosphatidylcholine (DSPC), (iii) cholesterol, and (iv) PEG 2000 -C-DMG (PEGylated myristoyl glyceride, a lipid with C 14 acyl chains). The PEGylated lipids (PEG 2000 -C-DMG) are conjugated with short anchors to the NP lipid membrane, which allows for their redistribution from the NP surface in the surrounding environment and exposure of the ionizable lipids at the surface of the LNPs. After dissociation of the PEGylated lipids, the naked surface of the particles containing the ionizable DLin-KC2-DMA, which is neutral in a biological environment, interacts with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), enabling ApoE liver-mediated targeting. Transient PEGylation facilitates not only the localization and interaction with the target cell but also improves ion pair formation between the ionizable lipid (which will become cationic at pH 4) and the anionic endogenous endosomal phospholipids. This will enable the fast release of the payload into the cytoplasm and efficacious transfection [142][143][144][145][146][147][148]. Besides the efforts for liver and liver hepatocyte targeting, different research groups are working on the challenge of developing lipid nanoparticles for specific organ targeting after IV administration, including lipid nanoparticles for lung targeting or targeting relevant cell types, that is, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, immune cells of the lungs, B cells, and T cells.",

A larg improvement in the tumour to blood ratio was achived when nine or more bioins were conjugated to the antibody (four biotn resdues resulted in no Improvement in the tumour to blood ratio). The major problem noted was the high and persistent levels of radioactivity in the spleen, and a method to circumvent this splenic uptake was required. \n\nGalactose conjugated to antibodies has been shown to greatly increase their clarance from the circulation via the liver (Mattes, 1987; Sharma et al., 1990).

            "text": "The representative ligands of the MR include mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) [175]. MR has been considered a favorite target for hepatic drug delivery because of the presence of MR in LSECs. Kim et al. recently reported interesting data regarding cell-specific targeting in the liver [176]. They evaluated the cell uptake and transfection of mRNA-loaded mannose-decorated LNPs. The results suggested that the lipid-PEG content, particle size, and a ligand (mannose) could be critical in targeting efficiency. With 1.5% PEG-lipid but without mannose, the mRNA transfected cells were 80, 40, and 10% for hepatocytes, LSECs, and Kupffer cells, respectively. With an increase in the PEG-lipid content, the difference in transfected cell population became smaller between the hepatocytes and LSECs, while it got larger at lower PEG-lipid content. They said that the higher PEG content may have reduced the apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-mediated cellular uptake of the LNPs by interfering with the adsorption of ApoE. Notably, with the decoration of mannose on the particles, the transfected cell ratios dramatically changed for the hepatocytes and LSECs (hepatocytes: 70 to 15%, and LSECs: 15 to 70%). The results further implied that MR-mediated targeting could be a powerful tool for selective drug delivery to the LSECs [176]. \n\nLDLR is a cell surface endocytic receptor that mediates the uptake of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) rich in cholesterol. It recognizes apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100) and ApoE, which are embedded in LDL particles and chylomicron/very low-density lipoprotein remnants, respectively. LDLR is highly expressed in the liver and regulated by sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) [177].",

            "text": "In vitro assays demonstrated that PEGylation did not alter the rHER2 binding properties of either the targeted or non-targeted IONP (S6B Fig. ). Ultimately, however, PEGylation failed to extend blood circulation times, reduce liver sequestration, or exert any other notable effect on in vivo biodistribution of 100 nm IONP (Figs. 4, 5A and 5C). \n\nIn contrast to the large particles, systemic administration of smaller non-targeted 30 nm IONP-Mal yielded statistically significant concentrations of iron in the tumor (Fig. 4A), averaging 120 \u03bcg/g tissue (1.6% of the injected dose, Fig. 5B). Importantly, the addition of the Tfab targeting moiety significantly increased tumor accumulation to 230 \u03bcg/g (3% of the injected dose, Fig. 4A and 5B). Thus, in contrast to the larger 100 nm IONP, the in vitro performance advantage of antibody targeted 30 nm IONP translated to a 2-fold enhanced tumor accumulation in vivo. Compared to the 100 nm IONP, both the targeted and non-targeted 30 nm IONP exhibited significantly elevated blood concentrations at 24 hours (Fig. 4B), and both showed substantially lower concentrations in the liver (Fig. 4E). As seen with the 100 nm IONP, PEGylation of 30 nm IONP did not alter binding to rHER2 in vitro (S6A Fig. ), but neither did PEGylation influence in vivo biodistribution of the smaller IONP constructs (Fig. 4). Finally, it is worth noting that TEM analysis of tumor tissue sections revealed that, as was seen in vitro, 30 nm IONPs were internalized by BT-474 cells in the NSG-BT-474 mouse xenograft model (Fig. 6). \n\nImportantly, to minimize variability associated with the experimental procedures, the circulatory systems of mice were not perfused prior to tissue harvesting. As a result, all tissues contained some nominal amount of contaminating blood, and the blood vol% of each tissue contributed proportionally to the measured iron concentrations.",

In the same study, co-delivery of LNP-mRNA encoding ZFN targeting the albumin gene and a viral vector for templates of promotor-less human IDS or FIX resulted in integration of those templates at the albumin locus and generated therapeutically relevant levels of those proteins in murine models. In addition to continuous efforts in optimizing ionizable cationic lipids for enhanced genome editing in the liver, a recent study by Cheng et al. demonstrated that bioengineering LNP formulations with additional lipids, so-called selective organ targeting (SORT) molecules, can tune the LNP's efficiency and biodistribution. Adding 20 mol% of an ionizable cationic lipid such as DODAP significantly enhanced the genome editing in the liver, while addition of cationic or anionic SORT molecules enabled specific gene regulation in the lung or spleen [207,208].",

This tolerance effect was accompanied by the inhibition of the Th2 immune response, IgE antibody production, and degranulation of mast cells. Kim et al. [93] reported the development of engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of mRNA to hepatocytes and LSECs. They evaluated the effects of the particle size and PEG-lipid content of LNPs on the specific delivery of mRNA in the liver. Targeted mRNA delivery to the LSECs was further explored by introducing active ligands. Interestingly, Saunders et al. [94] utilized the dimensions of fenestrations in the liver and administered nanoprimers to mice as a pretreatment. This strategy aimed to reduce LNP uptake, consequently enhancing LNP accumulation in cell types other than Kupffer cells and LSECs. \n\nLiver-targeted LNPs show potential for the treatment of hereditary diseases such as hemophilia and acute intermittent porphyria [95]. Studies have identified antithrombin (AT) as a negative regulatory factor that can be targeted to treat hemophilia A and B [96,97]. Restoration of the coagulation system balance has been achieved using the RNA interference drug fitusiran to selectively inhibit AT [98]. However, it is not a long-acting medication and requires repeated injections [99]. To seek long-acting treatments for hemophilia, Han et al. [69] developed LNPs encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and mouse AT-targeted singleguide RNA (sgRNA) for AT gene editing and inhibition. They evaluated therapeutic efficacy in hemophilia A and B mouse models by assessing thrombin generation mediated by mAT gene editing.",

            "text": ", functionalized with targeting transferrin-PEG(5 kDa) was further modified at free reaction sites with PEG spacers of varying lengths, preventing the particles from protein corona formation. In order to enable receptor-recognition, PEG chains for shielding had to be shorter than the spacer between particle and targeting ligand [264]. Despite these difficulties, there are promising examples which have already demonstrated efficient, cell-or tissue-specific delivery of nucleic acids. Additionally, scientists have started to exploit the protein corona to tune particle distribution in vivo. It is commonly known that plasma proteins adsorption depends on particle surface characteristics. Hence, slight structural changes of the particle surface have shown to affect the protein corona composition. As a consequence of protein corona modification, transport to target cells by coating with certain plasma proteins which serve as endogenous ligands can be obtained in vivo. For example, DOTAP/DNA lipoplexes have shown to adsorb vitronectin which mediated receptor-dependent uptake by tumor cells expressing \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 integrins [265]. Patisiran is another prominent example for targeted transport to hepatocytes, mediated by coating with endogenous ApoE [104,137]. Manipulation of the interaction with receptors in vivo and therefore targeted delivery to other cell types could be achieved by an altered protein corona as a consequence of exchanging certain lipid components of the Patisiran formulation [146]. Additionally, Saunders et al. used \"nanoprimers\" administered shortly before injection of therapeutic LNPs that were taken up by cells of the hepatic RES (Fig. 6B). By inhibiting KCs and LSECs, LNPs could be preferentially delivered to hepatocytes, the desired target site [266].\n\nBased on these observations, methods which enable fast screening of broad libraries of nucleic acid carriers in vivo were developed [106][107][108][109]. By means of that, evaluation and characterization of predominant plasma proteins in the corona and tuning the biodistribution profile based on facile structural variations becomes feasible, pathing the way for improved targeted, cell-specific nucleic acid delivery in vivo (see Fig. 6C) [110,[142][143][144][145].  5 Interaction of i",

            "text": "Lack of control for this administration route is well known in rodents, 55 explaining the high variability we observed for the low doses. Rather than intact LNPs escaping from the subcutaneous depot into the blood, PEG lipids could also reach blood circulation by dissociating from the LNPs and associating to proteins or bionanoparticles. 57 Supporting this scenario is the fact that clinically approved LNPs use PEG lipids with short acyl chains, resulting in quick shedding from the LNP surface, allowing the particle to be efficiently internalized and escaping the endosome with the RNA cargo. 58,59 The observations for subcutaneous injections pinpoints a potential issue with subcutaneously administered LNPs, as anti-PEG immunity cannot be circumvented by increasing the dose, which should give precautions for researchers attempting to design therapeutics for such systems and administration routes. The different  S2. \n\ndose-dependent results obtained for intravenous and subcutaneous administrations underpins how lessons learned from one administration route cannot be assumed to apply to another administration route. \n\nFor intramuscular LNP injections, under some circumstances we did observe a significant increase in ALA generation compared with untreated mice. Typically, however, intramuscular injections led to ALA concentrations similar to or lower than intravenous or subcutaneous injections, and remained low irrespective of the dose. This type of injection may therefore be considered safer with respect to anti-LNP immunity, compared with the other tested administration routes. Despite this, it has been reported recently that subjects vaccinated with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Spikevax) have increased plasma concentrations of anti-PEG antibodies, 26,27 and that these antibodies can mediate increased neutrophil clearance of PEGylated therapeutics. 26 Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated mRNA transfection in the liver following intramuscular injections of FLuccarrying LNPs, 60 indicating that LNPs do escape from the muscle into the bloodstream. It is, however, unclear why the ALA generation for this administration route differs so remarkably from both the intravenous and subcutaneous routes.",

            "text": "LNPs, a fully synthetic option, are FDA-approved for delivery of siRNA and mRNA therapeutics. They provide transient expression with lower immunogenicity than viral vectors and can support repeated dosing (Kenjo et al., 2021). LNP-based ABE delivery showed promising results in disrupting PCSK9 in the liver with minimal off-target effects, resulting in durable LDL-cholesterol reduction in mice and primate models of hypercholesterolemia (Musunuru et al., 2021;Rothgangl et al., 2021). However, the progress of this therapy to clinical trials highlighted the need for LNP optimization to prevent potential LNP-associated side effects: Despite the high efficiency of the treatment in patients, potential LNPassociated liver abnormalities were observed (Philippidis, 2024). In this respect, base editing therapies can benefit from research on delivery methods for gene therapeutics, such as using sugars like N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNac) to enhance overall drug uptake and delivery. GalNacs are used in FDA-approved gene therapies like eplontersen, givosiran or lumasiran and showed good tolerance and liver targeting using either the asialoglycoprotein or the lowdensity lipoprotein receptors. GalNac-LNPs are currently undergoing clinical trials for ABE-based treatment of hypercholesterolemia (VERVE-102) (Vafai et al., 2024). An LNP-based base editing therapy is also in clinical trials for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (BEAM-302), highlighting this vehicle as the go-to choice for liveraffecting disorders. \n\nSince LNPs delivered intravenously naturally accumulate in the liver, their effectiveness in targeting non-liver tissues is limited. \n\nLNPs can be modified to modulate their tropism by changing their molar percentage, administration site, or adding target-specific ligands in the cargo such as mRNA encoding tissue-targeting proteins, antibodies or aptamers (Loughrey and Dahlman, 2022).",

            "text": "Since our overall goal is to develop an LNP platform for placental delivery, we examined the level of PlGF generated in the placenta and liver tissues. We compared PlGF levels in the liver because our prior data (Fig. 4A and B) demonstrated a high level of liver delivery. Dams treated with LNP A3 had the highest liver PlGF content with 54.4 ng of PlGF/mg of total protein (p < 0.05, Fig. 5D, Table S10.3). Alternatively, dams treated with LNP A10 had the highest PlGF content in the placenta with 6.81 ng PlGF per mg of total protein, which is 1.30-fold and 2.69-fold higher than LNPs A3 and A14, respectively (p < 0.001, Fig. 5E, Table S10.4). These results are consistent with in vitro results using PlGF mRNA, where LNP A10 had the highest PlGF secretion from BeWos (Fig. 5A). This data contradicts our studies with luciferase mRNA at the time points studied, which found that LNP A14 yielded highest delivery overall in vivo compared to the other LNP formulations. This indicates that, in addition to LNP design, the mRNA sequence also plays a critical role for in vivo biodistribution. \n\nA delivery ratio comparing PlGF levels in the liver to PlGF levels in the placenta demonstrated that LNP A10 exhibited the lowest liver: placenta (L:P) ratio that was 1.45-fold and 1.09-fold lower than LNPs A3 and A14, respectively (Fig. 5F). This result, combined with the higher serum PlGF content, indicates that LNP A10 is more efficient at delivering PlGF mRNA to the placenta compared to LNPs A3 and A14. Local placental delivery is important because PlGF levels in the placenta promote endothelial growth, vasculogenesis, and overall placental development [63].",

Typically, the optimal particle size range for LNPs is 20-200 nanometers, which provides ideal permeability and retention capabilities, allowing them to pass through stromal tissues. The components of LNPs also have certain drawbacks that require improvement. PEG is a significant potential source of peroxides and is generally unstable. Its degradation can lead to chain reactions and catalyze the degradation of ionizable lipids. Lipid degradation products can also react with mRNA, resulting in the formation of covalent mRNA-lipid adducts, which can affect mRNA bioactivity (34). Additionally, PEG-containing LNPs can bind to immunoglobulins on marginal zone B cells in the spleen, stimulating the production of anti-PEG IgM. Upon a second administration, the previously generated anti-PEG IgM binds to PEG on the LNPs, subsequently activating the complement system and enhancing the phagocytic activity of Kupffer cells, leading to increased clearance of the LNPs (121). Nogueira et al.

Because of the high affinity to ApoB substrates, both increased ECM binding and cellular uptake were obtained. Biodistribution studies revealed enhanced accumulation in the metastatic lungs of mice mammary carcinoma models (4T1 transplantable breast tumor, and orthotopic MDA-MB-231 mammary carcinoma). Despite the significantly higher retention of siOPN NPs in the tumor following intravenous treatment with targeted NPs, a similar therapeutic effect resulted following treatment with non-targeted siOPN NPs. It is suggested that further improvement of the targeting could be of value, and/or that a longer observation time is required.

Mannose-decorated polymers (p(Man)) were synthesized via reversible addition fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization from a mannose-decorated monomer, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)methacrylamide-a biologically inert co-monomer-and an azide-terminated RAFT agent. The model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) was first modified with an azide-and amine-reactive difunctional polyethylene glycol linker that, upon conjugation to the protein, forms a self-immolative linkage that is relatively stable in the extracellular space but degrades upon internalization, releasing the protein in its unmodified form 27 (Figure S2A). To measure the liver-targeting effects of p(Man) conjugation compared to the glycopolymers previously explored by our group, we performed a biodistribution study. Mice were treated with saline, dye-labeled OVA (OVA 647 ), or OVA 647 conjugated to p(Man), p(GalNAc), or a synthetic glycopolymer decorated with N-acetyl glucosamine (p(GlcNAc)) via intravenous (i.v.) injection. Organs were collected 3 h after injection and measured via an in vivo imaging system (IVIS). At the current dose, only the mice treated with p(Man)-OVA 647 experienced a significant increase in liver fluorescence signal compared to the OVA 647 control (Figures 1B and 1C). In addition, there was no off-target OVA 647 signal detected in other organs (Figure S2B).",

As passive targeting with lipid nanoparticle is a vast subject in itself, in this review we will discuss the types of lipids to use, as well a their proportions, in order to deliver gene therapies to specific organs, especiall extrahepatic ones. By manipulating the composition of lipids (Figure 2) and their proportion in LNPs, it is possible to change their size and surface characteristics. Indeed, the size and charge of LNPs seem to have significant effects on their biodistribution. Therefore, the delivery of the LNPs can be more specific to certain organs. Unfortunately, we still do not clearly understand the precise mechanism that explains the relationship between the biodistribution of LNPs and their size, charge, and the types of lipids used. It would therefore be interesting to conduct fundamental research on this mechanism.

            "text": "Nevertheless, we demonstrated that the fusion of EV and LNP enabled the loading of a sufficient number of barcodes to the hEVs allowing us to investigate the biodistribution of these particles in vivo. \n\nIn this study, we chose to employ the MC3 ionizable lipid in our LNP formulation due to its extensive documentation and well-established status, making it a reliable benchmark even in the face of newer lipids emerging for LNP composition. [20] However, it is important to note that MC3 LNPs tend to accumulate primarily in the liver, [21] posing a potential challenge for achieving effective extrahepatic delivery. Implementation of LNPs with lipids with \"neutral\" biodistribution may lead to a less biased assessment of delivery outcomes. Additionally, pegylation of EVs is known to affect their biodistribution, [22] which provides opportunities for engineering extrahepatic hEVs by incorporating LNPs with relevant PEG-lipids. These aspects might open up new avenues for future research to optimize and tailor hEV biodistribution for specific therapeutic applications. \n\nThe use of NGS techniques was also instrumental in achieving high sensitivity in the detection of hEVs in tissue samples. We detected DNA barcodes corresponding to particles injected at 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mg kg \u22121 or higher dose, which means that for ESC and HL-60 hEVs (10 \u22125 mg kg \u22121 ) were not retrieved. Going forward, one of the possible solutions to increase the sensitivity of the assay is to perform deeper sequencing, which can be easily implemented. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the barcodes are degraded or ended up in the tissues that were not examined, or that particles were phagocytized by immune cells in the blood and therefore were not able to reach target organs. Future studies are needed to examine these possibilities and further optimize the system. \n\nImportantly, our results are in general agreement with the existing literature. 10c,23] Interestingly, we discovered that hEVs originated from HAP1 cells displayed lung tropism. To eliminate the possibility that lung tropism was driven by aggregation, we performed immunohistochemistry analysis of the lung tissues.",

            "text": "And changing formulation to lyophilized form or adding cryoprotectant, such as mannitol and sucrose, are feasible methods to improve the stability of LNP formulations [61]. \n\nDespite some studies show that lipid materials may cause liver or lung injuries and the cytotoxicity of LNPs is related to the dosage of administration and the properties of lipids used, LNPs offer several advantages compared to viral vectors, including ease of production, relatively low immunogenicity, high RNA loading capacity, and flexible design options [61,62]. Most LNPs are prone to target liver and usually be utilized to treat liver diseases. For instance, Onpattro with DLin-MC3-DMA LNP as the vector, is administrated intravenously and enables the inhibition of hepatic production of transthyretin [63]. Yang et al. demonstrated that LNPs encapsulating HNF4A mRNA could attenuate liver fibrosis in preclinical mouse model [64]. Finn et al. used a degradable lipid to formulate LNPs to deliver Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA for gene editing in vivo. The results showed that the editing efficiency was highly considerable for transthyretin gene editing in the liver, reducing serum protein levels by over 97% with a single dose [65]. Recently, some studies have revealed the rules of LNP targeting different liver cell subsets. It is reported that altering surface charge on the LNP in Onpattro formulation from neutral to anionic, the vector was prone to deliver mRNA to the hepatic reticuloendothelial system [66]. Additionally, researchers discovered that altering the size, adjusting PEG-lipid content, or incorporating ligands in LNPs affected the distribution of loaded cargoes in hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), or increased the delivery efficiency in extrahepatic organ. For instance, LNPs with 100 nm diameter in size are the most effective for targeting LSECs, while LNPs with smaller diameters, such as 60 nm, showed tropism for hepatocytes [67].",

            "text": "To date, we have summarized the representative examples of biological ligands for targeting of NPs. Various ligands including proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, peptides, and small molecules are capable of increasing the specific binding of NPs containing drugs to disease cells to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy. Active targeting is a term that is often misunderstood as the ability of a ligand to control and direct the movement of conjugated NPs to target cells in vivo like guided missiles. However, dramatic changes in organ distribution of NPs do not occur in many cases, and the ligands present on NPs only help the binding of NPs on target cells. As observed in the studies of the Davis group, biodistribution and organ distribution of NPs in vivo changed only slightly following conjugation of biological ligands, especially on whole-body imaging [45]. Nevertheless, the ligands significantly enhanced the binding and uptake of NPs after reaching tumor tissue, which may improve therapeutic efficacies, not large-scale distribution [46]. \n\nPhysicochemical properties such as size, shape, rigidity, or surface properties are very important to determine the large-scale distribution of NPs. It is known that nanoparticles from 10 to 500 nm can move through vessels and accumulate in tumor tissue [9]. Strong cationic charges increase liver accumulation and antifouling PEG modification helps tumor targeting [47]. Recent studies showed that soft NPs are advantageous for accumulation and penetration in tumor tissue [48,49]. In addition, the study of Reuter et al. showed unexpected lower tumor accumulation of RGD peptide-modified NPs compared to control PEG-modified NPs [50]. It demonstrated the importance of physicochemical properties of NPs and the unintended result of ligand modification. Thus, it is important for researchers to consider these properties while at the same time not overestimating the effect of biological ligands [46]. \n\nAnother important consideration of NP ligands is their cost [51]. For example, antibodies are attractive ligands due to high specificity and diverse targets, but their production and conjugation cost a lot [52]. Development of more efficient methods for coupling of antibodies onto NPs may reduce the cost.",

Further shielding of lipids increases the circulation half-life and stability and prevents the aggregation of particles during storage [70]. However, when using PEG, the so-called \"PEG dilemma\" is also encountered, whereby the efficient transfection of cells may be compromised because PEG shielding may not only protect the LNPs from the recognition by the immune system but also from the interaction with target cells [71]. As a consequence, the reduced transfection efficiency by PEGylation can be improved using special PEG lipids, where the linkage between PEG and lipid opens after administration time-dependent or in a stimuli-responsive manner and exposes the LNP surface, making them available for cell transfection once again [72]. Nevertheless, since the most common administration of LNPs is an intravenous injection into the body, resulting in a rapid systemic distribution, LNPs suffer from a short half-life when administered parenterally. To ensure a controlled or long half-life, the assistance of further delivery systems, such as hydrogels, for example, is recommended [73]. This allows the use of additional routes of administration to protect the LNPs from rapid clearance and to release it in a controlled manner from a drug depot at the target tissue [74]. Concluding LNPs achieve a high loading capacity for siRNA as well as an efficient transfection of cells; however, in the case of prolonged or delayed release, they are limited.",

            "text": "By varying the lipid-to-mRNA weight ratio and subsequently adjusting the surface charges of LNP, Kranz et al. reported a pioneering study for surfacecharge dependent organ tropism of mRNA-LNP, opening the prelude to using LNP to deliver mRNA in vivo. [129]Based on the well-known LNP compositions, they precisely delivered mRNA-encoding mutant neo-antigens to DCs in vivo by optimally adjusting the net charges of LNPs.The transported mRNA can efficiently express the targeted antigens, thus inducing potent memory T-cell responses for cancer immunotherapy in B16-OVA lung metastasis models. [129]ased on the speculation that the internal or external charges of LNPs can modulate their tissue-targeting ability, Cheng et al. reported organ-specific delivery of mRNA by adding internal charge-tuning lipids (zwitterions lipids, ionizable lipids, cationic lipids, anionic lipids, etc.), termed selective organ targeting (SORT) molecules, into the LNPs to alter their in vivo distribution profile. [54]To be specific, LNPs with permanently cationic SORT lipids (DDAB, EPC) accumulate preferentially in the lung, LNPs with anionic SORT lipids (14PA, 18BMP) accumulate in the spleen, and LNPs with ionizable cationic SORT lipids with tertiary amino groups (DODAP, C12-200) accumulate to the liver.In mechanism, the SORT lipids recognize and bind to specific plasma proteins after desorption of PEGylated lipids on the surface of LNPs.Subsequently, LNPs target different organs through the interaction of adsorbed proteins with homologous receptors highly expressed in particular tissue. [130]As a result, the SORT-added LNPs achieved targeted mRNA delivery to the lung, spleen, and liver, respectively, and the efficient production of therapeutic-level proteins including human hemoglobin and mouse interleukin (Figure 4A).The percentage of SORT molecules in LNPs also extensively altered the tissue-targeting ability of mRNA (Figure 4B).",

            "text": "Furthermore, LNPs containing mRNA have been utilized into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy [15,16]. Previous study has shown that LNPs containing mRNA encoding fibroblast activation protein (FAP) antibodies can achieve in vivo CAR-T therapy to treat cardiac injury [17], which further emphasized the importance of LNP-mRNA therapy. \n\nLNPs are composed of four distinct lipid classes, including ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids [6. 8]. The particle size, charge, and lipid composition of nanoparticles have been shown to significantly influence their transfection capabilities and biodistribution following intravenous administration [12,18,19]. Physiochemical properties and PEGylated lipids are recognized as critical determinants in the functional performance of LNPs, influencing key processes such as transfection and systemic distribution [20]. LNPs with positive charges preferentially localize to the lungs following intravenous injection, whereas those with negative charges are more likely to accumulate in the spleen [21]. The primary mechanism underlying the distinct in vivo distribution patterns of charged LNPs is attributed to variations in the protein corona adsorbed onto the nanoparticles, which significantly affects cellular uptake [22]. Moreover, PEGylated lipids also play essential roles in LNPs for mRNA delivery [23,24]. PEGylated lipids contribute to the evasion of macrophage capture, thereby enhancing nanoparticle stability and prolonging their efficacy in vivo [25,26]. The presence of PEGylated lipids in LNPs extends their circulation time in vivo, which is particularly advantageous for intravenous injection [1,27]. Upon entering the circulation, PEGylated lipids facilitate the interaction of LNPs with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in serum, promoting subsequent binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which is primarily located in the liver [24,28]. However, studies on the impact of composition on the biofunctions of LNPs post-intramuscular administration are still lacking.",

Moreover, PEGylation can help NPs escape from the mononuclear phagocytic system with prolonged blood circulation. 12,15,16 For example, it was experimentally demonstrated that the half clearance time of PEG during blood circulation was prolonged from 30 minutes to 24 hours with the increase of molecular weight from a few thousands to a few hundred thousand by reducing and slowing down RES uptake. [15][16][17] As a result, it is deduced that the circulation time of PEG-modified IONPs can be regulated by utilizing PEG of different molecular weight, similar to that reported for gold NPs and hydrogel particle replication in nonwetting templates NPs. 4,18 Although both the size of the NPs and surface PEG modification can extend the blood circulation time, early extant literature has reported controversial findings regarding whether the core size or PEG surface should be the dominant factor to prolong the circulation time of IONPs. 13,[19][20][21] Since intravenously injected IONPs are delivered to different tissues and organs by blood circulation in vivo, blood circulation time can affect the dynamic distribution and metabolism in organs. Despite that PEG-modified IONPs have been extensively shown to act as an imaging or hyperthermia agent, the dynamic distribution and metabolism of PEGylated NPs in vital organs and tissues remain unclear. 3,10,12 It is thus essential to investigate the influence of core size and PEG coating on in vivo dynamic distribution and metabolism in vital organs, as well as the circulation time, for future potential clinical trials.\n\nIn the present study, highly monodisperse IONPs with different core sizes and PEG molecules were prepared, and their biodistribution and metabolism were investigated systematically in vivo. They were injected via the tail vein into Kunming mice at a dose of 5 mg Fe/kg per mouse according to the dose requirement of MRI imaging and biosafety in vivo. 22 The effects of core size and PEG-modified surface on blood circulation, biodistribution, and metabolism were elucidated.

            "text": "Suzuki et al. [67] revealed the influence of PEG shedding rate on the blood clearance of PEGylated LNPs.Specifically, faster PEG shedding led to attenuated production of anti-PEG immunoglobulin M (IgM), indicating that optimization of the kinetics of PEG shedding can improve the circulation and biodistribution of LNPs in the body.Moreover, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of siRNA-loaded LNPs could be influenced by the desorption rate of PEG.It is essential to understand the kinetics of PEG dissociation, as it directly impacts the duration and effectiveness of the therapeutic payload in target tissues.Mui et al. [35] first investigated the gene knockdown efficiency associated with PEG length and PEG content within LNPs.Their group found that hydrophobic interactions with cell membranes were proportional to the PEG alkyl length.Specifically, when fixing PEG content at 1.5%, C16 and C18 PEG need more time to shed from the surface of LNPs compared to C14 PEG.When increasing the PEG content from 1.5% to 3%, C14 PEG LNPs showed a gradual decline in gene knockdown, while C18 PEG completely lost its function when its content was higher than 1.5%.This phenomenon can be attributed to the longer alkyl length of C18 PEG, which increased the hydrophobicity of PEG lipid, and hindered the interaction with the cell membrane.As a result, longer alkyl length required more energy for LNPs to adopt a monolayer transition state, leading to shedding of PEG from the LNP surface.Thus, C18 PEG has a longer circulation time after administration but still holds its ability with 1.5% threshold concentration.\n\nIn another aspect, PEG shedding is due to the pH change during the endocytosis process.A study by Hashiba and colleagues [68] demonstrated the benefits of pH-labile PEGylation in siRNA-loaded LNPs for hepatocyte targeting and gene silencing activity.The study highlighted that pH-responsive PEG lipids facilitated improved active targeting and gene silencing efficacy in hepatocytes.",

A major advantage of LNPs for gene delivery applications is their modularity. Organic excipients can be interchanged to produce LNPs with distinct physiochemical properties, passively shifting biodistribution toward specific organs or cell types (23,24). Alternatively, targetspecific ligands can be included during LNP formulation to actively influence tissue or cellular tropism (25). In this study, we sought to maximize LNP transfection of HSCs in vivo. \n\nWe previously identified a potent ionizable lipid (i.e., C14-490) for transfection of the mouse fetal liver following in utero IV injec tion at gestational day (E) 16 (26). Here, we studied the biodistri bution of C14-490 LNPs at E13.5, a timepoint when hematopoiesis is known to occur predominantly in the liver (21). R26 mT/mG fetuses (dual-fluorescent floxed reporter mouse model) were injected at E13.5 with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or C14-490 LNPs encapsulating Cre mRNA at a dose of 1 mg/kg mRNA. After 60 h, fetal tissues were harvested, demonstrating transfection of the whole fetus (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A) and fetal liver (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). While 50% of fetal hepatocytes were transfected (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C), only 2% of fetal HSCs (Lin-/Sca1+/cKit+) were trans fected, demonstrating that passive biodistribution alone was insuffi cient for robust LNP delivery to HSCs at this developmental stage. \n\nDesign and Characterization of Anti-CD45 LNPs.",

            "text": "LNPs have many benefits, such as large RNA cargo capacity, high encapsulation efficiency, redosability (safety), scalability, and ease of modification and functionalization. 94,105 However, traditional LNPs tend to go to the liver for the following reasons: 1) the liver harbors a substantially larger blood volume and exhibits a slower flow rate compared to other organs, plus the fact that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells have fenestrations that allow LNPs to pass through; 2) ApoE-mediated delivery is via interactions with the LDLR, which is highly expressed by hepatocytes; and 3) the liver contains a high density of scavenger receptors, particularly on hepatic reticuloendothelial system cells, which can recognize and bind to the LNPs leading to preferential uptake by the liver. 106 To broaden the application of LNP/RNA technologies, it is important to detarget LNPs from the liver and retarget them to the desired cells and tissues. 107,108 uning the administration route is a straightforward and effective approach to improve the biodistribution and therapeutic results of LNPs. 95,109 For systemic administration, it is important to design and develop targeted LNPs that could circumvent the biological barriers during blood circulation and extravasation to target nonliver cells. 95,110 or the detargeting of LNPs from the liver, an overarching goal is to ensure LNPs evade detection by the immune system and their binding to APOE and/or other serum proteins that mediate nonspecific cellular uptake during blood circulation. Strategies for generating NPs with such attributes include cell membrane coating, protein modifications, and a nonfouling biomaterials layer. 111 However, these strategies need to be optimized so that there is no deleterious effect on cellular uptake and endosomal escape. 112,113 Another approach for the detargeting of LNPs was recently introduced by Saunders et al. where the authors developed a \"nanoprimer\" that serves as a pretreatment approach to transiently occupy liver cells, thereby facilitating the delivery of LNPs to other tissues. 114",

No acute toxicity was observed in the hours post injection and animals gained weight over the course of the experiment, suggesting the pooled ASO-LNPs were well tolerated (Figure 7B). To examine ASO-LNP activity and biodistribution, we quantified mKate2 and EGFP fluorescence in ex vivo tissues both 6 and 20 days post dosing (Figures 7C-7E). mKate2 fluorescence was largely maintained in the brain, spleen, kidneys, heart, liver, and lungs (Figure 7D). In contrast, EGFP intensity increased specifically in the liver of mice injected with pooled ASO-LNPs (Figure 7E). Liver EGFP signal was consistent between 6 and 20 days post dosing, revealing that ASO-LNP-mediated splice-switching is robust over time. However, despite administering a pooled mixture of ASO-LNPs that were previously reported to differentially distribute to the liver or lungs, 16,[21][22][23] EGFP signal in the lungs did not change over the course of the experiment. There was also no significant increase in EGFP intensity in the brain, spleen, kidneys, or heart. Given the robust induction of EGFP in the liver, we next aimed to isolate EGFP+ cells (Figure 7F). We prepared liver single-cell suspensions from WT animals and ki littermates injected with saline or pooled ASO-LNP 6 days after dosing. FACS analysis revealed a clear enhancement in EGFP+ liver cells when isolated from ASO-LNP-treated mKate2.ssEGFP.HBB ki animals.",

            "text": "(3) the synthetic nature of NPs allows for functionalization to enable targeting through attachment of ligands (Florinas et al. 2016;chen et al. 2018). A variety of ligands ranging from small molecules to antibody fragments can be used to influence NP biodistribution and tissue retention. in the case of cancer, targeting agents can be used to facilitate tumour accumulation, retention, internalisation, and ultimately delivery of therapeutic drugs. \n\nOver the past decade, numerous NP delivery technologies have been reported (Puri et al. 2023), and more than 30 NP formulations have been approved by the FDA, many of which are targeted for cancer therapy (cabral et al. 2018;Anselmo and Mitragotri 2019). even though tumours are permeable to NPs because of their extravasation, enhanced permeability and retention (ePR) characteristics, untargeted NPs have a propensity for accumulating in the liver or spleen in a size dependent manner (cabral et al. 2011). Hence, current NP technologies are focused on modifying NP surfaces (e.g. with PeG) or using conjugation chemistry to functionalise the NP with tumour targeting agents (peptides (e.g. arginylglycyclaspartic acid (RGD), scFvs, Fabs, or even small molecule ligands such as folate, GalNAc and manose-6-phosphate) that direct them towards specific cell surface proteins (Friedman et al. 2013). \n\nOne recent example comes from the laboratories of Ulrich weisner and Michelle Bradbury (formerly at Memorial Sloan Kettering cancer center) at cornell University who developed a targeted NP technology utilising the cornell prime dots, or c'dots. these consist of an inorganic silica core coordinated around a fluorescent dye and functionalised with a polyethylene glycol (PeG) coat (Phillips et al. 2014). PeG components can be modified to contain a radionuclide chelator and a targeting moiety (e.g. RGB peptide). initially developed as diagnostic agent, the small size of the NP (6 nm diameter) allowed for effective tumour penetration and retention as well as rapid clearance through kidney excretion.",

            "text": "In our study, to ensure both uniformity and a consistent diameter of approximately 200 nm, the synthesized mixture was subjected to physical extrusion through a 200 nm polycarbonate film. This process ensures the LNPs maintain their desired size while achieving a homogeneous distribution. Our study also showed that LNP-GMC significantly enhances the retention and sustained release of GMC in hepatic tissue. With controlled particle sizes around 200 nm, LNP-GMC demonstrated high stability and encapsulation efficiency, qualities that are crucial for liver-specific drug delivery. Nonetheless, it has been documented that interactions with serum proteins can sometimes alter nanoparticle stability, which could impact biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy [44]. \n\nIn our experiments, we validated the stability of LNPs by co-incubating them with 10% FBS and observed the distribution of LNPs in vivo using DiR labeling. The LNPs were not significantly affected by serum proteins, which may related to the addition of DSPE-mPEG2000 during LNP synthesis. However, considering the differences between humans and animals, we hope to obtain more convincing evidence, ideally in human studies, in the future. \n\nMechanistically, our study primarily focused on evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of LNP-GMC and validating 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT imaging rather than probing the molecular mechanisms underlying GMC's effects on ALI. Although we observed increased FAP expression in the liver tissue of ALI mice, indicating its potential utility as a biomarker, a more in-depth investigation into FAP's role in the pathogenesis of ALI is warranted. Understanding how FAP expression and fibroblast activation contribute to liver injury and repair could provide further insights into the therapeutic potential of targeting FAP in ALI. Additional studies could explore the molecular pathways involving FAP in liver damage and evaluate how 68 Ga-FAPI PET imaging could reflect these pathways in real time. \n\nFurthermore, 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT allowed us to effectively distinguish between healthy and damaged liver tissue, validating its potential for ALI diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring.",

            "text": "Currently, nucleic acids-based therapies are of immense clinical value due to their vast potential. LNPs have made significant progress in the field of targeted delivery of nucleic acids, but they also face certain challenges. Therefore, reasonable design of LNPs in the future will help overcome these difficulties. \n\n(1) Although LNP therapies generally exhibit lower immunogenicity compared to conventional chemotherapy and protein therapy, they are not immune to potential toxicity arising from the accumulation of LNPs in the liver and spleen. The presence of PEG chains in LNPs is beneficial in reducing toxic side effects and increasing their circulation time in vivo. Keeping a reasonable balance between the proportion of PEGylated lipids and PEG chain length in LNPs may mitigate their toxicity. (2) Traditional LNPs possess inherent passive targeting properties that predominantly guide them to hepatocytes, leading to accumulation in the liver and spleen. There is an urgent need to develop LNPs tailored to deliver nucleic acids to other organs. Screening and optimizing selective ILs or implementing chemical and biological modifications will enhance the targeting of specific organs. In addition, by exploring structure-activity relationships and chemical synthesis, more ILs for extrahepatic and extrasplenic targeting could be obtained. (3) The relationship between LNPs components and the types of protein corona formed on their surface needs to be further studied. Constructing and screening a predictable library is essential, validating the structure-activity relationship of lipids, and proteomics is anticipated to provide insights for the design of organ-selective LNPs. (4) The organ-selective delivery of LNPs faces the common challenge of being time-consuming and labor-intensive. The emerging use of DNA or mRNA barcodes holds the potential to enable high-throughput in vivo screening to address this issue. (5) The current pharmacokinetic studies of LNPs are not without flaws, and the use of LNPs may induce immune responses, which can limit their long-term usage. Continuous drug safety assessment and optimization are necessary to ensure the reliability and safety of LNPs in clinical applications.",

            "text": "Cell-specific targeting of mRNA therapies and vaccines may be crucial to developing safe and effective drug products. Conjugation of a cell targeting moiety (ligand or antibody) to the cholesterol or PEGylated lipid (Figure 3B) is commonly used to generate cell specific LNPs (75). For example, mannose has been used to target liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in the liver after intravenous injection (92) as well as antigen presenting cells in saRNA vaccines after intramuscular injection (93). Antibody conjugation has recently shown promise for CD4+ T cell targeting (94) albeit with leaky liver expression. The same group targeted lung and inflamed brain endothelial cells using anti-PECAM-1 (95) and -VCAM (96) antibodies conjugated to iLNPs and cLNPs respectively. However, conjugating antibodies to LNPs is inefficient and antibody-dependent optimization is required. Kedmi and colleagues overcame this issue by designing a modular platform, referred to as anchored secondary scFv enabling targeting or ASSET, which can incorporate any antibody onto the surface of an LNP (97). This method uses a plasmid encoding an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a peptide motif resulting in lipidation by E. coli, a single chain variable fragment (scFv) targeting rat IgG, and a His-tag for purification. After purification, cholesterol is added to produce micelles, and lipidation allows incorporation of the scFv into the micelles, which are mixed with pre-formulated mRNA-LNPs to form ASSET-LNPs (Figure 3C). Potentially any rat IgG antibody can be added to these ASSET-LNPs to create targeted LNPs. ASSET also uses significantly less antibodies as each antibody is positioned in the correct orientation as a result of the scFv, unlike conventional conjugation methods (Figure 3C compared to 3B).",

Electron microscopic observations revealed that most of the LNPs were located in the space of Disse even at early time point (3 min after administration). Both rapid blood clearance and the accumulation of the bare LNPs which were absent in ApoE-deficient mice, were restored by the co-administration of recombinant ApoE protein. On the other hand, the GalNAc/Shielded LNPs gradually accumulated in liver tissue and were endocytosed by hepatocytes in wild-type mice. The ApoE is known to bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as well as LDLR through the arginine-rich receptor-binding domain [48]. Treatment with heparin, which can compete with HSPGs, even 10 min after administration of the bare LNPs significantly suppressed both the accumulation and gene silencing of the LNPs in hepatocytes, suggesting that HSPGs in the liver are involved in the rapid accumulation of the bare LNPs. The relatively slow uptake of the bare or GalNAc/Shielded LNPs could be explained by assuming that receptors are mainly distributed on microvilli but not on coated pits and therefore a certain time would be required for the particles to migrate to coated pits for internalization [49,50].",

            "text": "The present study illustrates the differences in biodistribution patterns following i.v. and oral routes of administration of two doses of PEG-PLA NPs. The higher concentration of radiolabeled NPs in blood compared to RES organs indicated the enhanced systemic circulation of these NPs following i.v. injection. Moreover, a dose-dependent distribution of NPs to the blood and RES organs following i.v. injection was observed. Furthermore, an increased distribution of NPs with time following oral administration to the organs such as the heart, lung, liver, spleen, muscle, bone and brain suggests their absorption after oral route. Such differences in the biodistribution profile following i.v. and oral administration routes could be due to the variations in the distributed concentrations of NPs to these organs. PEG-PLA NPs may thus consider as safe nanocarriers due to their hemocompatibility and potential to balance the oxidative stress. Even though PEG-PLA NPs induced DNA damage in the tested organs, no notable cell death was observed, indicating their compatibility at the tissue level. It is expected that an understanding of the biological interactions of the NPs, the consequences, and the associated mechanisms in vivo may considerably help in anticipating the safety of NPs. These investigations are expected to provide key information on the influence of administration route and dose on biodistribution profile and also on the resulting consequences of the nanoparticles' interaction with the biological components. A thorough understanding of the relationship between physicochemistry and pharmacokinetic profile of the carrier in preclinical models is essential to predict the efficacy and safety of the carrier, which would allow design of safer nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery systems suitable for human application.",

Other biological barriers include protection by nucleases, evading the MPS, and renal glomerular filtration for effective systemic distribution. The surface engineering of LNPs offers stability and target efficiency, which in turn improves the efficacy of loaded therapeutics, i.e., siRNA. The apparent pKa value of IL in the range of ~6.4 with a neutral surface charge is desirable to avoid sequestration by MPS. Thorough investigations of the ideal (or desirable) LNP structure(s), however, remain to be fully explored in different indications. It is possible that certain LNP configurations might be more advantageous for certain indications (e.g., provide better delivery at the disease site), but this issue remains to be investigated in a systematic way. The urgency to push for clinical use sometimes de-emphasizes such explorations, limiting clinically useful LNP formulations to a handful of formulations. With an increasing understanding of the contributing properties of the LNP components, further modification of the components could be employed in order to achieve a stable formulation and effective targeting of desired organs. The better implementation of organ-specific targeting is bound to enhance the efficacy of treatment as well as reduce any possible side effects by restricting the biodistribution of the drug and carrier to the site of action. This endeavour will be especially important to expand the utility of siRNAs beyond liver diseases (all siRNA approved to date are for liver indications). \n\nFor further improvements in bioavailability, increased circulation in the blood, delivery to the target organs, the surface modification of LNPs such as PEGylation, and incorporation of surface ligands on the LNPs have been found to be effective strategies. Engineered approaches to 'shed' the incorporated targeting/functional moieties will be beneficial to enhance the therapeutic effects once the carrier reaches its destination. Improved delivery in the order of 2-to 3-folds will not possibly be beneficial for improved clinical outcomes, but a more significant improvement such as 10-fold increased delivery might be required for significant clinical effects.",

            "text": "Direct transfection of APC in secondary lymphoid organs can be achieved by intravenous application [164], given that the nano-vaccine predominantly addresses APC by passive [72] or active [165] targeting. This would result in the induction of antigen-specific T effector cells, which can home to each tissue, and thereby also reach metastases irrespective of their location. However, as delineated in preclinical rodent biodistribution studies, systemically administered NPs of larger size (\u2265 200 nm diameter) may accumulate e.g., in lung as reported e.g., for mesoporous silica particles [166] or chitosan NP [167]. Moreover, most NP formulations tested so far accumulate in the liver [168] as a consequence of the general clearance function of the liver [169], conferred by Kupffer cells (KC) as the major liver-resident macrophage population [170] and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) [171]. KC and LSEC are equipped with a number of danger receptors, including different C-type lectin receptors (CLR) as e.g., the mannose receptor CD206 [172,173], and scavenger receptors that broadly bind negatively charged ligands [174,175]. Besides, KC [176] and LSEC [177] express high affinity Fc receptors, and KC also express complement receptors [178]. Therefore, it is conceivable that NPs, depending on the characteristics of the protein corona formed in vivo [179], also including complement activation as shown for lectin-coated NP [180], may be internalized preferentially by KC and LSEC. The formation of a pronounced protein corona may be attenuated by PEGylation, shown to reduce unwanted binding to KC [181] and LSEC [182], and by conjugation with CD47, which serves as a 'do not-eat-me' ignal for macrophages as evaluated for liposomes [183]. Furthermore, targeting moieties on NP may engage according receptors on either non-parenchymal liver cell population. An example is mannose, which",

Applying this pharmacokinetic knowledge, several tissue-targeted LNPs have been developed by adding cationic or anionic lipids to the general composition of LNPs to tune their charge [47]. Specifically, based on the LNPs composed of dendrimer-type ionizable lipid, DOPE, cholesterol, and DMG-PEG (15/15/30/3 molar ratio), (which was optimized for efficient mRNA delivery to the liver), the mixing ratio of an additional lipid, 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP), (which is cationic under physiological conditions because of its quaternary amine), gradually increased. Although the original LNPs predominantly expressed the luciferase reporter in the liver, its expression in the spleen became higher by adding 10e15% DOTAP; more than 90% of the expression was in the lung by adding 30e40% or more DOTAP. On the other hand, the addition of 10e30% of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (18 PA), which is a negatively charged lipid, resulted in an almost complete change to the spleen-targeting LNPs. The particle sizes of lung-targeting LNPs (50% DOTAP) and spleen-targeting LNPs (30% 18 PA) were 113.1 nm (PdI, 0.22) and 142.1 nm (PdI, 0.13), respectively. There were minimal changes from those of their original LNPs, 93.2 nm (PdI, 0.14). The zeta-potentials of the original, lung-targeting, spleen",

This study systematically evaluated the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) density on LNP physicochemical properties, innate immune response stimulation, and in vivo efficacy. Increased PEG density not only shielded LNP surface charge but also reduced hemolytic activity, suggesting the formation of a steric barrier. In addition, increasing the PEG density reduced LNP immunostimulatory potential as reflected in cytokine induction both in vivo and in vitro. Higher PEG density also hindered in vivo efficacy, presumably due to reduced association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein which serves as an endogenous targeting ligand to hepatocytes. This effect could be overcome by incorporating an exogenous targeting ligand into the highly shielded LNPs, thereby circumventing the requirement for ApoE association. Therefore, these studies provide useful information for the rational design of LNP-based siRNA delivery systems with an optimal safety and efficacy profile."

In general, liposomes with a brushlike coverage (5\u221215% PEG) and with a molecular mass of 2000 Da have a more stable steric barrier and prolonged circulation time. (Majzoub et al., 2015)212 Studies by Schmidt et al. demonstrated that pegylation (10%) of CAF09 (DDA/monomycoloyl glycerol (MMG) analogue 1/poly(I:C)) with DSPE-PEG2000 resulted in drainage of a larger dose fraction to the lymph nodes, followed by an induction of stronger CD8+ T cell responses in the blood upon subcutaneous immunization, as compared to nonpegylated CAF09. (Schmidt et al., 2019) Goswami et al. observed that reduction of PEG from 2% to 0.3% resulted in increased mannose exposure on the LNPs but also resulted in a lower SAM encapsulation efficiency. (Goswami et al., 2019) Thus, although pegylation increases liposome circulation time, the immunological profile of these particles needs to be balanced relative to the ligand/PEG content in order to achieve particle stability, high encapsulation, biodistribution, and presentation of attached ligands.\n\nAdditionally, the free end of PEG can be harnessed for chemical ligations with different targeting ligands, such as peptides, proteins, antibodies, carbohydrates, and polysaccharides. 214",

In the current studies, we evaluated mannosylated LNP (MLNP), which were obtained by incorporation of a stable Mannose-cholesterol amine conjugate, for the delivery of an influenza (hemagglutinin) encoded SAM vaccine in mice, by both intramuscular and intradermal routes of administration. SAM MLNP exhibited in vitro enhanced uptake in comparison to unglycosylated LNP from bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, and in vivo more rapid onset of the antibody response, independent of the route. The increased binding antibody levels also translated into higher functional hemagglutinin inhibition titers, particularly following intradermal administration. T cell assay on splenocytes from immunized mice also showed an increase in antigen specific CD8+ T responses, following intradermal administration of MLNP SAM vaccines. Induction of enhanced antigen specific CD4+ T cells, correlating with higher IgG2a antibody responses, was also observed. Hence, the present work illustrates the benefit of mannosylation of LNPs to achieve a faster immune response with SAM vaccines and these observations could contribute to the development of novel skin delivery systems for SAM vaccines.",

Using cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM), optical light scattering, and fluorescence microscopy, we investigated the structure and phase behavior of PEGylated (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) cationic liposome-DNA nanoparticles (CL-DNA NPs) as a function of DNA length, topology (linear and circular), and \u03c1(chg) (the molar charge ratio of cationic lipid to anionic DNA). Although all NPs studied exhibited lamellar internal nanostructure, NPs formed with short (\u223c2 kbps), linear, polydisperse DNA were defect-rich and contained smaller domains. Unexpectedly, we found distinctly different equilibrium structures away from the isoelectric point. At \u03c1(chg) > 1, in the excess cationic lipid regime, threadlike micelles rich in PEG-lipid were found to coexist with NPs, cationic liposomes, and spherical micelles. At high concentrations these PEGylated threadlike micelles formed a well-ordered, patterned morphology with highly uniform intermicellar spacing. At \u03c1(chg) < 1, in the excess DNA regime and with no added salt, individual NPs were tethered together via long, linear DNA (48 kbps \u03bb-phage DNA) into a biopolymer-mediated floc. Our results provide insight into what equilibrium nanostructures can form when oppositely charged macromolecules self-assemble in aqueous media. Self-assembled, well-ordered threadlike micelles and tethered nanoparticles may have a broad range of applications in bionanotechnology, including nanoscale lithograpy and the development of lipid-based multifunctional nanoparticle networks."

In general, liposomes with a brushlike coverage (5\u221215% PEG) and with a molecular mass of 2000 Da have a more stable steric barrier and prolonged circulation time. (Majzoub et al., 2015)212 Studies by Schmidt et al. demonstrated that pegylation (10%) of CAF09 (DDA/monomycoloyl glycerol (MMG) analogue 1/poly(I:C)) with DSPE-PEG2000 resulted in drainage of a larger dose fraction to the lymph nodes, followed by an induction of stronger CD8+ T cell responses in the blood upon subcutaneous immunization, as compared to nonpegylated CAF09. (Schmidt et al., 2019) Goswami et al. observed that reduction of PEG from 2% to 0.3% resulted in increased mannose exposure on the LNPs but also resulted in a lower SAM encapsulation efficiency. (Goswami et al., 2019) Thus, although pegylation increases liposome circulation time, the immunological profile of these particles needs to be balanced relative to the ligand/PEG content in order to achieve particle stability, high encapsulation, biodistribution, and presentation of attached ligands.\n\nAdditionally, the free end of PEG can be harnessed for chemical ligations with different targeting ligands, such as peptides, proteins, antibodies, carbohydrates, and polysaccharides. 214"

We developed a liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform to deliver mRNA-encoded peanut allergen epitopes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which function as robust tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells that induce FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects. These results demonstrate an exciting application of mRNA/LNP for treatment of food allergen anaphylaxis, with the promise to be widely applicable to the allergy field."

Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies are used to detect possible pathways of metastasis spread. We present a unique non-invasive diagnostic alternative to biopsy along with an intraoperative imaging tool for surgery proven on an in vivo animal tumor model. Our approach is based on mannan-based copolymers synergistically targeting: (1) SLNs and macrophage-infiltrated solid tumor areas via the high-affinity DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin) receptors and (2) tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The polymer conjugates were modified with the imaging probes for visualization with magnetic resonance (MR) and fluorescence imaging, respectively, and with poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (POX) to lower unwanted accumulation in internal organs and to slow down the biodegradation rate. We demonstrated that these polymer conjugates were successfully accumulated in tumors, SLNs and other lymph nodes. Modification with POX resulted in lower accumulation not only in internal organs, but also in lymph nodes and tumors. Importantly, we have shown that mannan-based polymer carriers are non-toxic and, when applied to an in vivo murine cancer model, and offer promising potential as the versatile imaging agents."

Understanding how these modifications affect LNP distribution between liver and extrahepatic tissues is crucial for developing effective therapeutics. (LLM Memory)",
                "text": "\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as one of the most promising delivery systems for nucleic acid therapeutics, as demonstrated by their successful application in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. LNPs typically consist of ionizable lipids, helper lipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified lipids. Their biodistribution in the body is a critical factor that determines therapeutic efficacy and potential off-target effects. Unmodified LNPs predominantly accumulate in the liver due to interactions with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and subsequent uptake by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. This natural hepatotropism is beneficial for liver-targeted therapies but limits applications requiring delivery to extrahepatic tissues. To overcome this limitation, LNP surface properties can be modified through two primary strategies: (1) PEGylation, which involves coating the surface with PEG to create a hydrophilic shield that reduces protein adsorption and hepatic uptake; and (2) incorporation of targeting ligands such as mannose, antibodies, or peptides that direct LNPs to specific cell types or tissues. The interplay between these modification strategies significantly influences LNP biodistribution patterns between hepatic and extrahepatic tissues, offering opportunities to tailor delivery systems for specific therapeutic applications. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                "text": "\nPEGylation percentage plays a crucial role in determining how lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) distribute within the body, particularly between hepatic and extrahepatic tissues. Studies have shown that increasing the PEG-lipid content in LNPs significantly reduces their association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a key mediator of hepatocyte uptake. Kumar et al. demonstrated that LNPs with 5% PEG-lipid exhibited lower binding affinity with ApoE compared to those with 1.5% PEG-lipid, resulting in decreased activity in hepatocytes <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"12507733\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This reduced ApoE association effectively blocks the natural hepatotropism of LNPs, creating an opportunity for targeting extrahepatic tissues.\n\nThe optimal PEG-lipid percentage appears to be formulation-dependent, with approximately 1.5% considered ideal for many applications <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. At this concentration, LNPs maintain stability while preserving sufficient interaction with endogenous targeting factors. However, increasing PEG density to 3-5% creates a stronger steric barrier that not only shields LNP surface charge but also reduces their immunostimulatory potential and hemolytic activity <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"12507733\" paperTitle=\"(Kumar et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This higher degree of PEGylation enhances circulation time and reduces toxicity by preventing protein adsorption and subsequent clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPEGylation also impacts the immune response to LNP-delivered therapeutics. LNPs with brush-like PEG coverage (5-15%) using PEG with a molecular weight of 2000 Da exhibit more stable steric barriers and prolonged circulation times <Paper corpusId=\"235962403\" paperTitle=\"(Chatzikleanthous et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"6110022\" paperTitle=\"(Majzoub et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This study systematically evaluated the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) density on LNP physicochemical properties, innate immune response stimulation, and in vivo efficacy. Increased PEG density not only shielded LNP surface charge but also reduced hemolytic activity, suggesting the formation of a steric barrier. In addition, increasing the PEG density reduced LNP immunostimulatory potential as reflected in cytokine induction both in vivo and in vitro. Higher PEG density also hindered in vivo efficacy, presumably due to reduced association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein which serves as an endogenous targeting ligand to hepatocytes. This effect could be overcome by incorporating an exogenous targeting ligand into the highly shielded LNPs, thereby circumventing the requirement for ApoE association. Therefore, these studies provide useful information for the rational design of LNP-based siRNA delivery systems with an optimal safety and efficacy profile."

In general, liposomes with a brushlike coverage (5\u221215% PEG) and with a molecular mass of 2000 Da have a more stable steric barrier and prolonged circulation time. (Majzoub et al., 2015)212 Studies by Schmidt et al. demonstrated that pegylation (10%) of CAF09 (DDA/monomycoloyl glycerol (MMG) analogue 1/poly(I:C)) with DSPE-PEG2000 resulted in drainage of a larger dose fraction to the lymph nodes, followed by an induction of stronger CD8+ T cell responses in the blood upon subcutaneous immunization, as compared to nonpegylated CAF09. (Schmidt et al., 2019) Goswami et al. observed that reduction of PEG from 2% to 0.3% resulted in increased mannose exposure on the LNPs but also resulted in a lower SAM encapsulation efficiency. (Goswami et al., 2019) Thus, although pegylation increases liposome circulation time, the immunological profile of these particles needs to be balanced relative to the ligand/PEG content in order to achieve particle stability, high encapsulation, biodistribution, and presentation of attached ligands.\n\nAdditionally, the free end of PEG can be harnessed for chemical ligations with different targeting ligands, such as peptides, proteins, antibodies, carbohydrates, and polysaccharides. 214"

                            "The self-assembly of oppositely charged biomacromolecules has been extensively studied due to its pertinence in the design of functional nanomaterials. Using cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM), optical light scattering, and fluorescence microscopy, we investigated the structure and phase behavior of PEGylated (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) cationic liposome-DNA nanoparticles (CL-DNA NPs) as a function of DNA length, topology (linear and circular), and \u03c1(chg) (the molar charge ratio of cationic lipid to anionic DNA). Although all NPs studied exhibited lamellar internal nanostructure, NPs formed with short (\u223c2 kbps), linear, polydisperse DNA were defect-rich and contained smaller domains. Unexpectedly, we found distinctly different equilibrium structures away from the isoelectric point. At \u03c1(chg) > 1, in the excess cationic lipid regime, threadlike micelles rich in PEG-lipid were found to coexist with NPs, cationic liposomes, and spherical micelles. At high concentrations these PEGylated threadlike micelles formed a well-ordered, patterned morphology with highly uniform intermicellar spacing. At \u03c1(chg) < 1, in the excess DNA regime and with no added salt, individual NPs were tethered together via long, linear DNA (48 kbps \u03bb-phage DNA) into a biopolymer-mediated floc. Our results provide insight into what equilibrium nanostructures can form when oppositely charged macromolecules self-assemble in aqueous media. Self-assembled, well-ordered threadlike micelles and tethered nanoparticles may have a broad range of applications in bionanotechnology, including nanoscale lithograpy and the development of lipid-based multifunctional nanoparticle networks."

(9 sources)",
                "text": "\nMannose represents one of the most effective targeting ligands for redirecting LNPs away from hepatocytes and toward specific cell populations, particularly liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). This targeting capability stems from the specific expression of mannose receptors (CD206) on both human and mouse LSECs <Paper corpusId=\"275303089\" paperTitle=\"(He et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"19416780\" paperTitle=\"(Sorensen et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. The incorporation of mannose into LNP formulations creates a dual-targeting mechanism that can overcome the natural hepatotropism of standard LNPs.\n\nThe efficacy of mannose targeting is significantly influenced by the PEGylation percentage of LNPs. Kim et al. demonstrated that in LNPs with lower PEG content (1.5%), mannose-mediated uptake competes with ApoE-mediated pathways in the presence of serum, resulting in less selective targeting. However, increasing the PEG-lipid content to 3% reduces ApoE adsorption, allowing cellular uptake to occur primarily through mannose-CD206 interactions <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This higher PEG content effectively blocks the natural hepatotropism while enabling the mannose ligands to direct LNPs to their target cells.\n\nThe physical characteristics of mannose-modified LNPs also contribute to their selective biodistribution. Notably, mannose-incorporated LNPs typically exhibit larger physical dimensions than the liver sinusoidal fenestrae, which further reduces their uptake by hepatocytes and enhances selective delivery to LSECs <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This combination of size exclusion and targeted receptor binding makes mannose-modified LNPs particularly effective for LSEC-specific delivery.\n\nRecent applications have demonstrated the practical value of mannose-modified LNPs. Xu et al. used mannose-modified DSPE-PEG 2000 as the PEGylated lipid component in LNPs to achieve LSEC-specific delivery of GFP mRNA at the cellular level. This approach also enhanced in vivo lung accumulation of mannose-LNPs at a dose of 1 mg/kg <Paper corpusId=\"269341432\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"257231907\" paperTitle=\"(Xu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Beyond hepatic targeting, mannose-modified LNPs have shown potential for targeting macrophages and dendritic cells in sentinel lymph nodes, offering applications in cancer diagnostics and immunotherapy <Paper corpusId=\"273037430\" paperTitle=\"(Kulkarni et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"230665361\" paperTitle=\"(Jiratova et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHowever, optimizing mannose exposure on LNPs requires careful consideration of the PEG content. Goswami et al. observed that reducing PEG from 2% to 0.3% increased mannose exposure on LNPs but compromised self-amplifying mRNA (SAM) encapsulation efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"235962403\" paperTitle=\"(Chatzikleanthous et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"195872280\" paperTitle=\"(Goswami et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The cell acts as a scavenger cell responsible for removal of potential dangerous macromolecules from blood, and is increasingly acknowledged as an important player in liver immunity. This review provides an update of the major functions of the LSEC, including its role in plasma ultrafiltration and regulation of the hepatic microcirculation, scavenger functions, immune functions, and role in liver aging, as well as issues that are either undercommunicated or confusingly dealt with in the literature. These include metabolic functions, including energy metabolic interplay between the LSEC and the hepatocyte, and adequate ways of identifying and distinguishing the cells."

                            "While oral desensitization is capable of alleviating peanut allergen anaphylaxis, long-term immune tolerance is the sought-after goal. We developed a liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform to deliver mRNA-encoded peanut allergen epitopes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which function as robust tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells that induce FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects. These results demonstrate an exciting application of mRNA/LNP for treatment of food allergen anaphylaxis, with the promise to be widely applicable to the allergy field."

Studies (McCright et al., 2022) have reported that PEGylation enhances the hydrophilicity of the molecule, leading to enhanced uptake in the lymphatic system after subcutaneous injection. Another approach involves the addition of targeting ligands like mannose (Jir\u00e1tov\u00e1 et al., 2020) that allow for selective binding to mannose receptors (CD206) highly expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells in SLNs."

                            "Early detection of metastasis is crucial for successful cancer treatment. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies are used to detect possible pathways of metastasis spread. We present a unique non-invasive diagnostic alternative to biopsy along with an intraoperative imaging tool for surgery proven on an in vivo animal tumor model. Our approach is based on mannan-based copolymers synergistically targeting: (1) SLNs and macrophage-infiltrated solid tumor areas via the high-affinity DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin) receptors and (2) tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The polymer conjugates were modified with the imaging probes for visualization with magnetic resonance (MR) and fluorescence imaging, respectively, and with poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (POX) to lower unwanted accumulation in internal organs and to slow down the biodegradation rate. We demonstrated that these polymer conjugates were successfully accumulated in tumors, SLNs and other lymph nodes. Modification with POX resulted in lower accumulation not only in internal organs, but also in lymph nodes and tumors. Importantly, we have shown that mannan-based polymer carriers are non-toxic and, when applied to an in vivo murine cancer model, and offer promising potential as the versatile imaging agents."

In general, liposomes with a brushlike coverage (5\u221215% PEG) and with a molecular mass of 2000 Da have a more stable steric barrier and prolonged circulation time. (Majzoub et al., 2015)212 Studies by Schmidt et al. demonstrated that pegylation (10%) of CAF09 (DDA/monomycoloyl glycerol (MMG) analogue 1/poly(I:C)) with DSPE-PEG2000 resulted in drainage of a larger dose fraction to the lymph nodes, followed by an induction of stronger CD8+ T cell responses in the blood upon subcutaneous immunization, as compared to nonpegylated CAF09. (Schmidt et al., 2019) Goswami et al. observed that reduction of PEG from 2% to 0.3% resulted in increased mannose exposure on the LNPs but also resulted in a lower SAM encapsulation efficiency. (Goswami et al., 2019) Thus, although pegylation increases liposome circulation time, the immunological profile of these particles needs to be balanced relative to the ligand/PEG content in order to achieve particle stability, high encapsulation, biodistribution, and presentation of attached ligands.\n\nAdditionally, the free end of PEG can be harnessed for chemical ligations with different targeting ligands, such as peptides, proteins, antibodies, carbohydrates, and polysaccharides. 214"

                            "Mannosylation of Lipid Nanoparticles (LNP) can potentially enhance uptake by Antigen Presenting Cells, which are highly abundant in dermal tissues, to improve the potency of Self Amplifying mRNA (SAM) vaccines in comparison to the established unmodified LNP delivery system. In the current studies, we evaluated mannosylated LNP (MLNP), which were obtained by incorporation of a stable Mannose-cholesterol amine conjugate, for the delivery of an influenza (hemagglutinin) encoded SAM vaccine in mice, by both intramuscular and intradermal routes of administration. SAM MLNP exhibited in vitro enhanced uptake in comparison to unglycosylated LNP from bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, and in vivo more rapid onset of the antibody response, independent of the route. The increased binding antibody levels also translated into higher functional hemagglutinin inhibition titers, particularly following intradermal administration. T cell assay on splenocytes from immunized mice also showed an increase in antigen specific CD8+ T responses, following intradermal administration of MLNP SAM vaccines. Induction of enhanced antigen specific CD4+ T cells, correlating with higher IgG2a antibody responses, was also observed. Hence, the present work illustrates the benefit of mannosylation of LNPs to achieve a faster immune response with SAM vaccines and these observations could contribute to the development of novel skin delivery systems for SAM vaccines."

                "text": "\nWhile mannose targeting represents an effective strategy for redirecting LNPs to specific cell populations, antibodies and peptides offer additional targeting capabilities with potentially greater specificity. These targeting ligands can be conjugated to the LNP surface, often through attachment to the free end of PEG molecules, creating multifunctional delivery systems with enhanced cell-specific targeting.\n\nAntibody-modified LNPs (immunoliposomes) can achieve highly selective targeting through binding to specific cell surface receptors. The conjugation of antibodies to LNPs is typically accomplished through the free end of PEG molecules, which provides a flexible spacer that enhances antibody exposure while maintaining the \"stealth\" properties of PEGylated particles <Paper corpusId=\"235962403\" paperTitle=\"(Chatzikleanthous et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This strategic placement of antibodies allows them to extend beyond the PEG layer, improving receptor accessibility and binding efficiency.\n\nPeptide ligands offer several advantages over antibodies, including smaller size, lower production costs, and reduced immunogenicity. Various peptide sequences can be attached to LNPs to target specific cell types or tissues. Like antibodies, peptides are often conjugated to the terminal end of PEG chains, creating a flexible presentation that enhances target recognition while preserving the beneficial properties of PEGylation <Paper corpusId=\"235962403\" paperTitle=\"(Chatzikleanthous et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe balance between targeting ligand exposure and PEGylation percentage is crucial for optimizing LNP performance. While higher PEG content (5-15% with PEG 2000 Da) creates a more stable steric barrier and extends circulation time, excessive PEGylation can shield targeting ligands and reduce their interaction with target receptors <Paper corpusId=\"235962403\" paperTitle=\"(Chatzikleanthous et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similar to the challenges observed with mannose targeting, the incorporation of antibodies or peptides must be carefully balanced with PEG content to achieve optimal stability, encapsulation efficiency, and ligand presentation.\n\nBeyond hepatic targeting, antibody and peptide-modified LNPs have shown potential for targeting the lymphatic system. PEGylation enhances LNP hydrophilicity, leading to improved uptake in the lymphatic system after subcutaneous injection <Paper corpusId=\"273037430\" paperTitle=\"(Kulkarni et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This lymphatic targeting capability has promising applications in cancer diagnostics and immunotherapy, particularly for detecting sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) that represent potential pathways of metastatic spread <Paper corpusId=\"273037430\" paperTitle=\"(Kulkarni et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"230665361\" paperTitle=\"(Jiratova et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nNovel applications of targeting ligands include the development of multifunctional imaging agents. For example, polymer conjugates modified with imaging probes for magnetic resonance and fluorescence imaging have been combined with targeting moieties for visualization of tumors and lymph nodes <Paper corpusId=\"273037430\" paperTitle=\"(Kulkarni et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"230665361\" paperTitle=\"(Jiratova et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.

In general, liposomes with a brushlike coverage (5\u221215% PEG) and with a molecular mass of 2000 Da have a more stable steric barrier and prolonged circulation time. (Majzoub et al., 2015)212 Studies by Schmidt et al. demonstrated that pegylation (10%) of CAF09 (DDA/monomycoloyl glycerol (MMG) analogue 1/poly(I:C)) with DSPE-PEG2000 resulted in drainage of a larger dose fraction to the lymph nodes, followed by an induction of stronger CD8+ T cell responses in the blood upon subcutaneous immunization, as compared to nonpegylated CAF09. (Schmidt et al., 2019) Goswami et al. observed that reduction of PEG from 2% to 0.3% resulted in increased mannose exposure on the LNPs but also resulted in a lower SAM encapsulation efficiency. (Goswami et al., 2019) Thus, although pegylation increases liposome circulation time, the immunological profile of these particles needs to be balanced relative to the ligand/PEG content in order to achieve particle stability, high encapsulation, biodistribution, and presentation of attached ligands.\n\nAdditionally, the free end of PEG can be harnessed for chemical ligations with different targeting ligands, such as peptides, proteins, antibodies, carbohydrates, and polysaccharides. 214"

                            "Early detection of metastasis is crucial for successful cancer treatment. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies are used to detect possible pathways of metastasis spread. We present a unique non-invasive diagnostic alternative to biopsy along with an intraoperative imaging tool for surgery proven on an in vivo animal tumor model. Our approach is based on mannan-based copolymers synergistically targeting: (1) SLNs and macrophage-infiltrated solid tumor areas via the high-affinity DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin) receptors and (2) tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The polymer conjugates were modified with the imaging probes for visualization with magnetic resonance (MR) and fluorescence imaging, respectively, and with poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (POX) to lower unwanted accumulation in internal organs and to slow down the biodegradation rate. We demonstrated that these polymer conjugates were successfully accumulated in tumors, SLNs and other lymph nodes. Modification with POX resulted in lower accumulation not only in internal organs, but also in lymph nodes and tumors. Importantly, we have shown that mannan-based polymer carriers are non-toxic and, when applied to an in vivo murine cancer model, and offer promising potential as the versatile imaging agents."

However, this higher degree of PEGylation can sometimes shield targeting ligands, reducing their accessibility to target receptors. This challenge is particularly evident in mannose-modified LNPs, where Goswami et al. observed that reducing PEG content from 2% to 0.3% increased mannose exposure but compromised self-amplifying mRNA encapsulation efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"235962403\" paperTitle=\"(Chatzikleanthous et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"195872280\" paperTitle=\"(Goswami et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor mannose-targeting specifically, Kim et al. found that incorporating mannose into LNPs with 3% PEG-lipid content provided optimal LSEC-selective delivery by reducing ApoE adsorption while maintaining sufficient mannose-CD206 interaction <Paper corpusId=\"275303089\" paperTitle=\"(He et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"232059366\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

This study systematically evaluated the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) density on LNP physicochemical properties, innate immune response stimulation, and in vivo efficacy. Increased PEG density not only shielded LNP surface charge but also reduced hemolytic activity, suggesting the formation of a steric barrier. In addition, increasing the PEG density reduced LNP immunostimulatory potential as reflected in cytokine induction both in vivo and in vitro. Higher PEG density also hindered in vivo efficacy, presumably due to reduced association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein which serves as an endogenous targeting ligand to hepatocytes. This effect could be overcome by incorporating an exogenous targeting ligand into the highly shielded LNPs, thereby circumventing the requirement for ApoE association. Therefore, these studies provide useful information for the rational design of LNP-based siRNA delivery systems with an optimal safety and efficacy profile."

                            "Thus, the presence of PEG in the formulation not only controlled the biodistribution of the vaccine but also switched the type of T cell responses from a Th1 toward a Th2.\n\nOn the other hand, it has been demonstrated that an optimized degree of pegylation may reduce depot formation, enhance passive drainage to the lymph nodes, and eventually improve immunogenicity. In general, liposomes with a brushlike coverage (5\u221215% PEG) and with a molecular mass of 2000 Da have a more stable steric barrier and prolonged circulation time. (Majzoub et al., 2015)212 Studies by Schmidt et al. demonstrated that pegylation (10%) of CAF09 (DDA/monomycoloyl glycerol (MMG) analogue 1/poly(I:C)) with DSPE-PEG2000 resulted in drainage of a larger dose fraction to the lymph nodes, followed by an induction of stronger CD8+ T cell responses in the blood upon subcutaneous immunization, as compared to nonpegylated CAF09. (Schmidt et al., 2019) Goswami et al. observed that reduction of PEG from 2% to 0.3% resulted in increased mannose exposure on the LNPs but also resulted in a lower SAM encapsulation efficiency. (Goswami et al., 2019) Thus, although pegylation increases liposome circulation time, the immunological profile of these particles needs to be balanced relative to the ligand/PEG content in order to achieve particle stability, high encapsulation, biodistribution, and presentation of attached ligands.\n\nAdditionally, the free end of PEG can be harnessed for chemical ligations with different targeting ligands, such as peptides, proteins, antibodies, carbohydrates, and polysaccharides. 214"

                            "The self-assembly of oppositely charged biomacromolecules has been extensively studied due to its pertinence in the design of functional nanomaterials. Using cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM), optical light scattering, and fluorescence microscopy, we investigated the structure and phase behavior of PEGylated (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) cationic liposome-DNA nanoparticles (CL-DNA NPs) as a function of DNA length, topology (linear and circular), and \u03c1(chg) (the molar charge ratio of cationic lipid to anionic DNA). Although all NPs studied exhibited lamellar internal nanostructure, NPs formed with short (\u223c2 kbps), linear, polydisperse DNA were defect-rich and contained smaller domains. Unexpectedly, we found distinctly different equilibrium structures away from the isoelectric point. At \u03c1(chg) > 1, in the excess cationic lipid regime, threadlike micelles rich in PEG-lipid were found to coexist with NPs, cationic liposomes, and spherical micelles. At high concentrations these PEGylated threadlike micelles formed a well-ordered, patterned morphology with highly uniform intermicellar spacing. At \u03c1(chg) < 1, in the excess DNA regime and with no added salt, individual NPs were tethered together via long, linear DNA (48 kbps \u03bb-phage DNA) into a biopolymer-mediated floc. Our results provide insight into what equilibrium nanostructures can form when oppositely charged macromolecules self-assemble in aqueous media. Self-assembled, well-ordered threadlike micelles and tethered nanoparticles may have a broad range of applications in bionanotechnology, including nanoscale lithograpy and the development of lipid-based multifunctional nanoparticle networks."

                            "Mannosylation of Lipid Nanoparticles (LNP) can potentially enhance uptake by Antigen Presenting Cells, which are highly abundant in dermal tissues, to improve the potency of Self Amplifying mRNA (SAM) vaccines in comparison to the established unmodified LNP delivery system. In the current studies, we evaluated mannosylated LNP (MLNP), which were obtained by incorporation of a stable Mannose-cholesterol amine conjugate, for the delivery of an influenza (hemagglutinin) encoded SAM vaccine in mice, by both intramuscular and intradermal routes of administration. SAM MLNP exhibited in vitro enhanced uptake in comparison to unglycosylated LNP from bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, and in vivo more rapid onset of the antibody response, independent of the route. The increased binding antibody levels also translated into higher functional hemagglutinin inhibition titers, particularly following intradermal administration. T cell assay on splenocytes from immunized mice also showed an increase in antigen specific CD8+ T responses, following intradermal administration of MLNP SAM vaccines. Induction of enhanced antigen specific CD4+ T cells, correlating with higher IgG2a antibody responses, was also observed. Hence, the present work illustrates the benefit of mannosylation of LNPs to achieve a faster immune response with SAM vaccines and these observations could contribute to the development of novel skin delivery systems for SAM vaccines."

                            "The liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) forms the fenestrated wall of the hepatic sinusoid and functions as a control post regulating and surveying the trafficking of molecules and cells between the liver parenchyma and the blood. The cell acts as a scavenger cell responsible for removal of potential dangerous macromolecules from blood, and is increasingly acknowledged as an important player in liver immunity. This review provides an update of the major functions of the LSEC, including its role in plasma ultrafiltration and regulation of the hepatic microcirculation, scavenger functions, immune functions, and role in liver aging, as well as issues that are either undercommunicated or confusingly dealt with in the literature. These include metabolic functions, including energy metabolic interplay between the LSEC and the hepatocyte, and adequate ways of identifying and distinguishing the cells."
