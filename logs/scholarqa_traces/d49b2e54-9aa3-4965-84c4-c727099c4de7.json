However, the fluorescence signal of traditional SPs tends to quench in their aggregate states owing to the strong \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, which can lead to the radiative decay pathway shutting down. To address this issue, aggregation-induced emission effect has been used as a rational tactic to boost the aggregate-state fluorescence of NIR-II emitters. In this contribution, we developed a precise molecular engineering tactic based on the block copolymerizations that integrate planar and twisted segments into one conjugated polymer backbone, providing great flexibility in tuning the photophysical properties and photothermal conversion capacity of SPs. Two monomers featured with twisted and planar architectures, respectively, were tactfully incorporated via a ternary copolymerization approach to produce a series of new SPs. The optimal copolymer (SP2) synchronously shows desirable absorption ability and good NIR-II quantum yield on the premise of maintaining typical aggregation-induced emission characteristics, resulting in balanced NIR-II fluorescence brightness and photothermal property. Water-dispersible nanoparticles fabricated from the optimal SP2 show efficient photothermal therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo investigation reveals the distinguished NIR-II fluorescence imaging performance of SP2 nanoparticles and their photothermal ablation toward tumor with prominent tumor accumulation ability and excellent biocompatibility.",

                    "text": "To meet the requirements of NIR-II FLI-assisted PTT theranostics, it is extremely urgent to develop exogenous contrast agents with efficient NIR-II emission and high photothermal effectiveness through precise molecular engineering. Up to now, a variety of inorganic nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes [18], quantum dots [19][20], and rare earth nanoparticles (NPs) [21,22], have been widely explored for NIR-II FLI, but their long-term biotoxicity and minimal biodegradability could substantially hinder their practical applications [23]. Small molecular organic dyes exhibit superiority in the aspect of biocompatibility, but they often suffer from unsatisfactory photostability and limited accumulation capacity [24,25]. In contrast, semiconducting polymers (SPs) with large \u03c0-conjugated architectures exhibit reliable biosafety, strong light-harvesting ability, durable photostability, excellent photothermal conversion ability, etc. They have manifested great talents in the fields of FLI, photoacoustic imaging, and imaging-guided PTT and/or photodynamic therapy [26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33]. In addition, the flexible tunability of the polymer skeleton endows SPs with versatile optical properties and therapeutic properties [34]. Hence, SPs are promising candidates for NIR-II FLI-guided PTT toward antitumor applications. However, currently, the structural diversity SP-based NIR-II emitters are still very limited, and their fluorescence performance still needs to be further improved. \n\nOn the basis of the Jablonski diagram, photoexcited dyes can dissipate their excited state energy through the radiative pathway to benefit fluorescence or through nonradiative channel to boost photothermal conversion. However, the radiative and nonradiative attenuations are 2 competitive channels involved in FLI and photothermal properties. Extending the conjugation length of organic probes or using highly conjugated SPs has been used as a feasible tactic to realize the red shift of emission wavelength.",

Xie, Deliang Wang, T. Han, Dong Wang, Benqin Tang\n## Abstract\nSemiconducting polymers (SPs) have shown great feasibility as candidates for near-infrared-II (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging-navigated photothermal therapy due to their strong light-harvesting ability and flexible tunability. However, the fluorescence signal of traditional SPs tends to quench in their aggregate states owing to the strong \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, which can lead to the radiative decay pathway shutting down. To address this issue, aggregation-induced emission effect has been used as a rational tactic to boost the aggregate-state fluorescence of NIR-II emitters. In this contribution, we developed a precise molecular engineering tactic based on the block copolymerizations that integrate planar and twisted segments into one conjugated polymer backbone, providing great flexibility in tuning the photophysical properties and photothermal conversion capacity of SPs. Two monomers featured with twisted and planar architectures, respectively, were tactfully incorporated via a ternary copolymerization approach to produce a series of new SPs. The optimal copolymer (SP2) synchronously shows desirable absorption ability and good NIR-II quantum yield on the premise of maintaining typical aggregation-induced emission characteristics, resulting in balanced NIR-II fluorescence brightness and photothermal property. Water-dispersible nanoparticles fabricated from the optimal SP2 show efficient photothermal therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo investigation reveals the distinguished NIR-II fluorescence imaging performance of SP2 nanoparticles and their photothermal ablation toward tumor with prominent tumor accumulation ability and excellent biocompatibility.\n## Introduction\nTo meet the requirements of NIR-II FLI-assisted PTT theranostics, it is extremely urgent to develop exogenous contrast agents with efficient NIR-II emission and high photothermal effectiveness through precise molecular engineering. Up to now, a variety of inorganic nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes [18], quantum dots [19][20], and rare earth nanoparticles (NPs) [21,22], have been widely explored for NIR-II FLI, but their long-term biotoxicity and minimal biodegradability could substantially hinder their practical applications [23]. Small molecular organic dyes exhibit superiority in the aspect of biocompatibility, but they often suffer from unsatisfactory photostability and limited accumulation capacity [24,25]. In contrast, semiconducting polymers (SPs) with large \u03c0-conjugated architectures exhibit reliable biosafety, strong light-harvesting ability, durable photostability, excellent photothermal conversion ability, etc. They have manifested great talents in the fields of FLI, photoacoustic imaging, and imaging-guided PTT and/or photodynamic therapy [26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33]. In addition, the flexible tunability of the polymer skeleton endows SPs with versatile optical properties and therapeutic properties [34]. Hence, SPs are promising candidates for NIR-II FLI-guided PTT toward antitumor applications. However, currently, the structural diversity SP-based NIR-II emitters are still very limited, and their fluorescence performance still needs to be further improved. \n\nOn the basis of the Jablonski diagram, photoexcited dyes can dissipate their excited state energy through the radiative pathway to benefit fluorescence or through nonradiative channel to boost photothermal conversion. However, the radiative and nonradiative attenuations are 2 competitive channels involved in FLI and photothermal properties. Extending the conjugation length of organic probes or using highly conjugated SPs has been used as a feasible tactic to realize the red shift of emission wavelength.",

Building on our earlier work, we report the formation of secondary antibody-conjugated Pdots and provide Cryo-TEM evidence for their formation. We demonstrate the selective targeting of the antibody-conjugated Pdots to FLAG-tagged FLS2 membrane receptors in genetically engineered plant leaf cells. We also report the formation of a new class of luminescent Pdots with emission wavelengths of around 1000 nm. Finally, we demonstrate the formation and utility of oxygen sensing Pdots in aqueous media.",

                    "text": "Luminescent semiconducting polymer dots-Semiconductor polymer dots (Pdots) have rapidly garnered interest as an alternative to semiconductor quantum dots and fluorescent dyes in nanoscale fluorescence imaging and sensing applications [1]. Pdots are nanoparticles ranging from 10 to 100 nm in diameter. They are primarily composed of a semiconducting polymer and additives to enable their aqueous solubility and unique emission properties [2]. When synthesized with no dopant dyes, the formed Pdots largely retain the optical properties of the bulk semiconducting polymer, with decreased quantum yield and the appearance of a red emission tail being the only noticeable differences. Luminescent Pdots are characterized with low batch-to-batch variance in emission properties. This is in contrast to the high variance in emission properties often observed with other semiconductor luminescent nanoparticles like inorganic quantum dots. Pdots have several desirable properties that make them attractive alternatives to other luminescent nanoparticles. The high brightness of Pdots is owed to their fast emissive rates and large extinction coefficients [3]. Since each monomer with the polymer chain is capable of absorbing incident light, the high concentration of chromophores in Pdots gives them extinction coefficients an order of magnitude higher than luminescent quantum dots and two orders of magnitude greater than organic dyes [4]. Furthermore, Pdots are highly resistant to photobleaching, which make them excellent candidates for fluorescence imaging and sensing applications [1]. Recent advancements in polymer design have produced drastic enhancements in quantum yield, up to 0.98 [5]. Finally, Pdots exhibit minimal or no cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells which distinguish them from heavy metal, cadmium and lead containing quantum dots [6]. \n\nPolymer Dot Synthesis-One of the greatest advantages of Pdots is their low-cost, facile synthesis. Although there are several methods by which to prepare Pdots, the one that produces the smallest Pdots and is most commonly used is the nanoprecipitation method [7]. A schematic diagram which describes the nanoprecipitation used in our laboratory and others to form near infrared highly emitting dye-doped Pdots is shown in Scheme 1.",

Ptaszek, Mengran Yang, G. Stacey, A. Parvate, James E. Evans, J. Traeger, Dehong Hu, G. Orr, Z. Rosenzweig\n## Abstract\nSemiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) are rapidly becoming one of the most studied nanoparticles in fluorescence bioimaging and sensing. Their small size, high brightness, and resistance to photobleaching make them one of the most attractive fluorophores for fluorescence imaging and sensing applications. This paper highlights our recent advances in fluorescence bioimaging and sensing with nanoscale luminescent Pdots, specifically the use of organic dyes as dopant molecules to modify the optical properties of Pdots to enable deep red and near infrared fluorescence bioimaging applications and to impart sensitivity of dye doped Pdots towards selected analytes. Building on our earlier work, we report the formation of secondary antibody-conjugated Pdots and provide Cryo-TEM evidence for their formation. We demonstrate the selective targeting of the antibody-conjugated Pdots to FLAG-tagged FLS2 membrane receptors in genetically engineered plant leaf cells. We also report the formation of a new class of luminescent Pdots with emission wavelengths of around 1000 nm. Finally, we demonstrate the formation and utility of oxygen sensing Pdots in aqueous media.\n## Introduction\nLuminescent semiconducting polymer dots-Semiconductor polymer dots (Pdots) have rapidly garnered interest as an alternative to semiconductor quantum dots and fluorescent dyes in nanoscale fluorescence imaging and sensing applications [1]. Pdots are nanoparticles ranging from 10 to 100 nm in diameter. They are primarily composed of a semiconducting polymer and additives to enable their aqueous solubility and unique emission properties [2]. When synthesized with no dopant dyes, the formed Pdots largely retain the optical properties of the bulk semiconducting polymer, with decreased quantum yield and the appearance of a red emission tail being the only noticeable differences. Luminescent Pdots are characterized with low batch-to-batch variance in emission properties. This is in contrast to the high variance in emission properties often observed with other semiconductor luminescent nanoparticles like inorganic quantum dots. Pdots have several desirable properties that make them attractive alternatives to other luminescent nanoparticles. The high brightness of Pdots is owed to their fast emissive rates and large extinction coefficients [3]. Since each monomer with the polymer chain is capable of absorbing incident light, the high concentration of chromophores in Pdots gives them extinction coefficients an order of magnitude higher than luminescent quantum dots and two orders of magnitude greater than organic dyes [4]. Furthermore, Pdots are highly resistant to photobleaching, which make them excellent candidates for fluorescence imaging and sensing applications [1]. Recent advancements in polymer design have produced drastic enhancements in quantum yield, up to 0.98 [5]. Finally, Pdots exhibit minimal or no cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells which distinguish them from heavy metal, cadmium and lead containing quantum dots [6]. \n\nPolymer Dot Synthesis-One of the greatest advantages of Pdots is their low-cost, facile synthesis. Although there are several methods by which to prepare Pdots, the one that produces the smallest Pdots and is most commonly used is the nanoprecipitation method [7]. A schematic diagram which describes the nanoprecipitation used in our laboratory and others to form near infrared highly emitting dye-doped Pdots is shown in Scheme 1.",

However, there are few systematic studies on the biological effects and biocompatibility of Pdots in vitro and in vivo. The physicochemical properties of Pdots, such as surface modification, are very important in biomedical applications. Focusing on the central issue of the biological effects of Pdots, we systematically investigated the biological effects and biocompatibility of Pdots with different surface modifications and revealed the interactions between Pdots and organisms at the cellular and animal levels. The surfaces of Pdots were modified with different functional groups, including thiol, carboxyl, and amino groups, named Pdots@SH, Pdots@COOH, and Pdots@NH2, respectively. Extracellular studies showed that the modification of sulfhydryl, carboxyl, and amino groups had no significant effect on the physicochemical properties of Pdots, except that the amino modification affected the stability of Pdots to a certain extent. At the cellular level, Pdots@NH2 reduced cellular uptake capacity and increased cytotoxicity due to their instability in solution. At the in vivo level, the body circulation and metabolic clearance of Pdots@SH and Pdots@COOH were superior to those of Pdots@NH2. The four kinds of Pdots had no obvious effect on the blood indexes of mice and histopathological lesions in the main tissues and organs. This study provides important data for the biological effects and safety assessment of Pdots with different surface modifications, which pave the way for their potential biomedical applications.",

There are many types of nanoparticles, including quantum dots (QDs) [2][3][4], silicon nanoparticles [5,6], metal nanoclusters [7], etc. Quantum dots are a semiconductor material [8] whose internal electrons are restricted in all directions, resulting in a discontinuous electronic-energy-level structure. Quantum dots demonstrate characteristics of wide absorption range, narrow emission peak width, and excellent photostability and brightness [9]. However, the inherent heavy metal toxicity and complex preparation methods of quantum dots greatly limit the further application of these nanomaterials in in vivo imaging and clinical translation. To solve these limitations, various types of nanomaterials were developed, including semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots). Pdots are nanoparticles formed with semiconducting polymers by methods such as nanoprecipitation or microemulsion. Semiconducting polymers are macromolecular compounds with large \u03c0-conjugated backbones and delocalized electronic structures [10]. Since Pdots have a conjugated framework and a large number of \u03c0-\u03c0 bonds, Pdots have strong light-harvesting ability, high fluorescence quantum yield, and easy electron and energy transfer in the conjugated framework [11]. Pdots also have the characteristics of excellent photostability, structural diversity, functional designability, and easy surface modification [12]. These outstanding properties ensured that Pdots could be widely used in the biomedical field, including bioimaging, biosensors, tumor therapy, etc. For instance, Day et al. synthesized a multimodal combination of Pdots containing a heat shock protein inhibitor and azo compound for triple-negative breast cancer [13].Wu et al. designed a silica nanoparticle coated with catalase to treat glioblastoma through chemodynamic therapy and sound dynamic therapy [6]. Deng et al. synthesized a manganese-loaded fluoride nanoparticle for MRI and chemodynamic treatment of tumors [14].",

Although semiconducting polymer dots (pdots) are an emerging class of highly fluorescent contrast agents with favorable advantages for the next generation of in vivo imaging, their use for deep multiphoton imaging has never before been demonstrated. Here we characterize the multiphoton properties of three pdot variants (CNPPV, PFBT, and PFPV) and demonstrate deep imaging of cortical microvasculature in C57 mice. Specifically, we measure the two-versus three-photon power dependence of these pdots and observe a clear three-photon excitation signature at wavelengths longer than 1300 nm, and a transition from two-photon to three-photon excitation within a 1060 \u2013 1300 nm excitation range. Furthermore, we show that pdots enable in vivo two-photon imaging of cerebrovascular architecture in mice up to 850 \u03bcm beneath the pial surface using 800 nm excitation. In contrast with traditional multiphoton probes, we also demonstrate that the broad multiphoton absorption spectrum of pdots permits imaging at longer wavelengths (\u03bbex = 1,060 and 1225 nm). These wavelengths approach an ideal biological imaging wavelength near 1,300 nm and confer compatibility with a high-power ytterbium-fiber laser and a high pulse energy optical parametric amplifier, resulting in substantial improvements in signal-to-background ratio (>3.5-fold) and greater cortical imaging depths of 900 \u03bcm and 1300 \u03bcm. Ultimately, pdots are a versatile tool for MPM due to their extraordinary brightness and broad absorption, which will undoubtedly unlock the ability to interrogate deep structures in vivo.",

Dunn\n## Abstract\nDeep in vivo imaging of vasculature requires small, bright, and photostable fluorophores suitable for multiphoton microscopy (MPM). Although semiconducting polymer dots (pdots) are an emerging class of highly fluorescent contrast agents with favorable advantages for the next generation of in vivo imaging, their use for deep multiphoton imaging has never before been demonstrated. Here we characterize the multiphoton properties of three pdot variants (CNPPV, PFBT, and PFPV) and demonstrate deep imaging of cortical microvasculature in C57 mice. Specifically, we measure the two-versus three-photon power dependence of these pdots and observe a clear three-photon excitation signature at wavelengths longer than 1300 nm, and a transition from two-photon to three-photon excitation within a 1060 \u2013 1300 nm excitation range. Furthermore, we show that pdots enable in vivo two-photon imaging of cerebrovascular architecture in mice up to 850 \u03bcm beneath the pial surface using 800 nm excitation. In contrast with traditional multiphoton probes, we also demonstrate that the broad multiphoton absorption spectrum of pdots permits imaging at longer wavelengths (\u03bbex = 1,060 and 1225 nm). These wavelengths approach an ideal biological imaging wavelength near 1,300 nm and confer compatibility with a high-power ytterbium-fiber laser and a high pulse energy optical parametric amplifier, resulting in substantial improvements in signal-to-background ratio (>3.5-fold) and greater cortical imaging depths of 900 \u03bcm and 1300 \u03bcm. Ultimately, pdots are a versatile tool for MPM due to their extraordinary brightness and broad absorption, which will undoubtedly unlock the ability to interrogate deep structures in vivo.\n## Introduction\nIn vivo imaging with multiphoton fluorescence microscopy (MPM) is widely used due to its ability to provide diffraction-limited, three-dimensional images of intact tissue at depths ranging from a few hundred microns to more than 1 mm. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] Recent reports of deep tissue, in vivo imaging with two-and three-photon excitation have demonstrated the potential of imaging structures in the brain beyond the cortex, including the corpus callosum and hippocampus. 8,9 These advances have been driven in part by the availability of new ultrafast laser sources at longer wavelengths (\u03bb ex = 1000 -1600 nm) than those traditionally used in two-photon fluorescence imaging (\u03bb ex = 700 -900 nm). Equally important to the availability of laser sources is the availability of contrast agents with strong multiphoton absorption properties at these longer wavelengths. In this paper, we show that an emerging class of fluorophores termed polymer dots 10 possess strong two-and three-photon excitation across a broad range of wavelengths and enable deep imaging of microvasculature in the brain.\n\nMPM of vasculature requires the intravenous injection of bright, biocompatible contrast agents that preferably exhibit large absorption cross sections under near-infrared (NIR) excitation (\u03bb ex = 700 -1000 nm) and prolonged blood circulation times. Traditional exogenous contrast agents for in vivo MPM include organic dyes such as dextran-conjugated fluorescein and indocyanine green or inorganic semiconductor quantum dots. 11,12 Organic dyes, however, suffer from poor photostability and low quantum yields in aqueous biological environments. 13.14,15 Although quantum dots offer improved brightness and photostability, they present substantial toxicity concerns and are prone to bioaccumulation in organs and tissues. 16,17,18 Thus, the biological imaging community is eager for a safer, brighter, and more stable probe for deep, high-resolution in vivo imaging.\n\nThe highly fluorescent semiconducting polymer dot (pdot) is a promising candidate for in vivo MPM with material properties that can potentially overcome many of the limitations faced by other probes. 19 Although pdots are similar\n...\na safer, brighter, and more stable probe for deep, high-resolution in vivo imaging.\n\nThe highly fluorescent semiconducting polymer dot (pdot) is a promising candidate for in vivo MPM with material properties that can potentially overcome many of the limitations faced by other probes. 19 Although pdots are similar to quantum dots with respect to size (5-50 nm) and quantum yield, pdots are brighter, more photostable, and present no clear evidence of biotoxicity. 19,20 A useful measure of fluorescence brightness is the action cross section, which is given by the product of the peak absorption cross section and the fluorescence quantum yield. 19,21 Polymer dots rival both quantum dots and organic dyes in that their two-photon action (2PA) cross-sections are one to two orders of magnitude larger than inorganic quantum dots and three to five orders of magnitude greater than commonly used fluorescent dyes. 19,22 Herein, for the first time, we present evidence that we can take advantage of polymer dots' many favorable properties to produce high-quality in vivo multiphoton images of vasculature with excellent signal-to-background ratio (SBR) at depths exceeding 1 mm.\n\nAnother advantage of pdots is their broad absorption, which enables multiphoton imaging with a variety of ultrafast laser sources, including ytterbium-fiber lasers (yb-fiber, \u03bb ex =1060 nm) and longer wavelength optical parametric amplifiers (OPA, \u03bb ex = 1100 -1400 nm).

SPNs are designed to improve the sensitivity and resolution of PAI because of the tunable optical properties, high absorption coefficients and high photostability of this material [51]. In 2019, through reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of polystyrene-b-poly (Nisopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PSNiAA), Xu's team prepared a functional nanoparticles (PDPP3T@PSNiAA) with photothermal sensitivity and PA response [52]. Anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin (Dox) was also loaded onto these NPs by electrostatic interaction and formed PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs. The data showed that all PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs at different concentrations had a time-dependent increasing laser irradiation response. The temperature of the NPs could still increase to the same level even up to the fourth laser-cooling circle, indicating the photothermal stability of PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs. Additionally, experiments for the PA properties of these NPs conducted in vitro showed that the maximum intensity of PDPP3T@PSNiAA NPs was at 785 nm, and the higher concentration of NPs contributed to higher PA signals. The in vivo experiments indicated that these PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs could accumulate in tumor region over time (Figure 7). A burst intracellular Dox release occurred with NIR irradiation at acidic condition (80%), while it was below 40% at neutral condition, which could minimize the release of the drug in normal tissues. In vivo studies on HeLa tumor-bearing mice showed that tumors of PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs with laser treatment were effectively eliminated without reoccurrence, while groups treated with free Dox (with and without laser) and NPs without laser showed none or minor tumor elimination.",

The current challenges in the field and future research directions for the designing and fabrication of PAI probes are proposed.\n## Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are another new photonic biomaterial with great potential for theranostic applications. SPNs are designed to improve the sensitivity and resolution of PAI because of the tunable optical properties, high absorption coefficients and high photostability of this material [51]. In 2019, through reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of polystyrene-b-poly (Nisopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PSNiAA), Xu's team prepared a functional nanoparticles (PDPP3T@PSNiAA) with photothermal sensitivity and PA response [52]. Anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin (Dox) was also loaded onto these NPs by electrostatic interaction and formed PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs. The data showed that all PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs at different concentrations had a time-dependent increasing laser irradiation response. The temperature of the NPs could still increase to the same level even up to the fourth laser-cooling circle, indicating the photothermal stability of PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs. Additionally, experiments for the PA properties of these NPs conducted in vitro showed that the maximum intensity of PDPP3T@PSNiAA NPs was at 785 nm, and the higher concentration of NPs contributed to higher PA signals. The in vivo experiments indicated that these PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs could accumulate in tumor region over time (Figure 7). A burst intracellular Dox release occurred with NIR irradiation at acidic condition (80%), while it was below 40% at neutral condition, which could minimize the release of the drug in normal tissues. In vivo studies on HeLa tumor-bearing mice showed that tumors of PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs with laser treatment were effectively eliminated without reoccurrence, while groups treated with free Dox (with and without laser) and NPs without laser showed none or minor tumor elimination.",

Gargiulo, S. Albanese, M. Mancini\n## Abstract\nThe optical imaging plays an increasing role in preclinical studies, particularly in cancer biology. The combined ultrasound and optical imaging, named photoacoustic imaging (PAI), is an emerging hybrid technique for real-time molecular imaging in preclinical research and recently expanding into clinical setting. PAI can be performed using endogenous contrast, particularly from oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and melanin, or exogenous contrast agents, sometimes targeted for specific biomarkers, providing comprehensive morphofunctional and molecular information on tumor microenvironment. Overall, PAI has revealed notable opportunities to improve knowledge on tumor pathophysiology and on the biological mechanisms underlying therapy. The aim of this review is to introduce the principles of PAI and to provide a brief overview of current PAI applications in preclinical research, highlighting also on recent advances in clinical translation for cancer diagnosis, staging, and therapy.\n## Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles.\nRecent advances have been made for cancer PAI and PTT using semiconducting polymer (SP) NPs, an emerging group of contrast agents characterized by optical features, biocompatibility, photostability, and functionalization potentially more advantageous for in vivo applications compared to the most widely used organic dyes, metallic NPs, and carbon nanomaterials [86]. e remarkable optical features of SPNPs are mainly related to the presence of delocalized electrons, while PA signal enhancement has been achieved by modifying their polymeric structure and designing activatable molecular probes [87].\n\nInitial investigations on the use of SPNPs for in vivo PAI were conducted by Pu and colleagues [88] that highlighted the advantages over SWNTs or GNRs, based on a wider and more stable PA signal, and higher detection sensibility.

Methods: Herein, multi-responsive semiconducting polymer semi-interpenetrating nanoparticles (PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs) with highly stable structure and uniform size have been successfully designed by semi-interpenetrating technique. Results: It is proposed for the first time that PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs were prepared with \u201creinforced concrete\u201d particle structure, which is even resistant to organic solvent such as ethanol and THF. By adjusting the polymerization time, the obtained PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs exhibit uniform and controllable particle size with extremely low polydispersity index (~0.037) at 1 h of reaction time. The presence of pH/light/GSH multi-responsive semi-interpenetrating network in PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs dramatically increase their drug loading efficiency (92.64%), which is significantly higher than previously reported comparable SPNs-based drug delivery systems. Additionally, PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA-DOX IPNs further provide improved therapeutic efficacy by the combination of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy with controllably regulated release of doxorubicin (DOX). In vitro and in vivo results indicate that PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA-DOX IPNs are able to release drugs at controlled rate by pH/light/GSH regulation and offer PAI-guided chemo/photothermal combined therapy with excellent therapeutic efficacy. Conclusions: The semi-interpenetrating network method may be generally extended for the preparation of a wide range of organic polymer nanoparticles to achieve ultrahigh structural stability, precise particle size controllability and excellent drug loading capacity.",

Up to now, SPNs have been diversified for biological sensing, drug delivery, photoacoustic imaging (PAI), as well as photothermal and photodynamic therapy. SPNs are composed of organic constituents with low cytotoxicity and thus naturally overcome the long term toxicity issue caused by inorganic nanoparticles [6][7][8][9]. Despite the progress of SPNs in nanomedicine in recent years, fabrication techniques for SPNs with structurally stability and multi-functionality are still Ivyspring International Publisher in its infancy and confronted with great challenges. \n\nThe synthetic techniques for making semiconducting polymer nanoparticles are generally limited to emulsion technique and nanoprecipitation method [10][11][12][13]. However, these techniques offer poor control of SPNs size and produce SPNs with different particle size [14]. Furthermore, to afford SPNs with surface functional groups, amphiphilic polymer or phospholipid are required to encapsulate SPNs surface [15][16][17][18], which however are not inherently stable and suffer from the potential dissociation issues. To achieve structural stability, the synthesis and self-assembly of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) grafting SPNs have recently been reported [19,20]. However, the synthesis of semiconducting polymer amphiphiles is relatively complicated and the functionalization is specifically designed for each SPNs. Therefore, new strategies to develop SPNs with stable structure and controllable sizes are desired but still a challenge. \n\nRecently, multi-stimuli sensitive (e.g., pH changes, temperature, redox or light) nanoagents for controlled chemo/photothermal synergistic therapy have attracted considerable attention due to their additionally enhanced anticancer efficacy and reduced side effects.",

Methods: Herein, multi-responsive semiconducting polymer semi-interpenetrating nanoparticles (PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs) with highly stable structure and uniform size have been successfully designed by semi-interpenetrating technique. Results: It is proposed for the first time that PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs were prepared with \u201creinforced concrete\u201d particle structure, which is even resistant to organic solvent such as ethanol and THF. By adjusting the polymerization time, the obtained PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs exhibit uniform and controllable particle size with extremely low polydispersity index (~0.037) at 1 h of reaction time. The presence of pH/light/GSH multi-responsive semi-interpenetrating network in PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA IPNs dramatically increase their drug loading efficiency (92.64%), which is significantly higher than previously reported comparable SPNs-based drug delivery systems. Additionally, PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA-DOX IPNs further provide improved therapeutic efficacy by the combination of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy with controllably regulated release of doxorubicin (DOX). In vitro and in vivo results indicate that PDPP3T@PNIPAMAA-DOX IPNs are able to release drugs at controlled rate by pH/light/GSH regulation and offer PAI-guided chemo/photothermal combined therapy with excellent therapeutic efficacy. Conclusions: The semi-interpenetrating network method may be generally extended for the preparation of a wide range of organic polymer nanoparticles to achieve ultrahigh structural stability, precise particle size controllability and excellent drug loading capacity.\n## Introduction\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have found tremendous success in recent years as promising theranostic agent owing to their good optical properties, high photostability and outstanding biocompatibility [1][2][3][4][5]. Up to now, SPNs have been diversified for biological sensing, drug delivery, photoacoustic imaging (PAI), as well as photothermal and photodynamic therapy. SPNs are composed of organic constituents with low cytotoxicity and thus naturally overcome the long term toxicity issue caused by inorganic nanoparticles [6][7][8][9]. Despite the progress of SPNs in nanomedicine in recent years, fabrication techniques for SPNs with structurally stability and multi-functionality are still Ivyspring International Publisher in its infancy and confronted with great challenges. \n\nThe synthetic techniques for making semiconducting polymer nanoparticles are generally limited to emulsion technique and nanoprecipitation method [10][11][12][13]. However, these techniques offer poor control of SPNs size and produce SPNs with different particle size [14]. Furthermore, to afford SPNs with surface functional groups, amphiphilic polymer or phospholipid are required to encapsulate SPNs surface [15][16][17][18], which however are not inherently stable and suffer from the potential dissociation issues. To achieve structural stability, the synthesis and self-assembly of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) grafting SPNs have recently been reported [19,20]. However, the synthesis of semiconducting polymer amphiphiles is relatively complicated and the functionalization is specifically designed for each SPNs. Therefore, new strategies to develop SPNs with stable structure and controllable sizes are desired but still a challenge. \n\nRecently, multi-stimuli sensitive (e.g., pH changes, temperature, redox or light) nanoagents for controlled chemo/photothermal synergistic therapy have attracted considerable attention due to their additionally enhanced anticancer efficacy and reduced side effects.",

This probe is able to achieve several meaningful biomedical real-time imaging applications including tumor diagnosis and SLN mapping. More importantly, NIR-II imaging using PDFT1032 is capable of aiding us to accomplish accurate image-guided tumor surgery, vascular embolization therapy and image-guided SLNB with high spatial and temporal resolution. Excellent biocompatibility, favorable hydrophilicity, and desirable chemical and optical properties render NIR-II PDFT1032 a highly promising probe with the potential to be widely applicable in clinical imaging and the surgical treatment of malignancy.",

This probe is able to achieve several meaningful biomedical real-time imaging applications including tumor diagnosis and SLN mapping. More importantly, NIR-II imaging using PDFT1032 is capable of aiding us to accomplish accurate image-guided tumor surgery, vascular embolization therapy and image-guided SLNB with high spatial and temporal resolution. Excellent biocompatibility, favorable hydrophilicity, and desirable chemical and optical properties render NIR-II PDFT1032 a highly promising probe with the potential to be widely applicable in clinical imaging and the surgical treatment of malignancy.",

Tang et al. developed a nanocarrier based on the photoreactive oxetane groups modified semiconducting polymer to dope with Chlorin e6 (Ce6), which was called Ce6-doped semiconducting polymer dots (Ce6-Pdots). After UV photo-crosslinking, a polymeric network was formed due to the reactions between the modified side chains to prevent the retained Ce6 leakage. Because the emission range of the nanocarrier overlaps with the Ce6 absorption range, upon green light (520 nm) irradiation, the semiconducting polymer can transfer the excitation energy to the Ce6 and then efficient 1 O 2 were generated. Compared with Ce6 alone, the energy transfer process can avoid the relatively high dose of light irradiation and due to the large absorption cross section of the semiconducting polymer-based nanocarrier, the 1 O 2 generation was amplified, which resulted in highly effective in vitro PDT effect even with low NPs concentration (10 \u03bcg/mL) and light dose (60 J/cm 2 ) and the in vivo tumor growth was apparently inhibited after the PDT treatment [140]. NPs can also protect PSs from inactivation and degradation in the complex biological environment. For example, ICG, which is a PSs approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical treatment and imaging, still suffers from the instability in aqueous solution, which hinder its PDT efficacy.

Besides green fluorescent proteins (GFPs), 9,10 quantum dots (Qdots), 11,12 carbon nanodots (Cdots), 13 nanodiamonds, 14 and fluorescent dyes, Pdots are one of the more promising nanosized probes that have practical applications in biomedical research. 15 Pdots have been demonstrated in a number of applications, such as fluorescence bioimaging and biosensing. 16 \u221225 However, many scientific issues still await further investigation for Pdots to be used in biological applications. Research on smaller, brighter, and narrower emissive Pdots in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) region remain a challenge. Multicolor imaging is a powerful approach to study dynamic processes at cellular and subcellular levels. Though we have successfully developed green, orange, deep red, and NIR Pdots with narrow emission for bioimaging, 23,25 there is a need to develop Pdots with other colors. Yellow Pdots, in particular, are needed to fill up the spectral gap between the green and orange Pdots. \n\nWe have designed new yellow Pdots that consist of donor and acceptor semiconducting polymers that are cross-linked to an amphiphilic functional polymer.",

Wu, Yong Zhang, Sarah Hayden, Yue-Guo Zhang, Changfeng Wu, D. Chiu\n## Abstract\nCross-linked polymer dots with intense and narrow yellow emission were designed using boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) polymer as the acceptor and poly[9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl-co-1,4-benzo-{2,1\u2032-3}-thiadiazole] (PFBT) polymer as the donor. The emission fwhm\u2019s of the polymer dots (Pdots) were 37 nm. CL-BODIPY 565 Pdots were about 5 times brighter than commercial quantum dots (Qdots) 565 under identical experimental conditions. Specific cellular targeting indicated that the small, bright, and narrow emissive CL-BODIPY 565 Pdots are promising probes for biological applications.\n## body\nO ver the past two decades, semiconducting polymers have been the subject of great research interest because of their uses in a wide range of optoelectronic applications, such as polymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs), 1 nonlinear optical materials (NLO), 2 field effect transistors, 3 sensors, 4 information storage, 5 electrochromic devices, 6 and solar cells. 7 Recently, research into semiconducting polymers as probes and biosensors has emerged as a new area of investigation because of their outstanding fluorescence characteristics. 8 Semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) with their high brightness and high photostability have attracted considerable attention. Besides green fluorescent proteins (GFPs), 9,10 quantum dots (Qdots), 11,12 carbon nanodots (Cdots), 13 nanodiamonds, 14 and fluorescent dyes, Pdots are one of the more promising nanosized probes that have practical applications in biomedical research. 15 Pdots have been demonstrated in a number of applications, such as fluorescence bioimaging and biosensing. 16 \u221225 However, many scientific issues still await further investigation for Pdots to be used in biological applications. Research on smaller, brighter, and narrower emissive Pdots in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) region remain a challenge. Multicolor imaging is a powerful approach to study dynamic processes at cellular and subcellular levels. Though we have successfully developed green, orange, deep red, and NIR Pdots with narrow emission for bioimaging, 23,25 there is a need to develop Pdots with other colors. Yellow Pdots, in particular, are needed to fill up the spectral gap between the green and orange Pdots. \n\nWe have designed new yellow Pdots that consist of donor and acceptor semiconducting polymers that are cross-linked to an amphiphilic functional polymer.",

Korri-Youssoufi, A. Yassar\n## Abstract\nIn the past decade, \u03c0-conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) have been considered as promising nanomaterials for biomedical applications, and are widely used as probe materials for bioimaging and drug delivery. Due to their distinctive photophysical and physicochemical characteristics, good compatibility, and ease of functionalization, CPNs are gaining popularity and being used in more and more cutting-edge biomedical sectors. Common synthetic techniques can be used to synthesize CPNs with adjustable particle size and dispersion. More importantly, the recent development of CPNs for sensing and imaging applications has rendered them as a promising device for use in healthcare. This review provides a synopsis of the preparation and functionalization of CPNs and summarizes the recent advancements of CPNs for biomedical applications. In particular, we discuss their major role in bioimaging, therapeutics, fluorescence, and electrochemical sensing. As a conclusion, we highlight the challenges and future perspectives of biomedical applications of CPNs.\n## Introduction\nThe last decade has witnessed great progress in the use of conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs), sometimes referred to in the literature as semiconducting polymer nanoparticles or polymer dots (Pdots), as an emerging class of multifunctional nanoscale materials for biomedical applications, including fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, biosensors, and photothermal therapy for microbial infections and cancer [1][2][3][4].CPNs exhibit outstanding properties combined with a simple preparation method, easy surface modification, and water dispersibility [5].Their straightforward synthesis [4] in desired sizes and tunable properties makes them highly attractive materials for the aforementioned applications [6,7].Their photophysical properties can be tailor-made by an appropriate rational molecular design of the structure of the conjugated polymers (CPs) or aggregate states.Until now, CPNs and, more generally, soft fluorescent nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as novel biomedical analysis tools due to their exceptional photophysical properties, outstanding photochemical stability, extraordinary fluorescence efficiency, tunable spectral properties, and amplified fluorescent quenching effect with less toxicity.They have been exploited in fluorescence imaging [8], cancer cell bioimaging [9], photodynamics, photothermal therapy [10], antimicrobial therapy, and bacteria killing, as shown in Figure 1 [11].For biomedical applications, CPNs present many advantages over small organic molecule nanoparticles.They can be obtained with accessible synthetic schemes, thus providing a much larger platform for material manipulation to meet the specific requirements for different biomedical applications.Their chemical structures, band gap energy, functionalities, topology, and morphology can easily be tuned compared to those of the organic dye nanoparticles.Furthermore, many recent reports have shown that the effectiveness of CPNs as fluorescent probes for bioimaging can surpass that of small molecules and inorganic quantum dots due to their extraordinary fluorescence brightness, excellent photochemical stability, high-fluorescence quantum yield, biocompatibility, and low toxicity to cells and tissues [12].",

In one of the \ue103rst examples of interfacing SPAAC with nanotechnology, Bernardin et al. reported the use of CdSe/ ZnS QDots functionalised with a cyclooctynyl-glycolic acid derivative for imaging the metabolic incorporation of tetraacetylated N-azidoacetylmannosamine (Ac 4 ManNAz) on the membranes of live Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. 69 The strained alkyne was conjugated to the surface of amino-QDots via amide coupling and the reactivity of the resulting cyclooctynyl-QDots towards the bioorthogonal azide partner was tested both under CuAAC and SPAAC conditions. It has been shown that the use of Cu(I) can induce irreversible photoluminescence quenching via energy/electron transfer or alteration of the core structure of the QDots; 147 therefore, the \ue104uorescence quantum yield of the conjugates obtained under Cu(I) catalysis was found to be about three times lower than the one of the corresponding SPAAC conjugates. In terms of bioorthogonal imaging capabilities, the QDots were used at nanomolar concentrations (organic dye probes typically require concentrations above 50 mM). The improved sensitivity over classical organic \ue104uorophores was attributed to the multivalent presentation of the cyclooctyne groups on the QDot surface.\n\nDespite the potential of QDots for bioimaging applications, they pose toxicity concerns related to the presence of heavy metal ions; 148 this led to the development of more biocompatible alternatives, such as polymer dots and carbon quantum dots. Semiconducting polymer dots (PDots) are non-toxic and exhibit superior properties when compared to QDots in term of brightness and photostability; 149 moreover, unlike QDots, they are compatible with the CuAAC reaction.

We show how, by joining forces, bioorthogonal chemistry and nanotechnology can overcome some of the key current limitations in the field of nanomedicine, providing better, faster and more sensitive nanoparticle-based bioimaging and biosensing techniques, as well as therapeutic nanoplatforms with superior efficacy.\n## Expanding the horizons of bioimaging applications\n(bio)molecules and requires the use of bright and photostable probes, especially for long-term studies. Inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots, QDots), having singular optical properties (tuneable and narrow emission spectra, good stability and long photoluminescence lifetime), are ideal candidates for imaging applications. In one of the \ue103rst examples of interfacing SPAAC with nanotechnology, Bernardin et al. reported the use of CdSe/ ZnS QDots functionalised with a cyclooctynyl-glycolic acid derivative for imaging the metabolic incorporation of tetraacetylated N-azidoacetylmannosamine (Ac 4 ManNAz) on the membranes of live Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. 69 The strained alkyne was conjugated to the surface of amino-QDots via amide coupling and the reactivity of the resulting cyclooctynyl-QDots towards the bioorthogonal azide partner was tested both under CuAAC and SPAAC conditions. It has been shown that the use of Cu(I) can induce irreversible photoluminescence quenching via energy/electron transfer or alteration of the core structure of the QDots; 147 therefore, the \ue104uorescence quantum yield of the conjugates obtained under Cu(I) catalysis was found to be about three times lower than the one of the corresponding SPAAC conjugates. In terms of bioorthogonal imaging capabilities, the QDots were used at nanomolar concentrations (organic dye probes typically require concentrations above 50 mM). The improved sensitivity over classical organic \ue104uorophores was attributed to the multivalent presentation of the cyclooctyne groups on the QDot surface.\n\nDespite the potential of QDots for bioimaging applications, they pose toxicity concerns related to the presence of heavy metal ions; 148 this led to the development of more biocompatible alternatives, such as polymer dots and carbon quantum dots. Semiconducting polymer dots (PDots) are non-toxic and exhibit superior properties when compared to QDots in term of brightness and photostability; 149 moreover, unlike QDots, they are compatible with the CuAAC reaction.

Thus the development of novel \ue104uorescent probes is of vital importance for further improvement of many \ue104uorescence-based techniques. For in vivo biological applications, near-infrared (NIR) \ue104uorescent probes are highly desirable because of minimal auto-\ue104uorescence interference and high tissue-penetration depth in NIR region due to the weak absorption and scattering of biological species. [3][4][5] The most widely used NIR \ue104uorophores are small-molecule organic dyes (e.g., ICG, Cy7, Atto 740 and Alexa 750). 6 However, low brightness, small Stokes shi\ue09d and limited photostability of these NIR dyes are limiting factors for practical biological imaging applications.\n\nAmong the strides made in nanotechnology, inorganic semiconductor quantum dots (Qdots) with unique size-tunable emission were introduced to biological studies nearly 20 years ago as \ue104uorescent probes. [7][8][9] However, the release of heavy metal ions is a signi\ue103cant concern for living systems. Alternatively, organic dyes can be doped into nanoparticles such as silica and latex beads, [10][11][12][13] which exhibit improved brightness and photostability when compared with molecular dyes alone. In certain cases, nanoparticles with some size range and surface functional groups are promising for applications, such as for sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) mapping, because they have a long blood-circulation time. [14][15][16][17][18] However, the usefulness of dyeloaded nanoparticles is severely limited by the low \ue104uorophore concentration and possible dye leaching problems.\n\nSemiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) are emerging as organic \ue104uorescent nanoparticles with high brightness, large Stokes shi\ue09d, and intriguing energy-transfer properties.

Wu, Zhihe Liu, Ying Tang, Haobin Chen, Jiangbo Yu, Changfeng Wu, Daniel T Chiu\n## Abstract\nA semiconducting polymer with bright and narrow-band emission at 800 nm was synthesized and used for biological imaging applications.\n## Introduction\nFluorescence imaging techniques are effective tools to noninvasively investigate many fundamental and complex biological processes because they have high signal-to-noise ratios and excellent spatial and temporal resolution. 1,2 The potential of a \ue104uorescence technique is signi\ue103cantly dependent on the \ue104uorophore's property. Thus the development of novel \ue104uorescent probes is of vital importance for further improvement of many \ue104uorescence-based techniques. For in vivo biological applications, near-infrared (NIR) \ue104uorescent probes are highly desirable because of minimal auto-\ue104uorescence interference and high tissue-penetration depth in NIR region due to the weak absorption and scattering of biological species. [3][4][5] The most widely used NIR \ue104uorophores are small-molecule organic dyes (e.g., ICG, Cy7, Atto 740 and Alexa 750). 6 However, low brightness, small Stokes shi\ue09d and limited photostability of these NIR dyes are limiting factors for practical biological imaging applications.\n\nAmong the strides made in nanotechnology, inorganic semiconductor quantum dots (Qdots) with unique size-tunable emission were introduced to biological studies nearly 20 years ago as \ue104uorescent probes. [7][8][9] However, the release of heavy metal ions is a signi\ue103cant concern for living systems. Alternatively, organic dyes can be doped into nanoparticles such as silica and latex beads, [10][11][12][13] which exhibit improved brightness and photostability when compared with molecular dyes alone. In certain cases, nanoparticles with some size range and surface functional groups are promising for applications, such as for sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) mapping, because they have a long blood-circulation time. [14][15][16][17][18] However, the usefulness of dyeloaded nanoparticles is severely limited by the low \ue104uorophore concentration and possible dye leaching problems.\n\nSemiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) are emerging as organic \ue104uorescent nanoparticles with high brightness, large Stokes shi\ue09d, and intriguing energy-transfer properties. [19][20][21] These polymeric semiconductors were originally developed for optoelect\n...\npossible dye leaching problems.\n\nSemiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) are emerging as organic \ue104uorescent nanoparticles with high brightness, large Stokes shi\ue09d, and intriguing energy-transfer properties. [19][20][21] These polymeric semiconductors were originally developed for optoelectronic devices, [22][23][24] and later used for highly sensitive chemical sensors. 25,26 In the past decade, the adaptation of semiconducting polymers as \ue104uorescent probes has received considerable attention in biology and medicine. 27,28 A large variety of Pdots have been demonstrated for applications such as cellular labeling and tracking, [29][30][31][32][33] photodynamic and photothermal cancer therapy, [34][35][36] drug delivery, 37,38 in vivo optical imaging, 20,39 photoacoustic imaging, [40][41][42][43][44][45] and molecular detection. [46][47][48] In contrast with inorganic nanoparticles, one prominent advantage of Pdots is that their optical properties are highly tunable because new polymer structures can be synthesized or small molecular \ue104uorophores can be doped into them.

[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] Near-infrared (NIR) \ue104uorescence imaging in the 700-800 nm wavelength range is very attractive for real time in vitro and in vivo applications as tissue penetration is at its deepest with minimal auto-\ue104uorescence. 2,9 Small molecule NIR dyes, such as the FDA-approved indocyanine green 11 are currently used in \ue104uorescence imaging and assays; however, the majority of these agents suffer from limitations such as low brightness, insufficient photostability, and a small Stokes shi\ue09d. [1][2][3][4][5] Inorganic semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (Qdots) have been developed as NIR probes as they offer a signi\ue103cantly higher photostability and brightness compared to small molecule NIR dyes. However, toxicity and the disruption of shielding surface modi\ue103cation are critical concerns for their biological applications. 2,3,12 NIR-emitting CPNs, in contrast, offer a high brightness, good photostability, and minimal toxicity to biological cells and tissues. [1][2][3][4][5] To achieve emission in the NIR region, CPNs have been manufactured according to multiple strategies, which all aim to produce nanoparticles with enhanced optical performance. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] For example, low molecular weight, hydrophobic NIR dyes have been encapsulated within a CPN core resulting in quenching of visible emission of the conjugated polymer with distinct NIR emission 2 or multiple cascading light emitting polymers have been produced, which transfer the energy more efficiently to the dopant dye. 4 Disadvantages of such systems, however, include low CPN yields,",

Here, a method for achieving colloidally stable and low\u2010fouling SPNs is described by grafting poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) onto the backbone of the fluorescent semiconducting polymer, poly(9,9\u2032\u2010dioctylfluorene\u20105\u2010fluoro\u20102,1,3\u2010benzothiadiazole), in a simple one\u2010step substitution reaction, postpolymerization.

In vivo, the PEGylated SPNs are found to have excellent circulation efficiencies in zebrafish embryos for up to seven days postinjection. SPNs functionalized with affibodies are then shown to be able to target HER2 expressing cancer cells in a zebrafish xenograft model.

Stevens\n## Abstract\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are explored for applications in cancer theranostics because of their high absorption coefficients, photostability, and biocompatibility. However, SPNs are susceptible to aggregation and protein fouling in physiological conditions, which can be detrimental for in vivo applications. Here, a method for achieving colloidally stable and low\u2010fouling SPNs is described by grafting poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) onto the backbone of the fluorescent semiconducting polymer, poly(9,9\u2032\u2010dioctylfluorene\u20105\u2010fluoro\u20102,1,3\u2010benzothiadiazole), in a simple one\u2010step substitution reaction, postpolymerization. Further, by utilizing azide\u2010functionalized PEG, anti\u2010human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibodies, antibody fragments, or affibodies are site\u2010specifically \u201cclicked\u201d onto the SPN surface, which allows the functionalized SPNs to specifically target HER2\u2010positive cancer cells. In vivo, the PEGylated SPNs are found to have excellent circulation efficiencies in zebrafish embryos for up to seven days postinjection. SPNs functionalized with affibodies are then shown to be able to target HER2 expressing cancer cells in a zebrafish xenograft model. The covalent PEGylated SPN system described herein shows great potential for cancer theranostics.\n## Introduction\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs), often also referred to as conjugated polymer nanoparticles or polymer dots, are an emerging class of cancer theranostics.Their utility stems from their high absorption coefficients, biocompatibility, photostability, and fluorescent brightness.

With the increasing understanding of cancer biology and technology advancements, more strategies have been exploited to optimize the therapeutic outcomes. The rapid development and application of nanomedicine have motivated this progress. Combinational regimen, for instance, has become an indispensable approach for effective cancer treatment, including the combination of chemotherapeutic agents, chemo-energy, chemo-gene, chemo-small molecules, and chemo-immunology. Additionally, smart nanoplatforms that respond to external stimuli (such as light, temperature, ultrasound, and magnetic field), and/or to internal stimuli (such as changes in pH, enzymes, hypoxia, and redox) have been extensively investigated to improve precision therapy. Smart nanoplatforms for combinational therapy have demonstrated the potential to be the next generation cancer treatment regimen. This review aims to highlight the recent advances in smart combinational therapy.",

In addition to serving as the photothermal agent, pillararene-capped CuS nanocages were 4\u00d7 more responsive and could control the release of DOX. \n\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles [SPNs) have also been used as photothermal agents [150][151][152]. Being made of organic compounds including semiconducting polymers/oligomers and amphiphilic polymers, SPNs possess natural biocompatibility, good photostability, and are easy to functionalize [152]. It has been reported that SPNs have relatively higher photothermal conversion efficacy in comparison with carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods. The photophysical properties of SPNs are correlated to the molecular structures of their precursor polymers, which allows versatility and diversity for tuning the optical spectra [153,154]. Xu et al. synthesized stable and size controllable SPNs, where DOX was loaded to perform chemotherapy. DOX was released from nanoparticles through multi-responsiveness to pH/NIR/GSH. With a combination of chemo-and photothermal therapies, the proposed SPNs nanosystem showed improved therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. \n\nOrganic dyes can absorb optical energy and convert it into heat as well. Organic nanocarriers encapsulating organic dyes have been explored as complement for classic inorganic PTT, since they display good biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low longterm harmfulness. Liposomal nanocarriers are a popular delivery system for PTT [95,96]. Xiong et al. developed a NIR-triggered disintegrable liposomal nanoplatform which was modified with peptidyl ligands targeted to \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin receptors. The liposomes were loaded with ICG and a dendrimer-grafted cisplatin prodrug [19].",

Uribe, Liang Tang\n## Abstract\nCancer is a heterogeneous and complex disease. Traditional cancer therapy is associated with low therapeutic index, acquired resistance, and various adverse effects. With the increasing understanding of cancer biology and technology advancements, more strategies have been exploited to optimize the therapeutic outcomes. The rapid development and application of nanomedicine have motivated this progress. Combinational regimen, for instance, has become an indispensable approach for effective cancer treatment, including the combination of chemotherapeutic agents, chemo-energy, chemo-gene, chemo-small molecules, and chemo-immunology. Additionally, smart nanoplatforms that respond to external stimuli (such as light, temperature, ultrasound, and magnetic field), and/or to internal stimuli (such as changes in pH, enzymes, hypoxia, and redox) have been extensively investigated to improve precision therapy. Smart nanoplatforms for combinational therapy have demonstrated the potential to be the next generation cancer treatment regimen. This review aims to highlight the recent advances in smart combinational therapy.\n## Chemo-PTT Combination\nYang et al. also fabricated a CuS-containing supramolecular nanosystem for drug delivery, which consisted of a DOX reservoir, a middle layer of pillararene-functionalized CuS, and a superficial layer of folic acid-conjugated PEG [149]. In addition to serving as the photothermal agent, pillararene-capped CuS nanocages were 4\u00d7 more responsive and could control the release of DOX. \n\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles [SPNs) have also been used as photothermal agents [150][151][152]. Being made of organic compounds including semiconducting polymers/oligomers and amphiphilic polymers, SPNs possess natural biocompatibility, good photostability, and are easy to functionalize [152]. It has been reported that SPNs have relatively higher photothermal conversion efficacy in comparison with carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods. The photophysical properties of SPNs are correlated to the molecular structures of their precursor polymers, which allows versatility and diversity for tuning the optical spectra [153,154]. Xu et al. synthesized stable and size controllable SPNs, where DOX was loaded to perform chemotherapy. DOX was released from nanoparticles through multi-responsiveness to pH/NIR/GSH. With a combination of chemo-and photothermal therapies, the proposed SPNs nanosystem showed improved therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. \n\nOrganic dyes can absorb optical energy and convert it into heat as well. Organic nanocarriers encapsulating organic dyes have been explored as complement for classic inorganic PTT, since they display good biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low longterm harmfulness. Liposomal nanocarriers are a popular delivery system for PTT [95,96]. Xiong et al. developed a NIR-triggered disintegrable liposomal nanoplatform which was modified with peptidyl ligands targeted to \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin receptors. The liposomes were loaded with ICG and a dendrimer-grafted cisplatin prodrug [19].",

PTT functions via photothermal effects induced by converting light energy into heat on near-infrared laser irradiation. Despite the great advances in PTT for cancer treatment, the photothermal therapeutics using laser devise only or non-specific small molecule PTT agents has been limited because of its low photothermal conversion efficiency, concerns about the biosafety of the photothermal agents, their low tumor accumulation, and a heat resistance of specific types of cancer. Using nanomaterials as PTT agents themselves, or for delivery of PTT agents, offers improved therapeutic outcomes with fewer side effects through enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency, accumulation of the PTT agent in the tumor tissue, and, by extension, through combination with other therapies. Herein, we review PTT\u2019s current clinical progress and present the future outlooks for clinical applications. To better understand clinical PTT applications, we describe nanomaterial-mediated photothermal effects and their mechanism of action in the tumor microenvironment. This review also summarizes recent studies of PTT alone or in combination with other therapies. Overall, innovative and strategically designed PTT platforms are promising next-generation noninvasive cancer treatments to move closer toward clinical applications.",

Choi\n## Abstract\nPhotothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted extensive research attention as a noninvasive and selective treatment strategy for numerous cancers. PTT functions via photothermal effects induced by converting light energy into heat on near-infrared laser irradiation. Despite the great advances in PTT for cancer treatment, the photothermal therapeutics using laser devise only or non-specific small molecule PTT agents has been limited because of its low photothermal conversion efficiency, concerns about the biosafety of the photothermal agents, their low tumor accumulation, and a heat resistance of specific types of cancer. Using nanomaterials as PTT agents themselves, or for delivery of PTT agents, offers improved therapeutic outcomes with fewer side effects through enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency, accumulation of the PTT agent in the tumor tissue, and, by extension, through combination with other therapies. Herein, we review PTT\u2019s current clinical progress and present the future outlooks for clinical applications. To better understand clinical PTT applications, we describe nanomaterial-mediated photothermal effects and their mechanism of action in the tumor microenvironment. This review also summarizes recent studies of PTT alone or in combination with other therapies. Overall, innovative and strategically designed PTT platforms are promising next-generation noninvasive cancer treatments to move closer toward clinical applications.\n## Photothermal Agents and Their PTT Effects in the Tumor Microenvironment\nAn ideal photothermal agent should possess a high PCE at the treatment wavelength, excellent biocompatibility that includes minimal dark toxicity outside of the light-exposed tissue, and robust photostability.Generally, photothermal agents are divided into the following types: (i) organic dyes, such as indocyanine green and heptamethine cyanine; (ii) organic nanoparticles, including organic semiconducting polymeric nanoparticles and porphyrin-lipid conjugate porphysomes; (iii) gold nanomaterials; (iv) carbon-based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide; and (v) other inorganic materials such as metal oxide nanoparticles and quantum dots (Figure 2).Among the various photothermal agents, organic nanomaterials often have good biocompatibility and biodegradability; however, they also have inherent limitations such as low photothermal conversion efficiency, poor photothermal stability, and complicated synthesis.In contrast, inorganic nanomaterials usually show excellent NIR light absorbance; high photothermal efficiency and photostability owing to their intrinsic optical properties, such as localized surface plasmon resonance (e.g., gold nanomaterials), narrow emission spectra, and structural features that offer advantages such as ease of synthesis and surface modification with different functional groups, including carboxylic, hydroxyl, and epoxy groups (e.g., carbon-based nanomaterials).However, their non-biodegradable nature and potential long-term toxicity remain unsolved issues [27].\n\nIn terms of the mechanism of action, photothermal agents act as an enhancer to heat up target cells or tissues.Specifically, on irradiation by light of a specific wavelength, the agents absorb energy, and are excited from the ground singlet state to an excited singlet state.The excited PTT agent then undergoes nonradiative vibrational relaxation, returning to the ground state by a collision between the excited photothermal agents and the surrounding molecules.As a result, the increased kinetic energy heats the surrounding tumor microenvironment (Figure 3).",

CTX-based bioconjugates have been widely subjected to phase I/II clinical trials and have shown substantial promise. Many studies have demonstrated that CTX preferentially binds to neuroectodermal tumors, such as glioblastoma, without cross-reactivity to normal brain cells. With its ability to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and its tyrosine residue allows covalent conjugation with functional moieties, CTX is an attractive platform to explore development of diagnostic and therapeutic agents for gliomas.

Furthermore, this probe has been clinically evaluated for adult skin cancer (NCT02097875), sarcoma (NCT024643320), and for pediatric patients with central nervous system tumors (NCT02462629) [73]. \n\nOther promising fluorescence-based imaging probes developed for tumors detection are quantum dots (QDs). QDs can provide images across large ranges of wavelengths and have high quantum yields [74]. Unlike organic dyes, which often suffer rapid photo-bleaching [75,76], QDs are composed of semiconducting metals (e.g., Cd, Zn, Se, In, P, and As) that are resistant to photo-bleaching [77]. \n\nFurthermore, the quantum properties of QDs are tunable and can provide excitation/emission wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to NIR. The outer shell of the QD could be modified by organic layers including PEG polymers, phospholipids, and peptides [78], thus preventing nonspecific absorption of proteins to their surface, increase blood half-life, and reducing toxicity [79,80]. CTX conjugated with cadmium-free silver-indium-sulfide (Ag-In-S or AIS) chalcopyrite QDs was used in cellular imaging studies [47]. This CTX-conjugated QD-micelles exhibited specific internalization into U-87 brain tumor cells. Although QDs offer potentially valuable benefits in preclinical oncology, such as drug targeting and in vivo biomedical imaging, under certain conditions, they pose risks to human health and the environment, constituting a barrier for their translation to clinical use [81]. Semiconducting polymer dots have aroused extensive interests as a novel family of fluorescent probes for tumor targeting applications [54,61]. Unlike QDs, polymer-based dots were developed from biologically non-toxic materials, using deep-red photo-acceptors and visible-light photo-donors.",

Frank\n## Abstract\nChlorotoxin (CTX) is a 36-amino-acid disulfide-containing peptide derived from the venom of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus. CTX alters physiology in numerous ways. It interacts with voltage gated chloride channels, Annexin-2, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). CTX-based bioconjugates have been widely subjected to phase I/II clinical trials and have shown substantial promise. Many studies have demonstrated that CTX preferentially binds to neuroectodermal tumors, such as glioblastoma, without cross-reactivity to normal brain cells. With its ability to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and its tyrosine residue allows covalent conjugation with functional moieties, CTX is an attractive platform to explore development of diagnostic and therapeutic agents for gliomas. In this review, we outline CTX structure and its molecular targets, summarize molecular variations of CTX developed for glioma imaging, and discuss future trends and perspectives for CTX conjugates as a theranostic agent.\n## CTX-Based MRI/Optical Imaging\nIn addition, BLZ-100 was translated into the clinic and it is currently undergoing evaluation in Phase I clinical trials in adult patients with glioma (NCT02234297). Furthermore, this probe has been clinically evaluated for adult skin cancer (NCT02097875), sarcoma (NCT024643320), and for pediatric patients with central nervous system tumors (NCT02462629) [73]. \n\nOther promising fluorescence-based imaging probes developed for tumors detection are quantum dots (QDs). QDs can provide images across large ranges of wavelengths and have high quantum yields [74]. Unlike organic dyes, which often suffer rapid photo-bleaching [75,76], QDs are composed of semiconducting metals (e.g., Cd, Zn, Se, In, P, and As) that are resistant to photo-bleaching [77]. \n\nFurthermore, the quantum properties of QDs are tunable and can provide excitation/emission wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to NIR. The outer shell of the QD could be modified by organic layers including PEG polymers, phospholipids, and peptides [78], thus preventing nonspecific absorption of proteins to their surface, increase blood half-life, and reducing toxicity [79,80]. CTX conjugated with cadmium-free silver-indium-sulfide (Ag-In-S or AIS) chalcopyrite QDs was used in cellular imaging studies [47]. This CTX-conjugated QD-micelles exhibited specific internalization into U-87 brain tumor cells. Although QDs offer potentially valuable benefits in preclinical oncology, such as drug targeting and in vivo biomedical imaging, under certain conditions, they pose risks to human health and the environment, constituting a barrier for their translation to clinical use [81]. Semiconducting polymer dots have aroused extensive interests as a novel family of fluorescent probes for tumor targeting applications [54,61]. Unlike QDs, polymer-based dots were developed from biologically non-toxic materials, using deep-red photo-acceptors and visible-light photo-donors.",

            "abstract": "Abstract. Significance: Deep tissue noninvasive high-resolution imaging with light is challenging due to the high degree of light absorption and scattering in biological tissue. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) can overcome some of the challenges of pure optical or ultrasound imaging to provide high-resolution deep tissue imaging. However, label-free PAI signals from light absorbing chromophores within the tissue are nonspecific. The use of exogeneous contrast agents (probes) not only enhances the imaging contrast (and imaging depth) but also increases the specificity of PAI by binding only to targeted molecules and often providing signals distinct from the background. Aim: We aim to review the current development and future progression of photoacoustic molecular probes/contrast agents. Approach: First, PAI and the need for using contrast agents are briefly introduced. Then, the recent development of contrast agents in terms of materials used to construct them is discussed. Then, various probes are discussed based on targeting mechanisms, in vivo molecular imaging applications, multimodal uses, and use in theranostic applications. Results: Material combinations are being used to develop highly specific contrast agents. In addition to passive accumulation, probes utilizing activation mechanisms show promise for greater controllability. Several probes also enable concurrent multimodal use with fluorescence, ultrasound, Raman, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography. Finally, targeted probes are also shown to aid localized and molecularly specific photo-induced therapy. Conclusions: The development of contrast agents provides a promising prospect for increased contrast, higher imaging depth, and molecularly specific information. Of note are agents that allow for controlled activation, explore other optical windows, and enable multimodal use to overcome some of the shortcomings of label-free PAI.",

                    "text": "Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are advanced organic materials that have been applied in many imaging modalities, including fluorescent imaging, US imaging, and PAI. The advantages of SPNs are numerous and include large absorption coefficient, tunable absorption, high photostability, low toxicity, 86 high structural flexibility, small size, and higher PA signal generation than single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and AuNRs. 210 As an imaging probe to localize specific diseases or tissues, SPNs can produce PA signals in the sites of interest, relying on simple accumulation via the retention effect or receptor binding on the cell surface. This strategy leads to the application of LN mapping, 210 in vivo tumor-targeted imaging, [211][212][213] cell tracking, 214 and ROS mapping. 134 For example, SPN with poly as cyclopentadithiophene-altbenzothiadiazole showed a maximum NIR-I absorption at 660 nm and maximum PA signals at 690 nm, and it was used as PAI probes for lymphatic imaging. 210 Another recently reported SPNs, which was fabricated into water-dispersed NPs, showed strong absorption in the NIR-II window and efficient cellular uptake, leading to effective accumulation in subcutaneous tumors and brain tumors. 212 ther than the simple accumulation of agents, SPNs also can be employed as activable PA probes with biomarker-triggered signals, which offer measurable and quantifiable real-time information on pathological status at the molecular level. Such smart PA probes have been used for in vivo imaging of a variety of biomarkers and biological metabolites in recent years, including abnormal pH, 215 different ROS imaging (such as ONOO \u2212 and CLO \u2212 level, 134,210 O2 \u2022\u2212 level 216 ), and granzyme B. 104 The reader can refer to Ref. 104 for more details on activatable SP nanoprobe (SPNP), which was reported as a biomarker to detect granzyme B in the tumors of living mice. Granzyme B can be considered to be a signature of immune activation due to elevated concentration in cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",

A. Malik, M. Pramanik\n## Abstract\nAbstract. Significance: Deep tissue noninvasive high-resolution imaging with light is challenging due to the high degree of light absorption and scattering in biological tissue. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) can overcome some of the challenges of pure optical or ultrasound imaging to provide high-resolution deep tissue imaging. However, label-free PAI signals from light absorbing chromophores within the tissue are nonspecific. The use of exogeneous contrast agents (probes) not only enhances the imaging contrast (and imaging depth) but also increases the specificity of PAI by binding only to targeted molecules and often providing signals distinct from the background. Aim: We aim to review the current development and future progression of photoacoustic molecular probes/contrast agents. Approach: First, PAI and the need for using contrast agents are briefly introduced. Then, the recent development of contrast agents in terms of materials used to construct them is discussed. Then, various probes are discussed based on targeting mechanisms, in vivo molecular imaging applications, multimodal uses, and use in theranostic applications. Results: Material combinations are being used to develop highly specific contrast agents. In addition to passive accumulation, probes utilizing activation mechanisms show promise for greater controllability. Several probes also enable concurrent multimodal use with fluorescence, ultrasound, Raman, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography. Finally, targeted probes are also shown to aid localized and molecularly specific photo-induced therapy. Conclusions: The development of contrast agents provides a promising prospect for increased contrast, higher imaging depth, and molecularly specific information. Of note are agents that allow for controlled activation, explore other optical windows, and enable multimodal use to overcome some of the shortcomings of label-free PAI.\n## Photoacoustic Imaging with Exogeneous Probes\nThe NIR window has been extensively employed for deep tissue imaging at the sacrifice of imaging contrast as the absorption of intrinsic chromophores in the NIR region is low. Therefore, contrast agents are in great demand for NIR PAI. So far, metallic NPs, small organic molecules, organic NPs, semiconducting polymer (SP) NPs, carbon materials, fluorescent proteins, RGs, etc., have been demonstrated as PA contrast agents. 86,91,118 These can be used either by targeting a specific receptor/protein or can be used as nontargeted passive imaging agents. Nontargeted imaging agents may extravasate from the blood stream due to increased vascular permeability or the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in tumor tissue, whereas targeted imaging agents target a specific molecule, such as receptors, proteins, or enzymes. 148 lthough all contrast agents have their own absorption wavelengths and abundant choices of materials for PAT contrast agents, 149 not all choices can be considered useful for PA probes. Photostability, renal clearance, optical absorption, and photothermal conversion efficiency are four vital parameters for assessing effective contrast agents, and therefore, they should be taken into consideration when designing new materials. \n\nCommonly used contrast agents can be classified into (a) inorganic agents, such as metallic NPs or carbon-based nanomaterials, and (b) organic agents, such as organic dyes and SP NPs. A few of the probes discussed later in this review are sorted by material and their peak absorption wavelengths and shown in Fig. 1(b). Inorganic agents show high photothermal conversion efficiency and photostability, whereas organic agents show good biocompatibility and biodegradability. In this section, metallic NPs are discussed first, followed by organic dyes and organic NPs. Semiconducting polymer NPs, and carbon-based nanomaterials are presented at the end of this section.\n\n## Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are advanced organic materials that have been applied in many imaging modalities, including fluorescent imaging, US imaging, and PAI. The advantages of SPNs are numerous and include large absorption coefficient, tunable absorption, high photostability, low toxicity, 86 high structural flexibility, small size, and higher PA signal generation than single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and AuNRs. 210 As an imaging probe to localize specific diseases or tissues, SPNs can produce PA signals in the sites of interest, relying on simple accumulation via the retention effect or receptor binding on the cell surface. This strategy leads to the application of LN mapping, 210 in vivo tumor-targeted imaging, [211][212][213] cell tracking, 214 and ROS mapping. 134 For example, SPN with poly as cyclopentadithiophene-altbenzothiadiazole showed a maximum NIR-I absorption at 660 nm and maximum PA signals at 690 nm, and it was used as PAI probes for lymphatic imaging. 210 Another recently reported SPNs, which was fabricated into water-dispersed NPs, showed strong absorption in the NIR-II window and efficient cellular uptake, leading to effective accumulation in subcutaneous tumors and brain tumors. 212 ther than the simple accumulation of agents, SPNs also can be employed as activable PA probes with biomarker-triggered signals, which offer measurable and quantifiable real-time information on pathological status at the molecular level. Such smart PA probes have been used for in vivo imaging of a variety of biomarkers and biological metabolites in recent years, including abnormal pH, 215 different ROS imaging (such as ONOO \u2212 and CLO \u2212 level, 134,210 O2 \u2022\u2212 level 216 ), and granzyme B. 104 The reader can refer to Ref. 104 for more details on activatable SP nanoprobe (SPNP), which was reported as a biomarker to detect granzyme B in the tumors of living mice. Granzyme B can be considered to be a signature of immune activation due to elevated concentration in cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",

                    "text": "Fluorescence imaging allows for visualization of real-time details at a cellular level. However, long-term imaging is difficult due to the poor light stability of organic fluorescent dyes. Graphene quantum dots are a good alternative solution. They have outstanding optical properties and unique structural features. Graphene quantum dots are loaded on the surface of NPs for example optical magneto ferroferric oxide@polypyrrole core-shell NPs. They have longer metabolic processes in blood. In vivo results show they are capable of monitoring the distribution and metabolism of NPs [81]. Mesoporous silica NPs with graphene quantum dots can simultaneously monitor real-time localization of the doxorubicin (DOX) carrier for proper drug targeting as a fluorescent imaging agent. The nanoplatform shows stable suspension and excitation-dependent photoluminescence. They also show pH and temperature-dependent release behaviour that can be utilized in theranostic applications. Their fluorescence properties make them suitable for optical imaging with minimal cytotoxicity [82]. Quantum dots offer superior optical characteristics compared to organic dyes. Their potential toxicity, however, limits their application. Topical administration can reduce toxicity. In vivo endoscopic imaging of human bladder cancer by topical administration of quantum dots conjugated to anti-CD47 was successful and showed no indication of acute toxicity up to 7 days after installation [83]. The molecular profile of most cancer varies greatly between patients as well as spatially and temporally within a single tumour mass. To account for such variance, multiplexed molecular imaging has high potential. Multiplexed molecular imaging enables multiplexed imaging of large panels of cancer biomarkers. Polymer dots can be used in multiplexed molecular imaging and utilizes semiconducting polymers with strong fluorescence. Studies show a 10-fold enhanced brightness of polymer dots over commercial fluorescent dyes. Quantum dots are fluorescent semiconductor NPs that typically contain group II-VI (e.g., CdSe and CdTe), III-V (e.g., InP and InAs), IV-VI (e.g., PbTe, PbSe), or I-III-VI (e.g., CuInS 2 ) elements.",

Chow\n## Abstract\nNanomaterials, such as nanoparticles, nanorods, nanosphere, nanoshells, and nanostars, are very commonly used in biomedical imaging and cancer therapy. They make excellent drug carriers, imaging contrast agents, photothermal agents, photoacoustic agents, and radiation dose enhancers, among other applications. Recent advances in nanotechnology have led to the use of nanomaterials in many areas of functional imaging, cancer therapy, and synergistic combinational platforms. This review will systematically explore various applications of nanomaterials in biomedical imaging and cancer therapy. The medical imaging modalities include magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, single photon emission computerized tomography, optical imaging, ultrasound, and photoacoustic imaging. Various cancer therapeutic methods will also be included, including photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. This review also covers theranostics, which use the same agent in diagnosis and therapy. This includes recent advances in multimodality imaging, image-guided therapy, and combination therapy. We found that the continuous advances of synthesis and design of novel nanomaterials will enhance the future development of medical imaging and cancer therapy. However, more resources should be available to examine side effects and cell toxicity when using nanomaterials in humans.\n## Quantum Dots\nFluorescence imaging allows for visualization of real-time details at a cellular level. However, long-term imaging is difficult due to the poor light stability of organic fluorescent dyes. Graphene quantum dots are a good alternative solution. They have outstanding optical properties and unique structural features. Graphene quantum dots are loaded on the surface of NPs for example optical magneto ferroferric oxide@polypyrrole core-shell NPs. They have longer metabolic processes in blood. In vivo results show they are capable of monitoring the distribution and metabolism of NPs [81]. Mesoporous silica NPs with graphene quantum dots can simultaneously monitor real-time localization of the doxorubicin (DOX) carrier for proper drug targeting as a fluorescent imaging agent. The nanoplatform shows stable suspension and excitation-dependent photoluminescence. They also show pH and temperature-dependent release behaviour that can be utilized in theranostic applications. Their fluorescence properties make them suitable for optical imaging with minimal cytotoxicity [82]. Quantum dots offer superior optical characteristics compared to organic dyes. Their potential toxicity, however, limits their application. Topical administration can reduce toxicity. In vivo endoscopic imaging of human bladder cancer by topical administration of quantum dots conjugated to anti-CD47 was successful and showed no indication of acute toxicity up to 7 days after installation [83]. The molecular profile of most cancer varies greatly between patients as well as spatially and temporally within a single tumour mass. To account for such variance, multiplexed molecular imaging has high potential. Multiplexed molecular imaging enables multiplexed imaging of large panels of cancer biomarkers. Polymer dots can be used in multiplexed molecular imaging and utilizes semiconducting polymers with strong fluorescence. Studies show a 10-fold enhanced brightness of polymer dots over commercial fluorescent dyes. Quantum dots are fluorescent semiconductor NPs that typically contain group II-VI (e.g., CdSe and CdTe), III-V (e.g., InP and InAs), IV-VI (e.g., PbTe, PbSe), or I-III-VI (e.g., CuInS 2 ) elements.",

This review focuses on contrast agents, particularly in the wavelength range, for use in photoacoustic imaging. The basic principles of photoacoustic imaging regarding light absorption and acoustic release are introduced, and the optical characteristics of tissues are summarized according to the wavelength region. Various types of contrast agents, including organic dyes, semiconducting polymeric nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, and other inorganic nanoparticles, are explored in terms of their light absorption range in the near-infrared region. An overview of the contrast-enhancing capacity and other functional characteristics of each agent is provided to help researchers gain insights into the development of contrast agents in photoacoustic imaging.",

Han, Dakyeon Lee, Sungjee Kim, Hyung-Hoi Kim, Sanghwa Jeong, Jeesu Kim\n## Abstract\nPhotoacoustic imaging using endogenous chromophores as a contrast has been widely applied in biomedical studies owing to its functional imaging capability at the molecular level. Various exogenous contrast agents have also been investigated for use in contrast-enhanced imaging and functional analyses. This review focuses on contrast agents, particularly in the wavelength range, for use in photoacoustic imaging. The basic principles of photoacoustic imaging regarding light absorption and acoustic release are introduced, and the optical characteristics of tissues are summarized according to the wavelength region. Various types of contrast agents, including organic dyes, semiconducting polymeric nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, and other inorganic nanoparticles, are explored in terms of their light absorption range in the near-infrared region. An overview of the contrast-enhancing capacity and other functional characteristics of each agent is provided to help researchers gain insights into the development of contrast agents in photoacoustic imaging.\n## Contrast Agents at Low NIR-I (650-800 nm)\n[81]\n\n[82] [83] In addition to contrast enhancement, different functionalities for measuring biological responses have been studied using organic nanostructures.Miao et al., developed a pH-sensitive nanoprobe using a semiconducting oligomer (SO) [84].By synthesizing a boron-dipyrromethene dye with SO, the proposed nanoprobes were activated by the pH values of the biological tissues.The synthesized SO nanoprobes exhibited distinguishable PA responses, depending on the pH of the surrounding environment (Figure 2a).They delivered SO nanoprobes into HeLa xenograft tumors in mice and measured the PA signal differences with excitation wavelengths of 680 and 750 nm.The resulting images showed tumor-specific signals because the pH of the tumor was lower than that of the normal tissue surrounding it (Figure 2b).As a representative example of an activable probe, Reinhardt et al., developed a series of nanoprobes for the detection of nitric oxide (NO) [85].The optical absorption peak shifted from 770 nm to 680 nm in the presence of NO (Figure 2c,d).The activation of the nanoprobe was verified by measuring the multispectral PA responses before and after injection of the developed nanoprobes into the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation mouse model.The results showed significant signal enhancement compared with the control group.By visualizing NO levels in biological tissues, the role of NO in tumor progression can be elucidated in the future.\n\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have been developed as PA agents owing to their superior light absorption and photostability.In particular, organic semiconducting perylene diimide (PDI) was used because of its good chemical, thermal, and optical stability, as well as its good biocompatibility.Cui et al., developed PDI-based nanoparticles that could detect early thrombi [86].They added cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (cRGD) peptides, which have a high binding ability to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa generated from the early thrombus (Figure 2e).",

QDs offer excellent photostability and tunable emission spectra from the ultraviolet to the near infrared region, simply by modulating their size. Due to their photostability, QDs avoid the problems of self-absorption, self-fluorescence, and photobleaching from which traditional fluorophores suffer. Therefore, QDs offer applications within many different areas, including waterborne pathogen detection [26]. \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles encapsulate a fluorophore within a polymeric coating like fluorescent silica nanoparticles have been applied for detection using fluorescence spectrometers or fluorescent reading microtiter plate readers, as well as in flow cytometry.

Saleh\n## Abstract\nThe detection of trace levels of chemical, biological and other analytes has many important applications, including industry, forensics and environmental monitoring. Detection Journal is an international journal dedicated to the latest advancement of all areas that are related to detection. Nanotechnology based detection techniques may provide major advantages of low detection limits and rapid testing. This may allow scientists to know early about the case and provide the potential of stopping the problem at earlier stages.\n## Spectroscopic Based Methods\nResearch is required to develop improved ways to produce magnetic nanoparticles focusing on ensuring precise composition, uniform surface modification, and reproducible functionalization [25]. \n\nFluorescent quantum dots (QDs), of a semiconductor core such as cadmium, mixed with selenium or tellurium, surrounded by a semiconductor outer shell, often zinc sulphide, and a layer of polymer to stabilize the QD, and allow for (bio-)chemical functionalization, are of unique optical properties when compared to conventional semiconductors, organic fluorescent dyes, and proteins. QDs offer excellent photostability and tunable emission spectra from the ultraviolet to the near infrared region, simply by modulating their size. Due to their photostability, QDs avoid the problems of self-absorption, self-fluorescence, and photobleaching from which traditional fluorophores suffer. Therefore, QDs offer applications within many different areas, including waterborne pathogen detection [26]. \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles encapsulate a fluorophore within a polymeric coating like fluorescent silica nanoparticles have been applied for detection using fluorescence spectrometers or fluorescent reading microtiter plate readers, as well as in flow cytometry. The protection of the fluorophore by the polymer provides high stability under a range of conditions proving superior to organic dyes in terms of photostability and versatility [27].",

In addition to monomer form, dyes are often doped in polymer nanocarriers or immobilized on the surface of carriers before combining with antibodies to obtain higher fluorescence yield. Bamrungsap et al. doped dye Cy5 into silica nanoparticles for the detection of an influenza antigen, proving an eightfold better sensitivity than the commercial colorbased LFIA kit. [14] Quantum dots (QDs) make up for some inherent defects of organic fluorescent dyes due to their sharp emission peaks, strong signal intensity, low background, and photostability. It is reported that single QDs have longer fluorescence lifetime and 10-20 times higher signal strength than organic fluorescent dyes.

However, its clinical application is severely limited by the unsatisfactory sensitivity, which makes it difficult to obtain accurate results when detecting biomarkers of trace levels, especially in complex matrices. Nanoparticles have been introduced into LFIA for years and become an indispensable part, acting not only as carriers that load and enrich biomolecules, such as antibodies and dyes, but also a miniature platform applied for creative design and construction of nanoprobes. Due to the unique properties at the nanoscale, including the mimetic enzyme activity, the characteristic plasma resonance spectrum and so on, nanomaterials exhibit great potential in the development of novel LFIA and high\u2010sensitivity detection.\n## Nanoparticles in LFIA\nrganic fluorescent dyes are capable of emitting fluorescence when stimulated by exciting light. In addition to monomer form, dyes are often doped in polymer nanocarriers or immobilized on the surface of carriers before combining with antibodies to obtain higher fluorescence yield. Bamrungsap et al. doped dye Cy5 into silica nanoparticles for the detection of an influenza antigen, proving an eightfold better sensitivity than the commercial colorbased LFIA kit. [14] Quantum dots (QDs) make up for some inherent defects of organic fluorescent dyes due to their sharp emission peaks, strong signal intensity, low background, and photostability. It is reported that single QDs have longer fluorescence lifetime and 10-20 times higher signal strength than organic fluorescent dyes. [15] Besides, multiple separated emission peaks can be obtained under the same excitation wavelength of different QDs, which is particularly suitable for simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers. [16] [19][20] Semiconducting polymer dots have the advantages of biocompatibility, luminescent property, and surface activity, thus, developing rapidly in recent years.

Among the innovative agents used to enhance optical imaging (figure 5), fluorescent nanoparticles such as quantum dots have garnered significant attention. Quantum dots, which are semiconductor nanoparticles typically measuring between 2 and 10 nanometers, exhibit unique optical properties, including size-tunable fluorescence and exceptional photostability. These properties allow quantum dots to emit bright, stable signals over extended imaging periods, providing superior contrast and clarity in detecting microscopic tumor deposits that might be missed by traditional imaging techniques (Gao, 2004). Unlike conventional organic dyes, quantum dots also offer broad excitation and narrow emission spectra, allowing for multiplexed imaging-simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers in a single scan, which is invaluable for mapping tumor heterogeneity (Smith et al., 2006). (Lee et al., 2022) Other types of fluorescent nanoparticles, such as dyedoped silica nanoparticles, have been developed to improve biocompatibility and minimize toxicity, addressing one of the primary concerns associated with quantum dots, particularly those containing cadmium. These silica-based nanoparticles can be loaded with organic dyes to produce intense fluorescence and can be functionalized with targeting ligands, enhancing their accumulation in tumor tissues (Medintz et al., 2005). Functionalization with targeting molecules such as antibodies or peptides allows these nanoparticles to specifically bind to cancer cell biomarkers, increasing imaging specificity and enabling early detection of tumors at the cellular level (Jiang et al., 2008). This targeted approach enhances the capacity for precise tumor localization and may assist in real-time surgical guidance, as it allows clinicians to delineate tumor margins with high accuracy. \n\nThe application of fluorescent nanoparticles in detecting micro-sized tumors has shown promise in preclinical and clinical research, potentially transforming early-stage cancer diagnostics. Their ability to detect tumors smaller than 1 millimeter offers substantial benefits in identifying cancers when they are most treatable, improving the likelihood of successful intervention (Gao, 2004).",

(Lee et al., 2022) Other types of fluorescent nanoparticles, such as dyedoped silica nanoparticles, have been developed to improve biocompatibility and minimize toxicity, addressing one of the primary concerns associated with quantum dots, particularly those containing cadmium. These silica-based nanoparticles can be loaded with organic dyes to produce intense fluorescence and can be functionalized with targeting ligands, enhancing their accumulation in tumor tissues (Medintz et al., 2005). Functionalization with targeting molecules such as antibodies or peptides allows these nanoparticles to specifically bind to cancer cell biomarkers, increasing imaging specificity and enabling early detection of tumors at the cellular level (Jiang et al., 2008). This targeted approach enhances the capacity for precise tumor localization and may assist in real-time surgical guidance, as it allows clinicians to delineate tumor margins with high accuracy. \n\nThe application of fluorescent nanoparticles in detecting micro-sized tumors has shown promise in preclinical and clinical research, potentially transforming early-stage cancer diagnostics. Their ability to detect tumors smaller than 1 millimeter offers substantial benefits in identifying cancers when they are most treatable, improving the likelihood of successful intervention (Gao, 2004).",

            "text": "In addition, BLZ-100 was translated into the clinic and it is currently undergoing evaluation in Phase I clinical trials in adult patients with glioma (NCT02234297). Furthermore, this probe has been clinically evaluated for adult skin cancer (NCT02097875), sarcoma (NCT024643320), and for pediatric patients with central nervous system tumors (NCT02462629) [73]. \n\nOther promising fluorescence-based imaging probes developed for tumors detection are quantum dots (QDs). QDs can provide images across large ranges of wavelengths and have high quantum yields [74]. Unlike organic dyes, which often suffer rapid photo-bleaching [75,76], QDs are composed of semiconducting metals (e.g., Cd, Zn, Se, In, P, and As) that are resistant to photo-bleaching [77]. \n\nFurthermore, the quantum properties of QDs are tunable and can provide excitation/emission wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to NIR. The outer shell of the QD could be modified by organic layers including PEG polymers, phospholipids, and peptides [78], thus preventing nonspecific absorption of proteins to their surface, increase blood half-life, and reducing toxicity [79,80]. CTX conjugated with cadmium-free silver-indium-sulfide (Ag-In-S or AIS) chalcopyrite QDs was used in cellular imaging studies [47]. This CTX-conjugated QD-micelles exhibited specific internalization into U-87 brain tumor cells. Although QDs offer potentially valuable benefits in preclinical oncology, such as drug targeting and in vivo biomedical imaging, under certain conditions, they pose risks to human health and the environment, constituting a barrier for their translation to clinical use [81]. Semiconducting polymer dots have aroused extensive interests as a novel family of fluorescent probes for tumor targeting applications [54,61]. Unlike QDs, polymer-based dots were developed from biologically non-toxic materials, using deep-red photo-acceptors and visible-light photo-donors.",

Like quantum dots (QDs), SPNs have large absorption coefficients, high photostability, a tunable size, and optical parameters [76]. However, a higher biocompatibility distinguishes SPNs from QDs. SPNs exhibit a large range of quantum yield due to factors inherent to their structure, including size and morphology and chemical composition, as well as external factors such as solvent polarity and temperature. SPNs may be adapted for NIR-II fluorescence or PA imaging [41]. \n\nRelatively few SPNs have been engineered toward NIR-II fluorescence imaging as small-molecule fluorophores in NIR-II fluorescence imaging are limited by low fluorescence quantum yields. However, Hong et al. synthesized a polymer fluorophore to emit in the NIR-II window-the first to do so [29]. The polymer, pegylated and composed of poly (benzo [1,2-b: 3,4-b0] difuran-alt-fluorothieno-[3,4-b] thiophene) (named 'pDA'), has a fluorescence quantum yield of 1.7% and is tuned to an emission peak of 1040 nm. This enabled the real-time tracking of arterial blood flow in the mouse at 25 frames per second in the NIR-II window. In a separate study, an advanced imaging technique called optical resolution photoacoustic microscopy (ORPAMI) was employed along with bright nearinfrared II (NIR-II)-conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CP NPs) to accurately identify tumor and cerebral tissue vasculatures [77]. \n\nThe generally high photothermal conversion efficiencies of SPNs are advantageous for PA imaging. Zhen et al. outlined a screening process to elucidate the relationship between SP molecular structure and PA properties [76].",

Alongside their applications in molecular electronics and photovoltaics, semiconducting polymers (SP) have in the last decade attracted attention for use in PAI. 6-9 Their extensive, highly delocalised \u03c0-conjugated backbones give SP a narrow band gap, facilitating photoexcitation and energy transfer and conferring excellent opto-electronic properties. Their organic composition also carries less potential for toxic degradation than their inorganic counterparts. The inherent hydrophobicity of SP allows them to be formulated into nanoparticles alongside oligomers and lipids, to form semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPN). These have large absorption coefficients, controllable sizes, adjustable absorption maxima, optical properties that are independent of particle size, and high photostability. The majority of reported SPN have been formed through the co-precipitation of lipids and SP, via either nano-precipitation 10 or mini-emulsion. 11 These techniques effectively encapsulate a waterinsoluble, conjugated polymer within a water-soluble, liposome-like construct. Amphiphilic SP can also undergo crystallisation-driven selfassembly in solution to form nanoparticles with a core-shell architecture, 12 and more recently microfluidic processing systems have been shown to enable large scale, high throughput production of uniform SPN. 13,14 Over the last decade, different SPN have been developed with a range of SP, liposomal formulations and PEGylation approaches, leading to nanoparticles with long in vivo lifetimes, good biodistribution profiles and maximum absorbance tuned to the NIR-I or NIR-II regions.",

            "text": "Semiconductive polymeric nanoparticles comprise the major part of organic nanoparticles that possess PA and fluorescence properties because they have NIR absorption property. In addition to their exceptional photostability and biocompatibility, semiconducting polymers possess distinct advantages over the other nanoparticles in PA applications [90]. Successful detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using polymeric nanoparticles as nanoprobes has demonstrated that, these nanoparticles can be an excellent tool for the diagnosis of disease conditions such as tumor metastasis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity and etc., that involves ROS guided/influenced pathophysiological events [87]. Similarly, quantum dots represents another group of multifunctional nanoparticles with significant potential in photothermal therapy (PTT) and has made them a promising candidate to be a PA contrast agent [90]. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) are microbubble contrast agents, that showed great potential in ultrasound/PA based therapies and stimuli responsive drug delivery, when they were coupled with plasmonic nanoparticles [96]. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based polymeric nanoparticles and their derivatives were aided in tumor imaging with more than fivefold of the background signal at 2 h of the nanoparticle injection [87,97]. Benzothiadiazole moiety amplified the PA signal provided by the nanoparticles by twofolds [98]. Apart from imaging application for diagnosis, PA image guided photothermal/photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) was also achieved using semiconducting polymeric nanoparticles (Fig. 4) [97,99].",

QDs offer excellent photostability and tunable emission spectra from the ultraviolet to the near infrared region, simply by modulating their size.

            "text": "Fluorescence imaging allows for visualization of real-time details at a cellular level. However, long-term imaging is difficult due to the poor light stability of organic fluorescent dyes. Graphene quantum dots are a good alternative solution. They have outstanding optical properties and unique structural features. Graphene quantum dots are loaded on the surface of NPs for example optical magneto ferroferric oxide@polypyrrole core-shell NPs. They have longer metabolic processes in blood. In vivo results show they are capable of monitoring the distribution and metabolism of NPs [81]. Mesoporous silica NPs with graphene quantum dots can simultaneously monitor real-time localization of the doxorubicin (DOX) carrier for proper drug targeting as a fluorescent imaging agent. The nanoplatform shows stable suspension and excitation-dependent photoluminescence. They also show pH and temperature-dependent release behaviour that can be utilized in theranostic applications. Their fluorescence properties make them suitable for optical imaging with minimal cytotoxicity [82]. Quantum dots offer superior optical characteristics compared to organic dyes. Their potential toxicity, however, limits their application. Topical administration can reduce toxicity. In vivo endoscopic imaging of human bladder cancer by topical administration of quantum dots conjugated to anti-CD47 was successful and showed no indication of acute toxicity up to 7 days after installation [83]. The molecular profile of most cancer varies greatly between patients as well as spatially and temporally within a single tumour mass. To account for such variance, multiplexed molecular imaging has high potential. Multiplexed molecular imaging enables multiplexed imaging of large panels of cancer biomarkers. Polymer dots can be used in multiplexed molecular imaging and utilizes semiconducting polymers with strong fluorescence. Studies show a 10-fold enhanced brightness of polymer dots over commercial fluorescent dyes. Quantum dots are fluorescent semiconductor NPs that typically contain group II-VI (e.g., CdSe and CdTe), III-V (e.g., InP and InAs), IV-VI (e.g., PbTe, PbSe), or I-III-VI (e.g., CuInS 2 ) elements.",

            "text": "shifted of the three. This can potentially be explained by the unique chemical structure of poly(phenylene vinylene) polymers relative to fluorene-based co-polymers. The distinct molecular structures of the conjugated polymers affect the final energy levels of the polymer dot species in their excited states. Specifically, CNPPV has a donor-\u03c0-acceptor arrangement whereas PFBT and PFPV have donor-acceptor and donor-\u03c0-donor configurations, respectively, which leads to differences in the energy levels of their three-photon transitions.\n\nFurthermore, we justify the use of polymer dots over conventional fluorophores for multiphoton imaging experiments in the 800 -900 nm excitation range due to their extraordinary brightness relative to quantum dots, organic dyes, and fluorescent proteins (Fig. S3). PFPV (~2.02\u00d710 5 GM) is brighter than MEH-PPV (~5.50\u00d710 4 GM) and their 2PA cross sections are one to two orders of magnitude larger than an expected range for quantum dots (~2\u00d710 3 to ~4.7\u00d710 4 GM). When compared to fluorescent dyes and proteins, polymer dot cross sections are three to five orders of magnitude larger. Most notably, this comparison includes organic molecules specifically engineered for enhanced two-photon absorption. 28,43 In particular, many fluorescent dyes can be problematic within in vivo biological settings due to a reduced quantum yield and poor photostability in aqueous environments. [13][14][15] In contrast, polymer dots composed of hydrophobic conjugated polymers are strongly resistant to this effect. 19 Of course, highly emissive quantum dots such as QD605 28 and QD535 27 do come close to matching a dimmer polymer dot such as MEH-PPV in brightness. Therefore, one might be tempted to employ quantum dots as their preferred class of contrast agents due to their well-regarded photostability and spectrally broad light absorption, an essential feature for multicolor imaging experiments. However, polymer dots share these same properties 20 as well as the critical advantage of exhibiting no evidence of cytotoxicity. There are conflicting reports regarding quantum dot biocompatibility which can most likely be attributed to physiochemical and environmental factors;",

            "text": "Optical microscopy and detection methods, which employ a wide variety of non-invasive optical techniques, are fundamental to understanding the structural, organizational, and dynamic properties of biological systems. Among those optical detection modalities, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry are particularly important because they facilitate highly sensitive and specific imaging and detection. Fluorescent nanoparticles are becoming increasingly popular in biomedical imaging and sensing. When functionalized with tagging molecules, such nanoparticles can be used for the detection and multiplexed imaging of specific (large) molecules, cells, and tissues [1][2][3][4][5][6]. A particular interest in such particles is in flow cytometry, a method that counts the number of fluorescent markers per an object of investigation, for example, cells, exosomes, and liposomes. \n\nSeveral groups are currently trying to develop such particles [7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. The most developed (and commercially available) fluorescent nanoparticles are quantum dots (QDs) [12][13][14][15]. Although excellent in many aspects, they still exhibit several problems, including potential toxicity, some fractions of non-fluorescent QDs, blinking, etc. [16]. Polymer dots [11,17,18], an organic version of QDs, are promising bright particles that are still under development and have a limited number of available semiconductor polymers. Biodegradation, long-term toxicity, and monodispersity of polymer dots still have to be investigated/improved. Solid dye-doped silica particles were used for a while [5] which are not that bright and require chemical modification of dye, which limits the number of available dyes and adds to the cost. \n\nUltrabright fluorescent nanoporous silica nanoparticles (Star-dots) are a new class of exceptionally bright fluorescent silica nanoparticles [19][20][21]. The brightness of such particles is substantially higher than the fluorescence of individual dye molecules (for example, the brightness of a 30 nm particle can be equivalent to the fluorescent brightness of 600-2000 encapsulated dye molecules [22]).",

            "text": "In addition, it is important to consider the fact that the biologically active molecules that are labeled with organic fluorophores usually belong to the class of small-molecular-weight compounds. Thus, despite low molecular weight of the organic dye, it can still affect not only bioavailability, but also biological properties of the labeled construct compared to the non-labeled biologically active molecule. \n\nThere is a broad spectrum of fluorescent NPs that are used in biological applications. Numerous materials have been applied as NPs: silica and organically modified silica; hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic polymers; semiconducting organic polymers; quantum dots (QDs); carbonaceous nanomaterials including carbon dots, carbon nanoclusters and nanotubes; upconversion materials (UCNPs); and others. Compared to FPs and organic dyes, the application of fluorescent NPs in biological systems is relatively new [42,43]. While the majority of available reports have almost exclusively focused on applications of QDs [44,45], UCNPs and C-dots are currently on the rise [46]. QDs are nano-sized (mostly 2-10 nm) inorganic crystals that are made of semiconducting materials (e.g., CdSe, CdTe, C or Si) and possess optical properties intermediate between those of bulk semiconductors and discrete molecules. QDs have wide excitation spectrum in the UV range, whereas their emission spectrum is narrow and depends on the diameter and shape of QD: smaller QDs fluoresce in blue-green wavelengths, while emission of larger QDs is red-shifted (Figure 2). The correlation between the size of QD and its emission spectrum, as well as large Stokes shift make QDs well applicable for the multi-color imaging. In addition, QDs are endowed with good photostability, which makes those suitable for performing repeated cycles of excitation and emission (see below). \n\nHowever, for attachment of ligands, it is necessary to functionalize surface of QDs, which may influence optical properties of the latter. Compared to organic dyes, few labeling protocols are available for QDs; it is also difficult to prognose the number of the biologically active molecules attached to one QD during the labeling procedure.",

            "text": "Optical imaging is a critical modality in cancer diagnostics, particularly advantageous for visualizing microsized tumors due to its high resolution and sensitivity. Among the innovative agents used to enhance optical imaging (figure 5), fluorescent nanoparticles such as quantum dots have garnered significant attention. Quantum dots, which are semiconductor nanoparticles typically measuring between 2 and 10 nanometers, exhibit unique optical properties, including size-tunable fluorescence and exceptional photostability. These properties allow quantum dots to emit bright, stable signals over extended imaging periods, providing superior contrast and clarity in detecting microscopic tumor deposits that might be missed by traditional imaging techniques (Gao, 2004). Unlike conventional organic dyes, quantum dots also offer broad excitation and narrow emission spectra, allowing for multiplexed imaging-simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers in a single scan, which is invaluable for mapping tumor heterogeneity (Smith et al., 2006). (Lee et al., 2022) Other types of fluorescent nanoparticles, such as dyedoped silica nanoparticles, have been developed to improve biocompatibility and minimize toxicity, addressing one of the primary concerns associated with quantum dots, particularly those containing cadmium. These silica-based nanoparticles can be loaded with organic dyes to produce intense fluorescence and can be functionalized with targeting ligands, enhancing their accumulation in tumor tissues (Medintz et al., 2005). Functionalization with targeting molecules such as antibodies or peptides allows these nanoparticles to specifically bind to cancer cell biomarkers, increasing imaging specificity and enabling early detection of tumors at the cellular level (Jiang et al., 2008). This targeted approach enhances the capacity for precise tumor localization and may assist in real-time surgical guidance, as it allows clinicians to delineate tumor margins with high accuracy. \n\nThe application of fluorescent nanoparticles in detecting micro-sized tumors has shown promise in preclinical and clinical research, potentially transforming early-stage cancer diagnostics. Their ability to detect tumors smaller than 1 millimeter offers substantial benefits in identifying cancers when they are most treatable, improving the likelihood of successful intervention (Gao, 2004).",

            "text": "][3] To achieve desired signal output and high signal-to-noise ratio, a variety of fluorescent probes based on both discrete molecules and colloidal nanoparticles have been explored. While discrete small molecules (e.g. fluorescent proteins and organic dyes) have good biocompatibility and small sizes that are ideal for intracellular target labeling, 4,5 fluorescent nanoparticles have advantages of good photostability and easy surface functionalization, which have attracted increasing attention in biomedical research. 6 ][9][10][11][12][13] Each class of these fluorescent nanomaterials have shown their distinct advantages. For instance, inorganic quantum dots have excellent photostability with narrow emission, which are ideal candidates for multiplex imaging. 8 Metallic nanoclusters have subnanometer dimensions and low cytotoxicity, 9,14 while up-conversion nanoparticles produce visible emission upon excitation with nearinfrared (NIR) laser that benefits deep tissue imaging. 10 For organic nanomaterials, carbonaceous dots are toxic-free and are promising alternatives to traditional inorganic quantum dots. 11 ombinations of organic and inorganic components, such as dyedoped or dye-decorated silica nanoparticles, often show improved photostability and higher brightness as compared to discrete dye molecules. 12,15 As fluorescent nanomaterials containing inorganic elements face the challenge of non-biodegradability in living bodies, organic nanoparticles with organic emitters as the fluorescent core and biocompatible/biodegradable polymers as the encapsulation matrix have emerged as a new generation of promising probes for in vivo applications. \n\nTo date, the most popular organic emitters are small molecule dyes that are rich in variety. 16,17 The emission of these dyes, however, is often weakened or even annihilated in aggregates, which is known as aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ). 18 This phenomenon is even more serious for dyes with emission in the far-red/near-infrared (FR/NIR) tissue-transparency window. The elongated conjugation with large aromatic rings favors strong p-p interaction to quench the fluorescence. 19",

A growing number of studies have shown that the preferential extravasation capacity of 10~150 nm nanoparticles can preferentially accumulate in tumor tissue, as the tight junctions between endothelial cells in new blood vessels in tumors do not form properly, this form of passive nanoparticle entry into the tumor microenvironment is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. In addition to being specific to tumor tissue, these nanoparticle probes also usually exhibit long circulation times, as well as low toxicity to nearby healthy tissue, allowing them to be used for imaging and diagnosing cancer in vivo. \n\nQuantum dots (QDs) are nanometer-size luminescent semiconductor crystals (2~100 nm) characterized by obvious photostability, tunable emission, and high quantum yield, contributing to their wide application in tumor tissue imaging through passive accumulation dependent on the EPR effect. Compared with organic dye molecules, one of the more exclusive properties of QDs is the bright fluorescence and high photochemical endurance, which renders them optimal fluorophores for biomedical imaging (39). Near-infrared (NIR)-emitting QDs, which exhibit high molar excitation coefficients, are particularly well-suited for in vivo whole-body imaging techniques because NIR light penetrates the body more deeply than light in the visible spectrum. Researchers have also applied AuNPs to in vivo tumor imaging through passive targeting. Lai et al. reported that mercaptoundecanoic acidcoated AuNPs could identify and track cancer cells at the inoculation sites in mice. Furthermore, these particles detected tumor-associated microvasculature in detail. In some cases, chitosan nanoparticles have been used for in vivo imaging through the EPR effect (40).

The nanoparticles actively being pursued include quantum dots (QDs) [1,2], nanotubes [3], nanowires [4], nanoshells [5], and many others [6][7][8][9]. Among these, QDs are the most widely studied and have many potential clinical applications.\n\nOrganic fluorophores and dyes have been historically used to label cells and tissues for both in vitro and in vivo imaging [10]. However, due to their inherent photophysical properties such as low photobleaching thresholds, broad absorption/emission spectra, and small Stokes shifts, their use is limited and they are not ideal agents for multiplexing, long-term, or real-time imaging. On the other hand, QDs are inorganic fluorescent semiconductor nanoparticles with superior optical properties compared with organic fluorophores [11,12]. QDs have unique size-and composition-dependent optical and electrical properties due to quantum confinement, hence their commonly used name of quantum dots [13,14]. QDs have many desirable properties for biological imaging, such as high quantum yields, high molar extinction coefficients (1-2 orders of magnitude higher than organic dyes), strong",

            "text": "In recent years, nanomaterials with size of 1-100 nm have developed rapidly in the field of biomedicine [1]. There are many types of nanoparticles, including quantum dots (QDs) [2][3][4], silicon nanoparticles [5,6], metal nanoclusters [7], etc. Quantum dots are a semiconductor material [8] whose internal electrons are restricted in all directions, resulting in a discontinuous electronic-energy-level structure. Quantum dots demonstrate characteristics of wide absorption range, narrow emission peak width, and excellent photostability and brightness [9]. However, the inherent heavy metal toxicity and complex preparation methods of quantum dots greatly limit the further application of these nanomaterials in in vivo imaging and clinical translation. To solve these limitations, various types of nanomaterials were developed, including semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots). Pdots are nanoparticles formed with semiconducting polymers by methods such as nanoprecipitation or microemulsion. Semiconducting polymers are macromolecular compounds with large \u03c0-conjugated backbones and delocalized electronic structures [10]. Since Pdots have a conjugated framework and a large number of \u03c0-\u03c0 bonds, Pdots have strong light-harvesting ability, high fluorescence quantum yield, and easy electron and energy transfer in the conjugated framework [11]. Pdots also have the characteristics of excellent photostability, structural diversity, functional designability, and easy surface modification [12]. These outstanding properties ensured that Pdots could be widely used in the biomedical field, including bioimaging, biosensors, tumor therapy, etc. For instance, Day et al. synthesized a multimodal combination of Pdots containing a heat shock protein inhibitor and azo compound for triple-negative breast cancer [13].Wu et al. designed a silica nanoparticle coated with catalase to treat glioblastoma through chemodynamic therapy and sound dynamic therapy [6]. Deng et al. synthesized a manganese-loaded fluoride nanoparticle for MRI and chemodynamic treatment of tumors [14].",

Due to their high quantum yields, QDs are helpful in the detection of materials with low abundance. However, to enhance QD electrical characteristics, Pang et al. [52] hybridized ZnO NDs and g-C3N4 QDs to afford higher photoelectron transfer and separation efficiency. Due to the outstanding advantages, ZnO NDs and g-C3N4 QDs enjoyed the extended application, and a photocatalyzed renewable self-powered cytosensing device was presented on the basis of ZnO NDs@g-C3N4 QDs. Through conjugation to the membrane PTK7-specific aptamer Sgc8c, the device was used to detect CCRF-CEM cells (human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells), which express PTK7. The results showed that the device offers better performance in terms of detection range, detection limit, selectivity, and reproducibility. It captured only CCRF-CEM cells (500 cell/mL) and no other cell types, such as HL-60, K562, and HeLa cells. The authors think that the device could be an effective platform for monitoring the progression of leukemia and shows great promise. \n\nPolymer nanoparticles derived from various conductive hydrophobic polymers have been applied to produce nanoparticles with high quantum yields, photostability and that are nontoxic. Therefore, PD is ideal for CTC detection. Wu et al. [66] reported a strategy for semiconducting polymer dots (PDs) functionalization through entrapment of heterogeneous polymer chains into a single dot, which was facilitated by hydrophobic interactions, during nanoparticle formation. A few amphiphilic polymers with functional groups for subsequent covalent conjugation of biomolecules, such as streptavidin and immunoglobulin G (IgG), show co-condensation with most semiconducting polymers for modification and functionalization of a nanoparticle surface.",

Some other organic fluorophores including cyanine dyes, squaraine dyes and phthalocyanines derivatives that function in the near infrared (NIR) region have also been extensively used for the non-invasively monitoring of gene expression [11], in vivo cell trafficking [12], enzyme activities identification [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21], early stage of disease screening and new drug development [22,23] in vitro and in living subjects, mostly attributed to their promising advantages of reduced light scattering, high tissue penetration and relatively minimal auto-fluorescence from biological samples. However, despite the widely accepted utility of these NIR organic fluorophores in fluorescent imaging, most of the dye molecules indicated limited quantum yield, poor photostability, a short lifetime and less Stokes shift in aqueous solution [17][18][19][20][21]. Therefore, the development of alternative long emission materials with improved photo-physical properties will be still highly required.\n\nIn recent decades, the disciplines of nanomedicine and diagnostic imaging have attracted considerable academic and industry attentions, in which real-time imaging has shown to be particularly valuable for investigating the aspects, including target specificity, pharmacokinetic profiles and bio-distribution, as well as to assess the therapeutic effects of nanoparticle conjugates [15]. One of the most extensively studied nanomaterials for optical imaging applications are quantum dots (QDs) [24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. QDs are mono-dispersing inorganic fluorescent nano-crystalline particles made from semiconductor materials with numerous superior optical properties when compared to those of organic fluorophores [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21], such as high quantum yields, high molar extinction coefficients, long",

            "text": "After the injection, is required a tool to detect the actual biodistribution of the nanoparticles. \n\nIn this context, imaging is one of the most exploited techniques in order to find out the path of nanoparticles following injection into the bloodstream. \n\nTo ensure that nanoparticles effectively reach their planned target, such as a tumor, and to assess their interaction with the immune system, precise tracking and characterization methods are essential. Ma and coworkers have synthesized nanoparticles based on tetraphenylethylene and NIPAM, designed as lysosome-specific fluorescent probes for bioimaging, demonstrating low cytotoxicity, high specificity and excellent resistance to photobleaching. [156] One straightforward method for tracking nanoparticles is labelling them with radioactive tracers. [157] his approach allows for detection using imaging techniques such as scintigraphy, which provides information on the distribution and localization of the nanoparticles within the body. Additionally, recent advancements in imaging have significantly benefited from the development of quantum dots, representing cutting-edge nanotechnology that offers superior imaging capabilities compared to traditional organic dyes. The stability of quantum dots is attributed to their inorganic nature, which prevents the rapid degradation seen with organic dyes. Nanoscale quantum dots, typically ranging from 2 to 50 nm in diameter, emit light that changes from blue to red as their size increases. This size-dependent emission allows for multiplexing in imaging studies, where multiple quantum dots with different emission wavelengths can be used simultaneously to track various nanoparticles or biological processes. [158] Quantum dots photostability further enhances their utility in vivo imaging studies as they can remain fluorescent for months, providing continuous and reliable tracking of nanoparticles over extended periods. In particular, it has developed and produced a new class of thermo-responsive semiconducting polymer nanoparticles designed for high-contrast photoacoustic imaging of tumors. These advanced agents are built from semiconducting polymer brushes featuring poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide)-r-(hydroxypropyl acrylate) (PDMA-r-HPA) grafts. [159]",

Nanomaterials are currently being used in a number of applications, including textiles, cleaning products, sport equipments, biomedicine, and cosmetics [1]. While the potential benefits of nanotechnology have been widely reported, little is known about the potential toxicity of nanomaterials [2]. The increasing use of nanoparticles in consumer products and medical applications underlies the importance of understanding any toxic effects to humans and the environment that have raised concerns over the years.\n\nAmong various nanomaterials, quantum dots (QDs) distinguish themselves in their far-reaching possibilities in many avenues of biomedicine. QDs are nanometersized fluorescent semiconductor crystals with unique photochemical and photophysical properties. Their much greater brightness, rock-solid photostability and unique capabilities for multiplexing, combined with their intrinsic symmetric and narrow emission bands, have made them far better substitutes for organic dyes in existing diagnostic assays [3]. These properties, combined with the development of ways to solubilize QDs in solution and to conjugate them with biological molecules, have led to an explosive growth in their biomedical applications [4]. Bioconjugated QD fluorescent probes offer a promising and powerful imaging tool for cancer detection, diagnosis and treatment. Following the two seminal papers published on Science in 1998 demonstrating the feasibility of using QDs in biological environments [5,6], many new techniques have been developed during the last decade, utilizing the unique photophysical properties of QDs, for in vitro biomolecular profiling of cancer biomarkers, in vivo tumor imaging, and dual-functionality tumor-targeted imaging and drug delivery [7].\n\nEarly detection of cancer and targeted drug delivery remain the primary challenges to the cancer research community. In many cases, the malignancy of tumors is detected only at advanced stages when high dose of chemotherapeutic drugs are needed, which raises the cost of the therapy as well as the risk of side-effects. To mitigate this problem, early detection of tumors at their incipient stage and targeted drug delivery system 'pinpointing' cancer cells at the tumor site is the key.

Extensive work for the manipulation of gold at the nanoscale has recently led to the development of increasingly complex architectures with exotic shapes, which exploit sharp edges to red-shift their SPR absorption up to the NIR. 116,117 Quantum dots. Semiconducting nanoparticles (or quantum dots, QDs) have found extensive application as fluorescent probes due to their small size and interesting optical properties, which can be tuned to the NIR by choosing the appropriate particle size. Since their dimensions are close to or smaller than their exciton Bohr radius, the spatial confinement of the electrons in the nanostructure results in an increased gap between valence and conduction bands and in a size-dependent splitting of the continuous energy band into discrete energy levels. Semiconducting nanoparticles have shown great potential for use as contrast agents for optical imaging due to their relatively easy synthesis and functionalization and their tunable fluorescence properties (Fig. 6). [118][119][120] The applicability of QDs as photoacoustic imaging contrast agents is guaranteed by their high absorption cross-sections (as high as 106 M \u22121 cm \u22121 ), increased photostability after prolonged irradiation and quantum yield comparable with most small molecule dyes. 121 Thanks to QDs' optical properties, their in vivo applications have been widely explored in the literature, mostly focused on PA and fluorescence imaging. [122][123][124][125] However, still great effort needs to be directed towards the investigation of QD's pharmacokinetics (bioaccumulation, biodistribution, etc.) and toxicity before the application of these nanosystems in clinics.\n\nOther metals. Even though gold nanostructures represent the most widely investigated metallic cores as contrast media for PA imaging due to their unique optical properties and chemical inertness, other nanostructured metals have been recently exploited to image biological tissues.

            "text": "Generally, in semiconducting nanoparticles the electronic properties (e.g., band gap) depend on their size. This is especially obvious for fluorescent nanoparticles, for which the wavelength of fluorescence varies with size. Such fluorescent nanoparticles are called quantum dots (QDs). They possess often a high fluorescence efficiency. So, they are attractive as chromophores in LEDs. Thus recently, quantum dot based light emitting diodes (QLEDs) became competitive alternatives to organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) in terms of colour purity, luminescence intensities, and external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) [121][122][123] The narrow emission profile, the high stability of quantum dots (QDs), the high photoluminescence quantum yields (PL QYs), and the easily tunable emission wavelengths make them attractive as quantum dot LEDs (QLED) [124]. By understanding the basic device physics and optimizing the device structure it was possible to improve the device performance and efficiency of QLEDs, so much that they can be compared to organic LEDs [122,[125][126][127][128][129][130][131][132][133]. For this study semiconducting polymer hybrids QD, which allow a homogeneous dispersion in the matrix of a semiconducting polymer and an efficient charge transport into the QDs were very helpful [116,[134][135][136].\n\nChemical structures of a combination of semiconducting polymers and QDs are presented in Figure 10. The strong affinity between the surface of the inorganic part and the anchoring block of the polymers leads to a dense coating of the QDs and this allows a good dispersion (uniform distribution) within the semiconducting polymer matrix (Figure 11a). In addition to that the electro-luminescence observed in such hybrid systems is that of the pure QD (Figure 11b). This proves that all excimers formed from the positive and negative charges in the polymer matrix reach the QD for emission. With these systems it becomes possible to study the influence of the morphology of hybrid emission layers (e.",

These lead researchers to search for new alternatives. 4,7 Semiconductor quantum dots (SQDs) have attracted much attention for their serving as probes in cell imaging and other biomedical applications. Compared to conventionally used organic dyes, SQDs have unique photophysical properties such as tunable emission wavelengths, large molar extinction coefficient and quantum efficiencies. 3][14] In addition, the \ue104uorescence blinking in single SQDs, is harmful for dynamic tracking due to information loss. 15,16 lternatively, during the last decade studying the photophysics of carbon dots (C-dots) as a new class of nanoparticles became a target for many research groups [17][18][19] due to their biocompatibility, 20 low toxicity, 21 water solubility 22 and high quantum yield. 18,20,22 ][29] Therefore, C-dots have huge potential as a new generation of luminescent materials superior to conventionally used \ue104uorescent organic dyes or inorganic semiconductor quantum dots (SQDs). 30,31 The existence of many hydroxyl and/or carboxyl moieties on their surface facilitates their surface functionalization with various organic, polymeric, inorganic, or biological species. 32,33 This could in\ue104uence their \ue104uorescence properties. 27,33 Furthermore, C-dots have non-blinking characteristics, which allow single-molecule tracking compared to SQDs. 20,22,34 ][37][38][39][40] Plasmonic nanoparticles (i.e. 2][43] By controlling their particle size and shape let them have the capability of tuning their optical and electronic properties. 44 The optical properties of metallic nanoparticles are originated by the collective oscillation of conduction electrons that resulted from their interaction with electromagnetic radiation (i.e.",

            "text": "Today, cancer mortality is one of the most common causes of death. The application of nanotechnology in medicine includes six areas including 1) detection of molecular changes in diseases; 2) diagnosis and imaging; 3) drug delivery; 4) combined therapeutic and diagnostic applications; 5) report of therapeutic agent efficacy; and 6) nanotechnology applications in scientific discovery and basic research (56). A variety of nanostructures from organic and inorganic materials have been recently used for cancer therapy and diagnosis in passive or active tumor targeting. A novel formulation of nanovesicles, liposomes, polymeric micelles, dendrimers, and polymeric nanoparticles can enter into the solid tumor site through the porous structure of a tumor vascular system, and then, selectively deliver the therapeutic agents (57,58). Nanomaterials with proper targeting ligands could bind to antigens or receptors on the target cells. However, this powerful technology leads to a decreased toxicity in non-targeted cells, and therefore, the distribution of nanomaterials will be increased in the target cells (59). Some of the nanomaterials shown in Table 2 (60-73) such as semiconducting nanoparticles or quantum dots (QDs), colloidal nanoparticles, dendrimers, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs), and liposomal nanoparticles systems have been constructed for utilization in therapeutic applications. Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconducting nanoparticles with the diameter ranging from 2\u223c10 nm, narrow emission and broad absorption profile, high photostability, long fluorescence lifespan, ability to be conjugated with proteins (74). Also, QDs have the potential of applications in molecular and cellular labelling, cell tracking, drug delivery and also, cancer detection and therapy (75,76). Dendrimers are highly branched synthetic polymers (about 1.5\u223c13.5 nm) (77,78) that have attracted considerable attention because of their hyper-branched structure, monodispersity, functional surface groups, and symmetrical conformation (79).",

            "text": "Luminescent semiconducting polymer dots-Semiconductor polymer dots (Pdots) have rapidly garnered interest as an alternative to semiconductor quantum dots and fluorescent dyes in nanoscale fluorescence imaging and sensing applications [1]. Pdots are nanoparticles ranging from 10 to 100 nm in diameter. They are primarily composed of a semiconducting polymer and additives to enable their aqueous solubility and unique emission properties [2]. When synthesized with no dopant dyes, the formed Pdots largely retain the optical properties of the bulk semiconducting polymer, with decreased quantum yield and the appearance of a red emission tail being the only noticeable differences. Luminescent Pdots are characterized with low batch-to-batch variance in emission properties. This is in contrast to the high variance in emission properties often observed with other semiconductor luminescent nanoparticles like inorganic quantum dots. Pdots have several desirable properties that make them attractive alternatives to other luminescent nanoparticles. The high brightness of Pdots is owed to their fast emissive rates and large extinction coefficients [3]. Since each monomer with the polymer chain is capable of absorbing incident light, the high concentration of chromophores in Pdots gives them extinction coefficients an order of magnitude higher than luminescent quantum dots and two orders of magnitude greater than organic dyes [4]. Furthermore, Pdots are highly resistant to photobleaching, which make them excellent candidates for fluorescence imaging and sensing applications [1]. Recent advancements in polymer design have produced drastic enhancements in quantum yield, up to 0.98 [5]. Finally, Pdots exhibit minimal or no cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells which distinguish them from heavy metal, cadmium and lead containing quantum dots [6]. \n\nPolymer Dot Synthesis-One of the greatest advantages of Pdots is their low-cost, facile synthesis. Although there are several methods by which to prepare Pdots, the one that produces the smallest Pdots and is most commonly used is the nanoprecipitation method [7]. A schematic diagram which describes the nanoprecipitation used in our laboratory and others to form near infrared highly emitting dye-doped Pdots is shown in Scheme 1.",

In the past, luminous quantum dots (QDs) and commercial organic dyes have been used as FL imaging contrast agents. Although quantum dots have good photostability, they contain heavy metals and have potential biological toxicity. 26 Commercially available organic dyes, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), porphyrin and Nile Red, have good biocompatibility and high emission efficiency. However, these organic dyes suffer from low fluorescence quantum yield or even fluorescence quenching at high concentrations or in the solid-state due to the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect. 27,28 Recently, a new kind of organic dye with AIE characteristics has received much attention owing to its high photochemical stability and quantum yield at high concentrations or in the aggregated state. 29 In recent years, a large variety of AIE-based bioprobes with MR imaging functions have been developed for biomedical imaging, diagnosis, and therapy. 30 Liu et al prepared magnetic-fluorescent dual-modality probes based on gadolinium-functionalized AIE dots for cancer metastasis studies. 31 Tong and her coworkers synthesized a novel tetraphenylethene (TPE) derivative containing Gd (TPE-2Gd). These contrast agents have AIE characteristics, excellent longitudinal relaxivity in water and a long circulation lifetime for high-resolution images. 32 Hu et al developed theranostic nanoparticles with MR/FL dual-modal imaging diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities by integrating TPE, DOTA (Gd) MR imaging contrast agents and camptothecin (CPT) in one system. After conjugating with tumor-targeting peptides, the theranostic nanoparticles showed better tumor accumulation and MR imaging performance. 33 It should be noted that many AIE dyes that have been used in MR/FL dual-modal probe systems are blue or green emitters. These AIE dyes have limited tissue penetration depth and autofluorescence interference. To overcome these problems, AIE dye with emission in the near-infrared region has been used to develop near-infrared MR/FL dual-",

            "text": "Polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) have found application in drug delivery due to their high biocompatibility and their ability to encapsulate and protect in their interiors drugs, dyes, proteins, etc. 154 In photoacoustic imaging, the most popular polymeric structures contain either conjugated polymers (CPs) or porphyrin-related units capable of directly interacting with NIR light thanks to their elevated \u03c0-conjugation spread throughout the whole polymer chains. 155 CPs are often referred to as semiconducting polymers (SPs), since their incredibly high conjugation degrees cause the formation of band structures and a massive shrinking in the gap between the \u03c0 and \u03c0* bands, which resembles the features of most inorganic semiconductors. 156 By means of microemulsion or nanoprecipitation, CPs are able to self-assemble into nanostructures which are stable and well dispersible in water, known as conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) or semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). Although their extinction coefficients are still lower than the ones of AuNPs and their absorption peak is broad, their high photostability and chemical versatility allow for both specific targeting and attachment of therapeutic moieties. CPs are macromolecules with a conjugated \u03c0-system spread throughout the polymeric backbone, and the polymers are densely packed to form nanoparticles with much stronger extinction coefficient and higher photostability compared with small molecule dyes. Optical properties, strictly connected to the polymeric core, can be tuned via modification of the polymeric backbone, combination of different polymers and control over aggregation and surface functionalization. [157][158][159][160] Because this class of contrast agents is still relatively young, detailed biocompatibility studies aimed at showing their potential for preclinical photoacoustic imaging still need to be conducted. [161][162][163][164][165][166][167] Principally, semiconducting polymers employed for PA imaging are composed of diketopyrrolopyrrole, phenothiazine, cyclopentadithiophene, fluorene, pyrrole or thio",

            "text": "Moreover, QDs allow imaging of deeper tissues and is also used to image lymph nodes and blood vessels in tissues. A key property for in vivo imaging is the unusual QD Stokes shift (measured by the distance between excitation and emission peaks), which can be as large as 300-400nm depending on the wavelength of the excitation light, which can be used to further improve the detection sensitivity. Organic dye signals with a small stoke shift are often buried by strong tissue autofluorescene, whereas QD signal with large Stokes shift are clearly detectable above the background. Unlike traditional dyes which usually show a broad emission band, QDs exhibit narrow sharp emission peaks and broadband absorption, which are ideal for multiplexed multicolor imaging. QDs are thus able to increase the number of labels that can be used simultaneously in a single system. The effective brightness per probe particle is also superior with quantum dots as evidenced by their large molar absorption crosssections which are a consequence of their nanometer size and composition. Different from \"soft\" organic nanoparticles (e.g., polymers, micelles, liposomes), inorganic nanomaterials with rigid cores usually show inefficient extravasation inside tumors. A number of reports suggest that QDs tend to stay within the tumor vasculatures without getting into the interstitial space or tumor cells, reducing the nonspecific tumor cell labeling in angiogenesis imaging (Liu and Peng 2010). The long term photostability and superior brightness of QDs make them appealing for live animal targeting and imaging. These properties have made QDs a topic of intensive interest in cancer biology, molecular imaging, and molecular profiling. The ability to functionalize as well as control the surface of quantum dots with specific linkers and multi-functional molecules is critical for nanoparticle-based gene therapy. Currently, QDs are used both as a transfection vector as well as a fluorescence label in RNA interference research. Quantum dot conjugates have been successfully used for targeted silencing of bcr/abl gene by RNA interference in human myelogenous leukemia K562 cells (Zhao et al. 2010).",

The advantages of SPNs are numerous and include large absorption coefficient, tunable absorption, high photostability, low toxicity, 86 high structural flexibility, small size, and higher PA signal generation than single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and AuNRs. 210 As an imaging probe to localize specific diseases or tissues, SPNs can produce PA signals in the sites of interest, relying on simple accumulation via the retention effect or receptor binding on the cell surface. This strategy leads to the application of LN mapping, 210 in vivo tumor-targeted imaging, [211][212][213] cell tracking, 214 and ROS mapping. 134 For example, SPN with poly as cyclopentadithiophene-altbenzothiadiazole showed a maximum NIR-I absorption at 660 nm and maximum PA signals at 690 nm, and it was used as PAI probes for lymphatic imaging. 210 Another recently reported SPNs, which was fabricated into water-dispersed NPs, showed strong absorption in the NIR-II window and efficient cellular uptake, leading to effective accumulation in subcutaneous tumors and brain tumors. 212 ther than the simple accumulation of agents, SPNs also can be employed as activable PA probes with biomarker-triggered signals, which offer measurable and quantifiable real-time information on pathological status at the molecular level. Such smart PA probes have been used for in vivo imaging of a variety of biomarkers and biological metabolites in recent years, including abnormal pH, 215 different ROS imaging (such as ONOO \u2212 and CLO \u2212 level, 134,210 O2 \u2022\u2212 level 216 ), and granzyme B. 104 The reader can refer to Ref. 104 for more details on activatable SP nanoprobe (SPNP), which was reported as a biomarker to detect granzyme B in the tumors of living mice. Granzyme B can be considered to be a signature of immune activation due to elevated concentration in cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",

The properties are crucial for imaging in living animals, but they do not exist in other optical imaging probes such as organic dyes and metallic nanoparticles (such as QDs). When properly designed, single polymer dots might be able to show simultaneously capabilities of multi-modal imaging (such as chemi/bioluminescence, photoacoustic, MRI) and therapy (such as photothermal and photodynamic therapies), which will provide unprecedented simplicity in designing a single nanoparticle-based multimodality image-guided therapy agent. Polymer dots thus represent a multifunctional nanoplatform that facilitates preclinical investigation into physiological and pathological processes in living subjects. \n\nWhile polymer dots hold great promises for in vivo imaging, there are important issues that should be addressed before their advances towards potential clinical translations (for instance, the unspecific uptake in the skin and liver by the tail-vein injection). Strategies such as synthesis of a size smaller than the physiologic pore size of filtration slit in the glomerular capillary wall (5 nm) are effective in reducing the uptake in the organs and being rapidly cleared out through urinary excretion. In addition, potential leakage of doped dyes from the polymer dot matrix was initially a concern. More synthetic strategies such as incorporating NIR dyes into polymer backbones and side chains, introducing moieties to induce intramolecular and intermolecular energy transfer, are effective in shifting the emission of polymer dots to the NIR region. Thereby, new chemistry for preparation of ultrasmall, biodegradable and high-performance NIR-emitting polymer dots is highly demanded for their advances towards potential clinical applications.",

            "text": "For example, croconaine-loaded NPs, which were reported by Li et al., have shown high contrast in PAI, enabling a real time monitoring of NPs accumulation within the tumor [115]. Furthermore, the authors used croconaines with different adsorption wavelength to compare the accumulation of targeted and untargeted NPs; the irradiation of the particles with the 808 nm laser set at 1.0 W determined a photothermal conversion of 30  C upon irradiation with 0.8 W/cm 2 for 5 min at 808 nm. The system was encapsulated within cancer cell membrane to improve the targeting to the tumor tissue upon intravenous administration [117]. Semiconducting polymeric NPs are characterized by a photoactivable semiconducting polymeric core, which allows PTT, as well as PA or fluorescent imaging of tumors [118]. \n\nThe main advantage of semiconducting polymeric NPs over other organic NPs for PTT is the presence of the photoactivator in the polymer, which is then precipitated into particles, compared to the loading of a molecule like indocyanine. Furthermore, the structure of the semiconducting polymeric NPs can be easily engineered in the backbone to introduce donor-acceptors to shift the absorption from NIR I to NIR II window, with enhanced efficacy vs. lower fluence of the laser and higher safety of the treatment [109,118]. Duan et al. recently reported a modification of two isoindigo-based semiconducting polymeric NPs (identified as PBFT-DIID) to present a strong absorption between 700 and 1000 nm, correlated with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 70.6%, with a concentration dependent increase in the temperature up to 60 \u2022 within 5 min of laser irradiation at 0.5 W/cm 2 , and stable photoactivation in 5 repeated irradiation cycles, correlated with a complete tumor eradication in 4T1 subcutaneous tumor model after 6 min exposure to 0.8 W/cm 2 over the tumor area [119]. Organic nanosystems present lower toxicity compared to the inorganic ones.",

            "text": "Therefore, QDs composed of less toxic semiconducting nanocrystals (e.g., indium phosphide and silicon) have attracted considerable attention as bright and biocompatible probes for fluorescence bioimaging [98]. In addition to lowtoxicity QDs, polymer dots based on conjugated semiconducting polymers have been investigated as alternative fluorescent probes without considering the cytotoxicity caused by ionized heavy metals [99]. \n\nThese imaging modalities have various advantages and disadvantages. For instance, MRI, CT, and PET have high penetration depths, however, their spatial resolution is limited to the millimeter scale. In contrast, fluorescent imaging has high spatial resolution at the subcellular scale, however, its penetration depth is limited to a few centimeters. To benefit from each advantage, multimodal imaging has generated considerable research interest in increasing the accuracy of diagnosis using complementary information from different imaging modalities [100]. The fabrication of nanoparticulated imaging probes allows them to exhibit multifunctional characteristics; therefore, the strength of each imaging modality can be integrated into a multimodal nanoparticle. For instance, 64 Cu-labelled and RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptide-conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles were developed as PET/MR dual-modality imaging probes for tumor integrin expression, whereas the near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye ZW800 loaded with silica nanoparticles labelled with Gd ions and 64 Cu was developed as PET/MR/optical imaging probe for tumor-draining sentinel lymph nodes [100]. In addition to diagnostic imaging, these multifunctional nanoparticles can also serve to monitor therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment (theranostics) [101]. For example, croconaine dye-based nanoparticles were developed for photoacoustic/fluorescent imaging-guided photothermal therapy [102], while SPIO and olaparib-loaded exosome extracted from hypoxic cells was investigated for magnetic particle imaging and therapy of hypoxic region in tumor [103].",

Thus the development of novel \ue104uorescent probes is of vital importance for further improvement of many \ue104uorescence-based techniques. For in vivo biological applications, near-infrared (NIR) \ue104uorescent probes are highly desirable because of minimal auto-\ue104uorescence interference and high tissue-penetration depth in NIR region due to the weak absorption and scattering of biological species. [3][4][5] The most widely used NIR \ue104uorophores are small-molecule organic dyes (e.g., ICG, Cy7, Atto 740 and Alexa 750). 6 However, low brightness, small Stokes shi\ue09d and limited photostability of these NIR dyes are limiting factors for practical biological imaging applications.\n\nAmong the strides made in nanotechnology, inorganic semiconductor quantum dots (Qdots) with unique size-tunable emission were introduced to biological studies nearly 20 years ago as \ue104uorescent probes. [7][8][9] However, the release of heavy metal ions is a signi\ue103cant concern for living systems. Alternatively, organic dyes can be doped into nanoparticles such as silica and latex beads, [10][11][12][13] which exhibit improved brightness and photostability when compared with molecular dyes alone. In certain cases, nanoparticles with some size range and surface functional groups are promising for applications, such as for sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) mapping, because they have a long blood-circulation time. [14][15][16][17][18] However, the usefulness of dyeloaded nanoparticles is severely limited by the low \ue104uorophore concentration and possible dye leaching problems.\n\nSemiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) are emerging as organic \ue104uorescent nanoparticles with high brightness, large Stokes shi\ue09d, and intriguing energy-transfer properties.

They are especially in demand for in vivo imaging in animals and humans, owing to the transparency of tissues in this NIR wavelength region, providing cancer targeting and imaging. Recently, a breakthrough was achieved with produced chemically modified organic small-molecule cyanine dyes [20]. The wavelengths of light-absorbed and FL-emitted photons by these new dyes are shifted roughly 200 nm towards longer wavelengths, that is, towards an infrared region greater than 1000 nm. Imaging in this spectral range offers important benefits for in vivo applications compared with that in the far red regions [21]. \n\nQuantum dots (QDs): Semiconductor QDs are the nanoparticles that bridge the gap between individual atoms and bulk semiconductor materials [10].

This effect is known as quantum confinement (QC) and it is determined by the tough limitation of the free motion of electrons in a restricted number of dimensions. Schematic representation of the quantum confinement (QC) effect is shown in the Figure 2. \n\nCrystals 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 43 \n\nOrganic molecular dyes: FL compounds based on synthetic large molecules are powerful tools to visualize biological processes in living cells and organisms. Ever since the discovery of organic FL dyes in the late 19th century, efforts have been made to study the behavior of specific biomolecules in living systems by using these dyes as biolabels [16]. Many organic bright and photostable compounds such as fluorescein, rhodamine, coumarin, and many other dyes were developed. The FL spectra of these diverse visible molecular dyes supply labels for almost the entire visible and near-IR spectrum (Table 1, Figure 1a) [17]. Some of them were later employed for optical bioimaging as local FL labels and probes owing to their FL high quantum yield.",

Due to their advantages, such as single source excitation, narrow emission, high quantum yield, long fluorescence time and high photostability, bioconjugated-QDs have now replaced the conventionally used organic fluorescent dyes in various tumor targeting and imaging applications. The major problem associated with QDs is their toxicity and hydrophobicity, which hinders their applicability in biological systems and the biomedical field. These problems are overcome by using non-cadmium based QDs such as InP QDs and carrying out surface passivation. Recent developments in the field of QDs therefore generate a hope for the early detection of cancer cells. This is due to their encapsulation using polymers, conjugation with various biomolecules and antibodies, thereby making them suitable for targeting specific cancerous cells. Therefore, the high fluorescence of QDs in comparison to other detection methods and their unique size-dependent optical properties can be explored in the design and development of highly sensitive molecular imaging tools for in vivo imaging and therapeutic applications.",

            "text": "Fluorescent nanomaterials, including quantum dots and fluorescent nanoparticles, are extensively utilized in the fluorescence imaging of colorectal cancer due to their high fluorescence quantum yield and stable optical properties [149]. Through surface modifications, these nanomaterials can specifically bind to tumor cells, either on their surface or within, enabling precise tumor labeling and imaging [219]. \n\nThe unique structure of quantum dots confines electron movement in all three dimensions, resulting in the quantum confinement effect [220]. Quantum dots feature a broad excitation spectrum and a narrow, symmetric emission spectrum, enabling excitation by a single light source to produce emissions at multiple wavelengths [221]. This sharp, high-resolution emission spectrum facilitates easy detection and differentiation in complex biological samples. Additionally, quantum dots exhibit a high fluorescence quantum yield and intense luminescence, generating strong fluorescence signals even at low concentrations, thereby enhancing imaging sensitivity [222]. Their excellent photostability surpasses that of traditional organic fluorescent dyes, as they are resistant to photobleaching under prolonged illumination. This stability ensures consistent and accurate imaging over time [223]. Yang et al. [224] developed an Ag 2 Se quantum dot (Figure 3B) with remarkable stability and fluorescence continuity in gastric acid, enabling long-term monitoring of intestinal peristalsis. Compared to conventional barium meals, these quantum dots provided clearer intestinal imaging with superior biocompatibility. \n\nFluorescent nanoparticles encompass a wide range of types, including carbon fluorescent nanoparticles and polymer fluorescent nanoparticles [225,226]. In intestinal endoscopy, the diagnosis of malignant lesions using white-light endoscopy depends heavily on the operator's skill and experience, and early-stage malignant lesions-such as those seen in Lynch syndrome-are often missed. This issue is exacerbated when lesions are hidden behind mucosal folds or are undetectable by standard endoscopy, making early detection challenging. While local staining could improve diagnostic accuracy, it is cumbersome and time-consuming, highlighting the need for better solutions [227]. Silica fluorescent nanoparticles offer several advantages, including good biocompatibility, ease of surface modification, and high stability [228].",

NPs can be further tuned in their optical, electrical, magnetic, and biological properties and carry large payloads along with contrast agents. 33 Although this approach has several notable disadvantages including the complexity of their design, high cost, difficulty in large-scale production, and, most importantly, the unknown long-term toxicity to biological systems, 34 NPs are generally more amenable to broader approaches for bioimaging and tissue targetability compared with small molecules. 35 Ex vivo labeling with NPs mostly relies on naturally high endocytosis activity of cells, especially macrophages. 36 In addition to endocytosis, several techniques such as electroporation, microinjection, and transfection have been developed. 37 38 For in vivo labeling, NPs often need to be conjugated with specific targeting moieties such as antibodies, peptides, aptamers, and so on, to label immune cells selectively after administration. Despite many NPs having been described, they often have different in vivo behaviors and biological properties which are caused by the complexity of biological environments and the diversity of NPs. Thus, the physicochemical properties of NPs, such as HD, MW, shape, composition, hydrophilicity/ lipophilicity, and surface characteristics, should be considered when selecting NPs for in vivo labeling. 9 Additionally, the photophysical properties of NPs, including absorption/emission spectra, extinction coefficient, quantum yield, plasma protein binding, and photostability, can be another important factor for the selection of the right fluorophores. 39 40 As such, fluorescent quantum dots (QDs) have been widely used for biomedical assays, imaging, and lymphatic mapping because they have shown superior optical properties and stability, and tunable wavelengths by size. 41 However, the potential toxicity of heavy metal-cored QDs by disruption of mitochondrial function can lead to DNA damage, which presents a major obstacle to their clinical translation. 42 On the other hand, semiconducting polymers are emerging fluorescent organic nanomaterials with photoconversion properties that allow for not",

            "text": "Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs), often also referred to as conjugated polymer nanoparticles or polymer dots, are an emerging class of cancer theranostics.Their utility stems from their high absorption coefficients, biocompatibility, photostability, and fluorescent brightness. [1,2]SPNs are typically formed from the self-assembly of semiconducting polymers (SPs).The hydrophobic nature of the polymers makes nanoparticle formation a thermodynamically favorable process.However, this hydrophobicity also decreases colloidal stability in aqueous buffer and promotes protein adhesion, leading to protein coronas.A common way to improve colloidal stability and reduce biofouling is to coprecipitate the semiconducting polymer with amphiphilic block copolymers, lipids, or surfactants.These additives shield the hydrophobic polymers from the aqueous environment.However, the resulting binary micelles may be prone to heterogeneity, require purification, and raise questions of short-and long-term stability in a biological context. [3]o circumvent the issues caused by coprecipitation, singlecomponent systems have been explored.These commonly consist of graft copolymers of SPs with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side chains.[6][7][8] In addition, the optoelectronic performance of graft copolymers for cancer theranostics has been shown to be improved when compared to coprecipitation. [9,10]However, graft copolymer synthesis is typically complex and potentially difficult to scale, often requiring the multistep functionalization and purification of monomer precursors and various postpolymerization modifications. [3,8]n the vast majority of SPN studies for cancer targeting, accumulation of the nanoparticles at the tumor site relies on passive tumor targeting, thanks to the enhanced permeability and retention effect, which is thought to be relevant in some but not all solid tumors.

            "text": "Semiconducting fluorescent nanomaterials are a type of nanomaterial that exhibits fluorescent properties when exposed to light [101]. These nanomaterials can absorb and emit light, making them useful for a variety of applications, including cancer diagnostics [102,103]. The magnetic component of the nanostructure allows it to be guided to the site of the cancer cells using an external magnetic field [104]. Once the nanostructure reaches the cancer cells, the semiconducting fluorescent material can be activated using light, which can then be used to trigger the release of the therapeutic agent [105][106][107]. In photodynamic therapy, the light emitted by the fluorescent nanomaterials activates a photosensitizer, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) [108]. These ROS can damage the cancer cells and kill them while minimizing the impact on healthy cells. Semiconducting fluorescent nanomaterial magnetic hybrid nanostructures have several attractive properties for use in cancer treatment, due to their high fluorescence efficiency, tunable emission wavelengths, and ability to be functionalized with a variety of biomolecules [109]. There are several examples of semiconducting fluorescent nanomaterials that have been used in magnetic hybrid nanostructures for cancer treatment. Some of these materials include quantum dots, hybrid nanoparticles, carbon dots, graphene quantum dots, and fluorescent dyes [108]. \n\nQuantum dots are nanoscale semiconductor particles that can emit light of different colors depending on their size when excited. They have been used in magnetic hybrid nanostructures for cancer treatment because of their high photostability, which means they can retain their fluorescence over a long period. Hybrid nanoparticles can absorb low-energy light and emit higher-energy light, which makes them useful for photodynamic therapy [110]. They have been incorporated into magnetic hybrid nanostructures for cancer treatment because of their ability to generate ROS when excited. Carbon dots are nanoscale particles made of carbon that have been shown to have fluorescent properties [111]. They have been used in magnetic hybrid nanostructures for cancer treatment because of their biocompatibility and low toxicity.",

From a chemical perspective, CQDs are chemically inert and resistant to photobleaching and photoblinking. They exhibit good solubility in various solvents, depending on their surface functionalization, and can be easily functionalized with various molecules, polymers, or nanoparticles for specific applications. This versatility in functionalization opens up a wide range of possibilities for tailoring CQDs for diverse applications.

In particular, Pdots have demonstrated the utilization of optical and biosensing applications in recent years, such as super-resolution imaging [28,29], fluorescence imaging [30,31] and disease-related marker detection [32,33]. Pdots are organic nanoparticles assembled from polymer chains with \u03c0-conjugated systems, and the nanoscale size endows Pdots with unique properties, which have attracted extensive attention. According to the definition given by Wu and Chiu [34], the Pdots, specifically considered as a part of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs), are nanoparticles consisting of hydrophobic semiconducting polymers with a volume or weight fraction more than 50% and a diameter generally less than 50 nm, sometimes the particles size can be less than 30 nm. Pdots have shown characteristics of large absorption cross section, high brightness, good photostability, low toxicity and various forms of existence and modification, which are the basis of fluorescence probes for complex biological applications, typically for fluorescence-based biosensing and bioimaging [35][36][37]. \n\nThis review focuses on the fundamental content and recent advances of Pdots in biosensing and bioimaging applications. The preparation and properties of Pdots are briefly introduced. Modification and functionalization are basic and crucial parts of practical applications, which are related to the attachment of functional groups to the surface of nanoparticles. Thus, several surface modification methods are also introduced.",

            "text": "Besides inorganic materials, organic nanostructures can also be designed for applications in PTT. Organic materials for PTT include organic dye molecules, organic semiconducting nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, liposomes, dendrimers, nanoemulsions, and carbon-based materials, such as graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes. \n\nOrganic semiconducting polymer nanoparticles are polymeric structures optically active with large \u03c0-conjugated aromatic or aromatic heterocyclic structures, include polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), and conjugated donor-acceptor (D-A) structures. The photothermal conversion of organic semiconducting polymer nanoparticles occurs under laser incidence in the NIR-II window range, which is more comprehensive than small molecules [34,47]. The decoration of nanoparticles with functional groups gives them targeting properties to achieve organs or tissues [37]. \n\nCyanine, porphyrin, diketopyrrolopyrroles, phthalocyanine, and croconaine are part of the group of small molecular-based photo-converted H-ECBs [34]. Among the organic dyes, indocyanine green (ICG) is a contrast agent known to be useful for PTT in preclinical trials, requiring the use of 805 nm laser in preclinical tumor models. According to Dong et al. [34], cyanine molecules such as ICG, IR825, and IR780 are promising PTT candidates. \n\nCarbohydrate polymers are stable, biocompatible, biodegradable, safe, non-toxic materials, representing suitable nanocarriers for PPT. However, most carbohydrate polymers cannot display photothermal conversion. In this sense, they can be mixed with photothermal agents, which are embedded within nanoparticle structures, such as multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) embedded in \u03b2-cyclodextrin (CD). When these nanocomposites are stimulated, they can flawlessly perform thermal ablation in the tumor microenvironment.",

In addition to serving as the photothermal agent, pillararene-capped CuS nanocages were 4\u00d7 more responsive and could control the release of DOX. \n\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles [SPNs) have also been used as photothermal agents [150][151][152]. Being made of organic compounds including semiconducting polymers/oligomers and amphiphilic polymers, SPNs possess natural biocompatibility, good photostability, and are easy to functionalize [152]. It has been reported that SPNs have relatively higher photothermal conversion efficacy in comparison with carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods. The photophysical properties of SPNs are correlated to the molecular structures of their precursor polymers, which allows versatility and diversity for tuning the optical spectra [153,154]. Xu et al. synthesized stable and size controllable SPNs, where DOX was loaded to perform chemotherapy. DOX was released from nanoparticles through multi-responsiveness to pH/NIR/GSH. With a combination of chemo-and photothermal therapies, the proposed SPNs nanosystem showed improved therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. \n\nOrganic dyes can absorb optical energy and convert it into heat as well. Organic nanocarriers encapsulating organic dyes have been explored as complement for classic inorganic PTT, since they display good biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low longterm harmfulness. Liposomal nanocarriers are a popular delivery system for PTT [95,96]. Xiong et al. developed a NIR-triggered disintegrable liposomal nanoplatform which was modified with peptidyl ligands targeted to \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin receptors. The liposomes were loaded with ICG and a dendrimer-grafted cisplatin prodrug [19].",

[19][20][21] These polymeric semiconductors were originally developed for optoelectronic devices, [22][23][24] and later used for highly sensitive chemical sensors. 25,26 In the past decade, the adaptation of semiconducting polymers as \ue104uorescent probes has received considerable attention in biology and medicine. 27,28 A large variety of Pdots have been demonstrated for applications such as cellular labeling and tracking, [29][30][31][32][33] photodynamic and photothermal cancer therapy, [34][35][36] drug delivery, 37,38 in vivo optical imaging, 20,39 photoacoustic imaging, [40][41][42][43][44][45] and molecular detection. [46][47][48] In contrast with inorganic nanoparticles, one prominent advantage of Pdots is that their optical properties are highly tunable because new polymer structures can be synthesized or small molecular \ue104uorophores can be doped into them. [49][50][51] For the latter case, semiconducting polymers as the nanoparticle matrix efficiently absorb light and transfer the energy to the dopant \ue104uorophore, yielding ampli\ue103ed \ue104uorescence when compared with small molecules. Recently, there are major efforts to develop NIR-emitting Pdots for biological applications. Zhang et al. synthesized BODIPY-based Pdots and achieved bright narrow-band emission at $720 nm by cascade energy transfer. 52 We reported a squaraine-based semiconducting polymer that exhibited efficient NIR narrow-band \ue104uorescence ($704 nm). 21 Chan et al. developed a few Pdot species that extended the emission range to far red and NIR region. 53 Pu et al. demonstrated multilayered polymer dots for efficient NIR emission. 54 Despite these progresses, the in vivo performance of current Pdots are far from ideal because both the absorption and emission are far away from the center wavelength ($800 nm) of",

            "text": "In addition, most of the reported polymer encapsulated organic nanoparticles show good physical stability, which has been further improved when chemical bonds are introduced to cross link the matrices and the emitters through either postmodification or in situ polymerization. Although the photostability of these nanoparticles is primarily determined by the emitters themselves, encapsulating them into the polymeric shells could obviously improve their stability against photobleaching. Additional advantages of these nanoparticles also include their excellent biocompatibility, good cellular permeability and low cytotoxicity, which have been demonstrated for almost all the reported CP and AIE nanoparticles in vitro. However, systematic investigation of their in vivo toxicity, biodistribution and biodegradability remains to be explored. \n\nThe recent discovery that CPs are active agents in PA imaging has significantly broadened their biomedical applications. This is also very exciting from the materials point of view. Despite the fact that great efforts have been made to develop highly fluorescent CPs for sensing and imaging applications, many existing CPs, such as those with FR/NIR absorption, are not very emissive, especially in the aggregated states. The emitters with strong NIR absorption and active non-radiative decay thus opened a new window for PA imaging. On a par mass basis, the PA signals from CP nanoparticles are even higher than those for the most widely used PA contrast agents, such as Au nanorods and single-walled carbon nanotubes (Table 3). In addition, as non-radiative pathway is easily associated with heat generation, photoacoustic agents also have great potential to be used for photothermal therapy (PTT), which is a highly specific, low toxic and noninvasive strategy for cancer and tumor ablation. 174 Several CPs with FR/NIR absorption have also been demonstrated to be effective photothermal agents for imaging guided photothermal treatment of tumors. 175,176 As the application of CPs in PA imaging and photothermal treatment is at the very early stage, the design principles for such nanoparticles and their operation mechanisms are not fully established.",

            "text": "Over the past decade, conjugated polymer nanoparticles (NPs) have gained prominence in the bio-imaging field as an attractive class of fluorescent probes because of their interesting photoluminescence properties. They have a high absorption cross-section, high radiative rates, excellent photostability, non-blinking behavior and less susceptible to leaching as compared to small molecular weight organic dyes [1,2]. Furthermore, most of them are also biocompatible, in contrast to quantum dots [3,4]. In the last years, mainly polyfluorene [5], MEH-PPV (poly[2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene]), CN-PPV (cyano-poly(p-phenylene vinylene)) and PPE (poly(p-phenylene ethynylene)) nanoparticles have been studied for biomedical applications [6][7][8][9][10]. Recently, different PPV NPs, i.e., MDMO-PPV (poly[2-methoxy-5-(3 ,7 -dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene]) and CPM-MDMO-PPV (2-(5'-methoxycarbonylpentyloxy)-5-methoxy-1,4-phenylene vinylene), were tested in our group [11]. As the latter introduce carboxyl groups at the NP surface, the coupling of biomolecules to the nanoparticles was successfully demonstrated [12]. \n\nThe main drawback when applying these materials for bio-imaging is that they require excitation and emit in the visible region (390-700 nm), resulting in a lower sensitivity and specificity for bio-imaging and tracking applications. In general, for fluorescence bio-imaging, scattering and absorption of photons by biological tissue is of major concern, as both incoming (excitation) and outgoing (emission) light are affected.",

            "text": "Optical imaging techniques have excellent potential to help us further understand biological processes at the molecular level and provide useful tools for sensitive cancer diagnosis [1]. Biological optical imaging greatly relies on the use of sensitive and stable optical probes. To date, organic dyes [2,3], quantum dots [4][5][6], metal nanoparticles [7][8][9], and upconverting nanoparticles [10] are the most commonly used optical labels probes, but they also have intrinsic limitations. Organic dyes suffer from a short observation time, partly due to photobleaching, poor stability under physiological conditions, and limited Stokes shift. Quantum dots display good photostability, size-dependent emissions, and high quantum yield, while they still require constant excitation, which is responsible for undesirable autofluorescence and enhanced background signal that reduce the sensibility of the assay [11,12]. Such inherent disadvantages would affect their application for imaging in vitro or in vivo.\n\nIn order to overcome some of inherent problems encountered with optical imaging probes [13], persistent luminescence nanoparticles have been developed. It comes down to a particular optical phenomenon in which the excitation energy can be reserved by the material and then slowly released by a photonic emission, which can be persistent luminescence for some hours [14,15]. After long-persistence luminescent nanoparticles are excited in vitro, real-time in vivo and vitro imaging can be achieved without needing any external illumination source. Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be significantly improved by eliminating the background noise originating from in situ excitation [16,17]. Moreover, the long-persistent luminescence of near-infrared (NIR) emitting long-persistence luminescent nanoparticles (NLPLNPs) (the afterglow wavelength varies from 650-900 nm) pertain to the tissue transparency window, where light attenuation is largely due to scattering rather than absorption, which is advantageous for long-term in vivo and vitro imaging with deep penetration and a high SNR [18]. So far, large numbers of NIR persistent luminescence nanoprobes have",

            "text": "Organic dyes are often photobleached and fade by > 90% in less than one minute, whereas QDs are stable for more than 30 minutes under identical experimental conditions [58]. In vivo fluorescence quenching of QDs-micelles and rhodamine green-dextran was compared after 80 minutes of constant illumination at 450 nm under the microscope. The QDs fluorescence intensity remained the same, whereas the dextran had photobleached [7]. While detecting tumor marker CA125 in ovarian carcinoma, Wang et al. [59] compared the photostability of QDs signals and a conventional organic dye fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). QDs signals were found to be more specific and brighter than those of FITC, with exceptional photostability during continuous illumination for 1 hour, whereas FITC signals faded very quickly and became undetectable after 24 minutes of illumination. Arguably, the extreme photostability of QDs may have little significance in the context of clinical potential as fluence rates that photobleach organic fluorophores have no place in the clinical settings. The susceptibility of conventional fluorophores to photobleacing limits the fluence rate that can be applied to a sample and as a result it affects the sensitivity of detection [21]. In order to minimize the potential for toxicity, Kim et al. [16] increased the fluence rate, and proportionally decreased the dose of injected QDs. Their photobleaching data suggested that at least a 100fold lower dose could be used. Although QDs are photostable and they can achieve high-quantum yields in organic solvents, they underperform organic fluorophores as a function of molecular volume. That is, given their size, QDs are much poorer photoluminescence agents than organic fluorophores. In depth, discussions of various properties of QDs in relation to conventional fluorophores have been published [14,21,56,60].",

            "text": "Recent advances have been made for cancer PAI and PTT using semiconducting polymer (SP) NPs, an emerging group of contrast agents characterized by optical features, biocompatibility, photostability, and functionalization potentially more advantageous for in vivo applications compared to the most widely used organic dyes, metallic NPs, and carbon nanomaterials [86]. e remarkable optical features of SPNPs are mainly related to the presence of delocalized electrons, while PA signal enhancement has been achieved by modifying their polymeric structure and designing activatable molecular probes [87].\n\nInitial investigations on the use of SPNPs for in vivo PAI were conducted by Pu and colleagues [88] that highlighted the advantages over SWNTs or GNRs, based on a wider and more stable PA signal, and higher detection sensibility. In a following study, the same author and coworkers [89] highlighted the feasibility of diketopyrrolopyrrole-(DPP-) based SPNs for in vivo PAI on a HeLa xenograft mouse model. After IV administration, DPP-SPNs exhibited a significantly higher PA signal in tumor than surrounding tissues, presumably due to extravasation of SPNs through cancer blood vessels. ese studies provided the first insights about the potential of SPNs for high-resolution PAI in oncological research.\n\nFurther improvements in biodistribution of amphiphilic polymers containing DPP-SPNs have been obtained through PEGylation [90], overcoming also the potential issue of their dissociation. In a proof of concept study, the ability of these amphiphilic SPNs for in vivo tumor imaging was demonstrated at 24 hours after IV injection.\n\nAttempts for advances in diagnostic specificity and sensitivity are also in progress through implementation of multispectral PAI. Zhang and colleagues [91] developed semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots), which include in their structure isoindigo (IID) and 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3benzothiadiazole (DTBT) as electron acceptors. is chemical modification, consisting in incorporation of an electron-deficient element into the SPNs structure, is known as the \"self-quenched process,",

Free organic chromophores (fluorescent dyes) are bright but rapidly degrade. Inorganic nanoparticles (e.g., quantum dots) are photostable but toxic to biological systems. Alternatively, dye\u2010doped polymer particles are promising for labeling and imaging due to their properties that overcome limitations of photodegradation and toxicity. This progress report, therefore, presents various synthesis techniques for the generation of dye\u2010doped fluorescent polymer particles. Polymer particles are relatively soft compared to inorganic nanoparticles and can be synthesized with characteristics like biocompatibility and stimuli responsiveness. Also, their ability of loading fluorophores through various interactions reveals brightness. Here, a multiscale\u2010multicolor library of bright and soft fluorescent polymer particles is generated hierarchically. Various microfluidic supported strategies have been applied where fluorophores can be linked to polymeric networks noncovalently and covalently in the interior, and at the surface of nanoparticles (60\u2013550 nm). Besides, microfluidic strategies for hydrophilic and hydrophobic fluorescent polymer microparticles (20\u2013800 \u00b5m) have been performed for systematic tuning in size and color combination.

Semiconducting polymers (mostly conjugated polymers) and fluorescent inorganic nanoparticles have been investigated separately for some time. The combination of both materials is, however, highly interesting as it can lead to nanocomposites whose properties are much superior to those of their constituents [82]. These hybrid materials are being considered in several applications, mostly in light emitting diodes and photovoltaic cells. Latest reviews about this topic can be found in [83][84][85][86][87]. Semiconducting hybrid systems offer the potential to combine the benefits of inorganic nanocrystals (NCs) such as tunable optical properties, optical stability, and high electron mobility [82,86] with the advantages of semiconducting polymers like light weight, flexibility, ink jet printing, roll-to-roll production, solvent processability over a large area and with low costs [83,[88][89][90][91][92]. Because it is possible to tune the optical band gap of NCs very accurate from the ultraviolet to the nearinfrared, they can be used to prepare very bright quantum dot light emitting diodes (QLEDs, see Section 4) or solar cells consisting of p-type donor polymers and n-type acceptor inorganic nanoparticles which absorb a significant range of the solar spectrum.\n\nControlling the morphology is a crucial aspect for optoelectronic applications.

The polymer shell can then be functionalized; this process allows the linking of any number of biologically relevant molecules (oligopeptides, antibodies, and so forth) to the surface. These functionalized quantum dots have had applications in cellular imaging, 67,68 protein detection, 69 and cancer immunology. 70 Because of their unique charge-carrying abilities, QDots possess molar extinction coefficients 10 -50 times greater than typical organic dyes and are also up to 20 times brighter. 71 Additionally QDots have decreased rates of photobleaching, which lends them to being well-suited for biologic imaging. \n\nBy varying the semiconductor material contained within quantum dot nanoparticles, one can manipulate the wavelength that is emitted on excitation to skew emissions to the near-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This region is optimal for deep-tissue imaging due to the optical characteristics of biologic tissue. 3 ecently, a quantum dot fluorescent probe designed to target the epidermal growth factor receptor was evaluated for its ability to differentiate tumor cells from normal brain parenchyma in tumor biopsies of low-grade glioma. 72 In this study, quantum dots were conjugated to epidermal growth factor as well as monoclonal antibodies directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor and were evaluated for their ability to differentiate normal brain parenchyma from human glioma ex vivo (Fig 4). Tumor cells could be visualized from the macroscopic level, and this result indicated that quantum dot-targeted fluorescent probes could be used intraoperatively to assist in discerning tumor tissue from normal parenchyma in the resection of low-grade gliomas.",

            "text": "Fluorescent imaging is found to be attractive when it comes in terms of sensitivity, accessibility and cost. Before the cell administration they are pre-labelled with fluorescent nanoparticles. Considering the quantum yield, brightness and stability issues, fluorescent nanoparticles for stem cell tracking mainly involves quantum dots (QDs), fluorescent polymer nanoparticles and fluorescent silica nanoparticles. Quantum dots (QDs) are highly fluorescent semiconductor nanoparticles with tuneable emissions, high extinction coefficients, sharp emission bandwidths, and good photo stability [30]. The tuneable emission especially at the near infrared region (> ~800 nm) avoids the background signal of auto fluorescence of the animal tissues (emissions are mainly at the visible region, ~300-550 nm). For the long-term tracking of stem cells good photostability is allowed by quantum dots [31]. One major concern of quantum dots for stem cell labelling is their cytotoxicity [32]. To address this issue, inert materials like silica have been used as the coating of quantum dots to add extra functionalities and to decrease their cytotoxicity. [33]. Researchers have designed biocompatible silica and polymeric nanaoparticles containing fluorescent dyes [34]. The biocompatible shell (polymer or silica) prevents organic dyes from oxidation or decomposition and strong fluorescence is generated by concentrating the dyes. Fluorescent silica NPs are mainly Cornell dots (C-dots) [35]. C-dots possess enhanced brightness, photo-stability and versatile surface functionalities which are biocompatible too. Besides C-dots and another type of silica nanoparticles are cyanine dye-doped silica nanoparticles which were synthesized using a reverse microemulsion method and could allow the discrimination between live and early-stage apoptotic stem cells through the different surface distribution. Besides silica nanoparticles, fluorescent polymeric nanoparticles like polystyrene nanoparticles are another popular choice for advanced therapeutics with clinical excellence in cancer treatment and stem cell therapy due to their variety of functional groups [36]. A powerful technique for the high-resolution imaging is the fluorescence imaging with multiphoton excitation.",

            "text": "SQDs are more photostable than organic dyes or fluorescent proteins, but their potential cytotoxicity remains a significant drawback. Environmental issues represent another concern because of the heavy metals used in SQD compositions, such as Cd, Pb or Te. \n\nC-dots represent a possible alternative, and they can be applied both for living and apoptotic cells [10] with reduced toxicity. Another intrinsic advantage is their lack of environmental issues and potential low fabrication costs. Their photostability, in particular, is a significant concern because it depends on several structural parameters and the state of the surface of C-dots. In a previous article, we observed that the functionalization of C-dots with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) increases their photostability. In hydrolytic conditions, the modification of the surface of C-dots by APTES forms a thin passivating layer, which protects the C-dots from emission quenching [11]. In the present work, we focused on obtaining C-dots that could fulfil most in vitro and in vivo bioimaging requirements. In particular, we obtained C-dots that exhibit a remarkable quantum yield and high photostability, which is generally a matter of concern for C-dots. The nanoparticles described in the present work satisfy the main requirements for applications in bioimaging.",

[21] A similar evolution of other fluorescent nanomaterials is yet to happen, and there are only few industrial fluorescent nanomaterials. \n\nFluorescent nanomaterials offer high brightness and photostability in components that on the macroscale distribute as if they were molecules. Thus, they give rise to homogeneous fluorescent signals from bulk materials. The brightest nanomaterials are based on dye doped nanoparticles, where Reisch and Klymchenko have created super bright fluorescent nanomaterials by doping polymer nanoparticles with rhodamines ion paired with bulky fluorinated anions. [22][23][24] While this method is limited by aggregation-indused quenching, [25,26] several high performing materials have been reported. [27][28][29] Very recently, fluorescent materials with a record brightness have been reported by Flood and Laursen.

Lately, the emergence of biocompatible nanoparticles has revolutionized the prospects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in clinical trials. Consequently, a lot of research is now being focused on developing non-toxic, biocompatible nanoparticle-based photosensitizers for effective cancer treatments using PDT. In this regard, semiconducting quantum dots have shown encouraging results. Quantum dots are artificial semiconducting nanocrystals with distinct chemical and physical properties. Their optical properties can be fine-tuned by varying their size, which usually ranges from 1 to 10 nm. They present many advantages over conventional photosensitizers, mainly their emission properties can be manipulated within the near IR region as opposed to the visible region by the former. Consequently, low intensity light can be used to penetrate deeper tissues owing to low scattering in the near IR region. Recently, successful reports on imaging and PDT of cancer using carbon (carbon, graphene based) and metallic (Cd based) based quantum dots are promising. This review aims to summarize the development and the status quo of quantum dots for cancer treatment. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT",

This makes them suitable for imaging and therapeutic purposes. 97,98 To date, various types of QDs from groups II\u2212VI such as Zn(S, Se), Cd(S, Se, Te), IV\u2212VI Pb(S, Se), I\u2212VI Ag 2 (S, Se), II\u2212V Cd 3 (P, As) 2 , and III\u2212V In(P, As) as well as ternary I\u2212III\u2212VI QDs (where I = Cu or Ag, III = Ga or In, VI = S or Se) have been successfully utilized in biomedical fields. 99,100 QDs comprise a fluorescent core surrounded by a crystal shell that protects the center from ionization within biological systems. 98 Their exceptional optical properties make them ideal for biomedical applications. Their narrow and symmetrical emission profiles provide color purity and accurate emission stability. Their broad excitation range and high molar absorption coefficients allow for high-throughput detection. Moreover, their high photoluminescence (PL), quantum yield (QY), and resistance to photobleaching offer the potential for long-term monitoring of biological processes.",

            "text": "These come in addition to more conventional (dyed) NPs such as those made from polystyrene, polyacrylamide etc. The polymer usually is prepared from aromatic precursors possessing polymerizable double or triple bonds. Particles (as needed for imaging)  are prepared by either emulsion polymerization or nanoprecipitation. 46 Doping with fluorophores is not needed. The backbone of conjugated polymers behaves like an array of lightharvesting units that exhibit a larger optical cross section compared to small organic molecule dyes. Photobleaching was not reported so far. Fine-tuning of the conjugated polymer structure and the polymeric encapsulation matrix leads to fluorescent probes with specific spectral properties and targeting capability. P-dots display strong fluorescence that often extends far into the NIR, are highly inert and do not swell in water. Little is known about biocompatibility, internalization, and excretion from tissues. Their uses in imaging and therapy have been reviewed. 47 luorescent nanodots consisting of semiconducting polymer blends can be attached to peptides (such as chlorotoxin) 48 and then can be used for targeted imaging (of malignant brain tumors, for example) in clinical diagnosis. By coupling the pH-indicator fluorescein to P-dots, a material is obtained that displays two fluorescence peaks, one being pH sensitive, the other not so that it can acts as an internal reference. Fully reversible pH sensing was demonstrated 49 for the pH 5.0 to 8.0 range. Intracellular pH values were determined by imaging of HeLa cells following the uptake of the P-dots by endocytosis. Tetraphenylethene-based fluorescent organic NPs undergo aggregation-induced emission inside cells and this was monitored via cell imaging. 50 The fluorescence of conjugated polymers, particularly if anionic, can be quenched by ions such as Cu(II). 51 emiconducting P-dots (20 to 50 nm) can also serve as photoacoustic probes for real-time imaging of reactive oxygen species in living mice tissue where they accumulate quite readily. 52",

            "text": "For effective treatment against cancer, exogenous PTT agents with NIR absorption are indispensable for the deeper penetration depth and efficient heat generation. Several NIR organic dyes, such as indocyanine green (ICG), naphthalocyanine, and porphyrin, have desirable optical properties for biological applications in PTT [56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63][64]. In addition, they emit fluorescent signals in the NIR range, which provide biological information in the body with minimal obstruction. These properties have made organic dyes an attractive choice as PTT agents. However, their drawbacks often impede their transition into practical bioapplications [65]. First of all, the photostability of organic dyes is not robust enough to sustainably produce heat under light exposure. Even worse, the light-induced heat from organic dyes exacerbates the stability of their chemical structure. Not only light and heat, but also the aqueous environment and biological conditions in the body amplify the degradation of organic dyes and reduce the bioavailability of organic dyes in PTT. \n\nNanoparticles containing such organic dyes enhance the stability and bioavailability of organic dyes for effective PTT [66]. Nanoparticle carriers protect loaded organic dyes from light, heat, and biomolecules to maintain their chemical structure. Additionally, the long circulation time and tumor-targeting properties improve the bioavailability until they reach the tumor tissues and exhibit their therapeutic effect upon laser irradiation. The enhanced stability and bioavailability of ICG was demonstrated through the encapsulation with lipid polymer nanoparticles [56,57]. The poor aqueous stability and rapid elimination of free ICG were successfully overcome by the nanoparticle formulation. These ICG-loaded nanoparticles had a photothermal effect that increased intratumoral temperature to 50 \u2022 C and induced necrosis upon 808 nm laser irradiation.",

            "text": "Fluorescent nanoparticles have potential applications in many biological and medical \ue103elds. The main types of \ue104uorescent nanomaterials can be classed as \ue104uorescent dye nanoparticles, inorganic nanocrystals also known as quantum dots (Qdots) or conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs), also known as \ue104uorescent polymer nanoparticles (Pdots). 25 Although all these nanoparticle types have their own constraints, both Qdots and CPNs offer signi\ue103cant increases in brightness and stability compared to dyes. [1][2][3][4][5] Qdots can be synthesized in many different colours by tuning the particle size, and characterized by large absorption cross-sections (some 100 fold that of \ue104uorescent dyes), large Stokes' shi\ue09ds, narrow emission bands (FWHM $20-40 nm) and minimal photobleaching. 25 Qdots serve as the imaging 'gold standard' at which all other probes can be measured; however, their toxicity is a major drawback in terms of their applications. Many groups are exploring new synthesis methods to address this major drawback by replacing highly toxic heavy metal cadmium with less toxic zinc or indium or by surrounding the quantum dots in polymers that are biocompatible. 26 Another property of Qdots which set them aside is their chemical stability and fabrication into nearly any desired monodisperse size, which other nanoparticle imaging systems have yet to match. CPNs on the other hand have even higher absorption cross sections and brighter emission pro\ue103les than Qdots of similar size, whilst being easy to fabricate and modify for a variety of applications. [1][2][3][4][5] CPNs that possess strong, stable optical properties in the NIR window, that are produced by methods easy to scale up for industrial manufacturing, and that exhibit positive biocompatibility attributes, such as low toxicity, long circulation times and biodegradability, will be more suitable for clinical translation. 27 These design features have driven the current study investigating the performance and biocompatibility of PLGA-PEG : CN-PPV CPNs both with and without incorporation of low molecular weight NIR dyes.\n\nA moderately high",

            "text": "In vivo imaging systems are commonly used to evaluate the biodistribution of nanoparticles, particularly in live animals across various time points to assess accumulation relative to disease progression. A variety of fluorescentlabeled nanoparticles have been imaged using this technique, including nanoporous silicon nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, metal-based nanoparticles, polymer-based nanoparticles, and lipid-based nanoparticles (Connell et al., 2002;Zheng et al., 2003;Gao et al., 2010b;Goldberg et al., 2011;Milane et al., 2011;Tasciotti et al., 2011;Liu Y. et al., 2012;Zhang et al., 2012). For example, Milane et al. (2011) used this technique as a qualitative assessment of the biodistribution of EGFR-targeted polymer-blend nanoparticles in an orthotopic animal model of multi-drug resistant breast cancer. In this study, non-targeted and targeted nanoparticles loaded with DiR (near-IR) dye were administered via tail vein injection, and the biodistribution was visualized using a Kodak In-Vivo FX Imaging Station over 6 h. The results attained from in vivo optical imaging were found to be comparable with the quantitative data attained from HPLC analysis of drug distribution. Interestingly, some nanoparticles possess contrast that is inherently fluorescent such as quantum dot nanocrystals (Gao et al., 2010a,b;Liu Y. et al., 2012;Zhang et al., 2012;Zhao and Zeng, 2015). Quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals synthesized with a core-shell structure that enables imaging in the near infrared spectrum, thereby enhancing image sensitivity. They possess attractive optical qualities such as size-tunable fluorescence, photostability, high fluorescence quantum yields, and high resistance to photobleaching (Gao et al., 2010a). However, quantum dot preparations contain heavy metals such as cadmium, tellurium and selenium, which are potentially toxic to the body (Hardman, 2006;Kim et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Fluorescence has long been used in biomarker analysis, immunoassays, and diagnostic imaging, including cancer diagnosis [1]. Many small organic fluorescent molecules (<1 kD in molecular weight) that are currently commercially available suffer from several limitations concerning wavelength range, brightness (i.e., extinction coefficient for absorbance \u00d7 quantum yield of fluorescence), photobleaching (i.e., photostability), and fluorescence self-quenching. Also, the toxicity exhibited by some promising organic fluorophore molecules has limited their application when intended for in vitro and in vivo optical imaging. \n\nFluorescent micro-and nanoparticle systems have been proposed as a solution to the abovementioned limitations of small organic fluorescent dyes [2]. When compared to the low absorption coefficients of individual organic fluorophore molecules, fluorescent micro-and nanoparticles often contain multiple fluorophore entities, leading to increased photoluminescent emission. Additionally, their encapsulation into the particle provides with improved stability and reduced photobleaching and toxicity, as illustrated by Raymo and co-workers in recent works [3,4]. Improved biocompatibility can also be obtained by proper selection of the nature of the particle. Moreover, a unique feature of microand nanoparticles is the possibility to combine imaging and drug delivery characteristics in the same system to produce theranostic agents for nanomedicine applications [5]. Several fluorescent micro-and nanoparticle systems based on block copolymer micelles and cross-linked polymer networks, quantum dots (QDs), \u03c0-conjugated polymers, and dendrimers have been evaluated as optical imaging systems. The polymerization of monomers containing fluorescent moieties has been employed to prepare amphiphilic block copolymers (BCPs) which self-assemble in water to produce fluorescent micelles [6]. Also, decoration of non-fluorescent BCPs with fluorescent dyes has been carried out to produce red, Molecules 2017, 22, 1819 2 of 14 green, and blue photoluminescent (PL) emission via crystallization-driven self-assembly, allowing even white light PL emission [7].",

It is well known that organic fluorescent dyes have several advantages such as small size, excellent biocompatibility, easy surface modifications for covalent conjugations, and relatively high fluorescent intensity [1]. However, some drawbacks have been found such as short detection times due to high photobleaching efficiency and chemical degradation [2]. Also, organic dyes have narrow absorption and broad emission spectra with long tailing which limits their detection [1][2]. Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) has advantages compared to conventional organic dyes such as size-tunable emission, bright photoluminescence, good photostability, broad ultraviolet (UV) excitation and narrow emission have emerged as alternative and promising fluorescent labels agent [3].

            "text": "Consequently, if fluorochromes are integrated into the shell or bound to the surface of a NP, the properties of the new structure are hard to predict and may even alter its behavior in cells and tissues when compared to unlabeled particles [35]. In contrast, incorporation of the dye into the core of an otherwise unaltered surface of a NP may leave its overall properties unchanged, especially when an unlabeled shell can be grown around this core. In addition, the potential of additional specific surface functionalization and binding of other molecules of interest may remain completely similar to that of unlabeled particles [79,83,84]. \n\nAnother disadvantage when using fluorescent dyes is their timedependent photobleaching, which results in a more or less rapid fading of the fluorescent yield [85]. In this regard, the increased brightness and photostability of a fluorescent dye when incorporated into the core of SiO 2 -NP are particularly welcome [83]. Of note, some specifically engineered NP may hold inherent fluorescent properties, such as inorganic quantum dots (QD) [76]. QD used in bioapplications are typically composed of a semiconductor core (e.g., cadmium sulfide), an outer shell of a higher band semiconducting material (e.g., zinc sulfide) and a surface functionalization which may consist of various hydrophilic organic molecules including biomolecules or polymers [86]. QD with their size-dependent optical properties possess great potential as probe for biomedical imaging applications, as previously shown for the mapping of lymph node structures [87]. Their superior photostability, their broad excitation and narrow emission spectra offer additional advantages [85] that even allow for the detection of mixed QD populations with a single excitatory wavelength [86]. Furthermore, the impact of toxic ions released by QD on biological matter has been minimized by embedding QD into silica nanoparticles [88] without influencing the optical properties [89]. Unlike fluorescent dyes that undergo photobleaching, photoactivation is a remarkable property of QD enhancing their quantum yield over time [90]. \n\nAnother group of highly photostable NP are lanthanide-doped upconversion NP (UCNP).",

Quantum dots are attractive probes for microscopy and imaging, owing to their photophysical properties, including their photostability and narrow bandwidth fluorescence emission with a wide excitation range [160]. They are mainly used as inert markers [161][162][163][164][165][166] and FRET-based sensors [167] for both in vitro and in vivo applications. They are highly luminescent semiconducting nanoparticles, and are approximately 100 times more resistant to photobleaching than organic fluorophore. Nevertheless, they suffer from signal attenuation under prolonged excitation, fluorescence blinking, complicated surface chemistry, and potentially cause long-term heavy-metal toxicity [168][169][170][171]. Single-walled carbon nanotubes overcome these limitations owing to their inherent non-photobleaching, non-blinking fluorescence, and their sp 2 hybridized all-carbon structure that gives rise to easy surface functionalization and biocompatibility [14,62,172]. Hence, SWCNTs are subjected to intensive research in many emerging applications of optical nanosensors that exploit their nIR fluorescent emission and surface chemistry for target recognition and signal transduction [10,16,30,41,50].",

            "text": "Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have found tremendous success in recent years as promising theranostic agent owing to their good optical properties, high photostability and outstanding biocompatibility [1][2][3][4][5]. Up to now, SPNs have been diversified for biological sensing, drug delivery, photoacoustic imaging (PAI), as well as photothermal and photodynamic therapy. SPNs are composed of organic constituents with low cytotoxicity and thus naturally overcome the long term toxicity issue caused by inorganic nanoparticles [6][7][8][9]. Despite the progress of SPNs in nanomedicine in recent years, fabrication techniques for SPNs with structurally stability and multi-functionality are still Ivyspring International Publisher in its infancy and confronted with great challenges. \n\nThe synthetic techniques for making semiconducting polymer nanoparticles are generally limited to emulsion technique and nanoprecipitation method [10][11][12][13]. However, these techniques offer poor control of SPNs size and produce SPNs with different particle size [14]. Furthermore, to afford SPNs with surface functional groups, amphiphilic polymer or phospholipid are required to encapsulate SPNs surface [15][16][17][18], which however are not inherently stable and suffer from the potential dissociation issues. To achieve structural stability, the synthesis and self-assembly of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) grafting SPNs have recently been reported [19,20]. However, the synthesis of semiconducting polymer amphiphiles is relatively complicated and the functionalization is specifically designed for each SPNs. Therefore, new strategies to develop SPNs with stable structure and controllable sizes are desired but still a challenge. \n\nRecently, multi-stimuli sensitive (e.g., pH changes, temperature, redox or light) nanoagents for controlled chemo/photothermal synergistic therapy have attracted considerable attention due to their additionally enhanced anticancer efficacy and reduced side effects.",

            "text": "rganic fluorescent dyes are capable of emitting fluorescence when stimulated by exciting light. In addition to monomer form, dyes are often doped in polymer nanocarriers or immobilized on the surface of carriers before combining with antibodies to obtain higher fluorescence yield. Bamrungsap et al. doped dye Cy5 into silica nanoparticles for the detection of an influenza antigen, proving an eightfold better sensitivity than the commercial colorbased LFIA kit. [14] Quantum dots (QDs) make up for some inherent defects of organic fluorescent dyes due to their sharp emission peaks, strong signal intensity, low background, and photostability. It is reported that single QDs have longer fluorescence lifetime and 10-20 times higher signal strength than organic fluorescent dyes. [15] Besides, multiple separated emission peaks can be obtained under the same excitation wavelength of different QDs, which is particularly suitable for simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers. [16] [19][20] Semiconducting polymer dots have the advantages of biocompatibility, luminescent property, and surface activity, thus, developing rapidly in recent years. [21] agnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have been widely used in the purification, enrichment, and detection of biomolecules. Both color and magnetic signals can be generated by MNPs due to their dark appearance (brown or black) and superparamagnetic property. Magnetic detection has to be operated with the assistance of a magnetic sensor, such as the giant magneto-resistive sensor or the resonant coil magnetometer, which makes it possible to achieve higher detection sensitivity by measuring the magnetic signals both at the surface and deep within the membrane. Cui's group utilized tunneling magnetoresistance sensors for quantitation of MNPs in lateral flow strips, achieving high sensitivity and strong antiinterference ability. [22] In addition to generating detection signals, the magnetism of particles has been used for other purposes. In combination with magnetic separation, the target molecules can be separated, enriched, and captured on the nanoparticles before chromatography, which is of great value for the analysis of biomarkers in complicated matrixes (e.g., plasma, saliva).",

            "text": "Semiconductor zero-dimensional nanocrystals, called quantum dots (QDs), have attracted considerable interest in recent years, especially in connection with their application for fluorescent diagnostics of various types of oncological diseases [1,2]. This is a new class of fluorescent biological labels with unique optical properties compared to conventional organic dyes, widely used in clinical practice. Conventional organic photosensitizers have low photostability, narrow absorption spectra, and broad emission spectra, which limits their effectiveness in long-term imaging and multiplexing [3]. The use of QDs in the biological environment for fluorescent tumor diagnostics has shown that the unique properties of QDs can overcome these shortcomings [4]. The distinctive properties of QDs for biomedical spectroscopy and imaging include high photoluminescence quantum yield, very high molar extinction coefficients (10-100 times greater than organic dyes), broad absorption, covering the range from ultraviolet to near infrared, and large effective Stokes shifts, which make it easier to separate the excited and emitted light. An additional advantage of QDs is their resistance to metabolic degradation, and they are more photostable than traditional fluorescent agents used for fluorescent diagnostics [5]. In comparison with photosensitizers in the molecular form, QDs have such a special property that their fluorescence spectra can be controlled by size and composition [6]. Unfortunately, the often-studied quantum dots of II-VI or III-V groups of the periodic table, containing \"class A\" metals, such as Cd, As, Hg and Pb, are not used in biological research due to their toxicity [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. In this regard, it seems promising to develop and study biomarkers for tumor diagnostics based on QDs from relatively non-toxic semiconductors of groups I-III-VI, such as indium and silver sulfide AgInS2 (AIS). QDs themselves are capable of generating only reactive oxygen species or a small amount of singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ), which, in comparison with classical photosensitizers (PSs), are inferior in efficiency in laser-induced therapy.",

            "text": "For in vivo imaging, the nanoparticles included cyanine 7 (Cy7) fluorophore labels. The stronger fluorescence intensity in tumor tissues treated with \u03b1-Hed-CS-CD147-NPs indicated the higher targeting efficiency compared to that of \u03b1-Hed-CS-NPs, resulting in greater antitumor efficacy [40]. In addition to Cy7 fluorophores for in vivo NIRF imaging, many studies have used cyanine 5.5 (Cy5.5) fluorophores with chitosan polymer [41]. For example, Na et al. reported the advantages of chitosan-based nanoparticles for liver tumor imaging by comparing Cy5.5-tagged liposome nanoparticles, polystyrene nanoparticles and glycol chitosan-5\u03b2-cholanic acid nanoparticles [42]; they found that glycol chitosan nanoparticles modified with 5\u03b2-cholanic acid were sufficiently stable to maintain their structure in the bloodstream and also exhibited a prolonged blood circulation half-life of 12.2 h, longer than that of other nanoparticles studied (Figure 3). As synthetic fluorescence semiconductor nanocrystals, quantum dots have some advantages over fluorophores in terms of their bright photoluminescence, narrow emission wavelength and excellent photostability without bleaching. Quantum dots encapsulated by chitosan nanoparticles have been reported. For example, Alexandra et al. reported quantum dot cores and tripeptide-modified chitosan organic shells. These nanoparticles were designed for targeting by RGD peptides and imaging via quantum dots. The RGD peptide was conjugated with chitosan and coated onto quantum dots [43]. Although quantum dots have some advantages over fluorophores, there are still some limitations on the design of quantum dot-based nanoparticles in terms of their high reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake and potential toxicity [44]. \n\ndots have some advantages over fluorophores in terms of their bright photoluminescence, narrow emission wavelength and excellent photostability without bleaching.",

Each type of nanoparticle has unique characteristics based on its composition, size, and surface chemistry, that determine its stability, biocompatibility, and interaction with the surrounding environment. Nanoparticles are actively being developed as probes for in vivo tumor targeting, biomolecular profiling of cancers, nanovectors for drug delivery, and various theranostic applications. 2,4 f all the different types of nanoparticles, semiconductor nanocrystals, or QDs, have gained significant attention due to their unique photophysical properties as the nextgeneration fluorophores. QDs are fluorescent 2-10 nm nanocrystals that can be used as alternative probes for a host of diagnostic, therapeutic, and theranostic applications in medical and surgical oncology. 14 Their broad absorption and narrow symmetric emission spectra, large molar extinction coefficients, high quantum yield, and enhanced photostability give them tremendous advantages over traditional fluorophores for biomolecular and cellular imaging in vitro and in vivo. 15 QDs can be size-tuned to emit at near-infrared (NIR, 650-1,000 nm) wavelengths, which are ideal for deep tissue imaging because the biological window is transparent to these wavelengths. This is based on the fact that tissue chromophores like hemoglobin absorb light in the visible spectrum (400-700 nm), leading to scattering, diffraction, and poor penetration through the skin.",

            "text": "herefore, it is desirable to combine the complementary advantages of NIR fluorescence and PA imaging, such as high resolution, high contrast, and large penetration depth, into a single platform, thereby increasing cancer diagnosis accuracy. Recently, a great variety of NIR dual-modality fluorescence and PA imaging contrast agents have been developed, such as activatable cyanine-based probes, 15 PEGylated semiconducting polymer nanoparticles, 16 indocyanine green (ICG)-conjugated mesoporous silica-coated gold nanobipyramids, 17 peptidefunctionalized carbon dots, 18 amorphous Ag 2-x Cu x S quantum dots, 19 and gold and dendritic mesoporous silica-encapsulated lanthanide-doped nanoparticles. 20 espite the tremendous efforts devoted to the development of theranostic agents and their exceptional imaging and therapeutic efficacy demonstrated, biocompatibility and biodegradability remain the most critical issues for in vivo clinical applications. 21,22 When the nanoparticles are administered intravenously, those smaller than 5 nm exhibit rapid renal excretion. 23 In comparison, the nanoparticles ranging from 5 to 200 nm have longer circulation times in the bloodstream before being captured by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). However, if the nanoparticle size exceeds 200 nm, they tend to be filtered out by the MPS in a relatively short time, leading to rapid accumulations in the liver and spleen. 24,25 It is worth noting that the nanoparticles between 30 and 200 nm can be trapped in the tumor lesions with the help of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. 26,27 To be fully removed from the organism after carrying out their functionalities, the biodegradation of the nanoparticles into excretable molecules or ions can help reduce chronic toxicity. 28,29",

Dendritic molecules, such as polyamidoamine (PAMAM), poly(propylene imine) polyamide, polyglycerol (PG) and triazine, are synthesized by assembling monomeric subunits to form uniform tree-like structures that allow for encapsulation of the drug payload in the internal star structure, while the branches can be complexed with functionalities, such as targeting ligands, imaging agents and other drugs (Figure 3d) [13]. Inorganic NPs exhibit photochemical, photothermal and magnetic properties that lend themselves to detection and diagnostic applications (Figure 4). Additionally, their rigid outer surface and the durable core can be complexed with a variety of drug/active agent payloads. Magnetic NPs, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide particles, have been used in image contrast and magnetic resonance to detect the presence of tumors. Modifications to the surface of these molecules, such as coating with surfactants and bioconjugation between the carboxyl and amine groups, make them amenable to complexation with targeting functionalities that can enhance the diagnostic capability of these NPs [14]. Gold NPs have optical and electric properties that can be exploited in tumor imaging [15]. Quantum dots are semiconductor NPs that have narrow emission and a broad range of absorption bands that have been predominantly used in fabricating imaging probes [16]. Gold NPs and quantum dots have been fabricated along with the organic polymers to form hybrid systems that can integrate packaging of the drug/active agent and diagnostic capabilities for effective drug delivery accompanied by real-time monitoring of treatment response and tumor activity [17,18]. Lanthanide-doped NPs are a class of fluorescent NPs that allow for conversion of low energy light, such as near infra-red (NIR), to high energy visible light or UV emission.",

            "text": "Prospects for wide application of quantum dots in medicine is associated with stability of their fluorescence in comparison with of traditional organic fluorophores and with possibilities to prepare multi-colored nanoparticles that are excited by one broad band. 68 It permits to track cellular processes in real time and on the other hand to analyze various parameters simultaneously. Quantum dots have size-and composition-tunable fluorescence from visible to infrared wavelengths, and one light source can be used to excite multiple colors of fluorescence emission. Very large stokes spectral shifts (measured by the distance between the excitation and emission peaks) permit to improve the sensitivity of detection. It is essential since during in vivo molecular imaging processes auto-fluorescence from tissue biomolecules takes place creating high background that interferes the label signal. The Stokes shifts of semiconductor QDs can achieve 300-400 nm. It permits to effectively remove the background signals from tissue auto-fluorescence. Moreover, fluorescence is very sensitive to various changes in external factors and in this aspects this type of nanoparticles can be applied for monitoring of these changes. So, since the fluorescence intensity of QDs is found to correlate with the acidity (or alkalinity) of the environment this property was applied for determination of urea. Urease splits urea and during this reaction pH increasing takes place and in this case intensity of fluorescence of QDs is also changed. These changes correlate with urea concentration. 69 ellular labeling using organic dyes and fluorescent proteins has great success, and modern instrumentation currently allows simultaneous measurement of up to 13 parameters on individual cells. Nevertheless, traditional fluorophores suffer from several problems, such as photo-bleaching, spectral interference from other molecules and narrow band of excitation. 1][72][73] As it was demonstrated the QD-labeled cells are brighter and more resistant to photo-bleaching. In fact, organic dyes are often photo-bleached and fade by 90% in less than one minute, whereas the QDs are stable for more than 30 minutes under identical experimental conditions. Fluorescence immuno-labeling for detection of different molecules in cells is widely used in cell biology. Owing to their robust optical properties, QDs are ideal probes in this area.",

However, preparation of fluorescent organic NPs is challenging due to the problem of self-quenching of the encapsulated dyes. Moreover, the photostability of organic dyes is much lower than that of quantum dots. To address both problems, we studied encapsulation into biodegradable polymer PLGA NPs of perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, which are among the most photostable dyes reported to date. Two PDIs were tested, one bearing bulky hydrophobic groups at the imides, while the other was substituted in both imide and bay regions (Lumogen Red). Encapsulation of the former resulted in aggregation, which was accompanied by the emission color change from green to red, some decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield and a significant drop in the photostability, unexpected for PDI dyes. In contrast, Lumogen Red showed nearly no aggregation inside polymer NPs and maintained high quantum yield and photostability. According to wide-field fluorescence microscopy with a 532 nm excitation laser, our 40 nm PLGA NPs loaded with 1 wt% Lumogen Red were >10-fold brighter than quantum dots (QD-585). These NPs were stable in biological media, including serum, and entered spontaneously into HeLa cells by endocytosis showing no sign of cytotoxicity. Due to excellent photostability, these nanoparticles could be considered as biodegradable substitutes of quantum dots in bioimaging.",

QDs are an exciting material to work with due to their unique optical properties compared to traditional organic fluorescent labels [53]. Organic fluorescent dyes have several drawbacks that have limited their usefulness as molecular imaging tags. Their low photobleaching threshold and broad absorption/emission peak width have hindered their use in long term imaging and multiplexing (detecting multiple labels simultaneously) [54]. QDs have properties that overcome these limitations of the organic fluorescent dyes including high resistance to photobleaching [55], broad-band absorption with narrow emission bands ranging from UV to NIR [56,57], and size tunable emission bands [58,59]. These exceptional optical properties of QDs have made them an exciting field of study for many researchers in search of molecular imaging tools for better cancer diagnosis. A multifunctional nanoparticle with biomolecules conjugated to QDs has been used in cancer targeting and drug delivery [60]. A10 RNA, aptamer that recognizes prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), was conjugated to the QD to target cancer cells [61]. Doxorubicin (DOX), a well known anthracycline drug with fluorescent properties, was intercalated in the conjugate. This conjugate offers an exciting method of imaging cancer cells. The intercalated DOX within A10 RNA conjugated to the QD quenches the fluorescence of both DOX and QD. When the QD-aptamer (DOX) conjugate finds the target cancer biomarker, it is taken into the cancerous cell through endocytosis. When DOX is released from the conjugate, both of them recover their fluorescent properties and thus can be imaged. With this design, the multifunctional nanoparticle can be fabricated so that cancer biomarkers can be detected precisely and the drug is delivered within the cancer cell, giving high specificity (Figure 5). \n\nQDs can be used as signal amplifying agents in ultrasensitive cancer biomarker detection [62].",

Many applications require \ue104uorescence within a speci\ue103c range of wavelengths, selected for the relevant end-use. 2 Nanoparticles engineered for these applications must, therefore, have stable emission that does not change or quench in their intended environment over the period of storage and use. Unlike quantum dots, 3,4 SPNs have emission colors that do not shi\ue09d with the change in their size. [5][6][7] However, if a different emission color is required, the SPNs' parent polymer must be changed or a dopant molecule 8 or further polymer 9 must be introduced within the same nanoparticle during the synthesis process to facilitate inter-chain interactions that result in the required \ue104uorescence change. A key method for tuning the optical properties of SPNs is by preparing polymer blends prior to nanoparticle formation, resulting in what can be referred to as polyblend SPNs. 10 Several studies reported the synthesis of polyblend SPNs from a blend of two conjugated polymers; 11,12 Huebner et al. 12 reported the synthesis of PFO:POPPV SPNs from a blend of a blue emitting (PFO) and a green emitting (POPPV) polymer. The blending resulted in a material with controllable photoemission caused by the tunable energy transfer within the nanoparticles. This energy transfer was also reported by McNeill et al. 11 when blending F8BT with MEH-PPV. The blend caused the total quenching of F8BT emission and an increase in the optical quantum yield of the new MEH-PPV-emitting polyblend SPNs. Color control of polyblend SPNs could pave the way towards the production of white emitting nanoparticles from a blend of polymers with different emission colors, 13 while \ue104uorescence emission enhancement of pre-existing polymer nanoparticles by",

            "text": "Among various bioimaging/biosensing techniques, fluorescence-based methods are generally preferred over absorption [1,2], especially with the ability to detect single photons with avalanche photodiodes and intensified camera systems [3]. One must employ an emissive chromophore such as an organic dye or fluorescent protein; however, they generally suffer from a lack of photochemical stability and may require sophisticated tunable excitation sources. The effect is to reduce researchers' ability to perform OPEN ACCESS studies that require multiplex detection over long timescales [4]. Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals with unique electro-optical properties due to quantum confinement effects [5]. Specifically, they have broad absorption spectra with large extinction coefficients, narrow and tunable photoluminescence (PL), high emission quantum yields, improved resistance against photobleaching, and long fluorescence lifetimes. As a result, QDs are exceptional bioimaging and biosensing tools [6][7][8][9][10]. As a comparison of QDs and organic dyes as fluorescent labels has been discussed in a recent review [11], we only summarize the main differences here. \n\nAlthough the aqueous synthesis of QDs results in instantly water soluble materials, the crystalline quality, quantum yield, and the emission bandwidth of the dots are sub-optimal. On the other hand, the synthesis of hydrophobic QDs in organic solvents imparts a higher quantum yield, enhanced monodispersity, and a narrower emission bandwidth [12]. As such, this review focuses on hydrophobic as-prepared dots. One of the fundamental aspects of manufacturing QD-based sensors is water solubilizing the organic capped QDs and functionalizing them for conjugation to biologicals or organics such as dyes. Furthermore, surface passivation via an inorganic shell that covers the cores can reduce the surface defects significantly and improve the QDs photoluminescence properties [13][14][15]. The core/shell structure also improves the stability of the QDs and reduces cytotoxicity by preventing the leaching of toxic elements, generally cadmium, from the cores.",

PTT agents can enhance the efficiency of localized light-based heating and ablation of tumor tissues and, at the same time, reduce adverse effects. \n\nHigh-performance photo-converted energy-converting biomaterials (H-ECBs) produce heat to kill specific cells, not requiring oxygen to interact with the target cells or tissues, as in photodynamic therapy. The longer the light wavelength, the less energetic and less harmful to healthy cells and tissues surrounding the tumors [34]. Once irradiated, the PTT agents absorb photons' energy, migrating from the ground singlet state to an excited singlet state. As it returns to the ground state, the so-called vibrational relaxation promotes collisions between the excited PPT agents which, in turn, collide with molecules surrounding their microenvironment. As a result, the temperature increases due to the increased kinetic energy [30]. Critical conditions for PTT success are the adequate spectral range, attaining the peak absorption wavelength of the photosensitive agent used in the treatment, and the tissue-penetration depth that can reach the target while reducing the power loss to a minimum [30].",

            "text": "The choice of fluorophore is important in general for all fluorescence based techniques, and in particular for saturable absorption based techniques as the physical properties of the fluorophore are more demanding. Organic molecules have been used successfully in many studies but are prone to photobleaching and are required to be chemically added to the biological system limiting their applicability to living cells. Proteins such as GFP are alternative labelling systems that can be used as genetically encoded markers. Protein mutagenesis offers a method to create fluorophores with tailored optical properties, reducing many of the problems associated with organic molecules. Quantum dots are another class of fluorophore that has been utilised. These materials are very photo-stable, possess a large Stokes shift between their absorption and emission and can be made with a very wide range of wavelengths. Quantum dots are semiconductors made from metals such as cadmium and selenium and are poisonous to living systems. In addition adding quantum dots to biosystems is non-trivial. However, quantum dots have been applied successfully to single tissue sections of biopsies for assessing malignant tumours and in 4Pi and STED microscopy. 57,58 Developments in fluorophore technology are being made in order to improve photostability and enhance fluorescence quantum yield. Widengren et al. have demonstrated a method to chemically retard dye photo-bleaching and increase fluorescence yield. 59 Adding two types of anti-fading molecules, antioxidants and triplet-state quenchers, was shown to increase the quantum yield of fluorescence and photostability of an organic dye molecule.",

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in particular are very attractive candidate nanoparticles to facilitate these \ue104uorescence enhancements because of their high chemical stabilities, high homogeneities, good biocompatibilities 25 and low toxicities. 1 Furthermore, the surface chemistry of AuNPs is well-understood and numerous chemistries are available to facilitate the surface modi\ue103cation of AuNPs. The incident radiation must also be resonant with the absorption transition of the \ue104uorophore. SiQDs are convenient in this case because they possess a featureless absorption spectrum with an absorbance that rises monotonically above the gap ($2 eV in our SiQDs) and therefore it is only necessary to match the excitation wavelength to the plasmon mode of the metal. \n\n7][28] AuNPs have also been successfully fabricated with other \ue104uorophores to prepare nanocomposites with optically active properties, especially in metal-enhanced \ue104uorescence, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, surface plasmon-coupled emission and plasmon-controlled \ue104uorescence systems. 29 Furthermore, there have been several recent impressive reports describing the fabrication of AuNPs with \ue104uorescent dyes 30 or CdSe-type quantum dots 31,32 in various particular research areas. \n\n2][43][44][45][46][47][48] Encapsulation of inorganic species inside polymer matrices affords composite materials which bene\ue103t from the outstanding properties associated with synthetic polymers e.g. their excellent mechanical, chemical, electrical, rheological, magnetic and optical properties. 33",

            "text": "To meet the requirements of NIR-II FLI-assisted PTT theranostics, it is extremely urgent to develop exogenous contrast agents with efficient NIR-II emission and high photothermal effectiveness through precise molecular engineering. Up to now, a variety of inorganic nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes [18], quantum dots [19][20], and rare earth nanoparticles (NPs) [21,22], have been widely explored for NIR-II FLI, but their long-term biotoxicity and minimal biodegradability could substantially hinder their practical applications [23]. Small molecular organic dyes exhibit superiority in the aspect of biocompatibility, but they often suffer from unsatisfactory photostability and limited accumulation capacity [24,25]. In contrast, semiconducting polymers (SPs) with large \u03c0-conjugated architectures exhibit reliable biosafety, strong light-harvesting ability, durable photostability, excellent photothermal conversion ability, etc. They have manifested great talents in the fields of FLI, photoacoustic imaging, and imaging-guided PTT and/or photodynamic therapy [26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33]. In addition, the flexible tunability of the polymer skeleton endows SPs with versatile optical properties and therapeutic properties [34]. Hence, SPs are promising candidates for NIR-II FLI-guided PTT toward antitumor applications. However, currently, the structural diversity SP-based NIR-II emitters are still very limited, and their fluorescence performance still needs to be further improved. \n\nOn the basis of the Jablonski diagram, photoexcited dyes can dissipate their excited state energy through the radiative pathway to benefit fluorescence or through nonradiative channel to boost photothermal conversion. However, the radiative and nonradiative attenuations are 2 competitive channels involved in FLI and photothermal properties. Extending the conjugation length of organic probes or using highly conjugated SPs has been used as a feasible tactic to realize the red shift of emission wavelength.",

            "text": "Targeted micro-and nanoparticle delivery toward tumors and cancer cells is one of the major research trends in the engineering of anti-cancer theranostic and bioimaging agents. Their controlled transportation and release of their content make it possible to reduce and mitigate off-target effects, ensuring smart delivery of drugs, and diagnostic tools (Fay and Scott, 2011;Wanakule and Roy, 2012). Polyelectrolyte microcapsules loaded with anti-cancer drugs, fluorescent dyes, and metal nanoparticles, e.g., magnetic, plasmonic, or fluorescent semiconductor nanoparticles (quantum dots, QDs), offer a promising opportunity for cancer detection and treatment (Gaponik et al., 2004;Zhao et al., 2006;Vergaro et al., 2011). \n\nFluorescently labeled polyelectrolyte microcapsules are widely used for imaging of microcapsule transport and release in vitro and in vivo. The use of QDs as an alternative to conventional, commonly used organic dyes (FITC, TRITC, RITC, etc.) for fluorescent labeling of polyelectrolyte microcapsules results in the formation of highly fluorescent microparticles ensuring their use as promising imaging tools (Gaponik et al., 2003;De Koker et al., 2007;Gao et al., 2016). Quantum dots (QD) attractiveness is explained by their photostability and fluorescent characteristics, including a quantum yield close to 100%, broad absorption spectra, and size-tunable, narrow emission spectra (Bilan et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the chemical composition, size, and surface charge of the semiconductor nanoparticles could limit in vivo use of QDs because of their potential toxicity. Quantum dots (QD) encapsulation into the polymer shell of polyelectrolyte microcapsules is a possible way to prevent the QD toxicity for live cell and improve their biocompatibility (Romoser et al., 2011). \n\nModification of polyelectrolyte microcapsule surface with the biomarkers recognition molecules, such as antibodies (Abs), ensures their specific and selective interaction with the target cells via specific receptors and subsequent internalization.",

            "text": "Of many, some of the CS nanocarriers are containing iron oxide (Fe 3 O 4 ), silicon, quantum dots (QDs), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polylactic acid glycolic acid (PLGA), etc., used for the delivery of anticancer drugs [14][15][16]. Such an incorporation of both metallic particles and anticancer drugs within a single nanoparticulate polymer system in the form of nanocarrier has evoked fascinating outcomes and substantial progress in DDS for cancer diagnosis and treatment. In general, the QDs are semiconductor nanocrystals (NC) made up of atoms or elements from group II-VI or from group III-V with small particles size, which are smaller than exciton Bohr radius. The QDs exhibit unique optical and electronic properties prior to their quantum confinement effect. Most of the metal and semiconductor NPs with particle sizes ranging from 2 to 6 nm have received mounting interest because of their unique size-dependent properties, as well as their dimension that mimics the biological macromolecules [17]. In recent years, QDs have been widely employed as imaging agent rather than other fluorescent nanomaterials and dyes. Briefly, QDs have drawn much attention because of the advantages of multiplex emission with single light excitation with minimal overlap [18]. Additionally, QDs exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties such as high quantum yield, high photostability, broad excitation wavelength-dependent optical emission [19], broad and tunable absorption spectrum extending from the ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared emission (>650 nm), size-tunable light emission broad absorption spectrum, massive stoke shift and resistance to photobleaching [18,20,21]. \n\nThese properties of QDs allow for the simultaneous application in bioimaging cancerous tissues and also act as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy [22].",

However, inorganic nanomaterials suffer from safety issues regarding immune uptake and clearance after imaging [99]. Organic dyes, on the contrary, represent an exceptional alternative, as they offer significant biocompatibility and biosafety advantages, and their fluorescence properties can be controlled by rational chemical structure design. For example, semiconducting polymers and small molecules with an alternating electron deficient group (acceptor, A) and electron abundant group (donor, D) exhibit sharp and strong absorption and emission in the NIR-II window [100][101][102]. The electron acceptor with electron donor groups through \u03c0-bridging moieties. This spatial configuration of strong electron donor groups adjacent to the central electron acceptor serves to reduce the energy gap separating the hybridized levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and shifts the fluorescent emission to the NIR-II region. Reducing the band gap between the HOMO and the LUMO is an effective method to obtain D-A semiconducting molecules [103,104]. Acceptor groups are usually presented by benzobisthiadiazole (BBTD) that has a significant quinoidal character, which allows to improve the delocalization of electrons. For the donor groups, fluorine, thiophene, and their derivatives have been developed to form the D-A-D fluorophores. To make these structures watersoluble, they are either loaded into hydrophilic polymer matrices or conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) [105][106][107][108][109].",

These are semiconductor nanocrystals of <10 nm in size and composed of elements belonging to groups II and VI (Zn, Te, Se, Cd) or group III-V (P, As, In). Because of their nano size, strong quantum confinement effect results in broad absorption band in UV-vis region and narrow emission spectra with tunable optical properties. The optical properties of QDs mainly depends on the constituent material, particle size, disparity (size distribution), type of QDs (core or core-shell quantum dots), and surface chemistry (type of material used for surface passivation). Thus, by manipulating these parameters, one can easily obtain desired optical properties for a specified application [22]. \n\nSilica nanoparticles (Si-NPs) are another class of nanomaterials that has been extensively exploited in fluorescent biosensors. Si-NPs can serve dual function; one is to use silica NPs as a solid support in FRET assay for smooth material handling [23,24] and secondly they can be used to doped with different fluorescent dyes for signal enhancement. Dye doped silica nanoparticles have been used in the detection of nucleic acids, proteins, and pathogens [25][26][27]. Major advantages of using silica NPs in fluorescence biosensors are abundant and non-toxic nature of silicon, ease of conjugation with biomolecules due to high surface to volume ratio of NPs, and that a large number of dye molecules can be incorporated inside the nanoparticles [28]. \n\nAu-NPs are one of the best FRET-based quenchers due to their outstanding optical properties [18,29]. Moreover, Au-NPs are resistant to photobleaching and have stable signal intensities.",

            "text": "Rapidly expanding field of image-guided surgery needs new materials for near-infrared imaging with deep tissue penetration, high brightness and good stability.With the development of nanotechnology, fluorescence nanomaterials, especially with emission in range of nearinfrared spectrum provide excellent candidates for real-time monitoring of surgical procedures with high spatio-temporal resolution and sensitivity [11].Inorganic nanomaterials, such as semiconductor quantum dots, lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles and noble-metal nanoparticles, exhibited outstanding photostability and brightness, presenting great opportunities for longer-term in vivo tracking and imaging.Unfortunately, most fluorescent inorganic nanoparticles are composed of highly toxic heavy metal cations, which raises the concerns of long-term toxicity and limits the further clinical transition [12].In terms of biocompatibility, the organic nanodots derived from the nanoaggregate of luminescent small molecule or polymers are generally considered more favorable than the inorganic nanoparticles [13].However, these organic nanodots suffer from a fundamental problem: the molecules or polymers are packed together so closely that they can be affected by aggregation caused quenching, in which most of the energy coming from the original light source is quickly dissipated and fails to trigger fluorescence.As a result, the brightness of as-prepared organic nanoparticles tends to decrease along with the increase of molecules or polymers doping concentration, which presents a dilemma for fabricating highly bright and photostable organic nanoparticles.A fundamental solution was pioneered in 2001, Tang et al proposed an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) conception.The luminogens with AIE property (AIEgens) are non-emissive in solutions but become highly fluorescent upon aggregate formation because the restriction of the intramolecular rotations (RIR), which make them ideal candidate materials for preparation of highly bright and photostable organic fluorescent nanoparticles.Since the first report of development of organic dots with aggregation-induced emission (AIE dots) for bioimaging, numerous reports suggest that these biocompatible highly bright nanoparticles have the potential to improve conventional therapeutic and imaging capability for disease detection and treatment [14][15][16][17][18]).",

Polymers have always been in demand for their biodegradation and biocompatibility profiles. Polymers are being utilized to improve MR imaging in gliomas, designed on the concept of nanotechnology. One recent study explored the potential of red fluorescent carbonized polymer dots with high internalization in glioma cells along with low toxicity, high photostability and long emission/excitation wavelengths. Such nanoprobes help in real-time image-guided surgery efficiently [186]. Similarly, biocompatible and photostable polymeric NPs decorated with cyclo (Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys (mpa)), to actively target integrin on the tumor cells, were designed, with an ability to absorb near-infrared beams for precise PA imaging and spatiotemporal photothermal therapy. The polymeric NPs pictured glioma at 3-mm depth with a high signal to noise ratio. Hence, polymeric NPs were found to be promising in glioma cell imaging by the PA technique [187]. Semiconducting polymers were developed by the fluorination strategy to yield fluorescence in the precise diagnosis of brain tumor. The bright near-infrared-designed polymer dots yielded three-fold enhanced images compared to non-fluorinated counterparts [188]. False-positive and ambiguous images remain the problem with existing imaging techniques. Hence, a robust strategy was exploited to design a polymeric nanostructure attached to an image contrast agent with an intrinsic T 1 /T 2 dual-mode characteristic. Nanostructure coordination polymers demonstrated low toxicity, high stability and dual T 1 /T 2 contrast ability in the murine glioblastoma model when linked to paramagnetic iron moiety. Furthermore, the bio distribution of the polymeric contrast nanostructure was persistent and gave sharp images with dial mode [189].",

Appropriate conjugated donor and acceptor functional groups were judiciously designed to adjust the fluorescence performance. In addition, pluronic F-127 was further applied to encapsulate AIE-active fluorescent dye and formed water-dispersible nanoparticles. Synthetic AIETP NPs displayed the highest fluorescence emission under the excitation of 1,040 nm, enabling in vivo dual-photo imaging with a penetration depth of 800 \u03bcm on craniotomy-based mouse brains. By using AIETP NPs, a high SNR values of >5 and a very high spatial resolution of 1.92 \u03bcm were finally achieved. Moreover, 2D and 3D images of the cerebral vasculature were also realized.\n\nSemiconducting polymers possess delocalized \u03c0-conjugated backbones and modifiable side chains, which endow them with excellent photophysical properties. Their large extinction coefficients, outstanding photostability, excellent water dispersibility, and biocompatibility make them ideal for bioimaging fluorophores. The absorption and emission of semiconducting polymers are determined by the band gap, so the fluorescence properties can be adjusted by changing the molecular structure of the polymer. Wu et al.

Furthermore, a fluorination strategy was employed to reduce radiative relaxations and enhance the NIR-II fluorescence. As a result, high fluorescence quantum yields ranging from 6.6% to~9.5% were finally achieved, displaying great potential for NIR-II fluorescence imaging. After that, the semiconducting polymer further interacted with PS-PEG-COOH to form colloidally stabilized semiconducting polymers dots (Pdots). By injecting the",

Nanocomposites of organic and inorganic nanoparticles provide novel electrical and optical field properties along with improved mechanical qualities [1]. Therefore, considerable efforts have been devoted to designing novel nanocomposite materials with efficient multipurpose applications, including nanostructures within polymer matrices that decrease transparency and increase refractive index, making them more suitable for light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Specific optical properties can be tailored depending on the applications, e.g., antireflective coatings, which are vital for many optical applications. \n\nDifferent nanoparticle inclusion in polymer-based composites can produce multifunctional nanocomposites for different applications. Polymer properties can be tuned advantageously by selecting suitable nanoparticle inclusions. Incorporating metal oxide or metal nanoparticles into organic polymeric matrices creates new state-of-the-art composite materials, exhibiting improved mechanical, electrical, and optical properties compared with the individual components. Several recent studies have prepared specific multipurpose polymer and metal oxide nanoparticle composites with metaproperties suitable for solar cells, LEDs, photodetectors, UV shielding, supercapacitors, chemical and biosensors, etc. The incorporation of quantum structures into a polymer matrix can provide linear and non-linear optical properties.

            "text": "Nanoparticles provide higher signal intensity than organic dyes, allowing for the detection of targets that are expressed at lower levels [86,87]. In addition, nanoparticles have desirable spectral properties such as flexible excitation bands and tunable fluorescence emission that can be used for multi-spectral imaging. Due to their relatively large surface areas, they are ideal substrates for efficient modification, and can be used to enable multi-valent binding to increase the affinity. There are several promising examples of nanosized materials that have been thoroughly investigated, including quantum dots (QDs), polymeric nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and gold nanoparticles, as shown in Figure 11. Over the past decade, there have been significant advances in the field of nanoparticle-based molecular imaging [88][89][90]. An early demonstration of in vivo targeted imaging was shown by Gao et al. in a mouse model using CdSe-ZnS quantum dots with a co-polymer functionalized surface conjugated to an antibody to target PSMA. In vivo targeting studies of human prostate cancer grown in nude mice demonstrated that the QD probes accumulate in tumors by enhanced permeability, retention, and binding to cancer-specific cell surface targets. Multi-color fluorescence imaging of cancer cells in vivo has been achieved by subcutaneous and systemic injection of QD-tagged cancer cells [91]. Similarly, quantum dot based imaging probes associated with the RGD peptide (QD705-RGD) as a model targeting system was suggested by Cai et al. in an in vivo murine xenograft study targeting \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 [92]. While in vivo imaging of QDs has been shown to be highly efficacious because of their superior brightness and photostability, the potential for future clinical use is mitigated by concern for long-term toxicities generated by traces of heavy metals. Therefore, metal-free systems would be preferable, provided that they exhibit comparable optical properties.",

            "text": "Semiconducting polymer particles and nanoparticles with optical properties are of considerable importance for applications in a diverse range of technologies including light-emitting diodes (Wong, 2017), solar cells (Zhou et al., 2014;Jana et al., 2017), biosensing (Wu and Chiu, 2013;Chan and Wu, 2015;Xu et al., 2015), and cancer phototherapy (Li et al., 2018;Meng et al., 2018). Advantages of polymer particles include generally good optically stability, relatively routine preparation through emulsion polymerization or precipitation routes (Pecher and Mecking, 2010), and ready functionalization for different applications (Feng et al., 2013). \n\nSome work has addressed the size dependence of the optical properties of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles but there is no conclusive narrative linking size to optical properties. In some experiments considering nanoparticles of different diameters, there was only limited evidence of size-dependent optical behavior (Lin et al., 2017;Peters et al., 2018). In experiments concerning polythiophenes (Kurokawa et al., 2004;Lee et al., 2010) and a polyfluorene copolymer (Pras et al., 2010) it was observed that smaller particles induce a blue shift in the emission spectra. By way of contrast however, decreasing nanoparticle size has led to a red shift in emission spectra of a poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) derivative (Sun et al., 2014), an observation that is not supported by experiments in which a different PPV derivative were allowed to aggregate in solution (Grey et al., 2006). Aggregated particles are therefore expected to behave differently to individual particles and one can therefore suppose that chain conformation and packing within the particles play an important role in their optoelectronic behavior. Indeed, this conclusion was reached by considering size-dependent brightness, which increased with increasing particle size less than would be expected by considering the number of fluorophores present in the volume (Sun et al., 2014).",

Also, in vivo study revealed the significant accumulation of developed nanoparticulate system preferentially in tumor tissue along with non-invasive fluorescence imaging for effective monitoring of PDT in mice model. Another researcher, Murakami et al. explored that the semiconducting and metallic-enriched single-walled CNTs are efficient to generate reactive oxygen species under the influence of NIR light (808 nm) irradiation [29]. The investigator reported in his findings that the semiconducting-enriched single-walled CNTs showed stronger photodynamic effects compared to the metallic-enriched single-walled CNTs.",

Carbon nanotubes, encapsulated organic dyes and Ag 2 S quantum dot contrast agents have required exposure times of 100 ms and may even exceed 200 ms for video-rate imaging 2-5 . The instrument overhead time for normal video-rate imaging is B80 ms and results in a frame rate of 5.3 FPS at a typical NIR-II exposure time of 100 ms. The donor-acceptor NIR-II polymer with a nominal 1.4% quantum yield allowed ultra-fast videos at B20 ms exposure times and frame rates of 25 FPS 1 . The CH-4T complex was able to easily capture ultra-fast videos under 1.5-2 ms exposure times at 50 FPS, which is virtually at the maximum possible frame rate of our imaging system (52 FPS) given the instrument overhead time of 19 ms under ultra-fast imaging conditions. Even though CH-4T has a significant higher brightness than the NIR-II polymer, the achievable frame rate with CH-4T is only double that of the polymer as the instrument overhead time is now the main factor limiting the time in-between frames 1 .\n\nHowever, designing faster fluorescent NIR-II imaging systems through hardware and software modifications could theoretically yield frame rates surpassing 500 FPS given the 1.5-2 ms exposure time of the CH-4T complexes. Such a high-brightness dye additionally allows the detection of deeper features in the body as evidenced by the clear resolution of the lumbar lymph nodes. As the excitation power density drops off when penetrating deeper into the body, high quantum yield NIR-II fluorophores are necessary to generate sufficient fluorescent signal. Although previous materials such as carbon nanotubes or CH-PEG can clearly discern more shallow features with a high degree of clarity due to minimal scattering, they have an insufficient quantum yield to",

Variations in tissue characteristics such as blood volume, flow rate, or hypoxia between cancerous and healthy tissues generate endogenous optical contrast, facilitating the detection of cancer cells. \n\nHowever, the low sensitivity resulting from background noise poses a significant challenge in optical imaging. 68 To address this limitation, exogenous optical contrast agents have been developed to enhance sensitivity and specificity by altering the absorption, scattering, or fluorescence properties of target tissues compared to normal tissues. 69 1][72][73][74][75][76][77] In this section of the review, we showcase recent examples of nanogel-based theranostic agents incorporating various anticancer optical imaging agents. Additionally, we explore the influence of stimuli-responsive properties of nanogels on drug delivery and optical imaging efficiency. While select examples are discussed in detail to underscore the promising prospects of this theranostic modality, an exhaustive list of reported examples to date is provided at the conclusion of this section (Table 2). \n\nSemiconductor quantum dots (QDs) represent light-emitting nanosized particles ranging from 2 to 10 nm, and have been extensively studied for cellular and in vivo imaging applications. 78 The remarkable potential of QDs in bioimaging stems from their unique optical properties, including photostability, broad absorption spectra, and well-defined narrow emission profiles. 79 2][83][84] The exceptional optical properties of QDs render them excellent candidates for engineering theranostic nanogels with optical imaging capabilities. In a notable study in 2011, Jayakumar and coworkers developed QD-incorporated chitin theranostic nanogels. 85 These nanogels efficiently loaded bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein, with the particle size of the nanogels varying proportionally to the amount of loaded BSA. Remarkably, the encapsulated BSA was completely released within 5 days under both acidic and neutral environments. Furthermore, the QD-chitin nanogels retained their luminescence for over 24 hours post-internalization, highlighting their potential for prolonged imaging applications.",

            "text": "The Quantum Dots (QDs) are fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals of about 10 nm, composed of a core coated with an envelope. QD-containing NPs represent an approach in cancer medical imaging, cancer cell tracking, cancer photodynamic therapy, and cancer diagnosis. They are contrast agents and have tumor imaging properties. When injected into the body, they infiltrate cancerous sites and produce images of these sites. The toxicity of QDs limits their use for in vivo applications. Thus appropriately coated, QDs can be rendered non-toxic in biological media. Polymer-coated QDs have properties of biocompatibility, solubility, targeting cancerous cells and drug delivery. QDs based on a core with lead sulfide (PbS) and shell with cadmium sulfide (CdS) and covered with PEG, emitting at about 1600 nm allow 3D tumor fluorescence imaging in vivo [97,98]. QDs can target specific receptors. Folate is vital for cell growth; the folate receptor is overexpressed in the cancer cell. QDs conjugated to folate are used to diagnose cancer. QDs have higher optical properties than organic dyes. They are photostable and possess quantum properties with excitation and emission of light in the NIR. The signal emitted is 100 times more intense than fluorescent dyes allowing deep tissue analysis [99,100]. When placed in the body and illuminated by light, QDs heat the surrounding tissue allowing hyperthermic cancer therapy. Considering that hyperthermia between 42\u00b0C and 45\u00b0C induces cell apoptosis while a temperature above 45\u00b0C causes cell necrosis. In photodynamic cancer therapy, QDs react with molecular oxygen producing peroxides and hydroxyl radicals, which lead to the death of cancer cells [101,102].",

            "text": "The NIR window has been extensively employed for deep tissue imaging at the sacrifice of imaging contrast as the absorption of intrinsic chromophores in the NIR region is low. Therefore, contrast agents are in great demand for NIR PAI. So far, metallic NPs, small organic molecules, organic NPs, semiconducting polymer (SP) NPs, carbon materials, fluorescent proteins, RGs, etc., have been demonstrated as PA contrast agents. 86,91,118 These can be used either by targeting a specific receptor/protein or can be used as nontargeted passive imaging agents. Nontargeted imaging agents may extravasate from the blood stream due to increased vascular permeability or the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in tumor tissue, whereas targeted imaging agents target a specific molecule, such as receptors, proteins, or enzymes. 148 lthough all contrast agents have their own absorption wavelengths and abundant choices of materials for PAT contrast agents, 149 not all choices can be considered useful for PA probes. Photostability, renal clearance, optical absorption, and photothermal conversion efficiency are four vital parameters for assessing effective contrast agents, and therefore, they should be taken into consideration when designing new materials. \n\nCommonly used contrast agents can be classified into (a) inorganic agents, such as metallic NPs or carbon-based nanomaterials, and (b) organic agents, such as organic dyes and SP NPs. A few of the probes discussed later in this review are sorted by material and their peak absorption wavelengths and shown in Fig. 1(b). Inorganic agents show high photothermal conversion efficiency and photostability, whereas organic agents show good biocompatibility and biodegradability. In this section, metallic NPs are discussed first, followed by organic dyes and organic NPs. Semiconducting polymer NPs, and carbon-based nanomaterials are presented at the end of this section.",

            "text": "It is of great value to be able to observe sole molecules in living cells (Pinaud et al., 2010). This is, as it may sound, naturally a hard target, especially in the case of a drug molecule, since the process can inversely affect the molecule's selectivity or activity due to interactions with the tracer or probe species. Therefore, choosing the functional group which leads to minimum disruptive effects on the functions of the molecules could be critical to be able to use covalent conjugation (Byrne et al., 2007). In few recent cases, the pharmaceutical molecules were conjugated to fluorophores (Uddin et al., 2010), yet this is neither always possible nor free from disadvantages (e.g. photobleaching) (Resch-Genger et al., 2008). \n\nSemiconducting nanoparticles can be used in this case, due to their distinctive optical properties (e.g. long fluorescence lifetimes and controlled sizes) in comparison to common dyes (Michalet et al., 2005;Rosenthal et al., 2011). Surface engineering and biofunctionalization of nanoparticles have added to the potentials of these particles for use as cellular probes applicable in the case of biomolecules (Biju et al., 2010;Zrazhevskiy et al., 2010). The fluorescence signal of nanoparticles can be monitored, in vivo, for the determination of properties such as specific targeting and drug release rates. Zhuo et al. (2019) suggested a new procedure for preparation of iron-doped carbon quantum dots (Fe-CQDs) as bioimaging agents. The procedure constituted hydrothermal carbonization, and the reagents used were ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) salts and ferric nitrate. These quantum dots contain dopamine-bonding Fe sites and luminescent carbon quantum dots (fluorophores). Cell-imaging studies revealed high photostability and low cytotoxicity on the part of the quantum dots, indicating their fitness for biological applications.",

            "text": "Quantum dots (QDs) are promising probes for incorporation into MEF based biosensors both in the visible and NIR range. 62 As a result of quantum confinement, QDs possess several advantages over organic dyes, such as a long excitedstate lifetime, high photostability and high quantum yields. In addition to this, QD emissions can be tuned across a wide range of wavelengths, and multiple dots of different emission wavelengths can be stimulated by a single light source, reducing the requirement for more than one excitation per different fluorophore. Beneficially, the bandwidths of QDs are narrow and, as such, can reduce the spectral overlap between different quantum dot emissions, which allows for potential multiplexing and detection of multiple discrete signals. 63 Typically, the choice of QDs suitable for in vivo biomedical applications is limited, due to concerns about high toxicity. 64 However, this concern can be largely dismissed when considering biosensing on a chip substrate (in vitro). Ag 2 S QDs are an attractive option for use in biosensing due to their optical properties in the near infrared regime. Their size-dependent excited-state optical properties were systematically investigated by Yejun Zhang et al. in 2014, 65 demonstrating that they may be tuned across NIR. Similarly, in 2015, Ag 2 S and Ag 2 S/SiO 2 QDs were prepared covering a wide spectral window from 500 to 1200 nm by Tang et al., which were successfully conjugated to a tumor-avid peptide (Fig. 3D). 66 Since then, Ag 2 S quantum dots have been incorporated into numerous MEF systems. For example, in 2016 I.G Theodorou et al. demonstrated significant fluorescence intensity enhancement of these probes in the NIR-II region when coupled with Au nanotriangular structures 67 (Fig. 3E). As the quantum yield of QDs is lower in the NIR range than in the UV or visible regions, MEF is beneficial in allowing for their wider application. Beyond just Ag 2 S, additional quantum dots have been investigated. For example, Au nanoparticles have been shown to enhance NIR II fluorescence of PbS quantum dots by a factor of 2. 68",

Zhu et al. designed SPNPs with core SPs, middle silica layer, and outer PEG corona for enhancing the in vivo NIR fluorescence molecular imaging. Multilayered nanostructures not only allow the lymph nodes tracking but also allow for sensitive tumor imaging. [269,272] Chao et al. designed SPNPs via self-assembling from an amphiphilic semiconducting oligomer (ASO) for photoacoustic and fluorescence dual-modal imaging. The fluorescent intensity of tumor area increased gradually with time after tail vein injection of ASO, which suggests that ASO passively targeted to the tumor site by EPR effect. [270] he concept of biosensors was proposed in the 1960s, and comprehensively and deeply researched in the 1980s. [273] The nanofluorescent biosensor is a new analytical system that uses fluorescent nanomaterials as carriers with the fluorescent signal as the detection object. As we mentioned above, a wide variety of FNPs show the superior optical properties, such as bright fluorescence, high photostability, and excellent biocompatibility to be applied for the construction of fluorescent biosensor platforms. [15,274] For example, Shi et al. designed a nanomedicine, called \"sense-act-treat\" system, which combined a ratiometric pH sensor with therapeutic gold nanocage. This design could \"sense\" the tumor through two-state switching of fluorescence and further provide chemotherapy and hyperthermia for tumor treatment, showing the future potential application in cancer diagnosis and therapy.

These materials are often employed in the design of biosensors for diagnostic applications, and also some derivatives have been studied in the context of drug delivery. Carbon nanostructures (~1-3 nm diameter, (Chen, et al., 2003)), such as single-or multiwalled carbon nanotubes, carbon nanospheres, extended carbon nanocube networks, etc., possess interesting physical properties suitable for applications in nanotechnology, electronics, and optics. They are highly stable and versatile in terms of their structural conformation, charge, strength, flexibility, etc. (Cheung, et al., 2010). This material can also be functionalized with drugs and/or biomolecules for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductors fabricated from a combination of metals and non-metals (Choi & Frangioni, 2010). These nanoparticles (~2-10 nm diameter) have unique photophysical properties, e.g., upon excitation they emit fluorescence that is brighter and more stable than that of traditional fluorophores, and their size can be varied to achieve excitation and emission at different wavelengths. They can be detected with high sensitivity, which along with their stability, provides an ideal ground for the design of ex vivo screening technologies, such as the case of effective diagnosis of genetic diseases (Bailey, et al., 2009). Metal nanoparticles are also used in biosensors due to their charge, high sensitivity, and output stability. Gold is often used for imaging and biosensing due to its biocompatibility and unique optical sensitivity (Cai, et al., 2008). Phosphor particles contain rare earth metals and have similar characteristics as QDs, being highly photostable and rendering virtually no autofluorescence, yet their larger size limits their applications (Corstjens, et al., 2005).",

            "text": "It is interesting to note that PEG-b-PLGA forms a stable polymeric micellar nanoparticle in an aqueous environment (denoted as OTN-PNP). A facile synthesis based on nanoprecipitation was performed and the photostability was enhanced by adding an organic fluorophore, di(thiophene-2-yl)-diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) encapsulated within OTN-PNPs. The influence of the molecular weight of the copolymers on the stability of the polymer micellar NPs in aqueous media and the emission intensity of IR-1061 in the polymer NP were studied. In this study, it was concluded that OTN-PNPs with a higher molecular weight of PLGA cores showed higher emission and stability under physiological conditions. \n\nTheranostic nanomedicine is recently emerging as a novel treatment that combines therapeutic and imaging functionalities in a single platform. In recent years, many research efforts have been invested in achieving this objective. The resulting nanosystems, capable of diagnostics, drug delivery, and therapeutic response monitoring, are expected to play an important role in the emerging field of customized medicine [254]. The fact that many nanoplatforms are already imaging agents makes it easy to build these new agents with additional built-in functionality. Its surface chemistry allows it to easily incorporate pharmaceuticals and advertise them as theranostic nanosystems. Nanoparticle-based theranostics, a descendant of the two aforementioned approaches, is still in the early stages of development. Nanoparticle-based imaging and therapy are struggling to make it to clinical trials. However, nanoparticle-based theranostics has already gained interest due to the impetus provided by advances in nanotechnology and the need for more individualized therapy. Some research groups have already been working on different NPs such as silicon NPs, quantum dots (QDs), or gold NPs [255].",

            "text": "Fluorescence bioimaging, labeling, and detection require fluorescence probes for studying complex and dynamic cellular processes [1]. The current widely studied and applied probes can be classified as (1) organic molecular probes including fluorescein derivatives [1], rhodamines [1] and cyanine dyes [1] and (2) inorganic probes including quantum dots (QD) [1] and upconversion nanoparticles [2][3][4]. Traditional organic molecular probes usually exhibit poor photostability when applied in longterm monitoring of live cells. The inorganic probes such as QDs are considered as alternative probes due to their excellent optical properties, such as high photostability, narrow emission, and high brightness. However, the inherent toxicity of QDs mainly from the heavy metal cores with cadmium ions is a significant concern for long-term bioapplications [5][6]. Also the QDs require suitable surface modification to enable their applications in biological fields. Due to these setbacks, there is a growing need for the development of new fluorescent probes. \n\nOn the other hand, along with the successful development of organic and polymeric materials for light emitting diodes (OLED and PLED), many highly fluorescent organic compounds, oligomers, and polymers having better photostability than the traditional organic fluorescent probes were synthesized [7,8]. However, many of these materials are insoluble in water, limiting their bioapplications. In general, three approaches have been utilized to enable their applications in biological fields. The first approach is a chemical modification of compounds/polymers with water soluble segments or moieties [9][10][11][12][13][14][15]; the second approach is the preparation of organic/polymer nanoparticles through a polymer precipitation approach [16][17][18][19][20]; the third way utilizes micelles formed from amphiphilic block copolymers to encapsulate hydrophobic organic molecules and polymers to enable their applications in biological environments [21][22][23][24][25].",

            "text": "Semiconducting NPs known as quantum dots (QDs) have been developed and used in fluorescence-based cytokine assays as alternatives for the traditional fluorescent dyes made from organic compounds. QDs represent a variety of inorganic compounds with core-shell structures. Examples include CdS/ZnS, CdSe/ZnS, CdSe/CdS, InAs/CdSe, ZnSe/CdSe, and CdTe/CdSe NPs. QDs are typically hydrophobic and, therefore, the core-shell complex is treated with polymeric or other hydrophilic coating layers in order to make them water soluble. The extended QD constructs also have chemical functionalization groups or biological moieties to equip them with the specificity needed in immunoassays. The final size of the QD complexes is 10-15 nm or even larger, and can reach the size range of a macromolecule [101]. Compared to traditional dyes, QDs can be excited with a broad band for absorption and, yet, their emission peaks are very narrow and symmetric, exhibiting large Stokes shift values of 300-400 nm. The absorption and emission spectra of several QDs are compared to traditional dyes in Figure 12. QDs can be fabricated to have absorption-emission wavelengths from near UV to near IR. Their quantum yield is high, while resisting photobleaching. QDs are also known to have longer lifetimes and higher photostabilities (~3 orders of magnitude larger) than organic dyes. All of these improvements by the use of QDs can lead to better fluorescence sensitivity in cytokine detection than traditional fluorophores [102][103][104]. Six different cytokines of TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, IL-6, MIP-1\u03b2, IL-13 and IL-1\u03b2 were detected down to the pM concentration level in a study testing the ability of QD fluorophores to detect [101]. The assays were carried out in a Tris-buffer with a total of ~4 h of incubation time by using a QD probe of QD655.",

            "text": "Nanomaterials could be synthesized by tricky mechanical or industrial processes. \u221222 Despite these trivial nanomaterials synthesized by either bottom-up or top-down methods, there are few nanoscale materials like upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), metal\u2212 organic frameworks (MOFs), molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), porous organic polymers (POPs), and fluorescent organic nanomaterials (FONs) that have a significant role in the detection of residual pesticides. We have designated these nanomaterials as non-trivial nanomaterials. These non-trivial nanomaterials have an immense impact on the optical detection of pesticides. In this perspective, guided by this synthetic methodology and ease of discussion, we have classified the nanomaterials into two categories: trivial and non-trivial nanomaterials (Figure 3). \n\nNanomaterials are the unbeaten driver on the highway of optical detection over other probes like small molecules, 20 covalent-organic frameworks, 2,3 and macrocycles 2,3 due to large surface-to-volume ratios, unique photochemical properties, unfamiliar target binding features, diverse composition and shape, outstanding selectivity, and amazing sensitivity to residual pesticides and food contaminants. 1 During the past decade, not only trivial nanomaterials but also nanoscale non-trivial materials have had a prevalent endowment in the field of optical  detection of pesticides. A comprehensive discussion is delineated in the subsequent sections. \n\n1.1.1. Trivial Nanomaterials. Among various kinds of trivial nanomaterials, three major classes, namely, quantum dots, nanoparticles, and nanocomposites, have extensive applications in the optical detection of pesticides. Quantum dots are excellent fluorescent labels for their high extinction coefficient, sizedependent emission behaviors, and almost zero photobleaching behaviors. 23 On the other hand, nanoparticles composed of metallic (single metal, bimetallic, and metal oxide), nonmetallic, and metalloid nanoparticles have excellent efficacy in high sensitivity optical detection of pesticides in the presence and absence of coating of fluorescent organic moieties on the surface.",

            "text": "However, the material itself has poor biocompatibility, and it is prone to fluorescence aggregation quenching or quenching by water in a physiological environment [13,14]. Semiconducting polymers also have many excellent characteristics, for example, good photostability and photothermal performance, easy functional modification of the surface of the material, and good biocompatibility. However, the molecular weight is not easy to control during the preparation process, and the metabolic mechanism in the human body is still unclear [15,16]. \n\nFluorescent polymer nanomaterials are prepared by physically doping or chemically bonding amphiphilic block polymers and fluorescent functional materials [17,18]. The composite material has the characteristics of good optical stability and wide application range of functional fluorescent materials. Additionally, it is also possible to select polymer monomers with different functions; while retaining the good water solubility and excellent biocompatibility of polymer nanomaterials, the controllable synthesis of properties such as size, morphology, stability, and surface properties can be achieved [19,20]. The complementary advantages of the two provide new ideas for expanding the application range of fluorescent functional materials in the field of biomedicine and have attracted the extensive attention of scientific researchers [21][22][23]. \n\nIn summary, this paper discusses the functionalization strategy of fluorescent polymers and the preparation methods for fluorescent polymer nanomaterials. It also systematically introduces the research and development status and application prospects of fluorescent polymer nanomaterials based on rare earth luminescent materials, semiconducting polymers, and small organic molecules from recent years. It is emphasized that the design and application of fluorescent polymer nanomaterials should be functionalized from the perspective of synthesis and optimization according to need. Finally, the development direction and challenges of polymer nanomaterials in the fields of optics and medical tumors are prospected.",

            "text": "Fluorescent dyes are chemical compounds that emit light upon absorbing light or other electromagnetic radiation energy. Traditional fluorescence sensors based on metal or organic dyes for catecholamine detection have been in use for decades [179,180]. However, several new categories of neurochemical sensors have been incorporated in this field. Carbon nanomaterials have stimulated much interest in optical electronics due to their extraordinary structures and physiochemical properties. SWCNTs wrapped with synthetic biomimetic polymers have been used for selective detection of DA in the near-infrared region utilizing corona phase molecular recognition, a mediated interaction between DA and SWCNT corona using the pinned polymer [181,182]. Chen et al. also reported a GObased, photoinduced charge transfer, label-free near-infrared fluorescent biosensor for DA. Their detection mechanism relies on the significant quenching of near-IR fluorescence GO with a left shift attributed to attached DA [183]. Quantum dots (QDs) are nanometer-sized fluorescent crystals made from semiconductor materials that exhibit unique luminescent properties. Compared with traditional fluorescent reporters or organic dyes, QDs are reported to be 20 times brighter and exhibit size-dependent emission properties [184,185]. A nano biosensor for in vivo AA analysis based on nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) and CoOOH nanosheets was reported recently [186]. The strong fluorescence emission at 445 nm displayed by NGQDs is suppressed by the CoOOH nano-quencher. AA can be detected by an increase in fluorescence intensity at 445 nm because AA effectively reduces CoOOH to Co 2+ , and thus removes the quenching effect. However, many QDs are highly toxic and not appropriate for in vivo studies. To address this problem, the development of simple and nontoxic methods for neurochemical sensing is highly desired. Conjugated polymer nano particles (CPNPs) are a more biocompatible option than QDs, with superior photostability. A CPNP for fluorescence sensing of DA in the ventricles of zebrafish larvae brains was developed [187].",

            "text": "Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), also called nanocrystals (NCs), have gained increasing attention in the past decade [1][2][3]. They have been widely investigated because of their potential use in sensors [4], laser materials [5], thinfilm light-emitting devices (LEDs) [6][7][8], and biological labels. Among numerous possible applications of QDs, biological labeling will be pointed out [9,10]. QDs exhibit larger photostability than organic dyes used routinely, since narrow excitation spectra of conventional dye molecules make difficult simultaneous excitation in most cases. However, QDs display size-dependent tunable florescence (FL) with broad excitation spectra and narrow emission band widths, which span the visible spectrum. This property of QDs allows simultaneous excitation of several particle sizes at a single wavelength, and therefore they facilitate multicolor experiments [11][12][13][14]. In addition, QDs have high photochemical stability, excellent resistance to chemical degradation and photodegradation, and good florescence quantum yields. \n\nFor most biological applications of QDs, their water solubility is indispensable. Three different approaches can be used to prepare water-soluble semiconductor QDs: ligand exchange [15,16], encapsulation into a water-soluble shell (i.e., the silica or phospholipids) [17,18], and surface coating with polymers [19,20]. In comparison, silica encapsulation produces good stability but with larger sizes which are about tens of nanometers to several micrometers [21]. In ligand exchange, the stability of the nanocrystals is limited by the stability of ligands on the QD surfaces. The proper choice of ligand is therefore crucial in order to achieve functionality and retain the optical properties of the QDs, and it usually limits the final application range of the QDs [22]. In this context, polymers may be used as suitable substitutes for the small organic ligand molecules due to their good stability on the surface of QDs [23].",

            "text": "Semiconducting quantum dots have been in use for almost three decades now. However, they continue to inspire several new researches and applications every day. The commercialization of the Quantum dots (QDs) variant of ultra-high-definition (UHD) televisions opened up a vast market for quantum dots in display technology [1,2], as well as generated a great deal of public interest regarding QDs. Ultrasensitive solution-cast quantum dot photodetectors are also gaining importance [3]. \n\nQuantum dots (QD) are novel semiconducting materials which possess excitons confined to three dimensions, a typical example being the cadmium-selenide binary alloy (Cd-Se). When this type of quantum dot is prepared and placed in a suitable medium as a suspension, it disperses and fluoresces strongly in the visible region, with its fluorescence quantum efficiency comparable to that of the conventional organic laser dyes. However, they differ starkly because the absorption and re-emission in a dye are a result of the delocalization of the \u03c0 electronic cloud, whereas in the case of the quantum dot, it is due to excitons. The optical properties of the type-II band engineered quantum dots [CdTe/CdSe (core/shell) and CdSe/ZnTe (core/shell) heterostructures] are unique. The spatial distribution of the carriers can be controlled within the type-II quantum dots, which enables these QDs to be used in many applications, such as photovoltaics and photoconduction devices. \n\nThese nanocrystal quantum dots present unique optical and physical properties that intermediate between molecules and bulk crystals and are strongly dependent on the particle size [3][4][5][6][7]. In these types of nanomaterials, a higher percentage of atoms are found on the surface than in the bulk: therefore, the ratio between the surface area and volume is unusually high. For instance, when the CdSe particle size drops from 10 nm to 1 nm, the ratio of the surface area to volume changes from 0.2 to 1 [8,9].",

            "text": "[81]\n\n[82] [83] In addition to contrast enhancement, different functionalities for measuring biological responses have been studied using organic nanostructures.Miao et al., developed a pH-sensitive nanoprobe using a semiconducting oligomer (SO) [84].By synthesizing a boron-dipyrromethene dye with SO, the proposed nanoprobes were activated by the pH values of the biological tissues.The synthesized SO nanoprobes exhibited distinguishable PA responses, depending on the pH of the surrounding environment (Figure 2a).They delivered SO nanoprobes into HeLa xenograft tumors in mice and measured the PA signal differences with excitation wavelengths of 680 and 750 nm.The resulting images showed tumor-specific signals because the pH of the tumor was lower than that of the normal tissue surrounding it (Figure 2b).As a representative example of an activable probe, Reinhardt et al., developed a series of nanoprobes for the detection of nitric oxide (NO) [85].The optical absorption peak shifted from 770 nm to 680 nm in the presence of NO (Figure 2c,d).The activation of the nanoprobe was verified by measuring the multispectral PA responses before and after injection of the developed nanoprobes into the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation mouse model.The results showed significant signal enhancement compared with the control group.By visualizing NO levels in biological tissues, the role of NO in tumor progression can be elucidated in the future.\n\nSemiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have been developed as PA agents owing to their superior light absorption and photostability.In particular, organic semiconducting perylene diimide (PDI) was used because of its good chemical, thermal, and optical stability, as well as its good biocompatibility.Cui et al., developed PDI-based nanoparticles that could detect early thrombi [86].They added cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (cRGD) peptides, which have a high binding ability to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa generated from the early thrombus (Figure 2e).",

            "text": "Quantum dots (QDs), tiny light-emitting particles on the nanometer scale, are emerging as a new class of fluorescent probes for cancer cell imaging and molecular profiling. In comparison with organic dyes and fluorescent proteins, QDs have unique optical and electronic properties, such as size-tunable light emission, improved signal brightness, resistance against photobleaching, and simultaneous excitation of multiple fluorescence colors. These properties are most promising for improving the sensitivity of molecular imaging and quantitative cellular analysis by one to two orders of magnitude. Recent advances have led to multifunctional nanoparticle probes that are highly bright and stable under complex biological conditions. A new structural design involves encapsulating luminescent QDs with amphiphilic block copolymers, and linking the polymer coating to tumortargeting ligands and drug-delivery functionalities. Polymer-encapsulated QDs are essentially nontoxic to cells and animals, but their long-term in vivo toxicity and degradation need more studies that are careful. Nonetheless, bioconjugated QDs have raised new possibilities for ultrasensitive and multiplexed imaging of molecular targets in living cells, animal models, and, possibly, in human patients.",

            "text": "As a top-down coating approach, the use of biological materials is able to bestow synthesized nanoparticles with native cell functionalities [25]. In particular, by extracting the entire membrane from single cells and then linking cell membranes components to the surface of nanoprobes, all biologically relevant surface moieties are transferred and maintained for the biomimetic nanoplatform, such as their biocompatibility, retention of cellular properties, and adaptability [26][27][28]. For example, nanoparticles coating with red blood cell membrane can prolong their circulation time and reduce the accelerated blood clearance [29,30]. In addition, it was discovered that nanoprobes coated with active cell membranes can open a new avenue for passing BBB and targeting glioma [31,32]. Therefore, due to the preserved antigen and cell membrane structure, biomimetic nanoprobes can acquire special functions such as ligand recognition and targeting, long blood circulation and immune escape [33], providing a promising way for the diagnosis of brain tumors. \n\nFurther, multifunctional nanoprobes can serve as the contrast agents for high-sensitivity brain tumor detection [31,34]. In particular, semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) have received extensive attention in biomedicine due to their outstanding biocompatibility, superior photostability, attractive optoelectronic properties, and abundant functional groups [35][36][37]. More importantly, luminescent conjugated polymers with NIR-II fluorescence properties were inspected, which were able to offer significant improvement for real-time imaging and glioma detection [38][39][40]. For example, Wu et al. developed NIR-II aggregation-induced emission (AIE) active Pdots with enhanced NIR-II fluorescence for through-skull mouse-brain imaging [41]. However, Pdots as exogenous materials, are easily identified by the immune system and quickly cleared by the liver and kidney before they can be transported into the brain [42]. Besides, pure Pdots have difficulties in crossing BBB, showing no specific targeting to brain tumor tissue.",

            "text": "In nanotechnology area, the \"nano\" appears to be a prefix for other sciences/technologies to highlight its integration with the merged field, in which the operation size range become an order of nanometer (1-100 nm) at a molecular level. In fact, due to the big ratio of surface-to-volume and quantum confinement effects, the most of material properties (e.g., electronic, optical, chemical, mechanical, and magnetic) differ from bulk materials when their sizes reach to nanoscale (Biju et al. 2008;Warburton 2002;Sharma et al. 2009). Such an approach has significantly promoted their scientific use in different applications such as military and optical electronic device (Kershaw et al. 2000;Wang et al. 2008c) and biological implementations such as bioimaging and biosensing (Ravindran Girija Aswathy et al. 2010;Debbage and Jaschke 2008;Frasco and Chaniotakis 2009;Hempen and Karst 2006;Willard et al. 2006), as well as bio-targeting (Gao et al. 2005;WeiboCai et al. 2007). From bioimaging and biosensing viewpoints, a nano-scaled particle can be categorized as an organic dye fluorophores and inorganic (i.e., semiconductor quantum dot (QD) (Mazumder et al. 2009) and metallic nanoparticle (NP) (Klaine et al. 2008;Suchita Kalele et al. 2006). The organic dyes were used for biological applications even though their efficiency was not high enough, perhaps due to narrow absorption spectrum. In fact, for the excitation, a tunable and fine wavelength of source is essential. The wide emission spectrum can cause aggregation of nanoparticles and overlap among different spectra. Moreover, the lack of photo-stability, photo-bleaching, and the variation of properties with the alteration of environment are other drawbacks of organic dyes (Murcia et al. 2008;Yu et al. 2006;Gao et al. 2005). Most problems associated with the organic dye fluorophores have been resolved by the emergence of QDs or NPs.",

            "text": "Because of its effectiveness as a cancer treatment technique, PDT is becoming more popular. Organic photosensitizers used in PDT have a number of drawbacks, including high toxicity, non-selectivity for tumors, and low light absorption. Low light penetration into tumor areas due to low absorption wavelength and long-term skin photosensitivity. As a result, non-toxic inorganic photosensitizers such as noble metal nanoparticles are receiving more attention these days. Nanomaterials are replacing organic dyes since they have photostability and non-toxicity. Among the metal nanoparticles, noble metals, especially gold and silver are attractive because of their size and shape-dependent unique optoelectronic properties. The noble metal is coated with inorganic/organic compounds, making the nanoparticles biocompatible and less poisonous. Furthermore, because of their distinct architectures, Ag-and Au-based inorganic/ organic complex nanoparticles may provide a new potential (Dhanalekshmi et al., 2020). Meanwhile, the coating of inorganic/ organic complex nanoparticles shields and stabilizes noble metals against chemical corrosion while also increasing reactive oxygen species generation. \n\nBiopsy and radiography are not sensitive enough to identify melanoma in its early stages. In recent years, several attempts have been made to develop effective theranostics modalities that combine diagnostic and therapeutic roles to enhance cancer treatment (Andreiuk et al., 2022). Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is gaining popularity in the bioimaging and diagnostic fields. This approach uses surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to enhance sensitivity while inheriting crucial Raman fingerprint information (Kleinman et al., 2013). Au NPs are considered excellent for in vivo imaging applications because they are inert, biocompatible, and their localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) may be adjusted toward the near-infrared regions (NIR) window -an optical window (700-950 nm) with low tissue absorption and autofluorescence (Smith et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Different from micelles, polymeric NPs are recognized as solid NPs comprised hydrophobic polymers. So far, a large amount of polymers has been applied to formulate the NPs, among which PLGA occupies an important position. PLGA, which was approved by FDA, has been exploited as an excellent biocompatible, biodegradable, and non-toxic polymer with various applications in tissue engineering, medical and surgical devices, as well as drug delivery since the early 1970s. By adjusting the monomer ratio of lactic acid to glycolic acid, the physicochemical properties of PLGA, including glass transition temperature, density, crystallinity, and viscosity, could be tailored to meet different requirements [127]. Thus, researchers have encapsulated phototherapeutics into PLGA NPs to develop efficient phototheranostic nanomedicine [128][129][130]. Shen et al. [129] designed a bioinspired, ICG and DOX coloaded, PLGA-based theranostic nanoplatform IDPNsquery, which is modified with bovine serum albumin, for fluorescence/PA imaging-guided cancer chemotherapy/PTT. The IDPNs displayed an impressive photothermal effect and heat controlled release behavior of DOX. In addition, their inhibition rate against EMT-6 tumors was high up to 95.6%. \n\nRecently, a novel type of organic optical nanostructures, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs), has also been developed for biomedical applications [131,132]. SPNs are usually comprised semiconducting polymers (SPs), showing advantages including organic and biologically inert, high absorption coefficients, and preferred photostability. Owing to their excellent optical properties, SPNs have been applied in cancer phototherapy. For example, Zhou et al. [133] prepared the polyaniline NPs coated with F127 to obtain the F127-modified PANPs, named F-PANPs. Based on their results, F-PANPs displayed an impressive molar extinction coefficient (8.95 \u00c2 10 8 M \u00c01 cm \u00c01 ), as well as high NIR photothermal conversion efficiency (48.5%).",

Currently, most existing agents developed for NIR\u2010II phototheranostics are limited to inorganic nanoparticles and small\u2010molecule dyes, which suffer from the issues of long\u2010term biotoxicity and poor photostability, respectively. Organic semiconducting nanomaterials (OSNs) constructed from \u03c0\u2010conjugated organic semiconducting polymers or oligomers have unique advantages including high photostability, flexible optical features, and good biocompatibility due to the totally organic and biologically inert constituents. These advantages make OSNs more promising for in vivo phototheranostics. We here make a brief review about recent progress of OSNs\u2010assisted phototheranostics conducted in the NIR\u2010II biological window. NIR\u2010II fluorescence imaging and photoacoustic imaging are mainly reviewed as diagnostic modalities to guide various treatments. Besides, multimodal phototheranostics using OSNs in NIR\u2010II window is also described. At last, the challenges and outlook for OSNs\u2010assisted NIR\u2010II phototheranostics are discussed.",

            "text": "The widespread integration of semiconducting organic polymers into the organic electronics industry has yet to be fully realized. However, due to their low cost and high efficiency, these materials have been proven to be a promising candidate for future renewable energy sources (RESs). One of the most critical challenges currently being addressed by numerous scientific research groups is the thermal stability of these materials. The study of thermal transitions in organic semiconductor materials is one of the essential factor for optimizing the performance and stability of organic electronic devices. Addressing this issue requires comprehensive studies of their morphology (both surface and internal), \n\nPolymers 2025, 17, 704 2 of 19 structural properties, and the impact of fabrication parameters [1,2], which influence the chemical and physical structure of active layers in devices, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) [3,4] and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) [5,6]. These studies typically focus on factors such as polymer molecular weight, thin-film deposition conditions, solvent selection, and variations in the composition of donor-acceptor polymer blends, all of which significantly affect charge transport and the overall performance of electronic devices [7][8][9][10][11]. A major research direction involves exploring polymer with inorganic metal oxides and metal nanoparticle (NP) composites for enhancing the electronic and optical properties of polymers [12,13], which are widely utilized across multiple industries [14][15][16][17][18]. In the field of organic electronics, the most commonly used inorganic metal nanoparticles are gold and silver nanoparticles [19,20]. These metal nanoparticles enhance light absorption primarily through the effect of their surface plasmon resonance (SPR). When exposed to light, the nanoparticles support the collective oscillations of conduction electrons at specific frequencies that resonate with the incident light. This phenomenon significantly amplifies the light absorption, with the degree of enhancement depending on the size and morphology of the nanoparticles. For instance, Pillai et al. demonstrated a 33% increase in photocurrent for silicon solar cells based on thin films by incorporating metallic nanoparticles.",

Compared with molecular probes, nanomaterial-based fluorescence probes are not subject to nonspecific binding of proteins, so their optical properties are not affected. In recent years, the research of nanomaterial-based CAs has been developing rapidly, especially in the fields of medicine and diagnosis (Hahn et al., 2011). Their fluorescence appeared not be easily affected by solvent polarity, ionic strength, pH, and temperature. More importantly, they show high sensitivity and selectivity to the target and have good contrast (Wolfbeis, 2015). The most commonly used nanomaterial-based CAs are hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic polymers, nanoparticles made of silica and organically modified silica, quantum dots (QDs), semiconducting organic polymers, carbonaceous nanomaterials including carbon (quantum) dots, carbon nanoclusters and carbon nanotubes, nanodiamonds, upconversion materials, metal particles, metal oxides (Wolfbeis, 2015). The photophysical features of selected nanomaterials are shown in  fluorescence properties, which make them promising CAs for NIR-FLTB. The detailed features and applications of QDs and UCNPs are described below. Gold cluster-and nanodiamondbased CAs are briefly introduced because of their relatively shorter excitation wavelengths (Table 2).",

            "text": "teolytic sensors using cyanine and Atto dyes are commercially available [34]. Furthermore, being molecular-sized entities, these organic dye labels exhibit almost no steric effects, which can be critical in enzymatic assays. Despite these advantages, organic fluorophores, especially near-IR (NIR) dyes, have limiting photophysical properties, such as photobleaching and low QY, which hampers their potential for in vivo applications [34].\n\nInorganic emitters such as quantum dots (QDs) can be an alternative to surpass such limitations. These nanocrystals have enhanced optical properties such as high photostability, spectral tunability, and a broad excitation wavelength range, while allowing surface functionalization for biomolecule immobilization [34]. For example, Jeong et al. developed a QD-based ET biosensor in the second NIR region to determine the proteolytic activities of MMP-2 and -9 in real time ( Figure 2A) [35]. In this work, a multifunctional peptide was used to bridge a QD to an acceptor that quenches its emission in the absence of MMPs. On breaking the peptide bond, the acceptor is released and the donor brightness increases proportionally to the presence of the active protease. Compared with other NIR dyes, this QD-based sensor displayed better performance for in-depth in vivo imaging. Despite these improvements, the application of QDs in these systems can still be hindered by toxicity, photoblinking phenomena, and size-related issues.\n\nAs an alternative to luminescence-based sensors, a system based on the scattering of light from plasmonic nanoparticles was develop by Jun et al. [36] to detect Caspase-3 and -7 inside cells using an adenocarcinoma (SW 620) cell line. In their design, the authors used a crown nanoparticle assembly comprising a core 40-nm plasmonic gold particle coupled to several gold nanoparticles by a target sequence for caspase detection ( Figure 2B). Using this plasmon ruler, the authors were able to optically probe caspase activity by measuring the scattered light from the",

            "text": "Despite the long history of in vivo optical imaging, organic dyes have suffered from small Stokes shifts, poor photostability, high plasma protein binding rate, aggregation and background fluorescence in aqueous medium [45]. Attention has been increasingly channeled toward nanotechnology to search for new class of more effective probes. Many nanomaterials are already widely used as catalysts, and energy storage and electronic devices [46][47][48][49][50]. Their application to the biomedical arena has attracted a similarly enthusiastic following. Interest in the nanomaterials arises from the fact that at nanoscale the properties of materials can be very different from their bulk counterparts. Firstly, nanomaterials when compared to the same mass of material existing in a larger form have a much higher surface area. As such, nanomaterials are more chemically reactive because of the high surface energy. In addition, at nanoscale range, quantum effects begin to dominate the behavior of matter, affecting the optical, electrical and magnetic behavior of materials [51,52]. \n\nLately, the integration of nanotechnology with medicine has found many novel applications of nanomaterials. Nanoparticles can be engineered to overcome biological barriers for effective and targeted delivery of drugs, genes, and contrast agents [53]. Active moieties such as proteins, peptides and nucleic acids can easily be conjugated to the surface of the nanoparticles for use as non-specific, targeting or activatable nanoprobes.

In particular, the development of novel nanomaterials is increasingly investigated. Due to their size-related effects leading to unique physical, chemical, optical, electrical, and magnetic properties, these materials can be widely used to develop novel sensors 1 . Among the different types of sensing technologies, optical based sensors offer important advantages: they enable small sizes, offer sensitivity to multiple environmental parameters, require small cable sizes and weights. \n\nIn contrast to electrical schemes, optical sensing offers potentials of high sensitivity, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and safe operation in explosive or combustive atmospheres, as well as more options for signal retrieval from optical intensity, spectrum, phase, and polarization 2 . Nanomaterial-based optical sensors can also be expected to exhibit further advantages over conventional sensors. In particular, the integration of nanoparticles in polymer hosts and their use in combination with optical fibers or planar platforms have attracted interest. Such arrangements are a key step towards the development of advanced analytical instrumentation, aiming small scale and multiparameter capability 3 . \n\nThe unique features of quantum dots (QDs) are highly attractive for fiber sensing platforms. Polymer fibers are excellent candidates to host QDs because of the good processability of their organic materials, which facilitate the nanoparticle integration 4 . Polymer optical fibers and waveguides have received continuous attention in recent years due to their excellent properties, such as simple preparation, biocompatibility, low cost, high optical transparency and flexibility. Although organic dyes were traditionally used for doping, they have been gradually superseded in several fields by quantum dots, because of their unique controlled size-dependent electronic and optical properties 5 . In addition, the QDs brightness is enhanced by 20 times and the stability against photobleaching is improved by 100 times compared to organic dyes 6 . \n\nAt present, some of the most attractive features of QDs are being explored for the detection of specific molecules in biomedical researches and clinical diagnosis [7][8][9][10] . Polymer embedded nanocrystals are also widely employed as luminescent indicators for detection of chemical species in sensing probes 11,12 . The unique features of QDs are also highly attractive for fiber sensing platforms.",

            "text": "\u221217 Hybrid NPs can be prepared in organic solvents or in aqueous media depending on the polymers used. For the preparation of water-dispersible hybrid nanoparticles, usually amphiphilic block copolymers 10\u221215 that can self-assemble into micellar or vesicle structures in water or water-soluble hyperbranched polymers 8 and dendrimers 17 are used because the interior of these nanostructures can accommodate metal ions in high concentration and act as a microreactor to facilitate the reduction of metal ions without the need of extra reducing agents and subsequently stabilize the newly formed metal nanoparticles. \n\nAs can be seen from the above literature examples, there are numerous studies on functionalizing of Au or Ag NPs with polymers, but the examples are relatively scarce on the use of conjugated and light-emitting polymers or oligomers for functionalization of Au or Ag NPs, although the synergistic effect of the both materials could offer many opportunities in the areas of nanophotonics and theranostics. For instance, gold and silver nanostructured materials having surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in the near-infrared region (NIR) have been widely used for NIR-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT). It would also be possible to combine photothermal (PTT) and photodynamic therapies in a single theranostic platform. 19 For this purpose, organic dye-based photosensitizers that exhibit the photodynamic effect upon light irradiation have been incorporated to the gold or silver nanoparticles. 20 However, these dyes are usually attached to metal nanoparticles through noncovalent interactions that might cause the leakage of these dyes and a decrease in the efficiency. Moreover, these small organic dyes suffer from low photostability. \n\n\u221233 In the literature there are also some examples for hybrid nanostructures of CPNs with metal nanoparticles. 34,35 \u221242 The photocatalytic applications of these nanoparticles have also been demonstrated. 43,44",

In one of the highest efficiency organic solar cells, for instance (P3HT: PCBM bulk HJ), the efficiency limitations due to lower cutoff wavelength (\u223c650 nm/E G \u223c2.1 eV) was taken care of by enhancing optical absorption as reported [43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55]. \n\nSemiconducting NPs, also called quantum dots (QDs), behave like quasi-atoms with electrons/holes possessing discrete energy levels, and exhibiting size-specific absorption and luminescence spectra characterized by the material used.

For instance, varying the size of CdSe QDs from 3 to 6.5 nm changed the emission from 470 to 630 nm.

            "text": "Because of their optical characteristics, polymeric NPs have been used to enhance in vitro and in vivo bioimaging. Semiconducting polymeric NPs are among the most technically advanced optical imaging probes because they exhibit excellent photostability and brightness, a large Stokes shift, and tunable optical characteristics [102]. This new formulation enabled us to overcome the difficulties associated with the free dye, such as its hydrophobicity, photobleaching and aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) manifestations, particularly in vivo. Remarkably, recent research has shown that using bulky hydrophobic counterions in NPs improves their bioimaging performance by reducing dye leakage and ACQ [103]. \n\nNanoformulations were created by combining hyaluronic acid (HA) with an aminopropyl-1-pyrenebutanamide (PBA), a hydrophobic ligand that induces NP self-assembly [104], to enhance the ICG's limited tumour retention and optical stability while also employing nontoxic and biodegradable polymers. The ICG molecules were physically entrapped in the hydrophobic pockets of HA-NPs and are known as NanoICG. NanoICG NPs were reported to be non-toxic and biodegradable. Their outstanding nano-morphology increases circulation time, facilitates delivery to tumours, ensures better cellular internalization, and improves intra-operative contrast and surgical advantages in solid tumours such as pancreas, breast, liver, and prostate. Preclinical investigations of prostate cancer xenograft models yielded promising results, and intravenously administered NanoICG improved tumour signal-to-noise ratio, at 24 h, by 2.9fold compared to free ICG [104][105][106]. \n\nRecent fluorescence-imaging techniques employes dyes that absorb near-infrared-II (NIR-II) light (1000-1700 nm) with remarkable penetration depth, less photodamage, and low autofluorescence within the extended spectral region [102,107]. The use of NIR-II imaging-guided surgery has the potential to improve tumour margin estimation and precision.",

For example, CDs have excellent photostability, good biocompatibility, permeability, low toxicity, low cost, and are easy to prepare (131). However, most CDs usually absorb light in the short wavelength region due to the p-p* transition of the C=C bond; therefore, other nanomaterials, such as metal nanoparticles (132) or semiconducting polymers (133) are needed as NIR-assisted PTAs (131). Lu et al. (42) assembled polydopamine (PDA) and carbon points on hollow mesoporous carbon (HMC) to construct a photothermal enhanced multifunctional system (HMC-SS-PDA@CDs). The results of in vivo experiments showed that under low-power, 808-nm laser radiation of 0.75 W/cm 2 , the antitumor drug-loaded HMC-SS-PDA@CDs inhibited tumor growth by 92.6% and significantly reduced the toxicity of Dox to cells, indicating that Dox/HMC-SS-PDA@CD nanoparticles have good photothermal chemotherapeutic synergism and ideal biocompatibility.",

            "text": "systemically administered iron-oxide nanoparticles into tumor sites using an external magnetic field is an excellent avenue for actively targeted delivery of minimally modified versions. MRI using T 2 contrast enhancement of IONPs is widely applied in pre-clinical settings. AMF directed hyperthermia using these nanoparticles can render localized heating to the tumor site with minimum off-target effects as a potential therapeutic route. The ease of synthesis, surface modification, storage, handling, and transport of these nanoparticles are additional benefits that would pave the way for their successful clinical translation.\n\nSimilarly, organic dyes such as Rhodamine 6G (R6G) have been widely used as a fluorescence marker for monitoring the distribution of biological molecules into the target sites by using fluorescence spectroscopy [12]. However, there are drawbacks to using organic dyes, such as their low quantum yield and rapid photo-bleaching. This has resulted in the development of optical nanoparticles such as quantum dots with high quantum yield and photo-stability [12]. In addition, they can be excited at any wavelength, unlike optical dyes, and provide sharp and bright emission light of various colors by carefully tuning their sizes ranging from 2 nm to 10 nm. However, due to their toxicity, several other optical nanoparticles such as carbon/graphene dots, plasmonic and up-conversion nanophosphors have recently emerged. These optical probes are unique biological tags for monitoring their distribution in cellular systems by simple spectrophotometry as an imaging platform. In addition, many of them can also produce localized heat (hyperthermia) by activating them using a certain wavelength of laser light, hence can be utilized as therapeutic agents.\n\nA combination of optical probes with IONPs can further enhance the repertoire of their biomedical applications. They also offer a myriad choice of nanomaterials, which can be selected for a specific biomedical application as diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Several review articles can be found that have chronicled separately either optical or magnetic nanostructures in terms of their synthesis, characterization, and biomedical applications.

Also important is the fact that the optoacoustic signal generation mechanism in NPs is significantly affected by the heat propagation rate to the surrounding medium. Thereby, the relative optoacoustic signal intensities generated by different NPs can significantly differ from the corresponding relative optical absorbances (Fig. 9a and b). \n\nBiocompatible NPs are classified into organic and inorganic compounds based on their chemical composition 146,148,149 and into plasmonic and non-plasmonic particles based on the optical absorption mechanism. 109,110,112 Organic NPs are composed of organic molecules grouped together in nanostructures or  73 ICG 137 (note that ICG small molecules bind to albumin in blood, resulting in a hydrodynamic diameter of 11 nm that prevents kidney clearance 138 ); gold nanorods (AuNR); 139 liposomal ICG (Lipo-ICG) 137 and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT). 140   combined through chemical bonds.

            "text": "Over the course of the last ten years, research and development efforts have been heavily concentrated on fluorescent NPs [37,[47][48][49][50][51]. These NPs include semiconductor NPs (quantum dots), metal NPs, silica NPs, polymer NPs, and many more [52][53][54]. In comparison to traditional fluorescent organic dyes, fluorescent NPs exhibit a more brilliant fluorescence, increased photostability, and enhanced biocompatibility. In addition, the NPs have a distinct set of chemical and optical characteristics [55,56]. Several different kinds of fluorescent NPs have emerged for bioimaging over the past few decades. These include organic-dye-doped silica NPs, organic polymer NPs, metallic NPs, carbon-based NPs (nanotubes and nanodots) [57], quantum dots (QDs) [58][59][60], and lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) [61][62][63]. In terms of their composition, fluorescent NPs employed in bioimaging may be roughly divided into two categories: organic and inorganic NPs. In order to be considered among the best fluorescent probes for imaging, fluorescent NPs should generally meet the following characteristics: high signal-to-background ratio, big strokes to prevent self-quenching, excellent stability under physiological settings, little cytotoxicity, and minimum disruption of biological activities, to name only a few. They also have limited fluorescence durations, typically around 10 \u22129 s, which is insufficient for efficiently separating short-lived fluorescence interference from dispersed excitation light. \n\nOptical biosensors based on fluorescence may be divided into two categories: those that use downconversion fluorescence and those that use upconversion fluorescence. Downconversion fluorescence, the foundation of most existing optical biosensors, works by transforming the energy of light, often in the ultraviolet to visible light range, into a more usable form. These probes excel in chemical, photochemical, and thermal stability, and their long fluorescence lifetimes make them ideal for biosensing applications.",

            "text": "Despite significant improvements using NIR-II dyes, the information available might be limited by just relying on one single imaging modality. NIR-II dye based multimodal imaging with combined desirable features of different imaging modalities could compensate limitations of each single modality, thus providing accurate diagnosis [29,91,93,128]. Therefore, it is of potential utility to develop multimodal imaging systems based on NIR-II dyes, especially for the multi-modal nanosystems that can avoid redundant administration and monitoring processes. \n\nFL and PA imaging are amongst the most common dual-mode imaging modalities seen in optical imaging. Some organic NIR-II dyes with absorbance in NIR-I window and fluorescence emission in NIR-II window can provide both NIR-I PA imaging and NIR-II FL imaging. For example, Wang et al. reported an A-D-A structural semiconducting polymer termed DPP-BDT by utilizing DPP and BDT as electron acceptor and donor, respectively [92]. This combines the advantages of fluorescence imaging with high sensitivity and the advantages of PA with high spatial resolution and deep tissue penetration. Furthermore, to obtain more anatomical information, Hu et al. designed a multifunctional semiconducting polymer nanoparticle, PFTQ-PEG-Gd NPs that could achieve tri-modal imaging. In this system, D-A structural semiconducting conjugate were used as PA/NIR-II FL contrast agent, and PFTQ with TQ and fluorene (F) were selected as acceptor and donor. Meanwhile chelated gadolinium ion can be used as a contrast agent of MRI. After systemic injection of PFTQ-PEG-Gd NPs, significantly enhanced PA signal was present within the tumor area in a 4T1 neoplastic mouse over time and reached a plateau value 24 h post-injection. Moreover, the blood vessels connecting the tumor were clearly observed owing to the high resolution of PA imaging (Fig. 13a). Like PA imaging, magnetic signals in the tumor region showed similar trend that the signal intensity gradually increased until 24 h so that anatomical information could be collected (Fig. 13b).",

            "text": "Nanomaterials have a lot of potential for use in cancer treatment.One such example is QDs, with sizes between 2-100 nm and with uniquely adjustable optical and targeting capabilities [111].The primary objective is to create miniaturized probes that are extremely selective, flexible, stable, and able to access deep within cells and organelles.Despite widespread excitement, advances in this area have been hampered by issues with reproducible production and biological obstacles.The majority of current research on QDs is directed toward the development of nanocrystals and their bioconjugation for tracking and imaging [112].QDs have not been investigated for their potential as sensitizers in cancer treatment.Colloidal QDs are fluorescent dyes based on inorganic semiconductor NPs, in contrast to organic fluorophores.After being photo-excited, these particles form electron-hole pairs; when recombining, they emit light as fluorescence.Because of their nanoscale dimensions, quantum effects play a significant role, leading to fluorescence wavelengths that vary with particle size.The bluer the fluorescence, the smaller the particle size [113].Thus, by manufacturing NPs of varying sizes, it is possible to obtain any color in the visible and infrared spectrums.When compared to organic fluorophores, QDs have various distinct photophysical characteristics.Their emission spectra are relatively narrow and symmetric; they do not exhibit any red-tailed emission, and their absorption spectra are continuous for wavelengths shorter than the wavelength of fluorescence emission.This allows for the spectrally clean excitation of a wide range of colors using a single excitation wavelength [114].\n\nIn a study, Su et al. developed a graphene quantum dot (GQD) nanoaircraft (SCNA) for the treatment of cancer.The nanoaircraft was built from GQDs with a size of less than 5 nm and a pH-sensitive polymer functionalized on their surface; it loses its stealth function in the mildly acidic tumor environment but retains stability at physiological pH.The SCNA is able to effectively penetrate deep tumor tissue owing to a size conversion triggered by NIR irradiation, which shrinks the 150 nm of the SCNA into the 5 nm of (DOX)/GQD.",

            "text": "Various nanoparticle platforms, both organic and inorganic, have been extensively investigated for biomedical applications. Among these, inorganic nanoparticles, specifically QDs, are notable for their unique optical characteristics. They feature broad absorption spectra, high quantum yields, sharp emission peaks, excellent photostability, and sizedependent tunable emission [14]. In addition to QDs, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) and other metal oxides represent another class of inorganic nanoparticles used in biological imaging applications. A formulation of SPIO has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use, and iron oxide nanoparticles have been widely employed as MRI contrast agents [15]. QDs, as nanoscale semiconductor particles, exhibit remarkable optical properties, particularly their size-tunable emission wavelengths and high quantum yields. \n\nHeavy metal-free biocompatible QDs with high photoluminescence quantum yields have enabled lymph node mapping in ex vivo imaging. Additionally, an innovative approach has been developed involving gadolinium-doped carbon dots for fluorescence/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [16]. Core-shell QDs, such as Cadmium Selenide Zinc Sulfide (CdSe@ZnS), have been utilized to quantitatively determine the extracellular nuclease activity of Staphylococcus aureus, employing QDs conjugated to a single-stranded Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid (ssDNA) fluorescent dye Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) probe. Furthermore, multiphoton imaging of tumor biomarkers can be conducted by conjugating single-domain antibodies to CdSe@ZnS QDs, providing a viable alternative to conventional organic fluorophores for imaging biomarkers [17]. \n\nThe emission wavelength of QDs can be precisely controlled by adjusting their size, allowing researchers to design QDs that emit specific colors ranging from ultraviolet to infrared [18,19]. This tunability arises from quantum confinement effects, which create discrete energy levels within the semiconductor material. Moreover, QDs demonstrate significantly higher photostability and brightness compared to traditional organic dyes, which are often prone to photobleaching during prolonged exposure to light [20,21].",

They are characterized by size-dependent fluorescent properties, broad excitation range, narrow emission peak, large Stokes shift, ultrahigh brightness, high quantum yield, and photostability. The synthesis method of quantum dots is fairly simple and well established. The organic phase synthesis yields high-quality quantum dots. However, they are oil phase soluble, thus further surface modification is necessary to render their usage in biological sensing [46][47][48]. In addition, due to the cytotoxicity of the semiconductor element (Cd element), the bio-application of quantum dots is greatly hindered. A coating layer such as a silica shell, polymer shell, or carbon shell can be applied to the surface of the semiconductor quantum dots to improve their water solubility and biocompatibility [49][50][51][52]. Compared to traditional fluorescent dye, Green Fluorescent Proteins (GFP), or enhanced GFP, quantum dots have superior luminescent properties such as photostability to ambient environment, high quantum yield, and bright size-dependent excitation photoluminescence. These luminescent properties of semiconductor nanocrystals make them favorable as nanobiosensing probes [53,54].",

            "text": "Some fluorophores could be encapsulated in the nanoparticle structure for stable tracing. Quantum dots (QDs) are nanocrystals made from semiconducting materials such as cadmium selenide or cadmium sulfide, typically with diameters ranging from 2 to 10 nm. At this scale, their properties differ significantly from those of their bulk counterparts, resulting in unique optical and electronic properties. When a fluorescent QD absorbs energy, an electron in the material is excited to a higher energy state. As the electron returns to its ground state, it emits light of a specific color or wavelength, which can be adjusted by varying the size and composition of the QD. Fluorescent QDs have several advantages over traditional fluorescent dyes or proteins: they have high brightness, broad excitation spectra, and narrow emission spectra and are highly photostable, meaning that they can be excited and emit light repeatedly without degrading or losing their brightness. 41 ncapsulating fluorescent QD cores into nanoparticles creates a core\u2212shell structure to enhance the optical properties of the nanoparticles. This approach is commonly used to improve the stability, biocompatibility, and functionality of fluorescent nanoparticles. 42 The shell can be made of various materials such as polymers, phospholipids, silica, or metallic compounds. Polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and polystyrene (PS) have been used extensively to form shell layers via self-assembly, polymerization, emulsion, and nanoprecipitation. \n\nPhospholipids are amphiphilic molecules with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties, making them ideal for forming shells around fluorescent QDs. The phospholipid layer, such as a micelle or liposome, also provides a biocompatible surface for the particles, making them suitable for use in biological systems.",

For cellular tracking, the functional nanomaterials can be attached ex vivo to the targeted protein on the cell surface or they can be infused inside through the process of diffusion or active transport [118]. When excited optically, these nanomaterials can be used to distinguish different performance and functionality of the matrix-embedded cells. In addition to cellular studies, nanomaterials , such as QDs [116] and UCNPs [123], have also been used to label hydrogel scaffold structures to study their degrada tion. These materials require different excitation wavelengths such as ultraviolet (UV) or visible light for QDs and dyes [115], while UCNPs are more sensitive to NIR wavelengths [123]. However, UV and visible wavelengths have different shortcomings, such as limited penetration depth and potential disintegration of the biological molecules and scaffolds [118]. In addition, even though QDs have excellent optical properties, their suboptimal biocompatibility and biodegradability represent major challenges that hinder their applications in TE [115]. NIR fluorophores can resolve those disadvantages as well as minimize the autofluorescence from cells and tissues, which allows them to be used in a wide range of in vivo tracking of hydrogel degradation (Figure 9) [115].

QDs/polymer hybrids have implications in sensors, photonics, transistors, pharmaceutical transport, and other domains. There are a great number of review articles available online discussing the creation of CDs and their many uses. There are certain review papers that can be found online that describe the creation of composites as well as their many different uses. For QDs/polymer hybrids, the emission spectra were nearly equal to those of QDs, indicating that the optical characteristics of QDs were substantially preserved. They performed well as biochemical and biophysical detectors/sensors for a variety of targets because of their FL quenching efficacy.

Incident photons elevate electrons from the valence to the conduction band, leaving an excited electron-hole pair called an exciton. When the exciton is confined within a nanoparticle that is smaller than its Bohr radius, quantum confinement leads to increased separation between the valance and conduction bands with corresponding increases in the band gap and energy of the photon emitted upon recombination. Therefore, QD size is an essential feature because small changes in QD diameter lead to large changes in the energy of the emitted photon. Reprinted with permission from [Pease et al., 2007]. Copyright (2011) American Chemical Society. \n\nFigure 9a shows a typical ES-DMA size distribution of carboxylic acid terminated QDs, with peaks at 15.0 and 18.0 nm representing individual QDs and dimeric QD clusters. This size varies from that anticipated from optical measurements between 5 nm and 7 nm for several www.intechopen.com reasons. First, these rod-shaped particles (see inset of Figure 9a) are coated with 40 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) and salt layers; the equivalent external size of an individual quantum dot without salt and polymer coatings is ~12.4 nm. Second, optical measurements (e.g., Figure 9b-d) reflect the size of the core for QDs with type I band alignment rather than the external size measured by ES-DMA. These differences indicate that optical, TEM, and ES-DMA measurements are mutually complementary for core-shell QDs: optical measurements ascertain the core, TEM gives the combined core and shell measurements, and ES-DMA provides core, shell and coating thicknesses. The ability to distinguish the soft and hard components indicates the potential to determine macromolecular conjugation.",

Therefore, developing strategies to enhance the photothermal efficacy of albumin@dye complex is essential for better integrating phototherapy with diagnostics. \n\nPolydopamine (PDA), a widely used biomaterial, has gained attention for its potential in drug delivery systems and photothermal therapy. However, due to limited efficacy, mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (MPDA), which possess an inherent porous structure and enhanced photothermal properties, have garnered increasing interest in cancer diagnosis and therapy. 21,22 Studies have shown that MPDA nanoparticles not only enable effective drug delivery but also exhibit remarkable photothermal conversion abilities, 23,24 making them ideal candidates for integrating photothermal therapy with diagnostic imaging. \n\nIn this study, we explore the development of a multifunctional diagnostic nanoplatform using MPDA as the carrier. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was conjugated with the cyanine dye IR780 to form a BSA@IR780 complex. This complex was then loaded onto the MPDA nanoparticles, resulting in the formation of the MPDA-BSA@IR780 nanoplatform. The MPDA-BSA@IR780 nanoplatform offers several key advantages: (1) Enhanced photostability: MPDA improves the photostability of the BSA@IR780 complex, enhancing its effectiveness in both photothermal therapy and \ue104uorescence imaging. (2) Improved photothermal effect: MPDA's strong photothermal properties address the limited photothermal response of BSA@IR780, thereby enhancing the therapeutic efficacy in tumor treatment.",

            "text": "Bioimaging is a method that visualizes biological events in real time and in a noninvasive manner using probes and detectors. Fluorescence imaging has emerged as a potent technique for clinical diagnosis, owing to its ease of use, low cost, high sensitivity, noninvasiveness, and ability for long-term monitoring [140]. Organic dyes, semiconductor quantum dots, and up-conversion nanoparticles are among the fluorescent materials leveraged for bioimaging. Nonetheless, these materials cannot be used in the biomedical industry due to their high cytotoxicity, poor photostability, and biocompatibility [141]. Carbon quantum dots offer high photostability, good biocompatibility, simple synthetic routes, flexible designability, multicolor emission, crimson/near-infrared emission, and two/multiphoton luminescence, making it a next-generation fluorescent probe for bioimaging in vitro and in vivo [37,142]. Huang et al. [143] prepared carbon quantum dots (CQDs) by a one-pot hydrothermal method using a by-product of the biorefining process (degradation product of biomass autohydrolysis) as a carbon source and then analyzed the morphology, structure, and optical properties of the CQDs by various characterization methods; they found that the CQDs possessed a size distribution of 2.0-6.0 nm, a high percentage of sp2 and sp3 carbon bonds, and blue-green fluorescence emission with a quantum yield of about 13%. In addition, the authors also found that CQDs have good photostability and temperature stability and are not prone to photobleaching and fluorescence bursts, which makes them suitable for long-time optical observation. Such fluorescence imaging was performed on the mice at different time points. The fluorescence signals of the mice were quantitatively analyzed, and it was found that the distribution of CQDs in the mice was mainly concentrated in the liver and spleen (Figure 17a), which was similar to the in vivo behaviors of other nanomaterials. Results showed that the fluorescence signals of the tumor sites gradually enhanced with time (Figure 17b), which indicated that the CQDs had a good ability to target the tumors.",

Besides green fluorescent proteins (GFPs), 9,10 quantum dots (Qdots), 11,12 carbon nanodots (Cdots), 13 nanodiamonds, 14 and fluorescent dyes, Pdots are one of the more promising nanosized probes that have practical applications in biomedical research. 15 Pdots have been demonstrated in a number of applications, such as fluorescence bioimaging and biosensing. 16 \u221225 However, many scientific issues still await further investigation for Pdots to be used in biological applications. Research on smaller, brighter, and narrower emissive Pdots in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) region remain a challenge. Multicolor imaging is a powerful approach to study dynamic processes at cellular and subcellular levels. Though we have successfully developed green, orange, deep red, and NIR Pdots with narrow emission for bioimaging, 23,25 there is a need to develop Pdots with other colors. Yellow Pdots, in particular, are needed to fill up the spectral gap between the green and orange Pdots. \n\nWe have designed new yellow Pdots that consist of donor and acceptor semiconducting polymers that are cross-linked to an amphiphilic functional polymer.",

            "text": "All the results mentioned above demonstrated good biocompatibility of 17-DMAG-HMPB@sPP@HA nanosystem. \n\nTraditional chemotherapy drugs have limited therapeutic effects due to their non-tumor-specific distribution in vivo, which is a major challenge for cancer treatment [40,41]. In contrast, photothermal therapy, especially near-infrared II (NIR-II) light-responsive nano-formulations with high photothermal stability and high photostability, can be used for the treatment of malignant tumors [42]. For example, Bian et al. reported a new type of NIR-II absorbing organic semiconductor amphiphilic polymer (OSPA) to enhance the stability and luminescence properties of organic semi-solid conductive polymer nanoparticles (OSPN) [43]. The maximum absorption wavelength of OSPA nanoparticles is located at 1000 nm, which enables the nanoparticles to achieve the photothermal treatment of subcutaneous and brain tumors under the guidance of photoacoustic imaging. \n\nIn the past decade, the rapid development of targeted delivery systems uses specific ligands in the drug delivery system to bind to specific receptors on the surface of tumor cells, such as folic acid and hyaluronic acid, which greatly improves the efficiency of drug delivery [44,45]. However, in the concept of cancer precision medicine, the ideal carrier can deliver personalized drugs to specific tumor tissues in specific patients. Since even the same cancer expresses different levels of cell surface receptors in different patients, targeted drug delivery is not effective in solving this problem. In recent years, newly emerged peptide-homing technology can improve the efficiency of drug delivery, prolong the half-life of drugs and avoid the side effects of off-target [46]. In particular, Mao et al. reported that the tumor-homing peptide guided targeting system based on phage display technology are able to quickly and economically select homing peptides, which have a clear targeting effect on unknown types of tumors without needing to know the target before [47]. This system demonstrated convincing precision treatment in the MCF-7 breast cancer-bearing mice, and it was completed in the same laboratory using the same animal model.",

            "text": "Accurate diagnosis and treatment of tumors, one of the top global health problems, has always been the research focus of scientists and doctors. Near-infrared (NIR) emissive semiconducting polymers dots (Pdots) have demonstrated bright prospects in field of in vivo tumor fluorescence imaging owing to some of their intrinsic advantages, including good water-dispersibility, facile surface-functionalization, easily tunable optical properties, and good biocompatibility. During recent years, much effort has been devoted to developing Pdots with emission bands located in the second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000\u20131700 nm) region, which hold great advantages of higher spatial resolution, better signal-to-background ratios (SBR), and deeper tissue penetration for solid-tumor imaging in comparison with the visible region (400\u2013680 nm) and the first near-infrared (NIR-I, 680\u2013900 nm) window, by virtue of the reduced tissue autofluorescence, minimal photon scattering, and low photon absorption. In this review, we mainly summarize the latest advances of NIR-II emissive semiconducting Pdots for in vivo tumor fluorescence imaging, including molecular engineering to improve the fluorescence quantum yields and surface functionalization to elevate the tumor-targeting capability. We also present several NIR-II theranostic Pdots used for integrated tumor fluorescence diagnosis and photothermal/photodynamic therapy.

            "text": "Real-time dynamic visual monitoring of the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells in vivo through direct and non-invasive methods has become one of the key technologies in the studies of OPEN ACCESS tumor formation and development, early diagnosis and treatment. Recently developed quantum dots (QDs) has shown great development potential in this field [1][2][3]. \n\nAs a new type of nano-fluorescent material, QDs, has many unique optical properties compared to the traditional fluorescent markers, such as narrow excitation spectra but wide emission spectra, strong fluorescence, high photochemical stability, and resistance to photolysis or bleaching, due to the effects of quantum size and dielectric confinement [4][5][6][7]. These optical properties can be used to dynamically trace live cells for a prolonged time, while all fluorescent probes currently being used cannot (a variety of organic fluorescent dyes and fluorescent proteins) [8]. Especially the fluorescence of recently developed QDs with near-infrared light of emission wavelength (700-900 nm) not only can strongly penetrate human tissue, but also avoids the interference of autofluorescence from the tissue. This is particularly suitable for in vivo non-invasive medical imaging [9][10][11]. Currently, QDs are used to label tumor cells by non-specific endocytosis or by linking with antibodies, ligands, and peptides to form fluorescent probes for the in vivo imaging of non-invasive tumor cells [8,[12][13][14], sentinel lymph node detection [15,16], and the targeting tumor angiogenesis [17]. These studies clearly demonstrated the great potential of the excellent optical characteristics of QDs in the fields of in vivo non-invasive in situ study of the formation and development of cancer cells, and the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer. \n\nIt has been shown that bio-labeling of tumor cells with QDs is not toxic and does not affect their growth and differentiation [1,8]. Other reports applied QDs to label tumor cells and monitored their invasion and metastasis by in vivo imaging [8,[12][13][14][15].",

            "text": "Moreover, many of them possess a certain level of toxicity that hampers their in vivo application. One of the solutions is enclosure of fluorescent dyes in nanomaterials, such as polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), which can be fabricated from a multitude of materials in a variety of compositions and doped with different fluorophores. This has the advantage of protecting the potentially toxic fluorophores from the environment and offers improved fluorophore stability due to reduced interactions with the environment, e.g., solvent molecules, chemically reactive species or quenching agents [30]. The main advantage of using NPs is their large surface areas allowing easy modification with a wide range of imaging moieties including several surface modifications for multimodal detection and/or drug delivery [31], but also surface attachment of target-specific bioligands or polymeric compounds such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). In particular, PEGylation is of particular interest as it strongly influences the pharmacokinetics of NPs by reducing clearance by the reticuloendothelial system and increasing plasma half-lives of the NPs but also their stability and water solubility while reducing their immunogenicity [32,33]. \n\nNevertheless, many presently available NP-formulations comprise potentially toxic elements. In spite of growing efforts to reduce side effects, such as using biodegradable coatings, the biodistribution, behaviour and risks of using NPs in living organism still have to be studied [34]. \n\nLuminescent semiconducting nanocrystals, quantum dots (QDs), which can readily be conjugated to targeting molecules (e.g., antibodies), are also increasingly used as fluorescent labels for in vivo imaging. Unlike organic dyes, QDs can be excited over a broad wavelength and their optical properties are controlled by the constituent material, particle size and dispersity, shape and surface chemistry. The use of QDs for in vivo imaging is also hampered by the contradictory reports on their toxicity [22].",

            "text": "The different and interesting properties of AuNPs have been widely explored in bioassays using a variety of detection systems, which are summarized in Table 1. These bioassays usually utilize AuNPs as optical or electrochemical labels to detect the target molecule, using direct, competitive or sandwich formats, as de-scribed below, although, in some instances, they act only as nanoscaffolds to increase the sensitivity of the assay, as is the case for many electrochemical sensors [4,[6][7][8]. \n\nQuantum dots (QDs) are inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals with interesting luminescent and electrochemical properties extensively used in numerous bioassays, as can be seen in several reviews that give a great deal of information about synthesis, properties and applications of QDs [2,[9][10][11][12][13][14]. Briefly, these NPs show broad excitation profiles and narrow emission peaks and can emit in a range of wavelengths by changing their size and composition. Also, they lack photobleaching and have long fluorescence lifetimes. However, QDs can show blinking characteristics when they are excited with high-intensity light, which could be a limiting factor for fast-scan systems, such as flow cytometry. Other limitations are toxicity, size variation, agglomeration and non-specific binding. Surface oxidation of QDs can occur under combined exposure to aqueous/UV-light excitation, which can lead (e.g., in CdSe-based QDs) to the release of cadmium ions, so that these NPs are inadequate for in vivo applications, such as in vivo drugdelivery assays. However, they offer better imaging results than those achieved by organic dyes in cell-based or tissue-based drug studies [9,13]. \n\nCapping the surface of the core QD with a protective shell of an insulating material or a wide-bandgap semiconductor can reduce the toxicity and increase the photostability of QDs [9]. One of the most commonly used QDs is therefore formed by an inner semiconductor core of CdSe coated with a ZnS shell, which gives rise to the formation of nanoshells.",

These nanoparticles emit a strong wavelength-dependent fluorescence. By changing the CQD size, the color of the emitted light can be tuned from deep ultraviolet to visible and near-infrared light. In addition, the fluorescence of CQDs, and also their water solubility, can be further modulated by functionalizing their surface with various atoms, chemical functional groups and molecules, such as metals, carboxyl groups, organic dyes and polymers. CQDs present good photostability, low photobleaching and relatively low cytotoxicity, and they are therefore considered to be suitable for biomedical applications such as bioimaging, biosensing, photodynamic and photothermal therapy of cancer, and drug delivery [165].\n\nIn hybrid materials with nanocellulose, CQDs were applied for constructing biosensors and drug delivery systems, and also for water purification. An optical sensor for visual discrimination of biothiols was based on a bacterial cellulose nanopaper substrate with ratiometric fluorescent sensing elements. These elements included N-acetyl l-cysteine capped green cadmium telluride (CdTe) quantum dots-rhodamine B and red CdTe quantum dots-carbon dots [26]. Hybrid materials containing carbon quantum dots and cellulose are also promising carriers for drug delivery. Composite core/shell chitosan-poly (ethylene oxide)-carbon quantum dots/carboxymethyl cellulose-poly(vinyl alcohol) nanofibers were prepared through coaxial electrospinning as a biodegradable implant for local delivery of temozolomide (TMZ), an anticancer drug. When tested in vitro, the antitumor activity of TMZ conjugated with carbon quantum dots against the tumor U251 cell lines was higher than the activity of the free drug [28]. Last but not least, carbon quantum dots, homogeneously dispersed together with magnetic Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles in electrospun cellulose nanofibers, were promising for the removal",

Quantum dots (QDs) are a class of semiconductor nanomaterials with adjustable emission spectra and long fluorescence life so that they are suitable for the construction of luminescent probes in CL imaging assays. In particular, nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) with excellent light stability have been used as luminescence probes for ascorbic acid detection based on the catalysis of copper ion [36]. \n\nIn addition, polymers have also been employed as probes in CL imaging assays. Through using molecularly imprinted polymers as recognition probes, the selectivity of CL imaging has been significantly improved [37][38][39], achieving sensitive and specific detection of a variety of small organic molecules, such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [40], trans-resveratrol [41], dipyridamole [42] and dansyl-phenylalanine [43]. Recently, using folic acid and HRP-bifunctionalized semiconducting polymer dots as integrated probes, a CL platform was developed for imaging of cancer cells and targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumors via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) (Figure 1C) [44].",

            "text": "In anticancer studies, QDs are predominantly utilized for imaging purposes in conjunction with various nanoparticles to observe drug targeting and release. While QDs have been found to enhance drug activity in certain cases, there is limited research exploring their synergy with anticancer phytochemicals. It is important to note that QDs can exhibit cytotoxic effects, although coating the core can mitigate these toxicities. Nevertheless, the presence of heavy metals in QDs remains a health concern. On the other hand, carbon dots (CQDs) derived from natural sources offer a promising alternative as quasi-spherical particles with reduced health risks. These carbon dots possess optical properties and, if prepared from a natural product exhibiting anticancer activity, can independently elicit improved anticancer effects. Additionally, such carbon dots have demonstrated specificity towards cancer cells. To overcome the challenges associated with CQDs in drug delivery systems, comprehensive in vivo studies are needed, and the specific targeting can be achieved by attaching receptor ligands to the CQDs. Small semiconducting particles or nanocrystals known as QDs have extremely small diameters. They were initially found in 1980. The unbelievably high surface-to-volume ratios of these dots contribute to their unusual electronic properties, which are intermediate between those of discrete molecules and bulk semiconductors [45,46]. Fluorescence, where the nanocrystals can produce distinct colors depending on the size of the particles, is the most noticeable effect of this. The quantum dot is a type of nanoparticle with dimensions between tens of nanometers and a few hundredths of a nanometer, which are smaller than those of a typical nanoparticle. The tumor dot can be used in multiple fields, including solar cells, light-producing diodes, lasers, and biomedical applications because the quantum mechanical behavior associated with it exhibits various optical and electronic properties [47]. \n\nDue to their unusual properties, such as their small size, high surface area, photoluminescence, chemical stability, simple synthesis, and potential for functionalization, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have attracted a lot of attention recently [48]. They are fluorescent carbon nanostructures with a size of less than 10 nm.",

The rotor-containing fluorogens exhibit low frequency vibrational modes in dilute solutions, which induce very fast non-radiative decay of the excited singlet states to emit faint fluorescence. In the aggregation state, these modes are eliminated by intermolecular steric interactions, which activate the radiative pathway. The fascinating features (e.g. low fluorescence as molecular species, high brightness in aggregates and large Stokes shifts) of AIE fluorogens led to booming development of polymer encapsulated AIE nanoparticles in the past two years, making them a new promising tool for imaging. \n\nConjugated polymers (CPs) represent the macromolecular emitters. Due to their highly delocalized p-conjugated backbones, 24 CPs show distinguished advantages over small organic dyes in terms of higher absorptivity, better photostability, larger Stokes shift, and stronger interaction with the encapsulation matrices. In addition, the optical properties of CPs can be feasibly customized through backbone and side-chain modifications. 25 ][33] Earlier studies have shown that self-assembled water-soluble polymers are ideal for sensing, imaging, drug delivery and photodynamic therapy. 27,34,35 However, it is time-consuming to design and modify each polymer to endow them with water-solubility.",

[85][86][87][88][89] QDs are typically between 2 and 6 nm and have unique optical properties depending on the size, such as fluorescent multi-color emission spectra, high quantum yields, and excellent resistance to photobleaching by excitation light. These optical properties are suitable in most fluorescence applications, particularly for long-term monitoring of labeled substances, an area in which QDs have a singular advantage over conventional fluorescent organic dyes.\n\nIn vitro biological applications of QDs include cell labeling and tracking cell migration, and in vivo they are applied as contrast agents in tumor-tissue sections. [90][91][92][93] The QD surface is generally covered by trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and n-octylamine derivatives to form a stable hydrophobic layer. [94] QDs are difficult to disperse in aqueous medium themselves and sometimes they induce serious damage to the target cells and tissues. Thus, the surfaces of QDs must be modified polymer. The nanoparticles could disperse well in an aqueous medium and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the QD core and fluorescent dye was observed in the media at pH values of 7.4 and 5.0. This change in pH corresponded to an endocytosis process known as the proton sponge effect. The fluorescence spectrum was significantly altered between pH 7.4 and 5.0 because the distance between the QDs and fluorescent dye changed according to the pKa (7.1) of the pH-responsive poly(DEAEMA) segment. Thus, when the distance between the QDs and fluorescent dye was within several nanometers at pH 7.4, FRET was induced from the QDs (the donor) to the fluorescent dye (the acceptor). This produced an increase in the fluorescence intensity of the red fluorescent dye. Alternatively, when the distance increased at pH 5.0 due to protonation of the polymer DMAEMA units, independent fluorescence of the QDs and fluorescent dye were observed.

Such broadband compatibility takes advantage of the favorable photophysical characteristics of these unique laser sources to improve SBR beyond the capabilities of conventional 2P titanium-sapphire (Ti:S) microscopy. Moreover, the ability to excite polymer dots at longer wavelengths allows us to approach an ideal biological imaging wavelength situated at 1,300 nm where absorption and tissue scattering events are minimized. 8,23 For instance, the photophysical advantages of longer wavelength excitation of PFPV (\u03bb ex = 1,060 nm) coupled with the ytterbium-fiber laser's intrinsic pulse characteristics results in a 3.5-fold improvement in SBR, and an overall 50 \u00b5m gain in penetration depth in vivo.

            "text": "Inorganic NPs are useful in cancer detection and diagnostic applications because of their photochemical, photothermal, and magnetic properties, and feasibility owing to their complex, durable cores and rigid outer surface with various kinds of drug agents. Several magnetic NPs, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide particles, have been used in image contrast and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for tumor detection. The diagnostic capability of these NPs can be enhanced by the complexity of surface modifications of these molecules with targeting functionalities, such as therapeutic superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs),which are made of an iron oxide NP core that carries both contrast agents for MRI as well as therapeutic drugs, and the coating on the surface is favorable for interactions between biological systems and SPION [152]. Furthermore, gold NPs are used in tumor imaging owing to their optical and electrical properties, and have been described as \"promising nanocarriers for therapeutics\" because of their easy synthesis and functionalization, relative biocompatibility, and low toxicity [153]. These NPs can be easily modified as they present negative reactive groups on the surface and a core of gold atoms. Ultra-small gold NPs are uniformly distributed within the tumor tissues owing to their ability to diffuse through tissues; however, their use is limited by poor uptake. Semiconductor NPs called quantum dots (QD), owing to their quantum and size effects, have unique optical properties, which make them useful as imaging probes [154]. The most commonly used QD system is composed of an inner semiconductor core of CdSe coated with a ZnS outer shell. QDs are also used as biosensors for cancer diagnosis owing to their unique properties, such as prolonged, stable, and intense fluorescence, resistance to photobleaching, and highly sensitive detection [155]. Moreover, some organic polymers have been fabricated along with gold NPs and QDs to form hybrid systems in order to achieve drug packaging and diagnostic capabilities for effective drug delivery along with treatment response and real-time monitoring of tumor activity [156].",

            "text": "It is worth noticing that, compared with other types of PAI probes, conjugated polymer nanoparticles usually show higher light stability and enhanced PA brightness [45]. In addition, conjugated polymer nanoparticles can also be used as photothermal reagents, due to their high NIR light absorption and strong non-radiation quantum efficiency [46]. In the NIR window, the photothermal effect of conjugated polymer nanoparticles has the ability to convert light energy into heat, which can be used to ablate tumor cells for photothermal therapy (PTT) [47,48]. Conjugated polymer dots are easy to couple with biological molecules, can participate in the energy transfer process with other dyes, and can be used in complex biological environments. They also have outstanding security, stability, and resolution, which provide better materials for cell imaging. As excellent biomedical nanoparticles, conjugated polymer nanoparticles and conjugated polymer dots have been used to develop a range of biomedical diagnostic and therapeutic methods. \n\nIn this review, we summarize recent advances in the design and application of CP materials, mainly in bioimaging and tumor diagnosis and treatment. We focus on problems of bioimaging and cancer therapy of CPs, with an emphasis on the discussion of researchers' strategies to rationally design functionalized CPs for bioimaging and cancer diagnosis and treatment. Firstly, we summarized the applications to obtain biological information, utilizing functionalized CPNPs with high brightness and good photostability, such as multicolor imaging, two-photon imaging, super-resolution imaging, photoacoustic imaging, and Raman imaging, and discussed potential challenges and developments for the future. Additionally, based on the properties of tunable emission wavelengths and photothermal and photoacoustic conversion, various cancer therapies have been developed. We illustrated the potential mechanisms of photoconversion and reviewed the progress of emerging phototherapies, including photothermal and photodynamic therapy and combination therapy. Finally, the potential challenges and future developments of CP materials for tumor diagnosis and treatment are presented to improve the optical functionalization of CP materials, as well as their translation to clinical applications.",

            "text": "Fluorescence imaging is an optical imaging method based on the excitation/emission of molecules . The use of fluorescent molecular probes-as fluorescent dyes and fluorescent proteins-has been widely applied in the labeling of biomolecules, cells and tissues. Although these probes are already used in vivo, for instance in retinal angiography and visualization of arteries, they are unsuitable for real-time imaging assays, regarding their low photostability and sensitivity at the cellular and molecular levels (Santra and Malhotra, 2011). The application of fluorophores in real-time in vivo imaging has also been limited by the high absorption of optical signal by tissues and body fluids in the UV and visible wavelength. The light scattering caused by tissues that attenuate the optical signal and the tissue auto-fluorescence that influences the background signal is also a limitation (Santra and Malhotra, 2011). Additionally, some fluorescent probes may be toxic for cells and body (Li et al., 2013). Several NP-based strategies have been proposed to overcome the limitations of fluorescent dyes for real-time in vivo imaging (Supplementary Material) (Santra and Malhotra, 2011;Wang et al., 2013b).\n\nFluorescent-labeled NPs are more stable in the body and increase the detection sensitivity and photostability. In the same platforms, a great number of probe molecules can be incorporated, in opposite to a single conventional molecule. Also, in NPs, fluorescent dyes can be protected from quenching and degradation (Santra and Malhotra, 2011;Wang et al., 2013b).\n\nThe most extensively studied nanosystems for fluorescence imaging are quantum dots (QDs) , inorganic fluorescent NPs that can be based on metallic or semiconductor materials, such as CdSe and CdTe (Ballou et al., 2004). As reviewed by Cai and Chen, in ideal conditions, QDs can have better properties than organic fluorescence probes. These include high resistance to degradation and photobleaching, high quantum yields, high molar extinction coefficients, continuous absorption spectra covering from UV to near-infrared, long fluorescence lifetimes (>10 ns), narrow emission spectra and very long effective Stokes shifts . QDs have been used for innumerous applications, from",

They offer valuable insights into the structure and function of biological systems that are not attainable through alternative techniques. These materials allow us to uncover the molecular makeup, precise positioning, interactions, and movement of biomolecules within living cells or tissues. 23,26,27 he effectiveness of FL imaging currently relies on the photophysical properties of fluorescent dyes (FDs), including their excellent photostability and large Stokes shift, as well as their concentration at the target site. 28,29 Various organic FDs such as porphyrin, Nile red, 30 BODIPY, 31 fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate, 32 and rhodamine 33 have been developed to achieve the desired FL signal output and high SNR. However, a major challenge lies in the poor accumulation of FDs in tumors, resulting in a low SNR during the diagnostic process. 5][36] For example, researchers have developed polymer-based nanoparticles that encapsulate NIR FDs for FL imaging-guided synergistic cancer therapy. 37",

            "text": "Fluorescence-based sensors have high sensitivity and selectivity, which allows them a strong precedence in detecting tumor biomarkers. Due to their exceptional electronic structure and diminutive size, some MNPs commonly demonstrate high fluorescence quantum yields and molar extinction coefficients, along with notable photostability, making them frequently used for constructing fluorescence sensors. Quantum dots are one of the earliest nanomaterials applied in the field of bioscience. Compared with traditional organic dyes, they have higher quantum yields, better photostability, and longer luminescence lifetimes, but their toxicity and broad absorption band severely limit their use in biomedicine. In 2012, Luo et al., first discovered that the interaction between thiol salts and Au elements significantly amplified the intensity of luminescence in the materials. Subsequent studies revealed that the luminescence mechanism is achieved through ligand-metal charge transfer or ligand-metal-metal charge transfer, followed by radiation relaxation through a metal-centered triplet state, resulting in luminescence [66][67][68]. \n\nHuang et al., designed satellite structures of Au nanorods (Au NRs) and Ag 2 S quantum dots (Ag 2 S QDs) that are precisely regulated by DNA. The optimal metal-enhanced fluorescence effect is achieved when the distance between the two is approximately 8 nm [69]. In light of this, the structure is used for the accurate detection of the prostate cancer marker urine prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), exhibiting high sensitivity and selectivity. The linear correlation between the variables is well suited within an interval of 5-500 pM, and the limit of detection for PCA3 is 1.42 pM. Importantly, the designed metal-enhanced near-infrared fluorescent satellite structure probe has been successfully used to detect PCA3 in human serum samples and prostate cancer cell lysates, demonstrating promising potential in the field of clinical cancer diagnosis. \n\nCTCs are a significant cause of postoperative recurrence and distant metastasis in patients, as well as a critical factor leading to their mortality [70]. Many fluorescent nanomaterials emitting visible light have been applied to the subsequent detection of CTCs.",

            "text": "CQDs have flourished in a variety of disciplines due to their superior chemical stability, optical characteristics, and renal clearance capabilities. Compared to organic dyes and conventional QDs, the improved photostability of CQDs may be attributed to their structure and composition. 53,54 CQDs are core\u2212shell composites consisting of a carbon core and surface passivation with various functional groups, such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amine, among others. This makes them hydrophilic and allows for a variety of surface functionalization and passivation processes to be carried out. 55 Due to the \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking, they are useful as carriers for various aromatic anticancer medicines. The cells take up these nanoscale quantum dots via energy-dependent endocytosis pathways. \n\nCQDs can be synthesized via various physical, chemical, and biological ways but top-down and bottom-up approaches are the two most widely used methods. 56 While any method can be used to synthesize CQDs, researchers favor the biological approach since it is cost-effective, cleaner, greener, and environmentally friendly. \n\nThe top-down strategy involves the chemical or physical breakdown of bulk material into nanostructures. Although this technique is straightforward and easily adjustable to meet our requirements, there are disadvantages, such as imperfections on the surface of the nanostructures. On the other hand, the bottom-up method may result in less waste and, therefore, can be more cost-effective. Bottom-up approaches entail assem- bling material atom by atom, then molecule by molecule or cluster by cluster, ultimately producing nanostructures. 55 arious techniques involved in the bottom-up and top-down approaches have been illustrated in Figure 1. \n\nCQDs: Role in Bioimaging. Numerous organic fluorophores are commercially available; however, QDs are favored due to their excellent resistance to photobleaching. 57 CQDs made from natural products exhibit a greater luminescence, biocompatibility, and solubility than those synthesized from other sources. 58 Compared to organic dyes and other cadmium-based QDs, CQDs feature emission peaks that are more clearly defined and broader excitation spectra.",

            "text": "In vivo imaging with multiphoton fluorescence microscopy (MPM) is widely used due to its ability to provide diffraction-limited, three-dimensional images of intact tissue at depths ranging from a few hundred microns to more than 1 mm. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] Recent reports of deep tissue, in vivo imaging with two-and three-photon excitation have demonstrated the potential of imaging structures in the brain beyond the cortex, including the corpus callosum and hippocampus. 8,9 These advances have been driven in part by the availability of new ultrafast laser sources at longer wavelengths (\u03bb ex = 1000 -1600 nm) than those traditionally used in two-photon fluorescence imaging (\u03bb ex = 700 -900 nm). Equally important to the availability of laser sources is the availability of contrast agents with strong multiphoton absorption properties at these longer wavelengths. In this paper, we show that an emerging class of fluorophores termed polymer dots 10 possess strong two-and three-photon excitation across a broad range of wavelengths and enable deep imaging of microvasculature in the brain.\n\nMPM of vasculature requires the intravenous injection of bright, biocompatible contrast agents that preferably exhibit large absorption cross sections under near-infrared (NIR) excitation (\u03bb ex = 700 -1000 nm) and prolonged blood circulation times. Traditional exogenous contrast agents for in vivo MPM include organic dyes such as dextran-conjugated fluorescein and indocyanine green or inorganic semiconductor quantum dots. 11,12 Organic dyes, however, suffer from poor photostability and low quantum yields in aqueous biological environments. 13.14,15 Although quantum dots offer improved brightness and photostability, they present substantial toxicity concerns and are prone to bioaccumulation in organs and tissues. 16,17,18 Thus, the biological imaging community is eager for a safer, brighter, and more stable probe for deep, high-resolution in vivo imaging.\n\nThe highly fluorescent semiconducting polymer dot (pdot) is a promising candidate for in vivo MPM with material properties that can potentially overcome many of the limitations faced by other probes. 19 Although pdots are similar",

[33][34] Alternatively, dye-doped fluorescent polymer particles are very promising because they can overcome the issues of photochemical degradation (e.g., of dyes) and cytotoxicity (e.g., of quantum dots). [18,[35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42] Furthermore, fluorescent polymer particles can be tailored with additional advantages such as biocompatibility, longer fluorescence lifetime, large absorption coefficients, and multicolor labeling ability that make them suitable optical agents for labeling of biological as well as materials systems. [36] Most of the types of polymers can be classified as amorphous (as well as semi-crystalline) and insulating materials. [43] They are usually not conducting the electricity, not interacting with light, and hence do not appear to absorb and reemit the light (fluorescence). However, specific types of polymer particles are highly suitable and nontoxic for biological systems because of their excellent biocompatibility, stimuli responsiveness, crosslinking variability, and cargo-carrying ability. [44][45][46][47][48] Furthermore, the merging of bright fluorophores with polymer particles allows them to use as potential optical agents. [36] In this way, the combination of the fluorescent property of fluorophores and biocompatibility of polymer particles can create powerful fluorescent labels that are prerequisites for fluorescence-based biological and biomedical applications. Since fluorescent polymer particles are promising candidates for labeling, the key challenges during their formation need to be addressed. Some of those challenges are obtaining their size homogeneity, efficient linking of fluorophores to prevent leaking, prevention of aggregation caused quenching of fluorophores in the polymer matrix, and desired surface properties of particles for interfacial interactions with targeted sites.

Cao et al. reported that polypyrrolecoated AuNR showed a final temperature of 58.3 \u2022 C compared to the uncoated AuNR along with tumor suppression, and the antitumor property could be further improved by loading doxorubicin (DOX) into the polymer shell. The incorporation of Fe 3 O 4 into the core enhanced the therapeutic application as demonstrated by improved magnetic resonance imaging and CT imaging efficiencies [67]. Incorporating other semiconducting metal ions into the AuNPs induces a redshift in their SPR peak to the NIR region [68,69]. The strong SPR absorption in NPs can enhance the charge separation in semiconducting materials, which results in the conversion of optical energy into thermal energy. Leng et al. showed that incorporation of copper sulfide into AuNRs induced an SPR peak shift up to 803 nm compared to bare AuNR and increased the light-to-heat conversion efficiency from 39% to 56% [68]. Moreover, the copper coating enhanced the photostability of the hybrid system to afford a final temperature of 60 \u2022 C under an 808 nm laser (0.9 W\u2022cm \u22122 ) for 10 min compared to AuNRs, which showed a decrease in temperature from 52.5 \u2022 C to 47 \u2022 C after several cycles. Following this work, Kumar et al. showed that molybdenum coating improved the PT effect and a final temperature of 60.3 \u2022 C could be attained for the AuNBP-Mo hybrid material [69]. Compared to molybdenum disulfide and AuNBP, the hybrid material showed a decrease in Hela cell viability up to 21.6%, indicating the enhanced PTT effect by the AuNBP-Mo hybrid system.",

They contribute significantly to the imaging process, traversing biological barriers and circulating before reaching their destinations. Enhancements involve conjugating cancerspecific antibodies to nanoparticles for improved tumor binding and detection [7]. Recent studies suggest nanoparticles and sensors can enhance cancer diagnostics and detection sensitivity. Diagnostic indicators include methylation patterns and mutation identification, while clinical diagnosis methods using circulating tumor cells, cell-free RNA, and extracellular vesicles require further investigation [7]. Stabilized by trimethoxysilane, (3-Mercaptopropyl) fluorescent gold nanoclusters and superparamagnetic ferrite are incorporated with polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate to create Fe 3 O 4 /GNCs nanoprobes on \"Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 nanoparticles\" [9]. Cancer-targeting antibodies exhibit enhanced infiltration into tumor cells with increased sensitivity when delivered via metallic nanoparticles, such as platinum, copper, silver, gold, and cobalt nanocomposites. These nanocomposites have demonstrated potential in cancer diagnostics and imaging, facilitating precise colon and breast cancer cell penetration and improved diagnostic signals. Because of their unique magnetic, chemical, and optical properties, nanoscale materials are employed to create imaging probes for positron emission tomography (PET), MRI, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and ultrasound, offering enhanced sensitivity, temporal and spatial information, and improved control over biodistribution, contrast, functionality, and multimodal imaging. These advancements promise future clinical benefits, including real-time disease monitoring, personalized therapy, and early diagnosis.",

            "text": "Beyond molecular and biomolecular luminescent materials, colloidal luminescent nanomaterials have gained attention in recent years [18,19]. Luminescent nanomaterials including semiconductor quantum dots, carbon dots, metal-doped nanoparticles, noble-metal nanoparticles, and organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles, have been studied for their ultrabright photoluminescence (PL) [20][21][22][23]. Semiconductor quantum dots (SCQDs) such as CdSe, CdTe, CdS, ZnS, ZnSe, PbS and PbSe have widely been studied as luminescent nanomaterials [24,25]. This is attributed to the possibilities to tune their size, surface functionalities, quantum confinement and high quantum yield (60-90%) [26,27]. Importantly, SCQDs display a broad spectrum of colors covering ultraviolet to near-infrared (NIR). Furthermore, SCQDs offer better sensitivity, stability against photobleaching, and a narrow spectral bandwidth compared to conventional organic dyes. However, due to their cytotoxicity, the tendency to undergo aggregation inside the cells, and easy oxidation, the extensive use in bioimaging remained a challenge. Therefore, efforts have been made to prepare silicon quantum dots (SQDs) [28]. SQDs exhibit relatively low cytotoxicity and better biocompatibility compared to SCQDs. Moreover, SQDs show broad absorption spectra, higher photostability, and the PL can be tuned from the visible to the NIR region [29]. Similar to SCQDs, SQDs undergo oxidation at room temperature and have limited water solubility. \n\nRecently, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with tunable size and shape-specific physicochemical properties have emerged as attractive luminescent nanomaterials [30]. Despite the early discovery of the luminescence phenomenon in bulk gold and gold films, the PL of gold remained unexplored for several decades [31,32]. This is attributed to the low quantum yield (10 \u221210 ), which limited the practical application and the understanding of the luminescence phenomenon in detail.",

Nano-BFF shows high photo stability and efficient photothermal conversion. The authors evaluated its use as a theranostic material for photoacoustic imaging and hyperthermia cancer therapy. While the data demonstrate promising properties of this new nanomaterial, its advantages over similar materials have not been conclusively shown. Response: Thank you for useful comments. We have performed additional experiments to address the issues raised by the reviewer. Please see the following detailed responses to your comments and suggestions. \n\n1. First, the use of ICG for comparison may not be sufficient. There are reported nanoparticles including polymer nanoparticles, at least they should compare to gold nano rods widely used for photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy. They are readily available. I could not find the extinction coefficient of Nano-BFF, in trying to get a sense of how much better this material was. Response: Thank you for your constructive question. To further validate the excellent photothermal stability of Nano-BFF, we evaluated the photostability of BFF, Nano-BFF, clinically used indocyanine green (ICG), and Au nanorods (Au NRs) under NIR-I or NIR-II laser irradiation. The characteristic peak of Au nanorods decreased and shifted to the shorter wavelength region, owing to the significant aggregation of Au nanorods upon exposure to continuous NIR-I laser irradiation (Supplementary Fig. 10). In contrast, the absorption spectra of BFF and Nano-BFF were nearly unchanged during NIR-I laser irradiation period (Supplementary Fig. 11b-d,f). Especially, NIR-II laser illumination exhibited a negligible effect on the optical property of Nano-BFF (Supplementary Fig. 11e,f). These results demonstrated that Nano-BFF with high photostability could serve as a desirable phototheranostic agent for PA imaging-guided disease treatment. \n\nFurthermore, the photothermal conversion performance of Nano-BFF was also investigated.",

            "text": "The exploitation of semiconductor quantum dots as nanoprobes is achieving great heights in the field of medical science because of their excellent fluorescent property. The technological significance of quantum dots makes them suitable to be used for cellular imaging. QDs need only a single excitation source to execute multiplexed imaging due to their wide absorption and narrow emission properties. QDs exhibit quantum mechanical characteristics and emit a particular fluorescent color when excited with a light source such as UV light. The extension in wavelength of QDs has resulted in enhanced tissue penetration and minimized background fluorescence. In vivo imaging depends on the Stokes shift, which varies according to the wavelength of the excitation light. QDs have higher photostability and an intense fluorescence property, due to which they are outperforming organic fluorescent dyes and proteins. The brightness of QDs in photon-limited conditions is better than that of organic dyes because of their larger molar extinction coefficient. The application of QDs as a classic fluorescent probe and nanocarrier material has contributed largely to early cancer detection and the study of signal transduction and cell localization. According to a recent study, it has been found that surface-modified CdTe QDs boosted the anti-tumor activity of the drug against the oncogenic cell [111]. In addition to this, intravenous injection of PEGylated QDs conjugated with monoclonal antibodies resulted in the specific targeting of tumor tissue [112].",

In this regard, the use of nanoparticles, especially quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as popular candidates due to their unique quantum confinement properties. Despite possessing numerous advantageous properties, inorganic semiconducting QD materials still face major drawbacks in terms of their application in the clinical arena primarily due to their biocompatibility issues. 1,2 Scientists were therefore in constant pursuit of an alternative and the emergence of carbon dots (CDs) as a novel class of luminescent nanomaterials has revolutionized the field of nanoparticle research. CDs, primarily classified as carbon nanodot, carbon quantum dot (CQD), carbonized polymer dot (CPD), and graphene quantum dot (GQD), 3,4 displayed their superior properties as compared to the traditional organic fluorescent dyes and inorganic semiconductor quantum dots. The advantages of CDs include but are not limited to their facile preparation and purification techniques, tunable photoluminescence (PL) emission, availability of surface functional groups, superior photostability, and excellent biocompatibility. 5 Subsequently, CDs are explored in many different applications including bioimaging, sensing, optoelectronic devices, drug delivery, catalysis, anti-counterfeiting, etc., where CDs have been demonstrated as an emergent frontier nanomaterial. The afterglow CD materials 6 with longer shelf-life, improved phosphorescence, and delayed fluorescence also deserve special emphasis in this regard. Thus, in lieu of their scientific significance and advanced applications, numerous review articles have been published to date on CDs summarizing the various aspects of their synthetic methods, unique photophysical properties, and potential applications in different fields, for example, theranostics, industry, and agriculture. However, it is very important to be up to date in the rapidly evolving field of CD research, and we believe that this review will address to this need.\n\nIn this review article, we initially provide a brief introduction to the chemical composition and types of CDs (Section 2).

Theranostic systems can potentially Ivyspring International Publisher assist in non-invasive monitoring of both the disease progression and nanoparticle drug delivery route [1]. Stimuli-responsive polymers and imaging agents (e.g. quantum dots, organic dyes or iron oxide nanoparticles) are attractive candidates for formulating theranostic systems, as they can be tracked following administration and provide controlled drug release in response to external stimuli. However, these systems are limited by non-biodegradability of polymers and by toxicity, photobleaching and possible leaching-out of the imaging agents [2]. To overcome these limitations, biodegradable photoluminescent materials have been developed from diverse materials such as porous silicon nanostructures, conjugated polymeric nanoparticles containing \u03c0 conjugated electron systems, and combinations of polyethylene glycol, citric acid, aliphatic diols and amino acid based polymers for in vivo biomedical applications such as tumor imaging and tracking the degradation progress of implanted scaffold materials [3][4][5][6]. The degradability of these polymers and the superior photoluminescent properties such as high quantum yield, photobleaching resistance, and tunable emission up to near infrared region, make them unique for trackable drug delivery systems. Moreover, these polymers have demonstrated excellent compatibility and imaging ability both in vitro [7] and in vivo [5].\n\nThermo-responsive polymers have long been studied for drug delivery applications due to their attractive temperature-dependent drug release behavior. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) and its copolymers are the most commonly used thermo-responsive polymers for such applications [8,9]. PNIPAAm undergoes a reversible phase-transition at a characteristic lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 32\u00b0C [10][11][12]. At temperatures below the LCST, the polymer becomes hydrophilic and swells by absorbing large quantities of water; whereas at temperatures higher than the LCST, the interactions among hydrophobic groups increase, causing the polymer to",

Fig. 2c shows results for 0.1 mg ml \u00c01 polymer nanospheres in water, with and without crosslinking. Also shown for comparison are equivalent results for the free dye in de-aerated ethanol (8.6 mM). The free dye underwent rapid quenching, losing 25% of its emission intensity in the first hour and virtually all of its emission intensity over the ten hour duration of the measurement. The dye in non-crosslinked PS-co-MA nanospheres fared better, retaining B88% of its initial intensity after ten hours. The dye in crosslinked PS-co-MA nanospheres fared better still, retaining virtually all (B98%) of its intensity after ten hours.

            "text": "Optical imaging modality is advantageous over other techniques for lymphatic imaging because it is cost effective, noninvasive, and of greater speed and needs no exposure of any radiation and improved sensitivity and shows high resolution at shallow depths. In literature, different studies are reported for the optical imaging of the sentinel lymph node. However, this review describes the application of quantum dots (QDs) that are fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals having distinctive electrical and optical features [72]. Their size ranges between 1-100 nm. QDs possess many excellent characteristics for example, 10-100 times more brightness than many dyes, quantum yield equal to approximately unity in comparison to the organic dyes and fluorescent proteins, extensive absorption properties, a comparatively lengthy fluorescence life time, a thin line width in emission spectra, continuous emission maxima, and insignificant photolightning. The absorption and emission properties of QDs depend upon its size and composition which is controlled by various synthetic approaches. In addition, the polymeric surface functionalization of QDs assists in targeting and avoiding from macrophage clearance [73,74] which make QDs suitable for biosensing, cell labeling, nucleic acid assessment, and in vivo fluorescence scanning [75,76]. \n\nAn important application of QDs is to identify the lymph node pathways. The small size of QDs is responsible for its endocytosis by cells especially by the macrophages in lymph node localizing the QDs in sentinel lymph node facilitating for fluorescence scanning. If QDs do not localize in lymphatics away from sentinel node, and thus may not be promising for scanning the distal lymphatic drainage. Ballou et al. in 2004 coated four QDs with various surface coating agents for their localization. According to results, the QDs remained fluorescent for at least 4 months in vivo [77]. For mapping the SLN, Ballou et al. reported the movement of quantum dots with different charged surface groups injected into murine tumor models [9].",

Inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots, QDots), having singular optical properties (tuneable and narrow emission spectra, good stability and long photoluminescence lifetime), are ideal candidates for imaging applications. In one of the \ue103rst examples of interfacing SPAAC with nanotechnology, Bernardin et al. reported the use of CdSe/ ZnS QDots functionalised with a cyclooctynyl-glycolic acid derivative for imaging the metabolic incorporation of tetraacetylated N-azidoacetylmannosamine (Ac 4 ManNAz) on the membranes of live Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. 69 The strained alkyne was conjugated to the surface of amino-QDots via amide coupling and the reactivity of the resulting cyclooctynyl-QDots towards the bioorthogonal azide partner was tested both under CuAAC and SPAAC conditions. It has been shown that the use of Cu(I) can induce irreversible photoluminescence quenching via energy/electron transfer or alteration of the core structure of the QDots; 147 therefore, the \ue104uorescence quantum yield of the conjugates obtained under Cu(I) catalysis was found to be about three times lower than the one of the corresponding SPAAC conjugates. In terms of bioorthogonal imaging capabilities, the QDots were used at nanomolar concentrations (organic dye probes typically require concentrations above 50 mM). The improved sensitivity over classical organic \ue104uorophores was attributed to the multivalent presentation of the cyclooctyne groups on the QDot surface.\n\nDespite the potential of QDots for bioimaging applications, they pose toxicity concerns related to the presence of heavy metal ions; 148 this led to the development of more biocompatible alternatives, such as polymer dots and carbon quantum dots. Semiconducting polymer dots (PDots) are non-toxic and exhibit superior properties when compared to QDots in term of brightness and photostability; 149 moreover, unlike QDots, they are compatible with the CuAAC reaction.

These inorganic nanoparticles have been prepared by a variety of chemical methods, however, those relying on colloidal synthesis offer several advantages for nanomedicines such as their easy biofunctionalization, namely, for bioimaging diagnosis. Among the biomarkers used for these purposes, quantum dots stand out for their size-dependent photoluminescence, narrow and tunable emission bands, photostability, and pronounced Stokes shift. Furthermore, the observation of size-tuned photoluminescence in quantum dots under irradiation using a single light source makes these particles suitable for multiplexing methods of analysis. Seminal research on colloidal quantum dots involved mainly the synthesis of Cd-containing materials using hot injection methods, whose surfaces could be subsequently modified with biomolecules. Currently, alternatives to toxic Cd-containing quantum dots are available and have been a subject of interest for bioimaging, such as zinc-sulfide-coated indium phosphide quantum dots or other types of fluorescent nanoparticles, including silica nanocomposites [109,110]. \n\nThe present imaging techniques available such as X-ray scan, MRI, and computer tomography have serious limitations when it comes to cancer diagnosis and the main limitation is that those techniques cannot recognize small numbers of malignant cells in primary or in metastatic sites [111]. Because quantum dots have improved signal brightness, synchronous excitation of multiple fluorescence colors, and size-tunable light emission, they have been explored as biofunctionalized labels for cancer imaging [10]. However, besides the requirements for cytotoxicity assessment, quantum dots still pose challenges concerning their use in bioimaging, such as the observation of tissue autofluorescence and photon scattering.",

On the other hand, they also face several problems: (i) they necessitate a stable coating for functionalization, (ii) exhibit a long tissue retention, (iii) only insufficient knowledge is available about their toxicity (especially in case of quantum dots, consisting of Cd ions and other potentially toxic metals), metabolism, and excretion, and (iv) they strongly accumulate in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and thus in liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Furthermore, the stoichiometry of the conjugated moieties is difficult to control or quantify after reaction. Nevertheless, most of the hybrid compounds developed for dual PET and OI so far are based on nanoparticles as carriers. \n\nThe group of nanoparticles applicable as structural basis for hybrid PET/OI agents consists of several different subgroups: polymer-based nanoparticles [60], lipid-based particles such as micelles [61] and liposomes [62], carbonbased systems such as nanotubes [63], and also metal-based nanoparticles such as iron oxide [5,27,[64][65][66][67], silica [8], and upconversion nanoparticles [68,69] as well as quantum dots (QDs) [70][71][72][73]. \n\nQDs are fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals whose fluorescent properties can be influenced by the particle size and composition. Furthermore, they exhibit high quantum yields and photostability [74], making them interesting fluorophores for the development of compounds for hybrid PET/optical imaging when stably radiolabeled with a positron-emitter (Figure 6(a)).",

Compared with conventional metal-based semiconducting quantum dots with long-term toxicity and environmental problems, BPQDs had excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity in human systems. These properties are important for BPQDs to be considered as an ideal candidate material for biological imaging and biomarkers. 83 Wu et al. prepared highly \ue104uorescent and stable BPQDs by a liquid stripping method using ultrasonic probe treatment and solvent heat treatment in ethanol. Compared with previously reported results, BPQDs obtained by this new method exhibited an excellent photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield, as high as 70% in water. And the PL stability for 150 days in the surrounding environment was also very high. The experimental results showed that the photostability of the prepared BPQDs was better than that of many heavy metal semiconductor nanostructures and organic \ue104uorescent dyes with high PL, mainly resulting from the quantum size effect and the introduction of two surface states related to P-OH and P-O-CH 2 CH 3 by the ethanol treatment (Fig. 19). Polar water molecules removed non-radiative centers and increased P-related \ue104uorescent groups, which enhanced PL by effective carrier transfer to the surface radiation state. Taking advantage of the excellent \ue104uorescence characteristics, BPQDs had excellent performance in cell labeling with good biocompatibility, showing great potential for biological imaging (Fig. 20). 84 Zhang et al. successfully synthesized several layers of BPQDs through a pulsed laser ablation (PLA) method in isopropyl ether (IPE) solvent. The prepared sample had a wrinkled hexagonal structure, which showed stable blue-purple luminescence and     a relatively high PL quantum yield (about 20.7%) for the \ue103rst time a\ue09der 15 days, which was 3 times higher than that of BPQDs prepared by ultrasonic exfoliation using a probe (about 7.2%). The prepared BPQDs were used for biological imaging of HeLa cells, showing a good PL signal and excellent biocompatibility.

Nanoparticles can be used as probes in in vivo imaging, biosensing, and immunostaining because of their unique physical and physiochemical properties. First of all, nanoparticles are small enough and can enter tumor microenvironment using an active transport mechanism through endothelial cells (Sindhwani et al. 2020). Secondly, they have relatively large surface areas to accommodate diverse probe molecules, increase the targeting affinity of individual probe, and are ideal for efficient modification with a variety of targeting and imaging moieties. Thirdly, they exhibit high sensitivity. Many nanoparticles show unique magnetic, optical properties and enable multivalent targeting to one or more biomarkers. Lastly, they can also be engineered as suitable platforms for tumor therapy and diagnosis by prolonging half-lives, enhancing stability, and improving targeting efficiency (Baetke et al. 2015;Chen et al. 2013;Lee et al. 2010). The well-investigated nanoparticles include magnetic nanoparticles, quantum dots, gold nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, upconversion nanoparticles, carbon nanoparticles, silicon nanoparticles, and many others. \n\nSelected peptides have been conjugated to nanoparticles and extensively used to cancer imaging. Carbon nanoparticles have shown potential as contrast agents for photoacoustic imaging of tumors because they offer high spatial resolution and allow deep tissue imaging. Gambhir's group fabricated single-walled carbon nanotubes conjugated with cyclic RGD peptides as targeting contrast agents for noninvasive cancer imaging and allowed the visualization of multiple molecular processes in living subjects (de la Zerda et al. 2012). Polymer nanoparticles possess excellent optical properties, high structural flexibility and photostability, and are considered as good near-infrared photoacoustic probes for in vivo real-time imaging of many diseases (Li et al. 2018).",

            "text": "\u221220 Previous studies have identified gold, 21\u221223 silver, 18 graphene, 19,20 and aptasensor 24 nanoparticles as nanoquenchers in pesticide detection. A diverse array of fluorescent-based sensors have been developed, incorporating organic dyes, luminescent proteins, metal\u2212 organic frameworks, and quantum dots. Notably, zerodimensional materials such as carbon quantum dots (CQDs), including carbon nanoparticles (CNPs), are highly acknowledged due to their exceptional photostability, biocompatibility, chemical stability, cost-effectiveness, straightforward synthesis, intense fluorescence, large surface area, versatile functionalization, and minimal toxicity. 25 CNPs generally show a semispherical morphology with an amorphous to nanocrystalline structure, mainly made up of oxygen\u2212nitrogen-based groups. They also possess postmodified functional groups facilitating easy interaction and binding to target molecules. 26 CQDs, often derived from natural sources or nontoxic precursors, offer cost-effective solutions suitable for large-scale biosensing applications. 27 The versatility and efficacy of CQDs underscore their pivotal role in advancing pesticide detection technologies. \n\nCQDs can be manufactured through various methods, including hydrothermal synthesis, 28 electrochemical synthesis, 29 and microwave-assisted synthesis. 30 \u221235 Recent research has highlighted the remarkable efficacy of CQDs in evaluating food quality and safety. 36 Investigations have explored dual-mode visual and smart sensing applications using a glyphosate nanosensor based on carbon dots. This sensor boasts a critical detection limit of 0.8 ng/mL and a high quantum yield. 37 Fluorescence biosensors play a pivotal role in environmental monitoring, leveraging their capabilities for fluorescence quenching and enhancement. Accurate pesticide detection has been achieved through a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensing mechanism. Additionally, studies have explored pesticide detection techniques employing the inner filter effect, which operates at distances exceeding 20 nm, in contrast to FRET, which occurs within a range of less than 10 nm. \u221240 Numerous recent studies have focused on synthesizing CQDs from natural sources. 41,42 However, the synthesis of CQDs from tea waste remains sporadic. 43",

            "text": "Quantum dots (QDs) are considered an excellent alternative to organic fluorophores due to their unique optical properties, such as broad excitation spectra, high photostability, size-tunable emission, narrow and symmetric emission spectra, and high quantum yields (QYs) [1]. These characteristics demonstrate them as attractive materials for biomedical and technological applications, such as clinical diagnosis and labeling [2][3][4], as well as for solar energy conversion in photovoltaic devices [5,6].\n\nRegarding their tentative use in the biomedical field, QDs are well-known to respond in the red to near-infrared (NIR) window (600-900 nm), which is highly advantageous for in vitro and in vivo imaging and detection [7]. NIR light easily penetrates animal tissue due to the minimum absorbance of NIR photons [8]. Ternary alloyed QDs have recently emerged as a new class of NIR emitters attracting considerable attention, due to the capability of tuning their optical emission without changing the particle size. Examples of ternary NIR QDs are CuInS 2 , AgInSe 2 , and CdTeSe [9]. Several groups have investigated the synthesis of NIR-emitting CdTeSe QDs [10][11][12][13][14]. Most of these studies are based on core-shell QD synthesis, since this type of QD shows greater photostability and QYs, but their synthesis is complicated and time-consuming. Because of this, a systematic study to obtain only core-doped QDs with high QYs and photostability is required.\n\nSynthetic methods involving organic solvents such as trioctylphosphine (TOP) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) [15] have produced QDs soluble in non-polar solvents exclusively. This condition limits their application in the biomedical arena. Surface modification represents an alternative synthetic strategy to obtain water-soluble and less toxic QDs [16,17]; however, it is known that ligand surface modification fails to maintain the high QYs of QDs. An important strategy is the direct synthesis of water-soluble QDs, in a single step, eliminating the superficial exchange of ligands that leads to significant decreases of",

NCQDs, also known as semiconducting nanoparticles, are small carbon nanoparticles (less than 10 nm in size) with unique optical properties such as photostability, non-photobleaching, signal brightness, and resistance to simultaneous multi-color fluorescence excitation [32]. On the other hand, their optical and electronic properties can be tuned to emit a broad range of visible regions [33]. Extensive studies have been conducted on semiconducting quantum dots, with recent attention and advances in nanoparticle surface chemistry to seize new opportunities for developing pH-responsive nanocarriers using biopolymers and NCQDs [34]. Zavareh et al. fabricated chitosan-carbon quantum dots-aptamer as a carrier of 5-fluorouracil. Based on their results, the fabricated nanocarrier retained the release of 5-fluorouracil in the normal physiological condition (pH 7.4), while releasing almost the entire drug in the tumor microenvironment (pH 5.4) [35]. The nanomaterials of CQDs were examined by Cutrim and his colleagues during the discharge of 5-FU [36]. Antitumor 5-FU was self-assembled onto carbon quantum dots in this work to provide a unique medication delivery method. 5-FU-CQD nanoconjugate may improve tumor treatment by lowering the cytotoxicity towards healthy tissues associated with free 5-FU, according to this research outcome. This allows for the minimization of unpleasant symptoms while retaining the clinical efficacy of 5-FU.",

            "text": "During the last decades, advances in technology (lasers, cameras) have enabled the development of high performance instrumentation for near-infrared fluorescence imaging. This imaging modality has rapidly been propelled toward clinical applications, since the near-infrared region is the best suitable optical window for body in-depth scanning. The use of the currently available near-infrared dyes, especially FDA-approved ICG, has been fully revisited by extending the field of their clinical applications. Due to the depth issue (photon penetration into tissues), near-infrared fluorescence imaging applications have been restricted to superficial tissues, or deep tissues in intraoperative context. For instance, clinical trials are presently ongoing on the accurate identification and resection of the sentinel lymph node, using fluorescence guided surgery. \n\nIn the meantime, nanotechnologies have opened exciting new avenues in the quest of more photostable and highly bright near-infrared tracers, more performing than classical organic dyes in terms of optical properties. The use of nanostructures in comparison to small organic dyes is mainly driven by their different and tunable biodistribution that can be tuned according to article size, shape, charge and flexibility. The wide range of nanostructures explored for the design of efficient nanoprobes is impressive. Quantum dots present several strong physicochemical advantages for this purpose, but their short term translation toward clinics seems impeded by the toxicity issue still in debate for their use in patients. Another encouraging way relies on the entrapment of organic nearinfrared dyes into toxic element-free nanoparticles, especially those developed in pharmaceutical science for drug delivery. These safe nanoparticles, especially polymer-or lipid-based carriers, allow the protection of the near-infrared dyes against chemical and/or biological degradation, improve their photophysical properties, and can be targeted for reaching specific diseased cells, increasing thus the fluorescence signal-over-noise ratio. In fine, the choice of a fluorescent nanoprobe dedicated to a specific medical application will be discussed on the basis of toxicity/adverse effects at the dose to be injected for good image contrast. The same criterion will dictate the choice between small organic dye and nanometer size tracer.",

A variety of nanoparticulated materials, such as lipid nanoparticles, polymer nanoassemblies, and inorganic nanocrystals, have demonstrated their enormous potential for biomedical applications, such as drug delivery, bioimaging, and sensing. The physicochemical properties of NPs, including size, shape, and surface chemistry, signi\ue103cantly affect their fate in biological systems, thereby determining their therapeutic or diagnostic activity. In particular, the correlation between the size of NPs and their interaction with cells and tissue has recently attracted considerable research interest. [1][2][3] In addition to their physicochemical properties, the precise design and synthesis of NPs further render their speci\ue103c characteristics, such as \ue104uorescent, 4 plasmonic, 5 and magnetic properties. 6 Fluorescent NPs have attracted signi\ue103cant attention as effective bioimaging and sensing agents. Since small molecular \ue104uorescent dyes were \ue103rst reported in the late nineteenth century, they have been representative imaging probes for monitoring biological phenomena. 7 The emergence of \ue104uorescent NPs has accelerated the development of numerous imaging methodologies based on their brightness and controllable optical properties. A representative example is quantum dots (QDs), which are semiconductor nanocrystals showing size-dependent \ue104uorescence due to the quantum con\ue103nement effect. 4,[8][9][10] They show excellent optical properties, including high photo-stability and tunable emission wavelengths, but the toxicity of QDs caused by their heavy metal components (e.g. cadmium) has been a potential concern. 11, 12 Recently, conjugated polymer NPs, o\ue09den called polymer dots (Pdots), have been investigated as a new class of \ue104uorescent NPs without heavy metal-related toxicity. 13,14 While QDs show visible photoluminescence only when their size is within the single-nm range, Pdots maintain their \ue104uorescent property with a size up to several hundred nanometres. This is advantageous for optimising their biological interaction via size. Additionally, Pdots can incorporate photo-functional molecules, such as \ue104uorescent dyes 15,16 or photosensitizers, 17,18 leading to tuna",

The controllability of the optical properties by bandgap variation makes QDs outstanding and suitable candidates for their applications in photonics. Additionally, as the semiconductor nanoparticle size is less than that of the exciton, charge carriers develop spatial confinement, resulting in an increase in their energy. Hence, size dependent optoelectronic properties are a consequence of the quantum confinement effect. 14 This allows tuning of the emission colour over a very broad spectral region, including ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared (NIR) spectral regions. 15 ][26][27] It is also reported that, the large spectral distance between the absorption and emission wavelength i.e., large stokes shift in QDs, reduces auto-fluorescence, increasing the sensitivity for detecting particular wavelengths when applied in sensors. In both, the visible and NIR spectral regions, QDs show high quantum yields in comparison to organic dyes. 28 A systematic representation of energy levels is shown in figure 1, for the growth in bandgap upon reduction in size of the nanocrystals. In general, QDs consists of a core which is made by a semiconductor nano-crystal and a surface passivating ligand present, viz; thiolates, long-chain carboxylic acids, amines, phosphines, etc. Such functionalized organic molecules (ligands) are essential in stabilizing the core structure, for spectroscopic and optical properties and in improving the solubility/dispersibility of the QDs in various solvents to obtain logically meaningful optical behaviour. 3,29 ",

            "text": "Quantum dots are colloidal fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals (2-10 nm). They possess a broad absorption band and a symmetric, narrow emission band, typically in the visible to near infrared (NIR) spectral range [47].The central core of quantum dots is usually composed of combinations of elements from groups II-VI of the periodic system (such as zinc, cadmium, selenium, and tellurium) or III-V (such as arsenic and phosphorus) [48], which are \"overcoated\" with a layer of ZnS. They show size-and composition-tunable emission spectra and high quantum yield. Quantum dots are photostable; therefore, the optical properties of QD make them suitable for highly sensitive, long term, and multitarget bioimaging application [49,50]. The application to cancer detection lies in the ability to select a specific colour of light emission of QD [33]. Indeed, in order for QDs to be used for melanoma detection, the surface must be treated to increase hydrophilicity and the desired tumor-targeting ligand must be attached. Possible ligands include antibodies, peptides, and small-molecule drugs/inhibitors [51]. New approaches, such as the addition of a silica coating or a biocompatible polymer coating, have further increased the biocompatibility and reduced their toxicity. Indeed, although quantum dots offer a lot of advantages in sensing and imaging and as contrast agents in various techniques like MRI, PET, IR fluorescent imaging, and computed tomography, there is uncertainty surrounding the toxicity of the materials used.",

            "text": "Quantum dots (QDs) are small particles or nanocrystals of semiconductor materials between 2 and 10 nanometers in size [88]. The ratio of the height of the surface to the volume of these particles gives the QDs the intermediate electron property which is between a mass semiconductor and a discrete atom [89]. Over the years, various QDs based techniques such as modification of QD conjugates and QD immunostaining have been developed. With the improvement of multiplexing capability, QDs conjugation greatly exceeds the monochromatic experiment in both time and cost-effectiveness [90]. Moreover, at low protein expression levels and in a low context, QD immunostaining is more accurate than traditional immunochemical methods. In cancer diagnosis, QD immunostaining is a potential tool for the detection of various tumor biomarkers, such as a cell protein or other components of a heterogeneous tumor sample [91]. Quantum dots can gather in specific parts of the body and transfer the drugs to those parts. The ability of the QDs to concentrate in a single internal organ makes them a potential solution against untargeted drug delivery, and possibly avoid the side effects of chemotherapy. The latest advancement in surface modification of QDs, which combine with biomolecules, including peptides and antibodies, in vivo, can be used to target tumors and make possible their potential applications in cancer imaging and treatment. Some studies combine QDs with prostate-specific antigen to label cancer, while others use QDs to make biomarkers that speed up the process with such immune markers having a more stable light intensity than traditional fluorescent immunomarkers [92]. High sensitivity probes based on quantum dots have been reported for multicolor fluorescence imaging of cancer cells in vivo and can also be used to detect ovarian cancer marker cancer antigen 125 (CA125) in different types of specimens (such as fixed cells, tissue sections, and xenograft) [93]. Besides, the light stability of quantum dot signals is more concrete and brighter than that of traditional organic dyes [94].",

Semiconducting polymers offer unique advantages in photoacoustic applications due to their remarkable photostability and biocompatibility, setting them apart from other NPs. Polymeric NPs containing diketopyrrolopyrrole and its derivatives were utilized for enhanced tumor imaging with more than five times higher than the background signal at 2 h of the NP injection. 42 Benzothiadiazole moiety doubled the PA signal provided by the NPs. 43 Organic dyes are continuously under investigation for its photoacoustic contrast capabilities due to their ability to provide a similar enhancement in PAI as polymeric NPs, while also demonstrating significant biocompatibility. 110 Recent studies have found that coupling with phospholipids enhances the effectiveness of porphyrin NPs in PAI. These NPs have also been reported to be a component of photon bubbles, which can serve as CAs for both UI and PAI. 118 n conclusion, the combination of PAI technology with NPs enables high-resolution imaging of biological tissues and cells. By using NPs as CAs, the photoacoustic signal can be enhanced, improving imaging sensitivity and resolution.",

            "text": "Besides the super photostability and high biocompatibility, the semiconducting polymer NPs can be easily surface functionalized or facilely conjugated with biomolecules for different purposes, e.g., for larger absorption range or loading capacity [55,118,139]. Tang et al. developed a nanocarrier based on the photoreactive oxetane groups modified semiconducting polymer to dope with Chlorin e6 (Ce6), which was called Ce6-doped semiconducting polymer dots (Ce6-Pdots). After UV photo-crosslinking, a polymeric network was formed due to the reactions between the modified side chains to prevent the retained Ce6 leakage. Because the emission range of the nanocarrier overlaps with the Ce6 absorption range, upon green light (520 nm) irradiation, the semiconducting polymer can transfer the excitation energy to the Ce6 and then efficient 1 O 2 were generated. Compared with Ce6 alone, the energy transfer process can avoid the relatively high dose of light irradiation and due to the large absorption cross section of the semiconducting polymer-based nanocarrier, the 1 O 2 generation was amplified, which resulted in highly effective in vitro PDT effect even with low NPs concentration (10 \u03bcg/mL) and light dose (60 J/cm 2 ) and the in vivo tumor growth was apparently inhibited after the PDT treatment [140]. NPs can also protect PSs from inactivation and degradation in the complex biological environment. For example, ICG, which is a PSs approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical treatment and imaging, still suffers from the instability in aqueous solution, which hinder its PDT efficacy. To improve its therapeutic effect, Yang et al. fabricated ICG-oxygen nanobubbles (named as ICG-NBs-O 2 ) through assembling the free ICG molecules with NBs-O 2 . The NPs assembly occurred on the gas-liquid interface due to the hydrophilic-hydrophobic interaction.",

For instance, luminescent organic dyes and QDs display FWHM values typically in the 50-100 nm range. 3.2. Bioimaging. Fluorescent materials for biosensing and bioimaging include metal ions [17], conjugated polyelectrolytes [18], functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) involving quantum dots (QDs) [19][20][21][22], magnetic particles (MPs) [23,24], noble metal NPs [25][26][27][28], functionalized proteins [29][30][31], carbon dots [32,33], and, more recently, conjugated polymers. The effect of polythiophene Pdots on prostate cancer cell PC3 viability was determined by crystal violet assay. Pdots of different concentrations (1,5,25,50, and 100 \u03bcg/ml) were tested on human prostate cancer cells by diluting solutions in DMSO or DMF. The final concentration of DMSO was <0.5%. Expectedly, the plot of Pdot concentration versus relative viable cells (Figure 3) shows that it is very cytotoxic to human prostate cancer cells (PC3) with cytotoxicity increasing after 24 h. For in vivo studies, this concentration was halved, that is, diluted further to 12.5 \u03bcg/ml. Based on the cytotoxicity data above and looking at the chemical composition with a significant amount of Cl groups, we anticipated polythiophene Pdots to display even greater toxicity in vivo.",

            "text": "Quantum dots (QDs) are inorganic NP with excellent optical properties and have been widely used in biomedical imaging, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications. Due to the quantum confinement, QDs exhibit size-dependent optical and electronic properties. QDs presents advantages over conventional organic dyes, such as lower photobleaching and size-dependent photoluminescence emission. Gold NP (Au NP) plays an integral role in the biomedical field due to their ease of synthesis and tunable optical and electronic properties [76]. The unique properties of Au NP arise from their surface plasmon resonance. The surface of AuNP can be easily modified with proteins, peptides, oligonucleotides, and many other compounds while still maintaining their optical properties. The advantages of AuNP over their metallic counterpart are their chemical inertness and reduced toxicity [77]. \n\nTo bypass high liver retention, Tang et al. developed monodisperse, water-soluble silver sulfide QDs with a distinct characteristic light emission from 500 to 1200 nm and a QDs core diameter between 1.5 and 9 nm. When conjugated with cyclic penta-peptide for targeting tumor-associated integrins, confocal imaging studies showed that QDs were selectively taken-up cancer cells with strong fluorescence signals. When i.v. administered, QDs in different mouse models of cancer demonstrated highly selective accumulation in tumors, which resulted in a high tumor-to-liver uptake ratio, an accomplishment rarely achieved by conventional NPs [78]. Similarly, Li et al. developed CdTe QDs with a high quantum yield (38%) for targeted NIR imaging of gliomas. In a mice-bearing U87 tumor, i.v. administered cRGD-QDs conjugate led to targeted imaging of tumor and its margins followed by successful tumor resection, suggesting its potential as a fluorescent indicator for intraoperative tumor imaging [79]. \n\nLee et al. prepared a protease activatable NIR-based nano-probe for in vivo cancer imaging that consists of Au NPs attached to Cy 5.5 dye through MMPs substrate.",

            "text": "Quantum dots (QDs) are tiny light-emitting particles on the nanometer scale. They are emerging as a new class of biological probes that could replace traditional organic dyes and fluorescent proteins. The fundamental benefit of using QDs is the high quantum yield and strong emission intensity. The emission spectrum of QDs is a function of the particle size, and hence by varying particle size QDs can emit from visible to infrared wavelengths [25]. They can be excited by UV light. Their broad excitation spectrum and narrow emission spectrum with little or no spectral overlap makes them attractive for imaging and resolving multiple species at the same time without complex optics and data acquisition systems. QDs offer higher signal to noise ratios compared to traditional fluorochromes. Their high sensitivity allows accurate detection even in the presence of strong autofluorescence signals encountered during in vivo imaging [26]. Their excellent resistance to photobleaching is particularly useful for long-term monitoring of biological phenomena, critical in live cell imaging and thick tissue specimens. Already QDs are finding increasing use in live cell imaging, by themselves or as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) donors combined with traditional fluorchromes, and in in vitro assays and live animal imaging for cancer and tumor diagnostics. \n\nLimitations of QDs can arise from the stability of the core shell structure. Most commercially available materials comprise a core of CdSe and a shell of ZnS. To render this inorganic structure hydrophilic, amphiphilic polymers are used to cap the shell layer and provide reactive sites for further linking to proteins. It is, therefore, the stability of this layer that controls the aggregation of QDs, as well as possible release of core materials (Cd ions) to their surroundings, which may result in toxicity [27]. This has limited the immediate clinical use of QDs, but has focused applications to animal testing and in vitro assay developments. Another reported problem is the blinking property of the QDs. QDs tends to blink at the single dot level and hence present some limitation in absolute fluorescence quantification. However, when used for imaging of biomarkers, this property does not have much of an effect as there are hundreds or thousands of QDs in a sample to allow proper averaging.",

            "text": "Conventional polymerization methods used to modify the surface of nanoparticles with polymers are not compatible with semiconductor nanoparticles. For example, anionic conditions are too severe for use in the presence of the quantum dots, and radicals generated by conventional radical polymerization (e.g., azo-bisisobutyronitrile initiated) degrade the nanoparticles and quench their photoluminescence. One of the first attempts for the surface modification of quantum dots came from Patten and Farmer who encapsulated CdS quantum dots in a silica shell and polymerized PMMA chains from the silica surface by ATRP [258]. These hybrid nanoparticles were casted into films which retained the photoluminescence of the precursor CdS nanoparticles and showed good dispersion of the polymer-coated CdS/SiO 2 hybrids throughout the PMMA matrix. However, the latter advances in CRP techniques, which are accompanied with low radical concentrations, have allowed the growth of functional polymers from the surface of quantum dots. \n\n\"Unprotected\" quantum dots without the intermediate silica layer have been used lately as substrates for the development of core-shell hybrids providing an intimate connection of the polymer to the nanoparticle core. Sill and Emrick reported the NMP synthesis of PS homopolymer and PS-co-PMMA copolymer chains from the surface of CdSe nanoparticles pre-functionalized with initiating molecules bearing phosphine oxide derivatives as the anchor groups [259]. The PS-coated CdSe nanoparticles not only showed a uniform dispersion in a polystyrene matrix but also exhibited enhanced fluorescence compared to the initiator functionalized particles due to their thermal treatment during the polymerization. At the same time a range of well-defined styrenes and (meth)acrylate homopolymers, random and block copolymers were grown by the RAFT technique from the surface of CdSe nanoparticles modified with trithiocarbonate moieties [260]. Upon surface modification with the polymeric stabilizers the particles maintained their optical properties without the requirement for a protective inorganic shell.",

            "text": "The choice of fluorophore is important in general for all fluorescence based techniques, and in particular for saturable absorption based techniques as the physical properties of the fluorophore are more demanding. Organic molecules have been used successfully in many studies but are prone to photo-bleach and are required to be chemically added to the biological system limiting their applicability to living cells. Proteins such as GFP are alternative labelling systems that can be used as genetically encoded markers. Protein mutagenesis offers a method to create flourophores with tailored optical properties reducing many of the problems associated with organic molecules. Quantum dots are another class of fluorophore that has been utilised. These materials are very photo-stable, possess a large stokes shift between their absorption and emission and can be made with a very wide range of wavelengths. Quantum dots are semiconductors made from metals such as cadmium and selenium and are poisons to living systems. In addition adding quantum dots to biosystems is non-trivial. However, quantum dots have been applied successfully to single tissue sections of biopsies for assessing malignant tumours and in 4Pi and STED microscopy [57,58]. Developments in fluorophore technology are being made in order to improve photostabillity and enhance fluorescence quantum yield. Widengren et al have demonstrated a method to chemically retard dye photobleaching and increase fluorescence yield [59]. Adding two types of anti-fading molecules, antioxidants and triplet-sate quenchers, were shown to increase the quantum yield of fluorescence and photostability of an organic dye molecule.",

            "text": "Photoluminescent nanomaterials have attracted much attention due to their excellent fluorescent properties and small size. In the past two decades, extensive research on fluorescent semiconductor quantum dots has expanded their application to biology [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. However, traditional semiconductor quantum dots (such as PbS and CdTe) usually contain heavy metal ions that are highly toxic to living organisms [10][11][12]. Moreover, low biocompatibility and poor photostability is a hindrance in their development for use in biological systems [5,13,14]. Therefore, there is an imminent need to develop non-metallic quantum dots with better photostability and lower cytotoxicity for use in clinical sciences.\n\nCarbon quantum dots (CQDs), also known as carbon nanodots (CDs), are a lucrative option in the field of sensing, photocatalysis and optoelectronics due to their better fluorescent properties including high quantum yield (\u03b7), photostability and excitation-related emissions [15,16]. In addition, other advantages of CQDs, including water dispersibility, biocompatibility, lower toxicity, small size, amenable to modifications and low processing cost make them potential material for biomedical applications [5,13,14]. Due to their similar size and photoelectrochemical properties, research on quantum dots has mostly focused on graphene quantum dots, CDs and polymer dots. However, they differ in their internal structure and surface chemical groups, including oxygen-containing groups [17]. For these materials to emit fluorescent light, their sizes and surface chemical groups must be carefully adjusted. The CQDs not only inherit the excellent optical characteristics of traditional semiconductor quantum dots but also make up for the shortcomings of traditional materials in terms of cytotoxicity, environmental and biological hazards; moreover, they can be imparted multi-functionality when conjugated with other nanoparticles. As a result, they have the potential in biomedical applications, such as drug delivery, photosensitizers and carriers for therapeutic and antimicrobial molecules. Significantly, when compared with heavy metal-based semiconductor quantum dots, CQDs show better",

            "text": "Curing cancer intends to eradicate tumors while preserving healthy cells [5,6]. \n\nA diverse range of organic and nanoparticles made of inorganic material, including photo thermal agents, comprise nonmaterial's that include platinum, gold, and silver carbon-based nonmaterial's, near-infrared dyes, conductive polymers, soluble proteins and peptides, and melanin-like polymers. On the other hand, PTAs with near-infrared absorbance possess downsides such as suboptimal pharmacokinetics, low immunogenicity, elevated toxic effects, and inflammatory side effects. They are also non-biodegradable. Investigating PTAs that exhibit strong clinical translational efficacy and optimize PTT therapeutic efficacy is imperative [7]. \n\nTo solve the problem, scientists are creating biodegradable nonmaterials such as conducting polymers, melanin-like polymers, carbon-based tiny substances, and tiny molecular organic colors. These materials possess inherent biocompatibility and biodegradability, along with established degradation mechanisms and recognized metabolic pathways, making them promising candidates for enhancing the effectiveness of PTT. By leveraging the potential of these biodegradable nonmaterials, researchers aim to prevail over the constraints of recent PTAs and provide the most efficient, effective PTT treatments. \n\nTo ensure that PTAs used in clinical translation are successfully removed from the human body within a given timeframe, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States emphasizes this matter. A clear advantage is provided by mechanisms that can stimulate the degradation of nonmaterial's [4]. Despite its considerable effectiveness in clinical therapeutics, PTT has drawbacks, especially when treating tumors at the periphery where light penetration is inadequate and partial removal of malignant cells results. This incomplete removal may facilitate tumor regret and metastasis to other body parts. Due to the previously mentioned limitations, PTT immunotherapy alone is currently frequently insufficient to achieve complete cancer eradication. Many complementary methods, including PDT, immunotherapy, gene therapy, and chemotherapy, are investigated to optimize PTT overall efficacy. These methods can lead to accurate tumor identification and management, providing a comprehensive plan to address a range of cancers and other conditions [8].",

            "text": "Recently, we have reported the use of a highly selective optical sensor for the assessment of total prostate-speci\ue103c antigen in the serum of prostate cancer patients 14 and cancer antigen CA 125. 15 arbon quantum dots (CDs) have attracted increasing scien-ti\ue103c attention because of their promising optical properties, good photostability, low toxicity, excellent biocompatibility, easy synthesis, and the possibility of functionalization. 16,17 Compared to graphene quantum dots that have low solubility in common solvents, the surface functional groups of CDs result in good solubility and chemical stability in aqueous and polar organic solvents. 18 This new category of nanomaterials is being considered as a possible alternative to semiconductor QDs, which emit stable and bright luminescent colors in solution and in a polymer matrix under ultraviolet light excitation. Its ease of manufacture and unique optical properties make it potentially useful in biomedical \ue103elds such as optical bioimaging (in vivo and in vitro), cell labeling, drug delivery, gene delivery, cancer therapy and biosensors. 16 These have also been used in various technologies, for example, in LEDs, 19 photocatalysis, 20 water splitting, and optoelectronic components. 21 lthough, there were a lot of traditional clinical assays for CA 125 quanti\ue103cation, such as enzyme-linked immune-sorbent and radiometric immunoassay that show high sensitivity and speci\ue103city but they are expensive, need several complicated operations and separation steps and, as such, are time-consuming. 22 Thus, developing low-cost, chemically stable and photostable, as well as easily synthesized biocompatible nanosensor is an alternative challenge. \n\nIn this work, \ue104uorescent CDs were synthesized from the orthophenylenediamine isomer by a simple solvothermal method and were used to quantify CA-125 in various serum samples from ovarian cancer patients. The evaluation process relies on the quenching of the luminescence intensity of the optical biosensor by various concentrations of CA-125 at 535 nm a\ue09der excitation at 425 nm in ethanol at pH 10.",

            "text": "\u22126 A few decades ago, most of the bioimaging agents were organic compounds, such as fluorescein and rhodamine. However, their instinct high toxicity, low photostability, and narrow absorption cross section restrained their applications in biological and biomedical analyses. 7,8 Afterward, fluorescent nanomaterials like quantum dots were developed for use in biomedical applications. 9 Compared with traditional organic dyes, semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) showed excellent optical properties like preeminent photostability, large Stokes shift, broad absorption cross section, and low cost for scale-up production. 10 However, most metal-based QDs are cytotoxic; surface modification was a challenging situation before application in pharmaceutical or biomedical studies. \n\nThe development of GQDs has been considered as a promising resolution to break through this problem; GQDs are zero-dimensional derivatives of 2D graphene sheets in the family of carbon-based nanomaterials with excellent dispersibility, adjustable luminescent properties, and low toxicity. 11,12 he optical properties of GQDs are mainly determined by the quantum confinement effects regulated by the graphene core structure and the edge effects of surface chemical groups. 13 herefore, it has been reported that the diversity of GQDs could be controlled and designed to be applied in different types of studies. 14,15 The synthesis of GQDs could be separated into two approaches at length: bottom-up and topdown methods. 16,17 The top-down methods could be summarized as producing GQDs from larger sized carbonbased materials, for example, acidic exfoliation splits large carbon materials through oxygen-based defects and brings oxygen-based functional groups to the surface of GQDs. The most popular route is using nitric acid or sulfuric acid to assist in the breaking of large size carbon source, such as graphite powder, carbon fiber, or nanotube, to prepare GQDs. 18 There are also some other top-down methods like electrochemical oxidation or hydrothermal reaction. 19,20 However, most of the GQDs produced from this classical route showed low quantum yield and went through multiple purification processes. 21",

            "text": "ICG is a common fluorescent dye that has been used in angiography and more recently in nanoparticles for the detection and photothermal therapy of tumors. However, ICG does not have a great photothermal conversion efficiency at 15.4%, and free ICG dye has a quantum yield of 2.7% [42,43]. In addition, ICG and similar fluorescent dyes can photobleach, whereas semiconducting polymers do not [44]. Fluorescence quenching can be overcome by using molecular spacers between the polymer chains so that quenching will be minimized and photothermal efficiency preserved, and this technique has been used to boost ICG nanoparticle fluorescence by up to 16.8% [45]. Although we did not compare the VMWNPs photothermal performance directly to metal nanoparticles, we have directly compared similar polymer nanoparticles to gold and provided a thoughtful comparative analysis in a recent review article [20,44]. ROS generation by VMWNPs appears to stem from the oligomer fraction, and may lead to cytotoxicity. \n\nVMWNPs produced no cytotoxicity in CT-26 cells until higher concentrations were reached. On the other hand, both OxS and OxR RKO cells indicated VMWNPs were cytotoxic even at concentrations as low as 100 \u00b5g/mL. Similar to CT-26 cells, both OxS and OxR HT-29 cells were insensitive to VMWNPs' toxicity at lower doses. \n\nOxS and OxR CT-26 cells showed a greater decrease in cell viability at 42 \u2022 C than at 37 \u2022 C with increasing oxaliplatin concentrations. OxS RKO cells were more susceptible to oxaliplatin than the CT-26 cells. The OxS RKO cells showed a higher cell death at even 100 \u00b5M of oxaliplatin and a complete cell death with 300 \u00b5M at 37 \u2022 C and 42 \u2022 C. The resistant RKO cells were very resistant to oxaliplatin, with toxicity observed only at 300 \u00b5M, and hyperthermia seemed to augment this effect.",

            "text": "There are several reasons why gold nanoparticles (AuNP) are the most widespread and became a common choice for many studies. The most important are their chemical resistivity, enzymatic stability, low cytotoxicity [15] and physicochemical characteristics (for more information regarding gold nanoparticles and their properties we recommend reviews [16,17]). Currently AuNP can be efficiently synthesized in variety of sizes, stabilized with neutral or charged groups and further functionalized via ligand exchange. Moreover, the plethora of optical traits resulting from surface plasmon of AuNPs and relatively large extinction coefficients made gold an exceptional material for research, engineering, and medical applications [18]. AuNPs are therefore good candidates for in vivo imaging and studies compared to other materials like organic dyes or quantum dots. Taken together, due to the negligible toxicity of gold, and the simplicity of the controlled synthesis of AuNPs and functionalization, it became of interest to utilize AuNPs in conjunction with biomolecules such as nucleic acids [19][20][21], peptides [22], proteins [23,24], antibodies [25,26], and chemotherapeutic agents [27]. An advantage of conjugated AuNPs is improved effectiveness of the active ligands bound to the nanoparticle. Several studies have reported a synergistic effect of the active compound when delivered via AuNP compared to the same compound alone [28][29][30]. \n\nMany medical applications speak for the great utility of the gold nanoparticles. For example, owing to their optical properties, AuNPs may be introduced into photothermal therapy [31,32], which may further be developed by coating AuNPs with selective moieties targeting a specific cancerous cell [33,34]. Mentioned above optical properties became of interest in the field of bioimaging, where AuNPs serve as probes to visualize cellular compartments and allow to follow nanoparticles' cellular uptake, specificity and locations, which might be used for the targeted therapies [26,35,36].",

The most important thing is that such SPs can easily form self-assembled structures at the nanoscale level, forming different types of SPN [42] (Table 1). Since SPN are considered as novel class of organic optical nanosystems, they have various benefits having brilliant opto-electrical properties with an excellent photostability, easy modification properties with a good biocompatibility for various biomedical applications including drug delivery [43] and bio-imaging [44].

            "text": "There are several reasons why gold nanoparticles (AuNP) are the most widespread and became a common choice for many studies. The most important are their chemical resistivity, enzymatic stability, low cytotoxicity [15] and physicochemical characteristics (for more information regarding gold nanoparticles and their properties we recommend reviews [16,17]). Currently AuNP can be efficiently synthesized in variety of sizes, stabilized with neutral or charged groups and further functionalized via ligand exchange. Moreover, the plethora of optical traits resulting from surface plasmon of AuNPs and relatively large extinction coefficients made gold an exceptional material for research, engineering, and medical applications [18]. AuNPs are therefore good candidates for in vivo imaging and studies compared to other materials like organic dyes or quantum dots. Taken together, due to the negligible toxicity of gold, and the simplicity of the controlled synthesis of AuNPs and functionalization, it became of interest to utilize AuNPs in conjunction with biomolecules such as nucleic acids [19][20][21], peptides [22], proteins [23,24], antibodies [25,26], and chemotherapeutic agents [27]. An advantage of conjugated AuNPs is improved effectiveness of the active ligands bound to the nanoparticle. Several studies have reported a synergistic effect of the active compound when delivered via AuNP compared to the same compound alone [28][29][30]. \n\nMany medical applications speak for the great utility of the gold nanoparticles. For example, owing to their optical properties, AuNPs may be introduced into photothermal therapy [31,32], which may further be developed by coating AuNPs with selective moieties targeting a specific cancerous cell [33,34]. Mentioned above optical properties became of interest in the field of bioimaging, where AuNPs serve as probes to visualize cellular compartments and allow to follow nanoparticles' cellular uptake, specificity and locations, which might be used for the targeted therapies [26,35,36].",

The single wavelength excitation character of QDs makes it more significant, as it can excite multiple particles in a confined surface simultaneously by narrow emission. QDs are more photostable than traditional organic dyes; however, when injected into tissues, whole animals, or ionic solutions, there is a significant loss of fluorescence. HQD-based probes conjugated with cancer-specific ligands, antibodies, or peptides are used in clinical diagnosis. It is more precise and reliable than standard immunohistochemistry (IHC) at minimal protein expression levels. Advanced clinical studies use photodynamic therapy (PDT) with fluorescence imaging to effectively identify and treat cancer. Recent studies revealed that a combination of unique characteristics of QDs, including their fluorescence capacity and abnormal expression of miRNA in cancer cells, were used for the detection and monitoring progression of cancer. In this review, we have highlighted the unique properties of QDs and the theranostic behavior of various macromolecule-conjugated HQDs leading to cancer treatment.",

            "text": "Gold, silver, and platinum displayed broad optical properties and can be easily functionalized with different chemical moieties [75]. In particular, one can highlight the characteristic plasmonic properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) [76]. Unlike other inorganic metallic nanoparticles, AuNPs can be prepared with different geometries, such as nanospheres, nanoshells, nanorods, or nanocages [77]. Their geometric versatility is one of the reasons why they are widely used in targeted drug and gene therapy strategies. Regarding PDT, they present advantages such as the possibility of PSs' incorporation in multi-component delivery systems, as well as the facilitation of PS's transcytosis across epithelial and endothelial barriers. Additionally, AuNPs can enhance not only the cellular PSs uptake but also the singlet oxygen generation and thus PDT's efficiency [18]. However, AuNPs display high tendency to aggregate. To overcome this limitation it has been reported that coating the AuNPs with hydrophilic polymers, such as PEG or HA, can not only increase their stability but also decrease the overall biotoxicity [31,70]. \n\nMetalloporphyrins containing zinc (Zn) also provide a higher PDT efficiency when compared with porphyrins alone, due to their metallic photothermal contribution [75]. An interesting report showed that AuNPs loaded with the synthetic metalloporphyrin Zn(II)meso-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin were able to generate remarkable amounts of singlet oxygen responsible for the cytotoxic effect observed in breast tumor cells after being submitted to PDT treatment [78]. \n\nQuantum dots (QDs) are other promising inorganic materials for PDT field. QDs are nearly spherical fluorescent semiconductor nanoparticles with a diameter of 2-10 nm [79]. Compared with organic dyes including conventional PS, QDs have more intense and broader light absorption, higher photobleaching thresholds and photoluminescence quantum yields, and longer photoluminescence lifetimes [80].",

            "text": "For several decades, a variety of powerful and long-term \ue104uorescent dyes have acquired tremendous interest, owing to their ability to label and track biological molecules within living cells. 1 Small molecules and proteins, such as green \ue104uorescent proteins (GFP), have been proven to be prominent organic \ue104uorophores under incident light in the blue to ultraviolet range. 2 However, GFPs present a restrictive drawback in long-term bioimaging because of their low stability against photobleaching due to interactions with surrounding molecules. 3 emiconductor quantum dots (SCQDs) constitute an ideal alternative to conventional organic dyes thanks to their excellent photostability and high \ue104uorescence quantum efficiency. 4,5 urthermore, these \ue104uorescent probes can be easily prepared and controlled through chemical methods. 6 However, the cytotoxicity of SCQDs, due to the toxic heavy-metal elements they contain, in addition to their poor solubility, preclude their use in biomedical applications. 7,8 To overcome this biosafety issue, special interest has been devoted to carbon-based \ue104uorescent nanoparticles. \n\nThe discovery of carbon quantum dots, diamond nanocrystals, \ue104uorescent carbon nanotubes and fullerene nanoparticles, is of great interest especially for biomedical research because of their high brightness, signi\ue103cant photobleaching resistance, and low cytotoxicity among other attributes. 9 Using hydrothermal cutting of pre-oxidized graphene sheets, graphene quantum dots (CQDs) were fabricated for the \ue103rst time in 2010. 10 They are graphene fragments of nanometric size where charge carriers are con\ue103ned in three dimensions of space. CQDs combining graphene performance and quantum dot behaviour, offer unusual optoelectronic properties resulting from quantum con\ue103nement and edge effects. 11 QDs are environmentally friendly and suitable for biomedical applications like in vivo and in vitro bioimaging, biosensing, drug and gene delivery, DNA cleavage, and cancer therapy. 12,13 5][16] To adapt and modify CQD properties such as the photoluminescence behaviour, for desired and speci\ue103c applications, different successful processes have been reported.",

SPNs are designed to improve the sensitivity and resolution of PAI because of the tunable optical properties, high absorption coefficients and high photostability of this material [51]. In 2019, through reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of polystyrene-b-poly (Nisopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PSNiAA), Xu's team prepared a functional nanoparticles (PDPP3T@PSNiAA) with photothermal sensitivity and PA response [52]. Anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin (Dox) was also loaded onto these NPs by electrostatic interaction and formed PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs. The data showed that all PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs at different concentrations had a time-dependent increasing laser irradiation response. The temperature of the NPs could still increase to the same level even up to the fourth laser-cooling circle, indicating the photothermal stability of PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs. Additionally, experiments for the PA properties of these NPs conducted in vitro showed that the maximum intensity of PDPP3T@PSNiAA NPs was at 785 nm, and the higher concentration of NPs contributed to higher PA signals. The in vivo experiments indicated that these PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs could accumulate in tumor region over time (Figure 7). A burst intracellular Dox release occurred with NIR irradiation at acidic condition (80%), while it was below 40% at neutral condition, which could minimize the release of the drug in normal tissues. In vivo studies on HeLa tumor-bearing mice showed that tumors of PDPP3T@PSNiAA-Dox NPs with laser treatment were effectively eliminated without reoccurrence, while groups treated with free Dox (with and without laser) and NPs without laser showed none or minor tumor elimination.",

            "text": "The transport of anti-cancer drugs through the BBB for the treatment of brain tumors remains one of the major challenges in brain cancer therapy. Thus, the development of nanotechnology-based strategies for an efficient brain uptake and controlled release of the active compounds is essential. The characteristics of the nanocarriers mostly depend on the cancer type, tumor characteristics, stage, and location [78]. \n\nNovel approaches for the diagnosis of brain cancer involve the use of nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, and quantum dots for various neuroimaging techniques. Therefore, silica shells doublecoated with semiconducting polymer layers were synthesized for fluorescence and photoacoustic brightness imaging [79]. Moreover, phosphonate polyethylene glycol and cyclo RGD functionalized iron-oxide nanoparticles [80] or bovine serum albumin and tumor-specific folic acid [81] functionalized iron-oxide nanoparticles were applied for magnetic resonance imaging. Another strategy for the diagnosis of glioblastoma involves coating gold nanoparticles with the CBP4 peptide for an enhanced binding to the CD133 biomarker [82]. Furthermore, liposomes incorporating heptamethine cyanine dye IR780 [46] and iron-oxide nanoparticles and a near-infrared fluorescence dye [83] were studied for near-infrared fluorescence imaging and magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging using gadolinium-incorporated micelles was used for the quantitative hemorrhage-risk evaluation due to the correlation between the extravasation of micelles and the hemorrhagic edema site [84]. Another study focused on the use of polyethylene glycol-coated quantum dots as neuroimaging systems at the tumor site through IVIS imaging system. However, to acquire the images, it was necessary to remove the skulls of the mice [85]. \n\nStudies regarding the treatment of brain cancer focused on the delivery of various anti-cancer drugs using nanocarriers.",

In this feature article, recent work is summarized on the development of SPNs for in vivo photoacoustic (PA) imaging, a state-of-the-art imaging modality that converts light energy into mechanical acoustic waves to provide deep tissue penetration. The structure-property relationship and doping approaches are discussed to reveal the importance of promoting nonradiative decay in amplifying the PA brightness of SPNs. Moreover, their imaging applications, including lymph node mapping, tumor imaging, and monitoring of pathological indexes, are highlighted. These studies demonstrate that SPNs can serve as versatile PA agents for advanced molecular imaging applications."

Their shape, size, surface functions, and optical properties can be precisely manipulated through integrated efforts of chemistry, materials, and nanotechnology for customized applications. When localized photons are used to activate both imaging and therapeutic functions such as photodynamic or photothermal therapy, these theranostic nanolights increase treatment efficacy with minimized damage to surrounding healthy tissues, which represents a promising noninvasive nanomedicine as compared to conventional theranostic approaches. As one of the most promising theranostic nanolights, organic dots with aggregation-induced emission (AIE dots) are biocompatible nanoparticles with a dense core of AIE fluorogens (AIEgens) and protective shells, whose sizes are in the range of a few to tens of nanometers. Different from conventional fluorophores that suffer from aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) due to \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction in the aggregate state, AIEgens emit strongly as nanoaggregates due to the restriction of intramolecular motions. Through precise molecular engineering, AIEgens could also be designed to show efficient photosensitizing or photothermal abilities in the aggregate state. Different from ACQ dyes, AIEgens allow high loading in nanoparticles without compromised performance, which makes them the ideal cores for theranostic nanolights to offer high brightness for imaging and strong photoactivities for theranostic applications. In this Account, we summarize the recent advance of AIE dots and highlight their great potential as theranostic nanolights in biomedical applications. Starting from the design of AIEgens, the fabrication of AIE dots and their bioimaging applications are discussed. The exceptional advantages of superbrightness, high resistance to photobleaching, lack of emission intermittency, and excellent biocompatibility have made them reliable cross platform contrast agents for different imaging techniques such as confocal microscopy, multiphoton fluorescence microscopy, super-resolution nanoscopy, and light-sheet ultramicroscopy, which have been successfully applied for cell tracking, vascular disease diagnosis, and image-guided surgery. The integration of therapeutic functions with customized AIEgens has further empowered AIE dots as an excellent theranostic platform for image-guided phototherapy. Of particular interest is AIE photosensitizer dots, which simultaneously show bright fluorescence and high photosensitization, yielding superior performance to commercial photosensitizer nanoparticles in image-guided therapy. Further development in multiphoton excited photodynamic therapy has offered precise treatment with up to 5 \u03bcm resolution at 200 \u03bcm depth, while chemiexcited photodynamic therapy has completely eliminated the limitation of penetration depth to realize power-free imaging and therapy. With this Account, we hope to stimulate more collaborative research interests from different fields of chemistry, materials, biology, and medicine to promote translational research of AIE dots as the theranostic nanolights.",

The nanoparticle is unique in that it contains a high density ensemble of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV(-)) centers as built-in fluorophores. The center possesses a number of outstanding optical and magnetic properties. First, NV(-) has an absorption maximum at \u223c550 nm, and when exposed to green-orange light, it emits bright fluorescence at \u223c700 nm with a lifetime of longer than 10 ns. These spectroscopic properties are little affected by surface modification but are distinctly different from those of cell autofluorescence and thus enable background-free imaging of FNDs in tissue sections. Such characteristics together with its excellent biocompatibility render FND ideal for long-term cell tracking applications, particularly in stem cell research. Next, as an artificial atom in the solid state, the NV(-) center is perfectly photostable, without photobleaching and blinking. Therefore, the NV-containing FND is suitable as a contrast agent for super-resolution imaging by stimulated emission depletion (STED). An improvement of the spatial resolution by 20-fold is readily achievable by using a high-power STED laser to deplete the NV(-) fluorescence. Such improvement is crucial in revealing the detailed structures of biological complexes and assemblies, including cellular organelles and subcellular compartments. Further enhancement of the resolution for live cell imaging is possible by manipulating the charge states of the NV centers. As the \"brightest\" member of the nanocarbon family, FND holds great promise and potential for bioimaging with unprecedented resolution and precision. Lastly, the NV(-) center in diamond is an atom-like quantum system with a total electron spin of 1. The ground states of the spins show a crystal field splitting of 2.87 GHz, separating the ms = 0 and \u00b11 sublevels. Interestingly, the transitions between the spin sublevels can be optically detected and manipulated by microwave radiation, a technique known as optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). In addition, the electron spins have an exceptionally long coherence time, making FND useful for ultrasensitive detection of temperature at the nanoscale. Pump-probe-type nanothermometry with a temporal resolution of better than 10 \u03bcs has been achieved with a three-point sampling method. Gold/diamond nanohybrids have also been developed for highly localized hyperthermia applications. This Account provides a summary of the recent advances in FND-enabled technologies with a special focus on long-term cell tracking, super-resolution imaging, and nanoscale temperature sensing.

Here we demonstrate a general strategy for monitoring the behaviors of PNCs in vivo by encapsulating a Ag2S quantum dot (QD) with fluorescence in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) inside the PNC, using simian virus 40 (SV40) PNC (PNCSV40) as a model. Benefiting from the high spatiotemporal resolution and deep tissue penetration of NIR-II fluorescence imaging, the dynamic distribution of the PNCSV40 in living mice was tracked in real time with high fidelity, and adopting the PEGylation strategy, surface chemistry-dependent in vivo behaviors of PNCSV40 were clearly revealed. This study represents the first evidence of real-time tracking of the intrinsic behaviors of PNCs in vivo without interference in PNC-host interactions by encapsulating nanoprobes inside. The as-described imaging strategy will facilitate the study of interactions between exogenously introduced PNCs and host body and prompt the development of future protein-based drugs, sensors, and high-efficacy targeted delivery systems.",

Optical agents are generally involved in biophotonics to interpret biomolecular events into readable optical signals for imaging and diagnosis or to convert photons into other forms of energy (such as heat, mechanical force, or chemical radicals) for therapeutic intervention and biological stimulation. Development of new optical agents including metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, up-conversion nanoparticles, carbon dots, and silica nanoparticles has contributed to the advancement of this field. However, most of these agents have their own merits and demerits, making them less effective as multimodal biophotonic platforms. In this Account, we summarize our recent work on the development of near-infrared (NIR) semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as multimodal light converters for advanced biophotonics. SPNs are composed of \u03c0-electron delocalized semiconducting polymers (SPs) and often possess the advantages of good biocompatibility, high photostability, and large absorption coefficients. Because the photophysical properties of SPNs are mainly determined by the molecular structures of the precursor polymers, molecular engineering allows us to fine tune their photophysical processes to obtain different optical responses, even to light in the second NIR window (1000-1700 nm). Meanwhile, the facile nanoformulation methods of SPNs enable alteration of their outer and inner structures for diverse biological interactions. The unique photophysical properties of SPNs have brought about ultrasensitive deep-tissue molecular imaging. NIR-absorbing SPNs with strong charge-transfer backbones can convert photoenergy into mechanical acoustic waves, permitting photoacoustic imaging that bypasses the issue of light scattering and reaches the centimeter tissue penetration depth. Differently, phenylenevinylene-containing SPNs can store photon energy via chemical defects and emit long-NIR afterglow luminescence with a half-life of \u223c6 min after cessation of light excitation. Such an afterglow process avoids tissue autofluorescence, giving rise to ultrahigh signal-to-background ratios. So far, SPN-based molecular photoacoustic or afterglow probes have been developed to image disease tissues (tumors), biomarkers (biothiols and reactive oxygen species), and physiological indexes (pH and temperature) in different preclinical animal models. The synthetic flexibility of SPNs further permits light-modulated biological and therapeutic interventions. Till now, SPNs with high photothermal conversion efficiencies have been shaped into photothermal transducers to remotely regulate biological events including protein ion channels, enzymatic activity, and gene expression. In conjunction with the desired biodistribution and tumor-homing ability, SPNs have been doped or coated with other inorganic agents for amplified photothermal or self-regulated photodynamic cancer therapy. This Account thus demonstrates that SPNs serve as a multimodal biophotonic nanoplatform to provide unprecedented opportunities for molecular imaging, noninvasive bioactivation, and advanced therapy.",

The obtained NPs show high fluorescence quantum yield, low cytotoxicity with good physical and photostability, which display excellent tracking performance of BMSCs in vitro and in vivo. Using a rat photothrombotic ischemia model as an example, the NP-labeled BMSCs are able to migrate to the stroke lesion site to yield bright red fluorescence. Immunofluorescence staining shows that the NP labeling does not affect the normal function of BMSCs, proving their good biocompatibility in vivo.

To overcome this issue, an organic photodynamic nanoinhibitor (OPNi) has been synthesized that has the additional ability to counteract carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX), a molecular target in the hypoxia-mediated signalling cascade. OPNi is composed of a metabolizable semiconducting polymer as the photosensitizer and a CA-IX antagonist conjugated amphiphilic polymer as the matrix. This molecular structure allows OPNi not only to selectively bind CA-IX positive cancer cells to facilitate its tumor accumulation but also to regulate the CA-IX-related pathway. The integration of CA-IX inhibition into the targeted PDT process eventually has a synergistic effect, leading to superior antitumor efficacy over that of PDT alone, as well as the reduced probability of hypoxia-induced cancer metastasis. This study thus proposes a molecular strategy to devise simple yet amplified photosensitizers to conquer the pitfalls of traditional PDT.",

Herein, we engineered and prepared a water-soluble gadolinium-chelated conjugated polymer-based theranostic nanomedicine (PFTQ-PEG-Gd NPs) for in vivo tri-mode PA/MR/NIR-II imaging-guided tumor photothermal therapy (PTT). Methods: We firstly constructed a semiconducting polymer composed of low-bandgap donor-acceptor (D-A) which afforded the strong NIR absorption for PAI/PTT and long fluorescence emission to NIR-II region for in vivo imaging. Then, the remaining carboxyl groups of the polymeric NPs could effectively chelate with Gd3+ ions for MRI. The in vitro characteristics of the PFTQ-PEG-Gd NPs were studied and the in vivo multimode imaging as well as anti-tumor efficacy of the NPs was evaluated using 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Results: The obtained theranostic agent showed excellent chemical and optical stability as well as low biotoxicity. After 24 h of systemic administration using PQTF-PEG-Gd NPs, the tumor sites of living mice exhibited obvious enhancement in PA, NIR-II fluorescence and positive MR signal intensities. Better still, a conspicuous tumor growth restraint was detected under NIR light irradiation after administration of PQTF-PEG-Gd NPs, indicating the efficient photothermal potency of the nano-agent. Conclusion: we triumphantly designed and synthesized a novel and omnipotent semiconducting polymer nanoparticles-based theranostic platform for PAI, NIR-II fluorescence imaging as well as positive MRI-guided tumor PTT in living mice. We expect that such a novel organic nano-platform manifests a great promise for high spatial resolution and deep penetration cancer theranostics.",

This study develops an organic semiconducting pro-nanostimulant (OSPS) with a near-infrared (NIR) photoactivatable immunotherapeutic action for synergetic cancer therapy. OSPS comprises a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPN) core and an immunostimulant conjugated by a singlet oxygen (1O2) cleavable linkers. Upon NIR laser irradiation, OSPS generates both heat and 1O2 to exert combinational phototherapy not only to ablate tumors but also to produce tumor-associated antigens. More importantly, NIR irradiation triggers the cleavage of 1O2-cleavable linkers, triggering the remote release of the immunostimulants from OSPS to modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Thus, the released tumor-associated antigens in conjunction with activated immunostimulants induce a synergistic antitumor immune response after OSPS-mediated phototherapy, resulting in the inhibited growth of both primary/distant tumors and lung metastasis in a mouse xenograft model. This is approved to be impossible for sole phototherapy. Our study thus provides a molecule design approach towards remote photoactivation of immunostimulants for cancer therapy.",

SPNB is self\u2010assembled from an amphiphilic semiconducting polymer which is grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) conjugated with a protein biosynthesis blockader through a singlet oxygen (1O2) cleavable linker. Such a designed molecular structure not only enables generation of 1O2 under NIR photoirradiation for PDT, but also permits photoactivation of blockaders to terminate protein translation. Thereby, SPNB exerts a synergistic action to afford an enhanced therapeutic efficacy in tumor ablation.

However, most dual PTT need to use two lasers for heat generation, which brings about inconvenience and limitation to the experimental operations. Herein, we report the development of \u201cnanococktail\u201d nanomaterials (DTPR) with 808 nm-activated image-guided dual photothermal properties for optimized cancer therapy. Methods: In this work, we co-encapsulated AIEgens (TPA-BDTO, T) and SPs (PDPPP, P) by using maleimide terminated amphiphilic polymer (DSPE-PEG2000-Mal, D), then further conjugated the targeting ligands (RGD, R) through \u201cclick\u201d reaction. Finally, such dual PTT nanococktail (termed as DTPR) was constructed. Results: Once DTPR upon irradiation with 808 nm laser, near-infrared fluorescence from T could be partially converted into thermal energy through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between T and P, coupling with the original heat energy generated by the photothermal agent P itself, thus resulting in image-guided dual PTT. The photothermal conversion efficiency of DTPR reached 60.3% (dual PTT), much higher as compared to its inherent photothermal effect of only 31.5% (single PTT), which was further proved by the more severe photothermal ablation in vitro and in vivo upon 808 nm laser irradiation. Conclusion: Such smart \u201cnanococktail\u201d nanomaterials could be recognized as a promising photothermal nanotheranostics for image-guided cancer treatment.",

Thus, the SPs exhibit great potentials for photothermal therapy (PTT) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). However, poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the correlation between the SP polymer chemical structures and their performances of PTT and PAI have significantly hindered their biomedical application. Herein, a series of acceptor-\u03c0-acceptor type (A1-\u03c0-A2) type SPs were synthesized. The diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and thiophene are used as A1 electron accepting block and \u03c0-bridge, and the chemical structure of A2 unit was variable. The SPs were formulated into PEGylated nanoparticles, which ensured these SP-based nanoparticles (SP@NPs) exhibited similar size, shape, and physiological stability. Thus, the chemical structure of A2 unit was the only variable. The effects of the SP chemical structures are carefully and comprehensively evaluated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Our results demonstrated the chemical structure of A2 unit simultaneously impact their absorption spectra and photothermal (PT) conversion efficiency, which finally determined their PTT and PAI performances. Among these A2 acceptors, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) unit exhibited the best in vitro and in vivo anticancer efficacies and PAI performances. This study not only provides molecular insights into the design of efficient SPs for PTT and PAI but also highlights the flexibility and potential of SP@NPs for biomedical application. Thus, SP@NPs can act as a versatile nanoplatform for the development of novel light intensive imaging and therapeutic approaches.",

Optical agents are generally involved in biophotonics to interpret biomolecular events into readable optical signals for imaging and diagnosis or to convert photons into other forms of energy (such as heat, mechanical force, or chemical radicals) for therapeutic intervention and biological stimulation. Development of new optical agents including metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, up-conversion nanoparticles, carbon dots, and silica nanoparticles has contributed to the advancement of this field. However, most of these agents have their own merits and demerits, making them less effective as multimodal biophotonic platforms. In this Account, we summarize our recent work on the development of near-infrared (NIR) semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as multimodal light converters for advanced biophotonics. SPNs are composed of \u03c0-electron delocalized semiconducting polymers (SPs) and often possess the advantages of good biocompatibility, high photostability, and large absorption coefficients. Because the photophysical properties of SPNs are mainly determined by the molecular structures of the precursor polymers, molecular engineering allows us to fine tune their photophysical processes to obtain different optical responses, even to light in the second NIR window (1000-1700 nm). Meanwhile, the facile nanoformulation methods of SPNs enable alteration of their outer and inner structures for diverse biological interactions. The unique photophysical properties of SPNs have brought about ultrasensitive deep-tissue molecular imaging. NIR-absorbing SPNs with strong charge-transfer backbones can convert photoenergy into mechanical acoustic waves, permitting photoacoustic imaging that bypasses the issue of light scattering and reaches the centimeter tissue penetration depth. Differently, phenylenevinylene-containing SPNs can store photon energy via chemical defects and emit long-NIR afterglow luminescence with a half-life of \u223c6 min after cessation of light excitation. Such an afterglow process avoids tissue autofluorescence, giving rise to ultrahigh signal-to-background ratios. So far, SPN-based molecular photoacoustic or afterglow probes have been developed to image disease tissues (tumors), biomarkers (biothiols and reactive oxygen species), and physiological indexes (pH and temperature) in different preclinical animal models. The synthetic flexibility of SPNs further permits light-modulated biological and therapeutic interventions. Till now, SPNs with high photothermal conversion efficiencies have been shaped into photothermal transducers to remotely regulate biological events including protein ion channels, enzymatic activity, and gene expression. In conjunction with the desired biodistribution and tumor-homing ability, SPNs have been doped or coated with other inorganic agents for amplified photothermal or self-regulated photodynamic cancer therapy. This Account thus demonstrates that SPNs serve as a multimodal biophotonic nanoplatform to provide unprecedented opportunities for molecular imaging, noninvasive bioactivation, and advanced therapy.",

Upon near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation, this pro-nanoenzyme not only generates cytotoxic singlet oxygen (1O2) for photodynamic therapy (PDT), but also triggers a spontaneous cascade reaction to induce the degradation of ribonucleic acid (RNA) specifically in tumor microenvironment. More importantly, OSPE-mediated RNA degradation is found to downregulate the expression of metastasis-related proteins, contributing to the inhibition of metastasis after treatment. Such a photoactivated and cancer-specific synergistic therapeutic action of OSPE enables complete inhibition of tumor growth and lung metastasis in mouse xenograft model, which is not possible for the counterpart PDT nanoagent.

Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) composed of polymers with \u03c0-electron delocalized backbones can be designed to amplify their PA imaging and PTT performance, because of their clear structure-property relation and versatility in modifying their molecular structures to tune their photophysical properties. This review summarizes the recent advances in the photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy applications of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with a focus on signal amplification and second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700\u00a0nm) construction. The strategies such as structure-property screening, fluorescence quenching, accelerated heat dissipation, and size-dependent heat dissipation are first discussed to amplify the PA brightness of SPNs for in vivo PA. The molecular approaches to shifting the absorption of SPNs for NIR-II PA imaging and PTT are then introduced so as to improve the tissue penetration depth for diagnosis and therapy. At last, current challenges and perspectives of SPNs in the field of imaging and therapy are discussed."

However, biodegradable nanoagents with the ability for photoacoustic (PA) imaging guided photothermal therapy (PTT) are rare. We herein report the development of biodegradable semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) with enhanced PA and PTT efficacy for cancer therapy. The design capitalizes on the enzymatically oxidizable nature of vinylene bonds in conjunction with polymer chemistry to synthesize a biodegradable semiconducting polymer (DPPV) and transform it into water-soluble nanoparticles (SPNV). As compared with its counterpart SPN (SPNT), the presence of vinylene bonds within the polymer backbone also endows SPNV with a significantly enhanced mass absorption coefficient (1.3-fold) and photothermal conversion efficacy (2.4-fold). As such, SPNV provides the PA signals and the photothermal maximum temperature higher than SPNT, allowing detection and photothermal ablation of tumors in living mice in a more sensitive and effective way. Our study thus reveals a general molecular design to enhance the biodegradability of optically active polymer nanoparticles while dramatically elevating their imaging and therapeutic capabilities.",

Here, we demonstrate that PTT combined with chemotherapy can efficiently elicit immunity to suppress metastatic tumor growth. Specifically, we rationally designed a new SPN (PDPSe NPs) as a photothermal agent for PTT with a large mass extinction coefficient in the near-infrared region (e.g., 44.9 L g-1 cm-1 at 808 nm), high photothermal conversion efficiency (62.5%) and excellent biocompatibility. A hypoxia-activated anti-tumor drug, tirapazamine (TPZ), was selected for chemotherapy. Strikingly, the combination therapy not only induced tumor cell death in the primary tumor, but also effectively suppressed the growth of distant tumors (mimicking metastatic tumors) without PTT. Importantly, the combined therapies exhibit synergistic effects on immune remodeling. Immunofluorescence data suggest that the inhibition of metastatic tumor growth is attributed to the immune remodeling triggered by PTT and chemotherapy. This work demonstrates a new paradigm of utilizing PTT together with hypoxia-activated drugs to effectively retard metastatic tumor growth.",

Optical agents are generally involved in biophotonics to interpret biomolecular events into readable optical signals for imaging and diagnosis or to convert photons into other forms of energy (such as heat, mechanical force, or chemical radicals) for therapeutic intervention and biological stimulation. Development of new optical agents including metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, up-conversion nanoparticles, carbon dots, and silica nanoparticles has contributed to the advancement of this field. However, most of these agents have their own merits and demerits, making them less effective as multimodal biophotonic platforms. In this Account, we summarize our recent work on the development of near-infrared (NIR) semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as multimodal light converters for advanced biophotonics. SPNs are composed of \u03c0-electron delocalized semiconducting polymers (SPs) and often possess the advantages of good biocompatibility, high photostability, and large absorption coefficients. Because the photophysical properties of SPNs are mainly determined by the molecular structures of the precursor polymers, molecular engineering allows us to fine tune their photophysical processes to obtain different optical responses, even to light in the second NIR window (1000-1700 nm). Meanwhile, the facile nanoformulation methods of SPNs enable alteration of their outer and inner structures for diverse biological interactions. The unique photophysical properties of SPNs have brought about ultrasensitive deep-tissue molecular imaging. NIR-absorbing SPNs with strong charge-transfer backbones can convert photoenergy into mechanical acoustic waves, permitting photoacoustic imaging that bypasses the issue of light scattering and reaches the centimeter tissue penetration depth. Differently, phenylenevinylene-containing SPNs can store photon energy via chemical defects and emit long-NIR afterglow luminescence with a half-life of \u223c6 min after cessation of light excitation. Such an afterglow process avoids tissue autofluorescence, giving rise to ultrahigh signal-to-background ratios. So far, SPN-based molecular photoacoustic or afterglow probes have been developed to image disease tissues (tumors), biomarkers (biothiols and reactive oxygen species), and physiological indexes (pH and temperature) in different preclinical animal models. The synthetic flexibility of SPNs further permits light-modulated biological and therapeutic interventions. Till now, SPNs with high photothermal conversion efficiencies have been shaped into photothermal transducers to remotely regulate biological events including protein ion channels, enzymatic activity, and gene expression. In conjunction with the desired biodistribution and tumor-homing ability, SPNs have been doped or coated with other inorganic agents for amplified photothermal or self-regulated photodynamic cancer therapy. This Account thus demonstrates that SPNs serve as a multimodal biophotonic nanoplatform to provide unprecedented opportunities for molecular imaging, noninvasive bioactivation, and advanced therapy.",

Herein, the first series of metabolizable NIR\u2010II PA agents are reported based on semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). Such completely organic nanoagents consist of \u03c0\u2010conjugated yet oxidizable optical polymer as PA generator and hydrolyzable amphiphilic polymer as particle matrix to provide water solubility. The obtained SPNs are readily degraded by myeloperoxidase and lipase abundant in phagocytes, transforming from nonfluorescent nanoparticles (30 nm) into NIR fluorescent ultrasmall metabolites (\u22481 nm). As such, these nanoagents can be effectively cleared out via both hepatobiliary and renal excretions after systematic administration, leaving no toxicity to living mice. Particularly these nanoagents possess high photothermal conversion efficiencies and emit bright PA signals at 1064 nm, enabling sensitive NIR\u2010II PA imaging of both subcutaneous tumor and deep brain vasculature through intact skull in living animals at a low systematic dosage. This study thus provides a generalized molecular design toward organic metabolizable semiconducting materials for biophotonic applications in NIR\u2010II window.",

However, chemo drugs are usually lacking in the specificity towards cancer cells over normal cells. In this study, we prepared a novel multifunctional trimeric prodrug by linking the chemo drug camptothecin (CPT) and the exceptional photostable near infrared (NIR) croconaine dye (CR) via a glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide linker. Compared with CPT, our novel trimeric CR-(SS-CPT)2 is more hydrophobic and bulky, making it highly effcient to be encapsulated into biocompatible polymeric nanocarrier. The prodrug underwent rapid drug release specifically in cancer cells with high GSH concentration. The hyperthermia produced by CR upon laser irradiation could further accelerate the break of disulfide bond, which makes the release of CPT even more controllable. We further loaded the CR-(SS-CPT)2 into folate modified lipid-polymer nanoparticles, which demonstrated high in vivo tumor accumulation and retention. The biodistribution of these nanoparticles can be directly monitored in real time via NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging. Under the imaging guided chemo- and photothermal- synergistic therapy, the tumors were completely ablated with no recurrence. The design not only highly enhanced the therapeutic specificity and effeciency of CPT, but also provide a \"all in one\" nanomedicine for imaging-guided dual modality therapy."

Advances in the design of various diagnostic and therapeutic agents, and the recent trend of utilizing molecules for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications (i.e. theranostics), still have not achieved the maximum benefits of controlling the navigation and biodistribution of these molecules within the biological system. The key challenges towards the use of these agents, from small molecules to macromolecular drugs (e.g. natural, proteins and nucleic acids-based drugs, or synthetic, polymer-based conjugates, carriers or other systems), are, for example, the loss of activity via rapid clearance or degradation, inefficient delivery to the target sites, and inappropriate probing of the disease states, dependent on the particular disease and its location in the body. The concept of nanotechnology has been initiated early in 1959 by Richard Feynman in his famous historical talk at Caltech \u201cThere\u2019s Plenty of Room at the Bottom\u201d, with introduction of the possibility of manipulating materials at the atomic and molecular levels.1 In 1974, Norio Taniguchi, at Tokyo University, first utilized the term \u201cnanotechnology\u201d referring to the design of materials on the nanoscale.2 In the early 1990\u2019s and until now, the use of nanomaterials of different nature (organic and inorganic), and for various applications (multiple disciplines) has been greatly expanded, in particular, over the last couple of decades.3-4 In the medical field, nanotechnology has emerged to include non-invasive systems for probing of disease and also capable of carrying cargo for localized high concentration delivery, known as \u201cnanomedicine\u201d, with reduction of off-target effects. The use of nanomaterials, in particular polymeric nanostructures, has demonstrated efficiency in improving delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the target sites, and the feasibility of incorporating several therapeutic/diagnostic/targeting moieties within specific compartments of the nanoparticles, with control of their navigation in the body and to the target sites. Further understanding of the nature and microenvironments of biological systems (e.g. different pH, temperature, permeability, drainage, or overexpressing proteins, enzymes or receptors), and the barriers towards the delivery of various moieties to their destinations, which could be either intra- or extracellular, has aided the design of nanomaterials that could evade the various physiological barriers. Selective delivery to the site of the disease can increase the therapeutic efficacy, imaging contrast and accuracy, reduce adverse reactions, and reduce the dose and cost of medications. \n \nInitially, platform technologies were the target for nanostructure designs, but with the complications of biological systems, it has been recognized over the past decade that disease- and patient-specific medical treatment is needed for efficacy\u2014this review highlights a few examples developed within the past couple of years, with a focus on in vivo studies together with novel designs and significant advances in syntheses. The advantages of polymeric nanostructures over other types of nanomaterials are based upon the flexibility over which their structures can be modified to yield materials of various compositions, morphologies, sizes, surface properties, with possibility of hierarchical assembly of several nanomaterials of various components into one construct that can be accommodated with a variety of therapeutic, diagnostic and/or targeting moieties, within selective compartments of the nanodevices. High efficiency in diagnosis and treatment of diseases and improving patient quality of life and compliance can be achieved through understanding the molecular events associated with various diseases, and combining the advances in the design of therapeutic and diagnostic agents and nanomaterials, together with the innovative instruments utilized for monitoring these agents. This review will focus on several recent advances in the design of polymeric nanoparticles that have been utilized for delivery of diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents, and the various barriers towards the clinical development of these materials. After a brief overview of the capabilities and challenges with medical imaging and therapy, in general, disease-specific examples of polymer nanoparticles designed specifically to overcome the challenges and address unmet medical needs will be discussed in detail.",

However, some types of cancer exhibited a low response rate to immunotherapy, and the high risk of immune-related side effects has been aroused during immunotherapy, which greatly restrict its broad applications in cancer therapy. Phototherapy that uses external light to trigger the therapeutic process holds advantages including high selectivity and efficiency, and low side effects. Recently, it has been proven to be able to stimulate immune response in the tumor region by inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD), the process of which was termed photo-immunotherapy, dramatically improving therapeutic specificity over conventional immunotherapy in several aspects. Among numerous optical materials for photo-immunotherapy, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have gained more and more attention owing to their excellent optical properties and good biocompatibility. In this review, we summarize recent developments of SPNs for immunotherapy and imaging of immunoactivation. Different therapeutic modalities triggered by SPNs including photo-immunotherapy and photo-immunometabolic therapy are first introduced. Then, applications of SPNs for real-time monitoring immunoactivation are discussed. Finally, the conclusion and future perspectives of this research field are given."

Specifically, COOH-capped Pdots were first fabricated and then assembled onto the indium-tin oxide (ITO) surface, followed by the modification of single-strand (ss) DNA probe (pDNA). After the DNA hybridization with the Au NP-tethered complementary ssDNA (Au NP-tDNA), the Au NPs were brought into the close proximity of Pdots. Upon light stimulation, photoluminescence (PL) was annihilated, fluorescence was attenuated, and the photocurrent intensity was evidently decreased. This ET-based PEC DNA sensor exhibited a linear range from 1 fM to 10 pM with a detection limit of 0.97 fM at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The present work first exploited the ET between Pdots and Au NPs, and we believe this phenomenon will spark new interest in the study of various Pdots-based ET-influenced PEC systems and thus catalyze increasing studies for specific bioanalytical purposes."

The functionalization of CPNs with specific recognition elements imparts them good ability for targeted recognition and imaging in vitro and in vivo. CPNs can be applied to deliver drug and gene, and simultaneously to real-time monitor the release process due to their self-luminous characteristics. Moreover, CPNs can sensitize oxygen molecules to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can kill adjacent bacteria and tumor cells. In this tutorial review, we provide a recent development of the preparation methods, properties, and functionalization strategies of CPNs, especially discussing their biological applications in targeted imaging, drug/gene delivery and biomedicine.

The design capitalizes on the enzymatically oxidizable nature of vinylene bonds in conjunction with polymer chemistry to synthesize a biodegradable semiconducting polymer (DPPV) and transform it into water-soluble nanoparticles (SPNV). As compared with its counterpart SPN (SPNT), the presence of vinylene bonds within the polymer backbone also endows SPNV with a significantly enhanced mass absorption coefficient (1.3-fold) and photothermal conversion efficacy (2.4-fold). As such, SPNV provides the PA signals and the photothermal maximum temperature higher than SPNT, allowing detection and photothermal ablation of tumors in living mice in a more sensitive and effective way.

Without additional vehicle and cargo, the as-prepared TNMs possessed a robust nanostructure and high photothermal conversion efficiency up to approximately 41%. The intrinsic theranostic properties of TNMs for use in photoacoustic (PA) imaging by a multispectral optoacoustic tomography system and in mediating photoinduced tumor ablation were intensely explored. Our results suggested that the TNMs could be successfully exploited as intrinsic theranostic agents for PA imaging-guided efficient tumor PTT. Thus, these TNMs hold great potential for (pre)clinical translational development.",

Optical agents are generally involved in biophotonics to interpret biomolecular events into readable optical signals for imaging and diagnosis or to convert photons into other forms of energy (such as heat, mechanical force, or chemical radicals) for therapeutic intervention and biological stimulation. Development of new optical agents including metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, up-conversion nanoparticles, carbon dots, and silica nanoparticles has contributed to the advancement of this field. However, most of these agents have their own merits and demerits, making them less effective as multimodal biophotonic platforms. In this Account, we summarize our recent work on the development of near-infrared (NIR) semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as multimodal light converters for advanced biophotonics. SPNs are composed of \u03c0-electron delocalized semiconducting polymers (SPs) and often possess the advantages of good biocompatibility, high photostability, and large absorption coefficients. Because the photophysical properties of SPNs are mainly determined by the molecular structures of the precursor polymers, molecular engineering allows us to fine tune their photophysical processes to obtain different optical responses, even to light in the second NIR window (1000-1700 nm). Meanwhile, the facile nanoformulation methods of SPNs enable alteration of their outer and inner structures for diverse biological interactions. The unique photophysical properties of SPNs have brought about ultrasensitive deep-tissue molecular imaging. NIR-absorbing SPNs with strong charge-transfer backbones can convert photoenergy into mechanical acoustic waves, permitting photoacoustic imaging that bypasses the issue of light scattering and reaches the centimeter tissue penetration depth. Differently, phenylenevinylene-containing SPNs can store photon energy via chemical defects and emit long-NIR afterglow luminescence with a half-life of \u223c6 min after cessation of light excitation. Such an afterglow process avoids tissue autofluorescence, giving rise to ultrahigh signal-to-background ratios. So far, SPN-based molecular photoacoustic or afterglow probes have been developed to image disease tissues (tumors), biomarkers (biothiols and reactive oxygen species), and physiological indexes (pH and temperature) in different preclinical animal models. The synthetic flexibility of SPNs further permits light-modulated biological and therapeutic interventions. Till now, SPNs with high photothermal conversion efficiencies have been shaped into photothermal transducers to remotely regulate biological events including protein ion channels, enzymatic activity, and gene expression. In conjunction with the desired biodistribution and tumor-homing ability, SPNs have been doped or coated with other inorganic agents for amplified photothermal or self-regulated photodynamic cancer therapy. This Account thus demonstrates that SPNs serve as a multimodal biophotonic nanoplatform to provide unprecedented opportunities for molecular imaging, noninvasive bioactivation, and advanced therapy.",

Recent work suggests that a new window across the short-wavelength infrared region can improve in vivo imaging sensitivity over near infrared light. Here we report on the first evidence of multispectral, real-time short-wavelength infrared imaging offering anatomical resolution using brightly emitting rare-earth nanomaterials and demonstrate their applicability toward disease-targeted imaging. Inorganic-protein nanocomposites of rare-earth nanomaterials with human serum albumin facilitated systemic biodistribution of the rare-earth nanomaterials resulting in the increased accumulation and retention in tumour tissue that was visualized by the localized enhancement of infrared signal intensity. Our findings lay the groundwork for a new generation of versatile, biomedical nanomaterials that can advance disease monitoring based on a pioneering infrared imaging technique. The short-wavelength infrared spectral region is of interest for bio-imaging applications as biological tissue is transparent to such light.

Although many exogenous contrast agents have been developed for PA imaging and PTT, the design guidelines to amplify their imaging and therapy performances remain challenging and are highly demanded. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) composed of polymers with \u03c0-electron delocalized backbones can be designed to amplify their PA imaging and PTT performance, because of their clear structure-property relation and versatility in modifying their molecular structures to tune their photophysical properties. This review summarizes the recent advances in the photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy applications of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with a focus on signal amplification and second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700\u00a0nm) construction. The strategies such as structure-property screening, fluorescence quenching, accelerated heat dissipation, and size-dependent heat dissipation are first discussed to amplify the PA brightness of SPNs for in vivo PA. The molecular approaches to shifting the absorption of SPNs for NIR-II PA imaging and PTT are then introduced so as to improve the tissue penetration depth for diagnosis and therapy. At last, current challenges and perspectives of SPNs in the field of imaging and therapy are discussed.",

Organic semiconducting materials (OSMs) composed of \u03c0-conjugated building blocks as the optically active components have recently emerged as a promising category of biophotonic agents. OSMs possess common features including excellent optical properties, good photostability and biologically benign composition. This review summarizes the recent progress in the development of OSMs based on small-molecule fluorophores, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) dyes and semiconducting oligomer/polymer nanoparticles (SONs/SPNs) for advanced biophotonic applications. OSMs have been exploited as imaging agents to transduce biomolecular interactions into second near-infrared fluorescence, chemiluminescence, afterglow or photoacoustic signals, enabling deep-tissue ultrasensitive imaging of biological tissues, disease biomarkers and physiological indexes. By fine-tuning the molecular structures, OSMs can also convert light energy into cytotoxic free radicals or heat, allowing for effective cancer phototherapy. Due to their instant light response and efficient light-harvesting properties, precise regulation of biological activities using OSMs as remote transducers has been demonstrated for protein ion channels, gene transcription and protein activation. In addition to highlighting OSMs as a multifunctional platform for a wide range of biomedical applications, current challenges and perspectives of OSMs in biophotonics are discussed."

Endogenous chromophores present in the body such as hemoglobin, lipid, melanin, and so on provide strong photoacoustic contrast due to their strong light absorption in certain optical window. To enhance the performance of PAI further, researchers have developed several exogenous contrast agents such as metallic nanoparticles, carbon-based nanomaterials, quantum dots, organic small molecules, semiconducting polymer nanoparticles, and so on. These exogenous contrast agents not only help improving the imaging contrast, but also make targeted molecular imaging possible. In this review article, we first discuss the state-of-the-art PAI techniques with endogenous contrast mechanism. Later, we provide an overview of recent progress in the development of exogenous photoacoustic contrast agents for in vivo imaging applications. Finally, we present the pros/cons of the existing PA contrast agents along with future challenges of contrast agent-based PAI for biomedical applications.

A diverse array of engineered nanoscale products and processes have emerged [e.g., carbon nanotubes, fullerene derivatives, and quantum dots (QDs)], with widespread applications in fields such as medicine, plastics, energy, electronics, and aerospace. With the nanotechnology economy estimated to be valued at $1 trillion by 2012, the prevalence of these materials in society will be increasing, as will the likelihood of exposures. Importantly, the vastness and novelty of the nanotechnology frontier leave many areas unexplored, or underexplored, such as the potential adverse human health effects resulting from exposure to novel nanomaterials. It is within this context that the need for understanding the potentially harmful side effects of these materials becomes clear. The reviewed literature suggests several key points: Not all QDs are alike; engineered QDs cannot be considered a uniform group of substances. QD absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity depend on multiple factors derived from both inherent physicochemical properties and environmental conditions; QD size, charge, concentration, outer coating bioactivity (capping material and functional groups), and oxidative, photolytic, and mechanical stability have each been implicated as determining factors in QD toxicity.

Many nanoparticles have undesirable tissue distribution or unacceptably low serum half-lives. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and biodistribution studies can help inform decisions determining particle size, coatings, or other features early in nanoparticle development. Unfortunately, these studies are rarely done in a timely fashion because many nanotechnology labs lack the resources and expertise to synthesize radioactive nanoparticles and evaluate them in mice. Methodology/Principal Findings To address this problem, we developed an economical, radioactivity-free method for assessing serum half-life and tissue distribution of nanoparticles in mice. Iron oxide nanoparticles coated with chitosan and polyethylene glycol that utilize chlorotoxin as a targeting molecule have a serum half-life of 7\u20138 hours and the particles remain stable for extended periods of time in physiologic fluids and in vivo. Nanoparticles preferentially distribute to spleen and liver, presumably due to reticuloendothelial uptake. Other organs have very low levels of nanoparticles, which is ideal for imaging most cancers in the future. No acute toxicity was attributed to the nanoparticles. Conclusions/Significance We report here a simple near-infrared fluorescence based methodology to assess PK properties of nanoparticles in order to integrate pharmacokinetic data into early nanoparticle design and synthesis. The nanoparticles tested demonstrate properties that are excellent for future clinical imaging strategies and potentially suitable for targeted therapy.",

Most toxicology data is derived from in vitro studies and may not reflect in vivo responses. Here, an initial systematic animal toxicity study of CdSe-ZnS core-shell quantum dots in healthy Sprague-Dawley rats is presented. Biodistribution, animal survival, animal mass, hematology, clinical biochemistry, and organ histology are characterized at different concentrations (2.5-15.0 nmol) over short-term (<7 days) and long-term (>80 days) periods. The results show that the quantum dot formulations do not cause appreciable toxicity even after their breakdown in vivo over time. To generalize the toxicity of quantum dots in vivo, further investigations are still required. Some of these investigations include the evaluation of quantum dot composition (e.g., PbS versus CdS), surface chemistry (e.g., functionalization with amines versus carboxylic acids), size (e.g., 2 versus 6 nm), and shape (e.g., spheres versus rods), as well as the effect of contaminants and their byproducts on biodistribution behavior and toxicity. Combining the results from all of these studies will eventually lead to a conclusion regarding the issue of quantum dot toxicity.",

These materials generally range from 1-100 nm in size and include several distinct classes with unique characteristics for biomedical applications. Semiconducting polymers (SPs) are conjugated polymers with delocalized \u03c0-electrons that provide strong absorption and emission properties with high quantum yields. Their fully organic composition, structural flexibility, and tunable properties make them particularly promising for biological applications. Quantum dots (QDs) are inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals with size-dependent optical properties, offering narrow emission bands, broad excitation spectra, and exceptional brightness. Metallic nanoparticles (MNPs), particularly gold and silver, exhibit surface plasmon resonance that enables strong light scattering and absorption, making them valuable contrast agents. Organic dyes, the most traditional fluorophores, are small molecules with conjugated structures that provide good brightness but often suffer from limited stability. The fundamental differences in composition, size, and electronic structure between these nanomaterials directly influence their effectiveness in tumor detection applications. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

Similarly, QDs exhibit decreased rates of photobleaching compared to organic dyes <Paper corpusId=\"21848769\" paperTitle=\"(Suffredini et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>, with the ability to remain fluorescent for months <Paper corpusId=\"276093448\" paperTitle=\"(Nunziata et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. In contrast, traditional organic dyes often suffer from rapid photobleaching and self-fluorescence issues <Paper corpusId=\"54100812\" paperTitle=\"(Cohen et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"33729982\" paperTitle=\"(Saleh, 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA unique advantage of SPNs over QDs is that their emission properties are not size-dependent <Paper corpusId=\"59488513\" paperTitle=\"(Hashim et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>, while their absorption and emission characteristics can be tuned by modifying the molecular structure of the polymer <Paper corpusId=\"254732880\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. SPNs also feature large absorption coefficients, allowing for enhanced sensitivity in photoacoustic imaging <Paper corpusId=\"253274990\" paperTitle=\"(He et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"31038259\" paperTitle=\"(Zhou et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. \n\nUnlike QDs, which face toxicity concerns due to heavy metal content <Paper corpusId=\"257134662\" paperTitle=\"(Guo et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"250730791\" paperTitle=\"(Kang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>, SPNs are composed of biologically inert organic materials with minimal cytotoxicity <Paper corpusId=\"209247990\" paperTitle=\"(Gao et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"252560850\" paperTitle=\"(Riahin et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This favorable biocompatibility profile makes SPNs particularly promising for clinical translation.\n\nFor NIR-II imaging (1000-1700 nm wavelength), SPNs such as PDFT1032 demonstrate excellent properties including high photostability, favorable absorption peaks, large Stokes shifts, and outstanding biocompatibility <Paper corpusId=\"19105574\" paperTitle=\"(Shou et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. These properties enable deeper tissue penetration and higher resolution imaging compared to imaging in traditional wavelength ranges <Paper corpusId=\"259742069\" paperTitle=\"(Su et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn the realm of metallic nanoparticles, their distinct surface plasmon resonance properties allow for strong light scattering and absorption, though their extinction coefficients may be lower than those of SPNs <Paper corpusId=\"85447855\" paperTitle=\"(Maturi et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Metallic nanoparticles remain valuable as contrast agents for specific imaging applications but face limitations in terms of optical tunability and photostability compared to semiconducting polymers and quantum dots.\n\nOrganic dyes, while widely used due to their availability and established protocols, generally exhibit lower brightness, poorer photostability, and smaller Stokes shifts compared to the other nanomaterials <Paper corpusId=\"99161006\" paperTitle=\"(Kemal et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. Their application in advanced bioimaging is increasingly limited by these inherent optical constraints, particularly for deep-tissue and long-term imaging applications.",

                            "Pdots have several desirable properties that make them attractive alternatives to other luminescent nanoparticles. The high brightness of Pdots is owed to their fast emissive rates and large extinction coefficients (Pecher et al., 2010). Since each monomer with the polymer chain is capable of absorbing incident light, the high concentration of chromophores in Pdots gives them extinction coefficients an order of magnitude higher than luminescent quantum dots and two orders of magnitude greater than organic dyes (Li et al., 2018). Furthermore, Pdots are highly resistant to photobleaching, which make them excellent candidates for fluorescence imaging and sensing applications (Wu et al., 2008)",

                            "Semi-conductive polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are an emerging type of PAI nanomaterials, and have displayed excellent properties such as non-blinking, low toxicity, prominent FL and excellent photostability. (Yu et al., 2012) Therefore, with a good control of surface chemistry and versatile modifications of functional groups, enormous SPNs have emerged as contrast agents for cell labeling and PAI. (Mallidi et al., 2011) SPNs can be further developed into NIR ratiometric nanoprobes for in vivo imaging of reaction oxygen species (ROS). Considering that ROS acts as a specific biomarker in many pathological processes, SPNs-based nanomaterials are promisingly utilized in the study of strokes, tumor metastasis, bacterial infections and cardiomyopathy.\n\nQuantum dots are another kind of semi-conductive nanocrystals with tiny dimensions but wide excitation spectra. They have exhibited a great potential as multifunctional nanomaterials for multimodal molecular imaging and PPT"

                            "QDs can provide images across large ranges of wavelengths and have high quantum yields (Alivisatos, 1996). Unlike organic dyes, which often suffer rapid photo-bleaching [75](Iyer et al., 2008), QDs are composed of semiconducting metals (e.g., Cd, Zn, Se, In, P, and As) that are resistant to photo-bleaching (260588791). \n\nFurthermore, the quantum properties of QDs are tunable and can provide excitation/emission wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to NIR. The outer shell of the QD could be modified by organic layers including PEG polymers, phospholipids, and peptides (Wang et al., 2011), thus preventing nonspecific absorption of proteins to their surface, increase blood half-life, and reducing toxicity (Hauck et al., 2010)(Jokerst et al., 2011)",
                            "Although QDs offer potentially valuable benefits in preclinical oncology, such as drug targeting and in vivo biomedical imaging, under certain conditions, they pose risks to human health and the environment, constituting a barrier for their translation to clinical use (Hardman, 2005). Semiconducting polymer dots have aroused extensive interests as a novel family of fluorescent probes for tumor targeting applications (Lee et al., 2010)(Cheng et al., 2014). Unlike QDs, polymer-based dots were developed from biologically non-toxic materials, using deep-red photo-acceptors and visible-light photo-donors."

QDs offer excellent photostability and tunable emission spectra from the ultraviolet to the near infrared region, simply by modulating their size. Due to their photostability, QDs avoid the problems of self-absorption, self-fluorescence, and photobleaching from which traditional fluorophores suffer. Therefore, QDs offer applications within many different areas, including waterborne pathogen detection (Iba\u0301n\u0303ez-Peral et al., 2008)",

SPNs have better uorescence stability with longer shelf-lives, are composed of benign or less-toxic materials, and can be synthesized by an environmentally friendly and relatively easy method (miniemulsion) that does not require any heating, and can be performed in ambient conditions. Many applications require uorescence within a specic range of wavelengths, selected for the relevant end-use. Nanoparticles engineered for these applications must, therefore, have stable emission that does not change or quench in their intended environment over the period of storage and use.

Owing to their large absorption coefficients, tunable optical properties, and high photostability, SPNs have recently been used to improve the sensitivity and resolution of photoacoustic (PA) imaging. In particular, a number of strategies have been explored to design activatable SPNs for amplified in vivo PA imaging. In this review, the recent advances in the development of SPNs as exogenous PA contrasts agents have been summarized and their promising potential as multifunctional probes for cancer theranostics has been discussed.

                            "Up to now, a variety of inorganic nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes (Diao et al., 2015), quantum dots [19](Awasthi et al., 2020), and rare earth nanoparticles (NPs) (Wang et al., 2017)(Naczynski et al., 2013), have been widely explored for NIR-II FLI, but their long-term biotoxicity and minimal biodegradability could substantially hinder their practical applications (Lei et al., 2020). Small molecular organic dyes exhibit superiority in the aspect of biocompatibility, but they often suffer from unsatisfactory photostability and limited accumulation capacity (Lyu et al., 2018)(Zhang et al., 2017). In contrast, semiconducting polymers (SPs) with large \u03c0-conjugated architectures exhibit reliable biosafety, strong light-harvesting ability, durable photostability, excellent photothermal conversion ability, etc. They have manifested great talents in the fields of FLI, photoacoustic imaging, and imaging-guided PTT and/or photodynamic therapy (Sun et al., 2018)(Song et al., 2020)(Guo et al., 2018)(Jiang et al., 2018)(Feng et al., 2013)(Li et al., 2018)(Yu et al., 2017)(Qi et al., 2022)."

                "text": "\nPhotostability is a critical parameter for effective tumor detection applications, as it determines the ability of imaging agents to maintain their optical properties during extended imaging sessions. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) demonstrate outstanding photostability, which is one of their most significant advantages over other nanomaterials. Multiple studies confirm that SPNs exhibit excellent resistance to photobleaching and maintain their optical performance during prolonged imaging periods <Paper corpusId=\"155642523\" paperTitle=\"(Gargiulo et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"210873619\" paperTitle=\"(Ni et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This exceptional photostability allows SPNs to be utilized for long-term cell tracking applications with minimal signal degradation <Paper corpusId=\"210873619\" paperTitle=\"(Ni et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"139966816\" paperTitle=\"(Ni et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA key advantage of SPNs is their resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are abundant in biological environments. Research has shown that SPNs are generally more resistant to ROS and significantly more photostable than gold nanorods, allowing for reliable imaging in living animals where ROS concentrations can reach micromolar levels <Paper corpusId=\"52111480\" paperTitle=\"(Zhu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This chemical stability in oxidative environments contributes to their overall superior performance in biological applications.\n\nQuantum dots (QDs) also exhibit strong photostability compared to traditional fluorophores. They show improved resistance against photobleaching and can remain fluorescent for months, making them suitable for longitudinal imaging studies <Paper corpusId=\"14621486\" paperTitle=\"(Xing et al., 2006)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, while QDs demonstrate good photostability, they face significant concerns regarding toxicity due to their heavy metal content, limiting their clinical applications <Paper corpusId=\"209247990\" paperTitle=\"(Gao et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn contrast, organic dyes, which have been widely used in biomedical imaging, suffer from poor photostability and low quantum yields in aqueous biological environments <Paper corpusId=\"90340197\" paperTitle=\"(Hassan et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. Their rapid photobleaching significantly restricts their utility for extended imaging applications, particularly in in vivo settings <Paper corpusId=\"221660902\" paperTitle=\"(Xie et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. \n\nMetallic nanoparticles show variable photostability depending on their composition and structure. While they generally offer better photostability than organic dyes, they typically do not match the exceptional stability of semiconducting polymers <Paper corpusId=\"232382625\" paperTitle=\"(Han et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Their non-biodegradable nature and potential long-term toxicity remain significant concerns for clinical applications <Paper corpusId=\"232382625\" paperTitle=\"(Han et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor second near-infrared (NIR-II) window applications, which enable deeper tissue penetration, the photostability of imaging agents becomes even more critical. Studies have demonstrated that semiconducting polymer nanoparticles like PDFT1032 possess excellent photostability in the NIR-II window, along with favorable absorption peaks and large Stokes shifts <Paper corpusId=\"19105574\" paperTitle=\"(Shou et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. These properties make them particularly suitable for deep-tissue and long-term tumor imaging applications.\n\nThe unique combination of high photostability, excellent biocompatibility, and lack of emission intermittency (non-blinking) positions SPNs as superior contrast agents for reliable cross-platform imaging techniques, including confocal microscopy, multiphoton fluorescence microscopy, and light-sheet ultramicroscopy <Paper corpusId=\"13679120\" paperTitle=\"(Feng et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"258745886\" paperTitle=\"(Bortot et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. These advantages, coupled with their tunable optical properties, make semiconducting polymers particularly promising for early-stage tumor detection applications where imaging reliability and signal persistence are crucial.",

To optimize the overall outcomes, it is important to understand the fate of transplanted stem cells (e.g., localization, migration, engraftment, survival, proliferation and differentiation). Fluorescent nanoparticles with good photostability and minimal perturbation of cell functions hold great promise for distinguishing transplanted stem cells from host tissues with high resolution, showing advantages over traditional histological methods. This review aims to summarize the recent advances in the use of fluorescent nanoparticles for the direct labelling of stem cells and the applications of such nanoparticles in stem cell tracking. The relevant fluorescent nanoparticles, including quantum dots, organic fluorogen-doped nanoparticles, fluorescent nanodiamonds, and upconversion nanoparticles are discussed. The advantages and limitations of the currently available fluorescent trackers are summarized, and perspectives on new research opportunities are discussed."

                            "Theranostic nanolights refer to luminescent nanoparticles possessing both imaging and therapeutic functions. Their shape, size, surface functions, and optical properties can be precisely manipulated through integrated efforts of chemistry, materials, and nanotechnology for customized applications. When localized photons are used to activate both imaging and therapeutic functions such as photodynamic or photothermal therapy, these theranostic nanolights increase treatment efficacy with minimized damage to surrounding healthy tissues, which represents a promising noninvasive nanomedicine as compared to conventional theranostic approaches. As one of the most promising theranostic nanolights, organic dots with aggregation-induced emission (AIE dots) are biocompatible nanoparticles with a dense core of AIE fluorogens (AIEgens) and protective shells, whose sizes are in the range of a few to tens of nanometers. Different from conventional fluorophores that suffer from aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) due to \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction in the aggregate state, AIEgens emit strongly as nanoaggregates due to the restriction of intramolecular motions. Through precise molecular engineering, AIEgens could also be designed to show efficient photosensitizing or photothermal abilities in the aggregate state. Different from ACQ dyes, AIEgens allow high loading in nanoparticles without compromised performance, which makes them the ideal cores for theranostic nanolights to offer high brightness for imaging and strong photoactivities for theranostic applications. In this Account, we summarize the recent advance of AIE dots and highlight their great potential as theranostic nanolights in biomedical applications. Starting from the design of AIEgens, the fabrication of AIE dots and their bioimaging applications are discussed. The exceptional advantages of superbrightness, high resistance to photobleaching, lack of emission intermittency, and excellent biocompatibility have made them reliable cross platform contrast agents for different imaging techniques such as confocal microscopy, multiphoton fluorescence microscopy, super-resolution nanoscopy, and light-sheet ultramicroscopy, which have been successfully applied for cell tracking, vascular disease diagnosis, and image-guided surgery. The integration of therapeutic functions with customized AIEgens has further empowered AIE dots as an excellent theranostic platform for image-guided phototherapy. Of particular interest is AIE photosensitizer dots, which simultaneously show bright fluorescence and high photosensitization, yielding superior performance to commercial photosensitizer nanoparticles in image-guided therapy. Further development in multiphoton excited photodynamic therapy has offered precise treatment with up to 5 \u03bcm resolution at 200 \u03bcm depth, while chemiexcited photodynamic therapy has completely eliminated the limitation of penetration depth to realize power-free imaging and therapy. With this Account, we hope to stimulate more collaborative research interests from different fields of chemistry, materials, biology, and medicine to promote translational research of AIE dots as the theranostic nanolights."

Multiple studies have confirmed that SPNs exhibit minimal or no cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells, making them particularly promising for in vivo applications <Paper corpusId=\"252560850\" paperTitle=\"(Riahin et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"235644177\" paperTitle=\"(Shrestha et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe biocompatibility advantage of SPNs becomes particularly evident when compared to quantum dots (QDs). While QDs offer excellent optical properties, their clinical translation faces significant barriers due to their composition. Most QDs contain heavy metals (e.g., Cd, Zn, Se, In, P, and As) that raise serious toxicity concerns <Paper corpusId=\"54100812\" paperTitle=\"(Cohen et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221467278\" paperTitle=\"(Siddique et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Studies have shown that QDs can potentially disrupt mitochondrial function and lead to DNA damage, which presents a major obstacle to their clinical translation <Paper corpusId=\"250730791\" paperTitle=\"(Kang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. These inherent toxicity issues have driven researchers to explore alternative nanomaterials like SPNs that maintain similar optical advantages without the associated biological risks <Paper corpusId=\"257134662\" paperTitle=\"(Guo et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMetallic nanoparticles, while useful as imaging agents, face biocompatibility challenges primarily due to their non-biodegradable nature and potential for long-term accumulation in tissues. Research indicates that their persistence in biological systems raises concerns about chronic toxicity that remain unresolved <Paper corpusId=\"232382625\" paperTitle=\"(Han et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This limitation significantly impacts their suitability for repeated clinical applications or longitudinal studies.\n\nOrganic dyes generally demonstrate good biocompatibility compared to inorganic nanomaterials <Paper corpusId=\"259742069\" paperTitle=\"(Su et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, their application is often limited by other factors such as poor photostability and limited accumulation capacity in target tissues rather than toxicity concerns <Paper corpusId=\"259742069\" paperTitle=\"(Su et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"224931609\" paperTitle=\"(Yin et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA unique characteristic of SPNs is their resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are abundant in biological environments, especially in tumor tissues. Studies have demonstrated that SPNs are generally more resistant to ROS than other nanomaterials such as gold nanorods, allowing for reliable imaging in living animals where ROS concentrations can reach micromolar levels <Paper corpusId=\"52111480\" paperTitle=\"(Zhu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This chemical stability in oxidative environments further enhances their biocompatibility profile and contributes to their overall superior performance in biological applications.\n\nThe organic and potentially biodegradable nature of semiconducting polymers provides additional advantages for long-term clinical applications. Unlike inorganic nanomaterials that may persist in tissues indefinitely, SPNs can be designed with biodegradable components that facilitate their elimination from the body after serving their diagnostic purpose <Paper corpusId=\"260861329\" paperTitle=\"(Dunn et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"59488513\" paperTitle=\"(Hashim et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This property is particularly valuable for repeated imaging procedures where accumulation of imaging agents could otherwise pose risks.\n\nThe exceptional biocompatibility of SPNs has enabled their successful application in various biomedical contexts, including fluorescence imaging, photoacoustic imaging, and photothermal therapy <Paper corpusId=\"260675119\" paperTitle=\"(Elgiddawy et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"272668437\" paperTitle=\"(Yin et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Their minimal toxicity, combined with their outstanding optical properties, positions them as highly promising agents for early-stage tumor detection applications where patient safety is paramount <Paper corpusId=\"99161006\" paperTitle=\"(Kemal et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"234149323\" paperTitle=\"(Idiago-Lopez et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "Biophotonics as an interdisciplinary frontier plays an increasingly important role in modern biomedical science. Optical agents are generally involved in biophotonics to interpret biomolecular events into readable optical signals for imaging and diagnosis or to convert photons into other forms of energy (such as heat, mechanical force, or chemical radicals) for therapeutic intervention and biological stimulation. Development of new optical agents including metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, up-conversion nanoparticles, carbon dots, and silica nanoparticles has contributed to the advancement of this field. However, most of these agents have their own merits and demerits, making them less effective as multimodal biophotonic platforms. In this Account, we summarize our recent work on the development of near-infrared (NIR) semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as multimodal light converters for advanced biophotonics. SPNs are composed of \u03c0-electron delocalized semiconducting polymers (SPs) and often possess the advantages of good biocompatibility, high photostability, and large absorption coefficients. Because the photophysical properties of SPNs are mainly determined by the molecular structures of the precursor polymers, molecular engineering allows us to fine tune their photophysical processes to obtain different optical responses, even to light in the second NIR window (1000-1700 nm). Meanwhile, the facile nanoformulation methods of SPNs enable alteration of their outer and inner structures for diverse biological interactions. The unique photophysical properties of SPNs have brought about ultrasensitive deep-tissue molecular imaging. NIR-absorbing SPNs with strong charge-transfer backbones can convert photoenergy into mechanical acoustic waves, permitting photoacoustic imaging that bypasses the issue of light scattering and reaches the centimeter tissue penetration depth. Differently, phenylenevinylene-containing SPNs can store photon energy via chemical defects and emit long-NIR afterglow luminescence with a half-life of \u223c6 min after cessation of light excitation. Such an afterglow process avoids tissue autofluorescence, giving rise to ultrahigh signal-to-background ratios. So far, SPN-based molecular photoacoustic or afterglow probes have been developed to image disease tissues (tumors), biomarkers (biothiols and reactive oxygen species), and physiological indexes (pH and temperature) in different preclinical animal models. The synthetic flexibility of SPNs further permits light-modulated biological and therapeutic interventions. Till now, SPNs with high photothermal conversion efficiencies have been shaped into photothermal transducers to remotely regulate biological events including protein ion channels, enzymatic activity, and gene expression. In conjunction with the desired biodistribution and tumor-homing ability, SPNs have been doped or coated with other inorganic agents for amplified photothermal or self-regulated photodynamic cancer therapy. This Account thus demonstrates that SPNs serve as a multimodal biophotonic nanoplatform to provide unprecedented opportunities for molecular imaging, noninvasive bioactivation, and advanced therapy."

                            "Pdots have several desirable properties that make them attractive alternatives to other luminescent nanoparticles. The high brightness of Pdots is owed to their fast emissive rates and large extinction coefficients (Pecher et al., 2010). Since each monomer with the polymer chain is capable of absorbing incident light, the high concentration of chromophores in Pdots gives them extinction coefficients an order of magnitude higher than luminescent quantum dots and two orders of magnitude greater than organic dyes (Li et al., 2018). Furthermore, Pdots are highly resistant to photobleaching, which make them excellent candidates for fluorescence imaging and sensing applications (Wu et al., 2008)",

                            "QDs can provide images across large ranges of wavelengths and have high quantum yields (Alivisatos, 1996). Unlike organic dyes, which often suffer rapid photo-bleaching [75](Iyer et al., 2008), QDs are composed of semiconducting metals (e.g., Cd, Zn, Se, In, P, and As) that are resistant to photo-bleaching (260588791). \n\nFurthermore, the quantum properties of QDs are tunable and can provide excitation/emission wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to NIR. The outer shell of the QD could be modified by organic layers including PEG polymers, phospholipids, and peptides (Wang et al., 2011), thus preventing nonspecific absorption of proteins to their surface, increase blood half-life, and reducing toxicity (Hauck et al., 2010)(Jokerst et al., 2011)",
                            "Although QDs offer potentially valuable benefits in preclinical oncology, such as drug targeting and in vivo biomedical imaging, under certain conditions, they pose risks to human health and the environment, constituting a barrier for their translation to clinical use (Hardman, 2005). Semiconducting polymer dots have aroused extensive interests as a novel family of fluorescent probes for tumor targeting applications (Lee et al., 2010)(Cheng et al., 2014). Unlike QDs, polymer-based dots were developed from biologically non-toxic materials, using deep-red photo-acceptors and visible-light photo-donors."

                            "Up to now, a variety of inorganic nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes (Diao et al., 2015), quantum dots [19](Awasthi et al., 2020), and rare earth nanoparticles (NPs) (Wang et al., 2017)(Naczynski et al., 2013), have been widely explored for NIR-II FLI, but their long-term biotoxicity and minimal biodegradability could substantially hinder their practical applications (Lei et al., 2020). Small molecular organic dyes exhibit superiority in the aspect of biocompatibility, but they often suffer from unsatisfactory photostability and limited accumulation capacity (Lyu et al., 2018)(Zhang et al., 2017). In contrast, semiconducting polymers (SPs) with large \u03c0-conjugated architectures exhibit reliable biosafety, strong light-harvesting ability, durable photostability, excellent photothermal conversion ability, etc. They have manifested great talents in the fields of FLI, photoacoustic imaging, and imaging-guided PTT and/or photodynamic therapy (Sun et al., 2018)(Song et al., 2020)(Guo et al., 2018)(Jiang et al., 2018)(Feng et al., 2013)(Li et al., 2018)(Yu et al., 2017)(Qi et al., 2022)."

SPNs have better uorescence stability with longer shelf-lives, are composed of benign or less-toxic materials, and can be synthesized by an environmentally friendly and relatively easy method (miniemulsion) that does not require any heating, and can be performed in ambient conditions. Many applications require uorescence within a specic range of wavelengths, selected for the relevant end-use. Nanoparticles engineered for these applications must, therefore, have stable emission that does not change or quench in their intended environment over the period of storage and use.

                            "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT) have attracted extensive attention in disease diagnosis and treatment. Although many exogenous contrast agents have been developed for PA imaging and PTT, the design guidelines to amplify their imaging and therapy performances remain challenging and are highly demanded. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) composed of polymers with \u03c0-electron delocalized backbones can be designed to amplify their PA imaging and PTT performance, because of their clear structure-property relation and versatility in modifying their molecular structures to tune their photophysical properties. This review summarizes the recent advances in the photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy applications of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with a focus on signal amplification and second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700\u00a0nm) construction. The strategies such as structure-property screening, fluorescence quenching, accelerated heat dissipation, and size-dependent heat dissipation are first discussed to amplify the PA brightness of SPNs for in vivo PA. The molecular approaches to shifting the absorption of SPNs for NIR-II PA imaging and PTT are then introduced so as to improve the tissue penetration depth for diagnosis and therapy. At last, current challenges and perspectives of SPNs in the field of imaging and therapy are discussed."

This review article focus on multispectral optical imaging techniques that can provide molecular functional information. We summarize the basic principle of the spectral unmixing technique that enables the delineation of optical chromophores. Then, we explore the principle, typical system configuration, and biomedical applications of the representative optical imaging techniques, which are fluorescence imaging, two-photon microscopy, and photoacoustic imaging. The results in the recent studies show the great potential of the multispectral analysis techniques for monitoring responses of biological systems in vivo."

                            "Theranostic nanoagents are promising for precision medicine. However, biodegradable nanoagents with the ability for photoacoustic (PA) imaging guided photothermal therapy (PTT) are rare. We herein report the development of biodegradable semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) with enhanced PA and PTT efficacy for cancer therapy. The design capitalizes on the enzymatically oxidizable nature of vinylene bonds in conjunction with polymer chemistry to synthesize a biodegradable semiconducting polymer (DPPV) and transform it into water-soluble nanoparticles (SPNV). As compared with its counterpart SPN (SPNT), the presence of vinylene bonds within the polymer backbone also endows SPNV with a significantly enhanced mass absorption coefficient (1.3-fold) and photothermal conversion efficacy (2.4-fold). As such, SPNV provides the PA signals and the photothermal maximum temperature higher than SPNT, allowing detection and photothermal ablation of tumors in living mice in a more sensitive and effective way. Our study thus reveals a general molecular design to enhance the biodegradability of optically active polymer nanoparticles while dramatically elevating their imaging and therapeutic capabilities."

                            "Biophotonics as an interdisciplinary frontier plays an increasingly important role in modern biomedical science. Optical agents are generally involved in biophotonics to interpret biomolecular events into readable optical signals for imaging and diagnosis or to convert photons into other forms of energy (such as heat, mechanical force, or chemical radicals) for therapeutic intervention and biological stimulation. Development of new optical agents including metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, up-conversion nanoparticles, carbon dots, and silica nanoparticles has contributed to the advancement of this field. However, most of these agents have their own merits and demerits, making them less effective as multimodal biophotonic platforms. In this Account, we summarize our recent work on the development of near-infrared (NIR) semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as multimodal light converters for advanced biophotonics. SPNs are composed of \u03c0-electron delocalized semiconducting polymers (SPs) and often possess the advantages of good biocompatibility, high photostability, and large absorption coefficients. Because the photophysical properties of SPNs are mainly determined by the molecular structures of the precursor polymers, molecular engineering allows us to fine tune their photophysical processes to obtain different optical responses, even to light in the second NIR window (1000-1700 nm). Meanwhile, the facile nanoformulation methods of SPNs enable alteration of their outer and inner structures for diverse biological interactions. The unique photophysical properties of SPNs have brought about ultrasensitive deep-tissue molecular imaging. NIR-absorbing SPNs with strong charge-transfer backbones can convert photoenergy into mechanical acoustic waves, permitting photoacoustic imaging that bypasses the issue of light scattering and reaches the centimeter tissue penetration depth. Differently, phenylenevinylene-containing SPNs can store photon energy via chemical defects and emit long-NIR afterglow luminescence with a half-life of \u223c6 min after cessation of light excitation. Such an afterglow process avoids tissue autofluorescence, giving rise to ultrahigh signal-to-background ratios. So far, SPN-based molecular photoacoustic or afterglow probes have been developed to image disease tissues (tumors), biomarkers (biothiols and reactive oxygen species), and physiological indexes (pH and temperature) in different preclinical animal models. The synthetic flexibility of SPNs further permits light-modulated biological and therapeutic interventions. Till now, SPNs with high photothermal conversion efficiencies have been shaped into photothermal transducers to remotely regulate biological events including protein ion channels, enzymatic activity, and gene expression. In conjunction with the desired biodistribution and tumor-homing ability, SPNs have been doped or coated with other inorganic agents for amplified photothermal or self-regulated photodynamic cancer therapy. This Account thus demonstrates that SPNs serve as a multimodal biophotonic nanoplatform to provide unprecedented opportunities for molecular imaging, noninvasive bioactivation, and advanced therapy."

                            "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging in the second near\u2010infrared (NIR\u2010II) window (1000\u20131700 nm) holds great promise for deep\u2010tissue diagnosis due to the reduced light scattering and minimized tissue absorption; however, exploration of such a noninvasive imaging technique is greatly constrained by the lack of biodegradable NIR\u2010II absorbing agents. Herein, the first series of metabolizable NIR\u2010II PA agents are reported based on semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). Such completely organic nanoagents consist of \u03c0\u2010conjugated yet oxidizable optical polymer as PA generator and hydrolyzable amphiphilic polymer as particle matrix to provide water solubility. The obtained SPNs are readily degraded by myeloperoxidase and lipase abundant in phagocytes, transforming from nonfluorescent nanoparticles (30 nm) into NIR fluorescent ultrasmall metabolites (\u22481 nm). As such, these nanoagents can be effectively cleared out via both hepatobiliary and renal excretions after systematic administration, leaving no toxicity to living mice. Particularly these nanoagents possess high photothermal conversion efficiencies and emit bright PA signals at 1064 nm, enabling sensitive NIR\u2010II PA imaging of both subcutaneous tumor and deep brain vasculature through intact skull in living animals at a low systematic dosage. This study thus provides a generalized molecular design toward organic metabolizable semiconducting materials for biophotonic applications in NIR\u2010II window."

                            "Chemotherapy is currently the major therapeutic method against cancer. However, chemo drugs are usually lacking in the specificity towards cancer cells over normal cells. In this study, we prepared a novel multifunctional trimeric prodrug by linking the chemo drug camptothecin (CPT) and the exceptional photostable near infrared (NIR) croconaine dye (CR) via a glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide linker. Compared with CPT, our novel trimeric CR-(SS-CPT)2 is more hydrophobic and bulky, making it highly effcient to be encapsulated into biocompatible polymeric nanocarrier. The prodrug underwent rapid drug release specifically in cancer cells with high GSH concentration. The hyperthermia produced by CR upon laser irradiation could further accelerate the break of disulfide bond, which makes the release of CPT even more controllable. We further loaded the CR-(SS-CPT)2 into folate modified lipid-polymer nanoparticles, which demonstrated high in vivo tumor accumulation and retention. The biodistribution of these nanoparticles can be directly monitored in real time via NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging. Under the imaging guided chemo- and photothermal- synergistic therapy, the tumors were completely ablated with no recurrence. The design not only highly enhanced the therapeutic specificity and effeciency of CPT, but also provide a \"all in one\" nanomedicine for imaging-guided dual modality therapy."

This new formulation enabled us to overcome the difficulties associated with the free dye, such as its hydrophobicity, photobleaching and aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) manifestations, particularly in vivo. Remarkably, recent research has shown that using bulky hydrophobic counterions in NPs improves their bioimaging performance by reducing dye leakage and ACQ (Feng et al., 2013)."

Following a brief introduction on fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, as well as the merits of using polymeric NPs over other types of fluorescent probes, this minireview gives a concise summary of key advances made in recent years (2017 - 2020) in the use of polymeric NPs for fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging. We placed a particular focus on various strategies used for enhanced bioimaging applications, including polymeric NPs that encapsulate near-infrared dyes, aggregation-induced emission fluorogens, cationic dyes doped with bulky hydrophobic counterions, and semiconducting polymers. Next, we summarized the current limitations in some of these polymeric NP systems and offered potential solutions to overcome them. Finally, we suggested, from our perspectives, some critical considerations in the design of polymeric NPs for future bioimaging and sensing applications."

                            "In the past few years, conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) have been successfully prepared and applied in the biological field because of their unique opto-electronic properties. The rapid development of CPNs is mainly attributed to their simple synthesis procedures and easy separation steps. The advantages of CPNs include high brightness, excellent photostability, low cytotoxicity, high quantum yield and versatile surface modification. The functionalization of CPNs with specific recognition elements imparts them good ability for targeted recognition and imaging in vitro and in vivo. CPNs can be applied to deliver drug and gene, and simultaneously to real-time monitor the release process due to their self-luminous characteristics. Moreover, CPNs can sensitize oxygen molecules to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can kill adjacent bacteria and tumor cells. In this tutorial review, we provide a recent development of the preparation methods, properties, and functionalization strategies of CPNs, especially discussing their biological applications in targeted imaging, drug/gene delivery and biomedicine. The challenges and outlooks in this field will also be discussed."

                "text": "\nThe clinical translation potential of nanomaterials for tumor detection varies significantly based on their inherent properties and biological interactions. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) demonstrate the most promising clinical translation profile due to their exceptional combination of biocompatibility, optical performance, and structural versatility. Their composition of fully organic, biologically inert constituents naturally overcomes the long-term toxicity issues associated with inorganic nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"224931609\" paperTitle=\"(Yin et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This favorable safety profile, coupled with high photostability and structural tunability, positions SPNs as ideal candidates for clinical applications where patient safety is paramount <Paper corpusId=\"155642523\" paperTitle=\"(Gargiulo et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"21432354\" paperTitle=\"(Cui et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn contrast, quantum dots (QDs) face significant barriers to clinical translation despite their excellent optical properties. Their core composition typically includes heavy metals such as Cd, Zn, Se, In, P, and As, raising serious toxicity concerns that limit their application in humans <Paper corpusId=\"250730791\" paperTitle=\"(Kang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Studies have shown that QDs can potentially disrupt mitochondrial function and lead to DNA damage, presenting major obstacles to their clinical adoption <Paper corpusId=\"257134662\" paperTitle=\"(Guo et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221467278\" paperTitle=\"(Siddique et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. While surface modifications with PEG polymers, phospholipids, and peptides can reduce toxicity and increase blood half-life, these approaches do not fully mitigate the underlying safety concerns <Paper corpusId=\"54100812\" paperTitle=\"(Cohen et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMetallic nanoparticles, although widely studied for biomedical applications, face translation challenges primarily due to their non-biodegradable nature and potential for long-term accumulation in tissues. Their persistence in biological systems raises concerns about chronic toxicity that remain unresolved <Paper corpusId=\"232382625\" paperTitle=\"(Han et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, while these materials offer excellent NIR light absorbance and high photothermal efficiency, their clinical adoption is hampered by uncertainties regarding long-term safety <Paper corpusId=\"259742069\" paperTitle=\"(Su et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nOrganic dyes, despite their good biocompatibility, face significant limitations for clinical translation due to their poor photostability and low quantum yields in aqueous biological environments <Paper corpusId=\"90340197\" paperTitle=\"(Hassan et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. Their rapid photobleaching and small Stokes shifts severely restrict their utility for extended clinical imaging applications <Paper corpusId=\"99161006\" paperTitle=\"(Kemal et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. These inherent limitations have driven researchers to explore alternative nanomaterials like SPNs that maintain superior optical advantages without the associated biological risks.\n\nThe clinical translation of SPNs benefits from their versatility in both imaging and therapeutic applications. Their dual functionality as diagnostic and therapeutic agents enables image-guided cancer therapies, where tumors can be both detected and treated using the same nanoplatform <Paper corpusId=\"235644177\" paperTitle=\"(Shrestha et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"206718590\" paperTitle=\"(Lyu et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. This theranostic capability is particularly valuable for clinical applications, as it streamlines treatment workflows and potentially reduces costs and complications.\n\nDespite their advantages, all nanomaterials face common challenges in their path to clinical translation. These include batch-to-batch reproducibility, scalable manufacturing, stability during storage, and standardization of characterization methods <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">. Regulatory hurdles also remain significant, as novel nanomaterials must undergo extensive safety and efficacy testing before clinical approval. Additionally, the complexity of functionalization for specific targeting and the optimization of biodistribution profiles present ongoing challenges that researchers must address.\n\nFor SPNs specifically, while their biodegradability can be engineered through the incorporation of cleavable linkages, optimizing their clearance pathways to prevent unintended accumulation remains an area requiring further investigation <Paper corpusId=\"206718590\" paperTitle=\"(Lyu et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. The development of standardized protocols for their synthesis and characterization is also essential to ensure consistent performance across different clinical applications.\n\nIn summary, while all nanomaterials discussed offer unique advantages for tumor detection, semiconducting polymers demonstrate the most favorable profile for clinical translation due to their exceptional biocompatibility, photostability, and optical performance. However, addressing manufacturing, regulatory, and optimization challenges remains critical to realizing their full potential in clinical settings.",

                            "Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have evolved into a new class of photonic materials with great potential for biomedical applications. Depending on the polymer structures, SPNs can be developed into optical agents for fluorescence and chemiluminescence imaging, photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy, and heat converters for photothermal therapy. In this feature article, recent work is summarized on the development of SPNs for in vivo photoacoustic (PA) imaging, a state-of-the-art imaging modality that converts light energy into mechanical acoustic waves to provide deep tissue penetration. The structure-property relationship and doping approaches are discussed to reveal the importance of promoting nonradiative decay in amplifying the PA brightness of SPNs. Moreover, their imaging applications, including lymph node mapping, tumor imaging, and monitoring of pathological indexes, are highlighted. These studies demonstrate that SPNs can serve as versatile PA agents for advanced molecular imaging applications."

                            "Up to now, a variety of inorganic nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes (Diao et al., 2015), quantum dots [19](Awasthi et al., 2020), and rare earth nanoparticles (NPs) (Wang et al., 2017)(Naczynski et al., 2013), have been widely explored for NIR-II FLI, but their long-term biotoxicity and minimal biodegradability could substantially hinder their practical applications (Lei et al., 2020). Small molecular organic dyes exhibit superiority in the aspect of biocompatibility, but they often suffer from unsatisfactory photostability and limited accumulation capacity (Lyu et al., 2018)(Zhang et al., 2017). In contrast, semiconducting polymers (SPs) with large \u03c0-conjugated architectures exhibit reliable biosafety, strong light-harvesting ability, durable photostability, excellent photothermal conversion ability, etc. They have manifested great talents in the fields of FLI, photoacoustic imaging, and imaging-guided PTT and/or photodynamic therapy (Sun et al., 2018)(Song et al., 2020)(Guo et al., 2018)(Jiang et al., 2018)(Feng et al., 2013)(Li et al., 2018)(Yu et al., 2017)(Qi et al., 2022)."

                            "Theranostic nanoagents are promising for precision medicine. However, biodegradable nanoagents with the ability for photoacoustic (PA) imaging guided photothermal therapy (PTT) are rare. We herein report the development of biodegradable semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) with enhanced PA and PTT efficacy for cancer therapy. The design capitalizes on the enzymatically oxidizable nature of vinylene bonds in conjunction with polymer chemistry to synthesize a biodegradable semiconducting polymer (DPPV) and transform it into water-soluble nanoparticles (SPNV). As compared with its counterpart SPN (SPNT), the presence of vinylene bonds within the polymer backbone also endows SPNV with a significantly enhanced mass absorption coefficient (1.3-fold) and photothermal conversion efficacy (2.4-fold). As such, SPNV provides the PA signals and the photothermal maximum temperature higher than SPNT, allowing detection and photothermal ablation of tumors in living mice in a more sensitive and effective way. Our study thus reveals a general molecular design to enhance the biodegradability of optically active polymer nanoparticles while dramatically elevating their imaging and therapeutic capabilities."
