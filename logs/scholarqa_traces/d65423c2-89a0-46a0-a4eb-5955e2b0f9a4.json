                    "text": "Lipid-based formulations are known for better uptake efficiency at cellular level. Physiological aspects of lipid-cell interaction are vital to understand the therapeutic distribution and ultimate fate of carrier system (Xing et al., 2016). LNPs exhibit many advantages as delivery carriers over other nanocarrier systems (such as polymers, CNTs, metallic NPs etc.), and have seen extensive usage in drug delivery. In addition to the above mentioned concerns of CNTs and metallic NPs, it has been observed that metallo-supramolecular polymers, that can provide the functionality of the metal ion along with the processability of a polymer have some limitations when used in drug delivery processes. For example, the introduction of metal ions in the body can disturb the ion balance and limit certain medical applications (Rowan and Beck, 2005), (Dong et al., 2015).

Zeth, M. Iftikhar, M. Rehman, M. Usman, W. Khan, A. Ihsan\n## Abstract\nNone\n## LNPs: superiority over other nanocarrier systems\nLipid-based formulations are known for better uptake efficiency at cellular level. Physiological aspects of lipid-cell interaction are vital to understand the therapeutic distribution and ultimate fate of carrier system (Xing et al., 2016). LNPs exhibit many advantages as delivery carriers over other nanocarrier systems (such as polymers, CNTs, metallic NPs etc.), and have seen extensive usage in drug delivery. In addition to the above mentioned concerns of CNTs and metallic NPs, it has been observed that metallo-supramolecular polymers, that can provide the functionality of the metal ion along with the processability of a polymer have some limitations when used in drug delivery processes. For example, the introduction of metal ions in the body can disturb the ion balance and limit certain medical applications (Rowan and Beck, 2005), (Dong et al., 2015). Furthermore, dendritic polymers exhibit many drawbacks which limit their usage in theranostic applications, for instance, several complex and highly expensive synthetic and purification procedures can lead to imprecise or nonspecific structures with low quantifiability. Moreover, these polymers show poor reproducibility and certain biosafety concerns due to their possible toxicity and unexpected removal, which restrict their clinical translation (Jain et al., 2010), (Shcharbin et al., 2014). The development of LNPs paves the way for resolving above stated limitations. \n\nAdvantages of LNPs may include: (1) ease of engineering processes, (2) up-scaling feasibility, (3) excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, (4) negligible toxicity, (5) controlled and targeted drug release potential, (6) improved drug solubility and stability, (7) enhanced bioavailability, (8) potential of encapsulating both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, (9) less expensive, (10) encapsulation of high drug content, (11) potential to cross various physiological barriers, (12) easy validation, and many others which could be favorable for specific delivery route or nature of the payload (Ghasemiyeh and Mohammadi-Samani, 2018), (Attama et al., 2012).\n...\nAdvantages of LNPs may include: (1) ease of engineering processes, (2) up-scaling feasibility, (3) excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, (4) negligible toxicity, (5) controlled and targeted drug release potential, (6) improved drug solubility and stability, (7) enhanced bioavailability, (8) potential of encapsulating both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, (9) less expensive, (10) encapsulation of high drug content, (11) potential to cross various physiological barriers, (12) easy validation, and many others which could be favorable for specific delivery route or nature of the payload (Ghasemiyeh and Mohammadi-Samani, 2018), (Attama et al., 2012). \n\nOwing to the charm of their multi-lamellar structures and potential benefits, LNPs have been owed to the fact that in addition to drug delivery, nucleic acid delivery by them is also a matter of interest to the nanomedicine community.

            "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer is considered the most aggressive type of breast cancer among women and the lack of expressed receptors has made treatment options substantially limited. Recently, various types of nanoparticles have emerged as a therapeutic option against TNBC, to elevate the therapeutic efficacy of the existing chemotherapeutics. Among the various nanoparticles, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) viz. liposomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid nanocarriers, and lipid\u2013polymer hybrid nanoparticles are developed for cancer treatment which is well confirmed and documented. LNPs include various therapeutic advantages as compared to conventional therapy and other nanoparticles, including increased loading capacity, enhanced temporal and thermal stability, decreased therapeutic dose and associated toxicity, and limited drug resistance. In addition to these, LNPs overcome physiological barriers which provide increased accumulation of therapeutics at the target site. Extensive efforts by the scientific community could make some of the liposomal formulations the clinical reality; however, the relatively high cost, problems in scaling up the formulations, and delivery in a more targetable fashion are some of the major issues that need to be addressed. In the present review, we have compiled the state of the art about different types of LNPs with the latest advances reported for the treatment of TNBC in recent years, along with their clinical status and toxicity in detail.",

                    "text": "Rapid advances in lipid-based nanoparticles show an immense impact on cancer treatment and management. Looking into the structural makeup of LNPs, we found that LNPs are composed of lipids that are both biodegradable and biocompatible such as phospholipids, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The inclusion of such less toxic substances, as well as limited use of organic solvents, makes LNPs a safe drug delivery system against TNBC as compared to polymeric and inorganic NPs [4,8]. According to the general prototype, LNPs consist of API, lipids that are designed to sequester, deliver, and promote functionality. Further, to maintain the stability of the dispersions formed by the LNPs, in environmental stresses, surfactants or a combination of surfactants are used, depending on their HLB values [25]. Further, to safeguard the LNPs from the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and to render biological stability, LNPs are often coated with a stealth or biocompatible polymeric layer such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) [6,26,27].

A. Shaik, B. Eid, A. Abdel-Naim, Shadab Md, Aftab Ahmad, A. Agrawal\n## Abstract\nTriple-negative breast cancer is considered the most aggressive type of breast cancer among women and the lack of expressed receptors has made treatment options substantially limited. Recently, various types of nanoparticles have emerged as a therapeutic option against TNBC, to elevate the therapeutic efficacy of the existing chemotherapeutics. Among the various nanoparticles, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) viz. liposomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid nanocarriers, and lipid\u2013polymer hybrid nanoparticles are developed for cancer treatment which is well confirmed and documented. LNPs include various therapeutic advantages as compared to conventional therapy and other nanoparticles, including increased loading capacity, enhanced temporal and thermal stability, decreased therapeutic dose and associated toxicity, and limited drug resistance. In addition to these, LNPs overcome physiological barriers which provide increased accumulation of therapeutics at the target site. Extensive efforts by the scientific community could make some of the liposomal formulations the clinical reality; however, the relatively high cost, problems in scaling up the formulations, and delivery in a more targetable fashion are some of the major issues that need to be addressed. In the present review, we have compiled the state of the art about different types of LNPs with the latest advances reported for the treatment of TNBC in recent years, along with their clinical status and toxicity in detail.\n## Lipid-Based Nanoparticles: A Versatile Drug Delivery System\nRapid advances in lipid-based nanoparticles show an immense impact on cancer treatment and management. Looking into the structural makeup of LNPs, we found that LNPs are composed of lipids that are both biodegradable and biocompatible such as phospholipids, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The inclusion of such less toxic substances, as well as limited use of organic solvents, makes LNPs a safe drug delivery system against TNBC as compared to polymeric and inorganic NPs [4,8]. According to the general prototype, LNPs consist of API, lipids that are designed to sequester, deliver, and promote functionality. Further, to maintain the stability of the dispersions formed by the LNPs, in environmental stresses, surfactants or a combination of surfactants are used, depending on their HLB values [25]. Further, to safeguard the LNPs from the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and to render biological stability, LNPs are often coated with a stealth or biocompatible polymeric layer such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) [6,26,27]. Finally, for possessing an enhanced targeting property, the LNPs may bind with a targeting moiety such as a biological receptor-specific ligand. Such orientation of LNPs and their small size help the LNPs to accumulate frequently on the tumor sites [6]. \n\nIn cancer research, it was observed that approximately 40% of new chemical entities show poor aqueous solubility, which further limits their therapeutic efficiency. Thus, the utilization of hydrophobic LNPs as a vehicle either encapsulates or solubilizes the drug moiety that will further improve the stability of poorly aqueous soluble drugs in the surrounding aqueous media and will prevent the precipitation of the drugs both in vitro and in vivo. Hence, it could be inferred that the development of LNPs shows improved chemotherapeutic efficacy by increasing their solubility [28,29].",

Notable applications include the first-ever U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved nano-drug, Doxil\u00e2, which uses LNPs for the delivery of the anticancer drug doxorubicin, and Epaxal\u00e2, which uses LNPs for the delivery of hepatitis A protein antigens. Most recently, mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2 or Comirnaty\u00e2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273 or SpikeVax\u00e2) have contributed significantly to the fight of the COVID-19 pandemic through the use of LNP-based delivery systems 5 . \n\nFor intracellular delivery purposes, nanomaterials including the lipid nanoparticles, (naturally derived and fully synthetic) polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles (e.g., gold nanoparticles, carbon-and silica-based nanoparticles, and iron oxide nanoparticles) have been intensively studied 6e11 . Each delivery system has its own advantages and disadvantages. Generally speaking, the lipid-based delivery systems usually have simple formulation procedures and compositions, good biocompatibility, and high bioavailability. So far, the lipid-based drug formulations are the most common FDA-approved nano-drugs. Despite the great success that LNP delivery technology has achieved in both basic research and clinical translations, there have been sustained efforts focused on developing more efficient and specific LNP delivery systems to apply to new therapeutics to different organs and tissues 12e15 . Considering that each type of cargo molecule (small molecule drugs and biologics) has its distinct physicochemical properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of small molecules; molecular weight, geometry, surface charge, and hydrodynamic size of biologics), the carrier LNP system needs to be carefully tailored for particular delivery applications 16e19 .",

Non-specific interactions between the administered drug and biomolecules can potentially induce unwanted toxicity or side-effects. Nanoparticle-based delivery systems have been extensively adapted to address this challenge 102,103 . Enormous evidence showed that nano-drug delivery systems can help solubilize hydrophobic drugs, protect cargo drug molecules from unfavorable hydrolysis and degradation, prolong half-life time in blood circulation, target specific organs and tissues, and control drug release rate, among other purposes. For these reasons, LNPs, polymers, and inorganic nanomaterials have been employed as nanocarriers for the delivery of small molecule drugs 23,104e106 . These delivery systems have demonstrated to be advantageous in comparison with free drugs, and have been used for the treatment of cancer, infectious diseases, inflammation diseases, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and many others 107e110 . Our studies have shown that our combinatorial LNPs could be useful in delivering small molecule anticancer drugs in vitro and antimicrobials in vivo in mouse model.",

Notable applications include the first-ever U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved nano-drug, Doxil\u00e2, which uses LNPs for the delivery of the anticancer drug doxorubicin, and Epaxal\u00e2, which uses LNPs for the delivery of hepatitis A protein antigens. Most recently, mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2 or Comirnaty\u00e2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273 or SpikeVax\u00e2) have contributed significantly to the fight of the COVID-19 pandemic through the use of LNP-based delivery systems 5 . \n\nFor intracellular delivery purposes, nanomaterials including the lipid nanoparticles, (naturally derived and fully synthetic) polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles (e.g., gold nanoparticles, carbon-and silica-based nanoparticles, and iron oxide nanoparticles) have been intensively studied 6e11 . Each delivery system has its own advantages and disadvantages. Generally speaking, the lipid-based delivery systems usually have simple formulation procedures and compositions, good biocompatibility, and high bioavailability. So far, the lipid-based drug formulations are the most common FDA-approved nano-drugs. Despite the great success that LNP delivery technology has achieved in both basic research and clinical translations, there have been sustained efforts focused on developing more efficient and specific LNP delivery systems to apply to new therapeutics to different organs and tissues 12e15 . Considering that each type of cargo molecule (small molecule drugs and biologics) has its distinct physicochemical properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of small molecules; molecular weight, geometry, surface charge, and hydrodynamic size of biologics), the carrier LNP system needs to be carefully tailored for particular delivery applications 16e19 .\n\n## LNPs for the delivery of small molecule drugs\nOne of the greatest challenges in administering traditional small molecule chemotherapeutic drugs is overcoming the offsite interactions formed between the target cell and the drug administration site. Non-specific interactions between the administered drug and biomolecules can potentially induce unwanted toxicity or side-effects. Nanoparticle-based delivery systems have been extensively adapted to address this challenge 102,103 . Enormous evidence showed that nano-drug delivery systems can help solubilize hydrophobic drugs, protect cargo drug molecules from unfavorable hydrolysis and degradation, prolong half-life time in blood circulation, target specific organs and tissues, and control drug release rate, among other purposes. For these reasons, LNPs, polymers, and inorganic nanomaterials have been employed as nanocarriers for the delivery of small molecule drugs 23,104e106 . These delivery systems have demonstrated to be advantageous in comparison with free drugs, and have been used for the treatment of cancer, infectious diseases, inflammation diseases, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and many others 107e110 . Our studies have shown that our combinatorial LNPs could be useful in delivering small molecule anticancer drugs in vitro and antimicrobials in vivo in mouse model.",

Mehta, Thuy Anh Bui, Xinpu Yang, Yagiz Aksoy, E. Goldys, W. Deng\n## Abstract\nOver the past decade, the therapeutic potential of nanomaterials as novel drug delivery systems complementing conventional pharmacology has been widely acknowledged. Among these nanomaterials, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown remarkable pharmacological performance and promising therapeutic outcomes, thus gaining substantial interest in preclinical and clinical research. In this review, we introduce the main types of LNPs used in drug formulations such as liposomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles, focusing on their main physicochemical properties and therapeutic potential. We discuss computational studies and modeling techniques to enhance the understanding of how LNPs interact with therapeutic cargo and to predict the potential effectiveness of such interactions in therapeutic applications. We also analyze the benefits and drawbacks of various LNP production techniques such as nanoprecipitation, emulsification, evaporation, thin film hydration, microfluidic-based methods, and an impingement jet mixer. Additionally, we discuss the major challenges associated with industrial development, including stability and sterilization, storage, regulatory compliance, reproducibility, and quality control. Overcoming these challenges and facilitating regulatory compliance represent the key steps toward LNP\u2019s successful commercialization and translation into clinical settings.\n## INTRODUCTION\nLipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) are a highly adaptable class of nanocarriers that have gained widespread usage in medical research and pharmacology. 1 They can encapsulate various therapeutic agents including small molecules, nucleic acids and monoclonal antibodies for a diverse range of applications. 2,3 NPs offer several benefits, such as safeguarding drugs from in vivo degradation, boosting their solubility and efficacy, enabling targeted drug delivery to the disease site, regulating drug release, and altering drug biodistribution. 4 These engineered nanocarriers hold the potential to overcome significant limitations of traditional therapeutic products such as inadequate efficacy, susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, low bioavailability, and off-target side effects. 1,5 he potential for LNP-based pharmaceuticals has been increasingly recognized in recent years, with significant growth in both research and industrial sectors. 6 The LNP-based gene therapy market's value reached about $3.5 billion in 2021, with a projected compound annual growth rate of around 18.5% from 2021 to 2026. 7 The current market value of liposomal therapeutics used for cancer treatment (e.g., Doxil, DaunoX-ome, Myocet, DepoCyt, Marqibo, Onivyde) was approximately $3.72 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach almost $7 billion by 2027. 8 In addition to cancer treatment, LNP-based therapies have gained FDA approval for treating other diseases, including COVID-19 vaccine (Spikevax , Comirnaty ) and Amyloidosis (Onpattro ), by delivering mRNA and siRNA, respectively. 9 \u221211 Nevertheless, to be clinically relevant, LNPbased therapies must be produced through techniques that ensure stability during storage, compatibility with sterilization, quality control, and regulatory compliance. 4 These factors are crucial to the successful development and translation of LNPbased therapeutics for clinical applications. \n\nIn addition to LNPs, metal\u2212organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a promising class of materials for drug delivery applications.\n\n## Lipid Polymer Hybrid Nanoparticles\nLipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) are another major type of lipid nanoparticle that combines the advantages of lipids and polymers for various biomedical applications. 117 PNs have polymer cores that contain therapeutic substances and lipid/lipid-PEG shells as a \"stealth\" coating for improved in vivo circulation. 134 This unique structural composition offers optimal biocompatibility and physical stability, making them an ideal vehicle for drug delivery. 117 LPNs have been successfully used to encapsulate various pharmaceuticals, including nucleic acids, for sustained release and improved stability. Furthermore, incorporating functional groups on the polymer surface facilitates the targeted drug delivery to specific cells or tissues. \n\nDensity functional theory (DFT) simulations, one of the computational modeling methods, were utilized to gain a better understanding of the interaction mechanism between the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) and the polymers within LNPs. 135 The study aimed to improve the therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin (DOX) in lipid nanoparticles (LPNs). By analysis of the DOX-loaded LPNs, researchers found that polymers interacted strongly with DOX at various sites, forming stable complexes. The simulations indicated energetically favorable binding, suggesting a potential for enhancing oral bioavailability. LPNs are gaining recognition as an advanced substitute for traditional liposomal and polymeric drug delivery systems due to their wide range of advantages, encompassing applications in combinatorial/active targeted drug deliveries, cancer gene therapy, vaccine development, and novel diagnostic imaging methods. 136 Encouraging results from Phase I and II clinical trials demonstrate the potential of LPNs in delivering the anticancer drug Docetaxel, particularly for lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancers 120\u2212123 (Table 1). Nevertheless, LPNs encounter certain challenges, such as potential polymer component toxicity and difficulties in achieving consistent particle size and shape. 18 Ongoing research endeavors aim to address these obstacles and further advance LPNs for use in diverse biomedical applications. Despite the challenges, LPNs exhibit great promise for drug delivery due to their distinctive properties and versatility in addressing various biomedical needs.",

            "abstract": "Introduction Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) is increasingly recognized for their potential in drug delivery, offering protection to hydrophobic drugs from degradation. Industrial synthesis of LNPs, exemplified by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines, utilizes flow chemistry or microfluidics, showcasing its scalability. This study explores the utilization of a novel design reactor, the vortex tube reactor, within flow chemistry for LNPs synthesis, aiming to optimize its conditions and compare them with batch synthesis. Methods LNPs were synthesized using the vortex tube reactor, incorporating bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model drug in the aqueous phase, alongside 1.2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and cholesterol in the organic phase. Design of experiments (DoE), specifically Box-Behnken design, was employed to optimize parameters, including X1: the flow rate ratio (10\u2013100 mL/min), X2: the aqueous-to-organic volumetric ratio (1:1\u201310:1), and X3: the number of reactor units (1\u20135 units). Responses evaluated encompassed physical properties and productivity. Optimized conditions were determined by minimizing particle size (Y1), polydispersity index (Y2), and zeta potential (Y3), while maximizing entrapment efficiency (Y4), drug loading (Y5), and productivity (Y5). Results Results indicated that optimal conditions were achieved at X1 of 100 mL/min, X2 of 5.278, and X3 of 1 unit. LNPs synthesized under these conditions exhibited favorable physical properties and productivity, with uniformity maintained across batches. The vortex tube reactor demonstrated superiority over batch synthesis, yielding smaller particles (166.23 \u00b1 0.98 nm), more uniform nanoparticles (PDI 0.17 \u00b1 0.01), and higher entrapment (67.75 \u00b1 1.55%) and loading capacities (36.39 \u00b1 0.83%), indicative of enhanced productivity (313.4 \u00b1 12.88 mg/min). Conclusion This study elucidates the potential of flow chemistry, particularly utilizing the vortex tube reactor, for large-scale LNPs formulation, offering insights into parameter relationships and advancing nanoparticle synthesis for drug delivery applications.",

These nanoparticles enable precise drug delivery to target cells, controlled release, and targeted distribution through surface modification with ligands. They are currently being developed as drug delivery systems for various substances and vaccines on the market, including AmBisome, DepoCyt, Doxil, Inflexal, Myocet, Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, and Moderna mRNA vaccines. 1,2 Nanoparticles have garnered significant attention in drug delivery due to their unique properties, such as a high surface area-to-volume ratio, the ability to traverse biological barriers, and the capacity to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs. Various types of nanoparticles, including polymeric, inorganic, and lipid-based nanoparticles, have been developed for drug delivery applications. 3 ipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) constitute a subclass of nanoparticles composed primarily of lipids, which have garnered significant attention in recent years. LNPs present several advantages over alternative nanoparticle systems, including high stability, biocompatibility, and the capability to target specific cells or tissues. This targeted approach enhances drug efficacy while mitigating side effects. Moreover, the customization of LNPs through surface modification with targeting ligands further refines their specificity toward desired cells or tissues, thus optimizing drug delivery efficiency. Structurally, LNPs typically comprise a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core, forming a versatile platform for drug encapsulation. This architecture facilitates the encapsulation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs within the lipid bilayer or aqueous core, respectively, enabling the simultaneous delivery of multiple therapeutic agents. Moreover, the lipid bilayer contributes to the stability of LNPs in biological environments, shielding encapsulated drugs from degradation and extending their circulation time in the bloodstream. 3,4 LNPs can be synthesized using various techniques, such as sonication, 5 microfluidics, 6 and extrusion. 7",

Sriamornsak, Chonlada Panpipat, T. Sangnim\n## Abstract\nIntroduction Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) is increasingly recognized for their potential in drug delivery, offering protection to hydrophobic drugs from degradation. Industrial synthesis of LNPs, exemplified by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines, utilizes flow chemistry or microfluidics, showcasing its scalability. This study explores the utilization of a novel design reactor, the vortex tube reactor, within flow chemistry for LNPs synthesis, aiming to optimize its conditions and compare them with batch synthesis. Methods LNPs were synthesized using the vortex tube reactor, incorporating bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model drug in the aqueous phase, alongside 1.2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and cholesterol in the organic phase. Design of experiments (DoE), specifically Box-Behnken design, was employed to optimize parameters, including X1: the flow rate ratio (10\u2013100 mL/min), X2: the aqueous-to-organic volumetric ratio (1:1\u201310:1), and X3: the number of reactor units (1\u20135 units). Responses evaluated encompassed physical properties and productivity. Optimized conditions were determined by minimizing particle size (Y1), polydispersity index (Y2), and zeta potential (Y3), while maximizing entrapment efficiency (Y4), drug loading (Y5), and productivity (Y5). Results Results indicated that optimal conditions were achieved at X1 of 100 mL/min, X2 of 5.278, and X3 of 1 unit. LNPs synthesized under these conditions exhibited favorable physical properties and productivity, with uniformity maintained across batches. The vortex tube reactor demonstrated superiority over batch synthesis, yielding smaller particles (166.23 \u00b1 0.98 nm), more uniform nanoparticles (PDI 0.17 \u00b1 0.01), and higher entrapment (67.75 \u00b1 1.55%) and loading capacities (36.39 \u00b1 0.83%), indicative of enhanced productivity (313.4 \u00b1 12.88 mg/min). Conclusion This study elucidates the potential of flow chemistry, particularly utilizing the vortex tube reactor, for large-scale LNPs formulation, offering insights into parameter relationships and advancing nanoparticle synthesis for drug delivery applications.\n## Introduction\nNanoparticles have transformed drug delivery, spanning sizes from 1 to 1000 nm. This innovation promises enhanced drug efficacy while minimizing side effects. These nanoparticles enable precise drug delivery to target cells, controlled release, and targeted distribution through surface modification with ligands. They are currently being developed as drug delivery systems for various substances and vaccines on the market, including AmBisome, DepoCyt, Doxil, Inflexal, Myocet, Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, and Moderna mRNA vaccines. 1,2 Nanoparticles have garnered significant attention in drug delivery due to their unique properties, such as a high surface area-to-volume ratio, the ability to traverse biological barriers, and the capacity to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs. Various types of nanoparticles, including polymeric, inorganic, and lipid-based nanoparticles, have been developed for drug delivery applications. 3 ipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) constitute a subclass of nanoparticles composed primarily of lipids, which have garnered significant attention in recent years. LNPs present several advantages over alternative nanoparticle systems, including high stability, biocompatibility, and the capability to target specific cells or tissues. This targeted approach enhances drug efficacy while mitigating side effects. Moreover, the customization of LNPs through surface modification with targeting ligands further refines their specificity toward desired cells or tissues, thus optimizing drug delivery efficiency. Structurally, LNPs typically comprise a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core, forming a versatile platform for drug encapsulation. This architecture facilitates the encapsulation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs within the lipid bilayer or aqueous core, respectively, enabling the simultaneous delivery of multiple therapeutic agents. Moreover, the lipid bilayer contributes to the stability of LNPs in biological environments, shielding encapsulated drugs from degradation and extending their circulation time in the bloodstream. 3,4 LNPs can be synthesized using various techniques, such as sonication, 5 microfluidics, 6 and extrusion. 7",

Thomson, Alexandra Birkenshaw, B. Leavitt, C. J. Ross\n## Abstract\nGene editing mediated by CRISPR/Cas9 systems is due to become a beneficial therapeutic option for treating genetic diseases and some cancers. However, there are challenges in delivering CRISPR components which necessitate sophisticated delivery systems for safe and effective genome editing. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have become an attractive nonviral delivery platform for CRISPR-mediated genome editing due to their low immunogenicity and application flexibility. In this review, we provide a background of CRISPR-mediated gene therapy, as well as LNPs and their applicable characteristics for delivering CRISPR components. We then highlight the challenges of CRISPR delivery, which have driven the significant development of new, safe, and optimized LNP formulations in the past decade. Finally, we discuss considerations for using LNPs to deliver CRISPR and future perspectives on clinical translation of LNP-CRISPR gene editing.\n## \u25a0 INTRODUCTION\nLipid-based nanoparticles contain lipid moieties in their structures and have tremendous biomedical potential in drug delivery and gene therapy. 15 Lipid-based nanoparticles are typically nanospheres that encapsulate therapeutic compounds such as nucleic acids or proteins. 16 Compared to viral and other nonviral nanoparticle systems, lipid-based nanoparticles offer advantages including ease of formulation, spontaneous selfassembly, high potency, high biocompatibility, larger payload capacity, and versatility in design for specific applications. 16 NPs are currently one of the most popular and sophisticated nonviral delivery platforms.

By using the body\u2019s own immune system, it is possible not only to specifically target and eliminate cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed but also to elicit long-term protective response. Despite the promise, current immunotherapy is limited and fails in addressing all tumor types. This is probably due to the fact that a single treatment strategy is not sufficient in overcoming the complex antitumor immunity. The use of nanoparticle-based system for immunotherapy is a promising strategy that can simultaneously target multiple pathways with the same kinetics to enhance antitumor response. Here, we will highlight the recent advances in the field of cancer immunotherapy that utilize lipid-based nanoparticles as delivery vehicles and address the ongoing challenges and potential opportunities.",

A variety of delivery platform vehicles are under development to target immune cells, such as antibodies (16), polymers (17), aptamers (18), and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (19,20). In comparison to other NPs, LNPs have attractive biological properties, which include general biocompatibility, biodegradability, and the ability to entrap both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs (15,21). Multiple properties of LNPs can be altered via different lipid composition and ratios or by surface chemistry, including their size, charge, and surface functionality (22). LNPs serve as carriers for a variety of therapeutic molecules: from nucleic acid to proteins, small molecules and chemotherapy drugs, and combinations of the aforementioned agents (22)(23)(24). LNPs shelter their cargo from clearance in the surrounding biological milieu, increasing the half-life in circulation, minimizing systemic toxicity, and hence enabling a wide therapeutic window (15,22,25). In addition, LNPs can promote delivery of their cargo directly to specific immune cell, such as APC or T-lymphocytes (20,26,27). Here, we review the latest developments in nanoparticle-based cancer immunotherapy, centering on LNPs.",

Hazan-Halevy, Dalit Landesman-Milo, Brandon D. Ng, D. Peer\n## Abstract\nImmunotherapy has a great potential in advancing cancer treatment, especially in light of recent discoveries and therapeutic interventions that lead to complete response in specific subgroups of melanoma patients. By using the body\u2019s own immune system, it is possible not only to specifically target and eliminate cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed but also to elicit long-term protective response. Despite the promise, current immunotherapy is limited and fails in addressing all tumor types. This is probably due to the fact that a single treatment strategy is not sufficient in overcoming the complex antitumor immunity. The use of nanoparticle-based system for immunotherapy is a promising strategy that can simultaneously target multiple pathways with the same kinetics to enhance antitumor response. Here, we will highlight the recent advances in the field of cancer immunotherapy that utilize lipid-based nanoparticles as delivery vehicles and address the ongoing challenges and potential opportunities.\n## Nanotechnology-Based therapies\nNanotechnology affords a unique opportunity to deliver therapeutic molecules to specific cells and simultaneously attack several biological avenues promoting tumor eradication (15). A variety of delivery platform vehicles are under development to target immune cells, such as antibodies (16), polymers (17), aptamers (18), and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (19,20). In comparison to other NPs, LNPs have attractive biological properties, which include general biocompatibility, biodegradability, and the ability to entrap both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs (15,21). Multiple properties of LNPs can be altered via different lipid composition and ratios or by surface chemistry, including their size, charge, and surface functionality (22). LNPs serve as carriers for a variety of therapeutic molecules: from nucleic acid to proteins, small molecules and chemotherapy drugs, and combinations of the aforementioned agents (22)(23)(24). LNPs shelter their cargo from clearance in the surrounding biological milieu, increasing the half-life in circulation, minimizing systemic toxicity, and hence enabling a wide therapeutic window (15,22,25). In addition, LNPs can promote delivery of their cargo directly to specific immune cell, such as APC or T-lymphocytes (20,26,27). Here, we review the latest developments in nanoparticle-based cancer immunotherapy, centering on LNPs.",

To overcome these issues, the use of microfluidic techniques in the production of LBNPs has sharply increased over the past two years. Microfluidics overcomes many of the pitfalls seen with conventional production methods, leading to reproducible LBNPs at lower costs and higher yields. In this review, the use of microfluidics in the preparation of various types of LBNPs, including liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, and solid lipid nanoparticles for the delivery of small molecules, oligonucleotides, and peptide/protein drugs is summarized.

Vogelaar, Samantha Marcotte, Jiaqi Cheng, Benazir Oluoch, J. Zaro\n## Abstract\nLipid-based nanoparticles (LBNPs) are an important tool for the delivery of a diverse set of drug cargoes, including small molecules, oligonucleotides, and proteins and peptides. Despite their development over the past several decades, this technology is still hindered by issues with the manufacturing processes leading to high polydispersity, batch-to-batch and operator-dependent variability, and limits to the production volumes. To overcome these issues, the use of microfluidic techniques in the production of LBNPs has sharply increased over the past two years. Microfluidics overcomes many of the pitfalls seen with conventional production methods, leading to reproducible LBNPs at lower costs and higher yields. In this review, the use of microfluidics in the preparation of various types of LBNPs, including liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, and solid lipid nanoparticles for the delivery of small molecules, oligonucleotides, and peptide/protein drugs is summarized. Various microfluidic parameters, as well as their effects on the physicochemical properties of LBNPs, are also discussed.\n## Introduction\nLipid-based nanoparticles (LBNPs), defined as 10-1000 nm nanoparticles composed of lipids as the main structural component, are versatile drug delivery systems (DDSs) as they can encapsulate a variety of drug cargos and selectively target cell/tissues by modification of the outer components.These types of nanosystems, including lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), have the advantages of protecting the cargo from degradation, allowing lower doses/toxic side effects, enhancing the solubility and therefore bioavailability of hydrophobic molecules, and being biocompatible/biodegradable [1].Although LNPs were recently brought into the spotlight worldwide due to the emergence of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, lipid-based delivery systems have been studied since the 1960s with the discovery of liposomes.Liposomes are the earliest form of LBNPs and are composed of selfformed closed lipid bilayer vesicles with an aqueous core [2].This technology has led to the development of many Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, starting with Doxil \u00ae in 1995.Due to the complicated production methods, low encapsulation efficiency, and limitations in the physicochemical properties of the drugs that could be incorporated, other types of lipid-based carriers were developed.",

Currently, they are in the frontline of the pandemic fight as vaccine formulations and therapeutic products. However, even though they are so well-studied, new materials and new modifications arise every day that can improve their properties. Their dynamic nature, especially the liquid crystal state of membranes, is under constant investigation and it is that which many times leads to their complex biological behavior. In addition, newly discovered biomaterials and nanoparticles that possess promising effects and functionalities, but also toxicity and/or poor pharmacokinetics, can be combined with LNPs to ameliorate their properties. As a result, many promising theranostic applications have emerged during the past decade, proving the huge potential of LNPs in the field. In the present review, we summarize some of the most prominent classes of LNPs for nanotheranostic purposes, and present state-of-the-art research examples, with emphasis on the utilized biomaterials and the functionality that they confer to the resultant supramolecular nanosystems, in relation to diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Although there has been unprecedented progress in theranostics, the translational gap between the bench and the clinic is undeniable. This issue must be addressed by experts in a coordinated way, in order to fully exploit these nanomedicines for the benefit of the society.",

Their main advantages over other classes include biocompatibility, biodegradability, safety, as well as incorporation and codelivery of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules, with the latter enabling the theranostic concept and addressing the issue of real-time interaction between diagnosis and therapy. Liposomes, niosomes, transfersomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), lipid nanocapsules (LNCs), core-shell lipid nanoparticles (CLNs), lipid-based micelles and hybrid systems are representatives of this class of nanoparticles (Figure 1) [7,8]. These nanosystems are considered bioinspired because they mimic natural and physiological components and hold great promise as delivery vehicles for nanotheranostic applications [9]. \n\nThe main ingredients of LNPs are lipids and surfactants, including phospholipids, cholesterol, solid and liquid lipids (fats and oils), as well as non-ionic and other surfactants [10]. In many of these cases, the components self-assemble into the liquid crystalline phase, which presents complex dynamics and metastable phases that are critical to the functionality of the systems [11,12]. LNPs can also contain lipids and materials with distinct structures and physicochemical characteristics, which lead to specific self-assembly, properties and biomedical applications (Table 1). The most recent well-known example is that of ionizable cationic lipids. These lipids have a pK a below 6.5 and during their development, they are charged, while they are non-charged in physiological pH. This class of lipids has been fully exploited for the development of some the recent COVID-19 vaccines. When mixed with genetic material, such as siRNA or mRNA, they produce complexes with internal hydrophobic and hydrophilic compartments.",

Naziris, C. Demetzos\n## Abstract\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the first approved nanomedicines and the most well-studied class of nanocarriers for drug delivery. Currently, they are in the frontline of the pandemic fight as vaccine formulations and therapeutic products. However, even though they are so well-studied, new materials and new modifications arise every day that can improve their properties. Their dynamic nature, especially the liquid crystal state of membranes, is under constant investigation and it is that which many times leads to their complex biological behavior. In addition, newly discovered biomaterials and nanoparticles that possess promising effects and functionalities, but also toxicity and/or poor pharmacokinetics, can be combined with LNPs to ameliorate their properties. As a result, many promising theranostic applications have emerged during the past decade, proving the huge potential of LNPs in the field. In the present review, we summarize some of the most prominent classes of LNPs for nanotheranostic purposes, and present state-of-the-art research examples, with emphasis on the utilized biomaterials and the functionality that they confer to the resultant supramolecular nanosystems, in relation to diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Although there has been unprecedented progress in theranostics, the translational gap between the bench and the clinic is undeniable. This issue must be addressed by experts in a coordinated way, in order to fully exploit these nanomedicines for the benefit of the society.\n## Lipid Nanoparticles and Mixed Nanosystems\nLNPs are one major category of nanocarriers that are utilized as delivery systems of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. Their main advantages over other classes include biocompatibility, biodegradability, safety, as well as incorporation and codelivery of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules, with the latter enabling the theranostic concept and addressing the issue of real-time interaction between diagnosis and therapy. Liposomes, niosomes, transfersomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), lipid nanocapsules (LNCs), core-shell lipid nanoparticles (CLNs), lipid-based micelles and hybrid systems are representatives of this class of nanoparticles (Figure 1) [7,8]. These nanosystems are considered bioinspired because they mimic natural and physiological components and hold great promise as delivery vehicles for nanotheranostic applications [9]. \n\nThe main ingredients of LNPs are lipids and surfactants, including phospholipids, cholesterol, solid and liquid lipids (fats and oils), as well as non-ionic and other surfactants [10]. In many of these cases, the components self-assemble into the liquid crystalline phase, which presents complex dynamics and metastable phases that are critical to the functionality of the systems [11,12]. LNPs can also contain lipids and materials with distinct structures and physicochemical characteristics, which lead to specific self-assembly, properties and biomedical applications (Table 1). The most recent well-known example is that of ionizable cationic lipids. These lipids have a pK a below 6.5 and during their development, they are charged, while they are non-charged in physiological pH. This class of lipids has been fully exploited for the development of some the recent COVID-19 vaccines. When mixed with genetic material, such as siRNA or mRNA, they produce complexes with internal hydrophobic and hydrophilic compartments.",

This manuscript details the design and benefits of various LNP systems, including solid lipid\u2013polymer hybrids, which offer controlled release and enhanced drug encapsulation. Despite achievements in reducing tumor size and enhancing survival, challenges such as manufacturing complexity, biocompatibility, and variable clinical outcomes persist. Future directions are aimed at refining targeting capabilities, expanding combinatorial therapies, and integrating advanced manufacturing techniques to tailor treatments to individual patient profiles, thus promising to transform lung cancer therapy through interdisciplinary collaboration and regulatory innovation.",

Gill, Luigi X Cubeddu\n## Abstract\nThis manuscript explores the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in addressing the pivotal challenges of lung cancer treatment, including drug delivery inefficacy and multi-drug resistance. LNPs have significantly advanced targeted therapy by improving the precision and reducing the systemic toxicity of chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel. This manuscript details the design and benefits of various LNP systems, including solid lipid\u2013polymer hybrids, which offer controlled release and enhanced drug encapsulation. Despite achievements in reducing tumor size and enhancing survival, challenges such as manufacturing complexity, biocompatibility, and variable clinical outcomes persist. Future directions are aimed at refining targeting capabilities, expanding combinatorial therapies, and integrating advanced manufacturing techniques to tailor treatments to individual patient profiles, thus promising to transform lung cancer therapy through interdisciplinary collaboration and regulatory innovation.\n## Collective Achievements\nEnhanced Drug Delivery and Efficacy: LNPs have significantly improved the delivery and efficacy of chemotherapy drugs, achieving high encapsulation efficiency and targeted release.Notable formulations include multi-trigger responsive nanovesicles encapsulating paclitaxel [15], and hybrid nanoparticles [16,17,19,[21][22][23].These LNPs have been tailored for targeted delivery, significantly reducing tumor size and enhancing survival rates.\n\nTargeted Drug Delivery: LNPs have demonstrated success in targeted delivery to lung cancer cells, enhancing therapeutic effectiveness.Key examples include mannosylated, chitosan-coated, and transferrin-conjugated systems [24,26,30].\n\nOvercoming Drug Resistance: LNPs such as paclitaxel-encapsulated PLGA-lipid hybrids and other innovative designs have targeted specific cancer cell characteristics and mechanisms, enhancing antitumor ability and overcoming resistance [21, 27,35,37,48,50,52,71].",

Compared to liposomes, LNPs provide higher drug loading capacity and better physical stability due to their solid or semi-solid lipid cores, which allow drugs to be more effectively embedded, enhancing drug stability and loading efficiency (Estap\u00e9 Senti et al., 2024). Additionally, the surface of LNPs can be modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or other hydrophobic molecules to extend their circulation time in the blood and reduce the likelihood of clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (Huang et al., 2023). LNPs also offer significant advantages in targeted delivery and localized release. By modifying the surface with targeting ligands, LNPs can specifically target tumor cells or particular molecules within the tumor microenvironment, enabling precise drug delivery. In the context of mRNA vaccine delivery, LNPs protect mRNA from degradation by nucleases within the body and facilitate its effective entry into target cells (Cheng et al., 2020;Kon et al., 2023).

On this basis, mRNA technology can take advantage of the body\u2019s own translation system to express proteins with multiple functions for the treatment of various diseases. Due to the advancement of mRNA synthesis and purification, modification and sequence optimization technologies, and the emerging lipid nanomaterials and other delivery systems, mRNA therapeutic regimens are becoming clinically feasible and exhibit significant reliability in mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and controlled immunogenicity. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), currently the leading non-viral delivery vehicles, have made many exciting advances in clinical translation as part of the COVID-19 vaccines and therefore have the potential to accelerate the clinical translation of gene drugs. Additionally, due to their small size, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, LNPs can effectively deliver nucleic acids into cells, which is particularly important for the current mRNA regimens. Therefore, the cutting-edge LNP@mRNA regimens hold great promise for cancer vaccines, infectious disease prevention, protein replacement therapy, gene editing, and rare disease treatment. To shed more lights on LNP@mRNA, this paper mainly discusses the rational of choosing LNPs as the non-viral vectors to deliver mRNA, the general rules for mRNA optimization and LNP preparation, and the various parameters affecting the delivery efficiency of LNP@mRNA, and finally summarizes the current research status as well as the current challenges. The latest research progress of LNPs in the treatment of other diseases such as oncological, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases is also given.

                    "text": "delivery of nucleic acids into cells makes them superior to other carriers. Since biological membranes and nucleic acids are negatively charged, it is difficult to deliver mRNA across this barrier. LNPs offer an ideal platform for delivering nucleic acid therapies as the ionizable lipids are nearneutrally charged at physiological pH. However, in acidic endosomal compartments (pH-4.5), they become ionized, promoting endosomal escape for effective intracellular delivery [46,47]. Hence, LNPs achieve high encapsulation rate for nucleic acids with improved transfection efficiency. Furthermore, LNPs have relatively low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity compared to liposomes, thus favoring delivery of nucleic acid based therapeutics [48][49][50].\n\nLipids used in formulating these nanoparticles are biocompatible and are well endured by fatty acids, triglycerides, waxes and steroids. In addition, selecting a good combination of emulsifiers could  make the formulation more stable with higher efficiency [52]. In terms of industrial scale up, LNPs offer multiple advantages compared with other carrier systems, such as large scale production using microfluidics or T-junction mixing, stability, and low cost of raw materials [52][53][54]. The most significant parameters in LNPs characterization are particle size, their size distribution, degree of polymorphism, zeta potential, crystallinity, drug loading, drug release and entrapment efficiency [55]. Drug release from LNPs mostly relies on the type of matrix used and the position of drug in the matrix formulation. The ingredients of lipid matrix, manufacturing parameters and surfactant concentrations, such as rate of stirring, temperature etc. can modulate the drug release profile [56]. In a nutshell, the most fundamental rationale of using LNPs, as an alternative to polymeric nanoparticles, is the simplicity of largescale manufacturing and their low toxicity [57,58].",

Allawadhi, Isha Khurana, Sachin Allwadhi, R. Weiskirchen, A. Banothu, Deepak Chhabra, Kamaldeep Joshi, K. Bharani\n## Abstract\nNone\n## The focus on delivery: key advantages of lipid nanoparticles\ndelivery of nucleic acids into cells makes them superior to other carriers. Since biological membranes and nucleic acids are negatively charged, it is difficult to deliver mRNA across this barrier. LNPs offer an ideal platform for delivering nucleic acid therapies as the ionizable lipids are nearneutrally charged at physiological pH. However, in acidic endosomal compartments (pH-4.5), they become ionized, promoting endosomal escape for effective intracellular delivery [46,47]. Hence, LNPs achieve high encapsulation rate for nucleic acids with improved transfection efficiency. Furthermore, LNPs have relatively low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity compared to liposomes, thus favoring delivery of nucleic acid based therapeutics [48][49][50].\n\nLipids used in formulating these nanoparticles are biocompatible and are well endured by fatty acids, triglycerides, waxes and steroids. In addition, selecting a good combination of emulsifiers could  make the formulation more stable with higher efficiency [52]. In terms of industrial scale up, LNPs offer multiple advantages compared with other carrier systems, such as large scale production using microfluidics or T-junction mixing, stability, and low cost of raw materials [52][53][54]. The most significant parameters in LNPs characterization are particle size, their size distribution, degree of polymorphism, zeta potential, crystallinity, drug loading, drug release and entrapment efficiency [55]. Drug release from LNPs mostly relies on the type of matrix used and the position of drug in the matrix formulation. The ingredients of lipid matrix, manufacturing parameters and surfactant concentrations, such as rate of stirring, temperature etc. can modulate the drug release profile [56]. In a nutshell, the most fundamental rationale of using LNPs, as an alternative to polymeric nanoparticles, is the simplicity of largescale manufacturing and their low toxicity [57,58].",

A few decades ago, small molecule drugs were the predominant therapeutic agents and their delivery depended heavily on the physicochemical properties of their own structure. In contrast, with the development of pharmaceutical sciences, the content of drugs has been extended to nucleic acids [1], peptides [2], proteins [3], and even cells [4], which are difficult to apply directly in clinical therapy due to the instability of their physicochemical properties. In this context, the role of DDS is increasingly significant, not only limited to improving the solubility of small molecule drugs but also in controlling the release behavior [5], maintaining the activity of drugs [6], overcoming biological barriers [7], and improving pharmacokinetics [8]. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is currently the most widely used and mature DDS in clinical practice. Whether it is more than twenty small molecule DDS formulations that have been marketed or the recent mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, LNP plays a key role in the development of advanced pharmaceuticals [9]. The concept of LNP can be divided into general LNP and special LNP. General LNP is a new DDS that use biocompatible phospholipid materials as carriers to wrap bioactive substances in nuclei or attach them to the surface of nanoparticles. General LNP includes solid lipid nanoparticles, niosomes, transfersomes, nanostructured lipid carriers, micelles, etc., of which liposome is the most representative [10]. And special LNP is described in more articles now as a specific type of particle used to deliver nucleic acids with the development of COVID-19 vaccines [10,11]. Special LNP is a composite vesicular structure composed of four components: PEGylated lipids, ionizable lipids, structural phospholipids, and cholesterol. Here, we refer to LNPs, collectively, as lipid-based nanoparticles to avoid confusion.",

Here, we classify signal sources into physical and physiological stimulation according to their origin. The physical signals include temperature, ultrasound, and electromagnetic wave, while physiological signals involve pH, redox condition, and associated proteins. We first summarize external physical response from three main points about efficiency, particle state, and on-demand release. Afterwards, we describe how to design drug delivery using the physiological environment in vivo and present different current application methods. Lastly, we draw a vision of possible future development.\n## Introduction\nDrug delivery system (DDS) is a progressive pharmaceutical formulation that delivers drugs to specific sites and release in a desired manner and rate. A few decades ago, small molecule drugs were the predominant therapeutic agents and their delivery depended heavily on the physicochemical properties of their own structure. In contrast, with the development of pharmaceutical sciences, the content of drugs has been extended to nucleic acids [1], peptides [2], proteins [3], and even cells [4], which are difficult to apply directly in clinical therapy due to the instability of their physicochemical properties. In this context, the role of DDS is increasingly significant, not only limited to improving the solubility of small molecule drugs but also in controlling the release behavior [5], maintaining the activity of drugs [6], overcoming biological barriers [7], and improving pharmacokinetics [8]. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is currently the most widely used and mature DDS in clinical practice. Whether it is more than twenty small molecule DDS formulations that have been marketed or the recent mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, LNP plays a key role in the development of advanced pharmaceuticals [9]. The concept of LNP can be divided into general LNP and special LNP. General LNP is a new DDS that use biocompatible phospholipid materials as carriers to wrap bioactive substances in nuclei or attach them to the surface of nanoparticles. General LNP includes solid lipid nanoparticles, niosomes, transfersomes, nanostructured lipid carriers, micelles, etc., of which liposome is the most representative [10]. And special LNP is described in more articles now as a specific type of particle used to deliver nucleic acids with the development of COVID-19 vaccines [10,11]. Special LNP is a composite vesicular structure composed of four components: PEGylated lipids, ionizable lipids, structural phospholipids, and cholesterol. Here, we refer to LNPs, collectively, as lipid-based nanoparticles to avoid confusion.",

            "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis, present ongoing challenges in terms of effective treatment and management. These diseases are characterized by persistent inflammation in the airways, leading to structural changes and compromised lung function. There are several treatments available for them, such as bronchodilators, immunomodulators, and oxygen therapy. However, there are still some shortcomings in the effectiveness and side effects of drugs. To achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes while minimizing systemic side effects, targeted therapies and precise drug delivery systems are crucial to the management of these diseases. This comprehensive review focuses on the role of drug delivery systems in chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases, particularly nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), novel biologicals, gene therapy, and personalized medicine. By examining the latest advancements and strategies in these areas, we aim to provide a thorough understanding of the current landscape and future prospects for improving treatment outcomes in these challenging conditions.",

                    "text": "The application of nanotechnology continues to provide effective strategies in treating various chronic diseases and improving treatment outcomes. Using nanocarrier systems such as liposomes, micelles, and nanoparticles for pulmonary drug delivery has been proven to be a promising noninvasive treatment strategy for achieving drug deposition and controlled release in the lungs [10] (Figure 1). These systems involve the use of engineered particles with dimensions on the nanometer scale to deliver drugs directly to target cells in the lungs [21]. Nanoparticles have several advantages over conventional drug delivery methods, including improved bioavailability, enhanced targeting, and reduced toxicity [22,23]. Liposomes are spherical vesicles composed of lipid bilayers that can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs [24]. The size, surface charge, and lipid composition of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be tailored to enhance drug stability, prolong circulation time, and improve biocompatibility [25]. Furthermore, conjugating small-molecule ligands, peptides [26], or monoclonal antibodies [27] to the surface of an LNP can endow it with targeting ability. For example, folate receptors are often found to be overexpressed on macrophages, which makes folate-coupled LNP a great option for delivering antiinflammatory drugs [28]. There are many factors that can affect the release of cargo carried by LNPs, including temperature, changes in pH values, enzymes, light, etc. Among them, the mechanism of pH change is the most studied, and can cause LNPs to undergo phase transition and achieve higher membrane permeability [29]. \n\nIn addition to LNPs, there are also some other nanoparticles that have their own characteristics (Table 1). Micelles are another kind of nanoparticle consisting of amphiphilic molecules that form a core-shell structure [30]. Their great solubility allows them to easily penetrate the increased alveolar fluid barrier present in chronic inflammatory lung diseases.",

Shao, D. He\n## Abstract\nChronic inflammatory respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis, present ongoing challenges in terms of effective treatment and management. These diseases are characterized by persistent inflammation in the airways, leading to structural changes and compromised lung function. There are several treatments available for them, such as bronchodilators, immunomodulators, and oxygen therapy. However, there are still some shortcomings in the effectiveness and side effects of drugs. To achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes while minimizing systemic side effects, targeted therapies and precise drug delivery systems are crucial to the management of these diseases. This comprehensive review focuses on the role of drug delivery systems in chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases, particularly nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), novel biologicals, gene therapy, and personalized medicine. By examining the latest advancements and strategies in these areas, we aim to provide a thorough understanding of the current landscape and future prospects for improving treatment outcomes in these challenging conditions.\n## Nanoparticle-Based Drug Delivery Systems\nThe application of nanotechnology continues to provide effective strategies in treating various chronic diseases and improving treatment outcomes. Using nanocarrier systems such as liposomes, micelles, and nanoparticles for pulmonary drug delivery has been proven to be a promising noninvasive treatment strategy for achieving drug deposition and controlled release in the lungs [10] (Figure 1). These systems involve the use of engineered particles with dimensions on the nanometer scale to deliver drugs directly to target cells in the lungs [21]. Nanoparticles have several advantages over conventional drug delivery methods, including improved bioavailability, enhanced targeting, and reduced toxicity [22,23]. Liposomes are spherical vesicles composed of lipid bilayers that can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs [24]. The size, surface charge, and lipid composition of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be tailored to enhance drug stability, prolong circulation time, and improve biocompatibility [25]. Furthermore, conjugating small-molecule ligands, peptides [26], or monoclonal antibodies [27] to the surface of an LNP can endow it with targeting ability. For example, folate receptors are often found to be overexpressed on macrophages, which makes folate-coupled LNP a great option for delivering antiinflammatory drugs [28]. There are many factors that can affect the release of cargo carried by LNPs, including temperature, changes in pH values, enzymes, light, etc. Among them, the mechanism of pH change is the most studied, and can cause LNPs to undergo phase transition and achieve higher membrane permeability [29]. \n\nIn addition to LNPs, there are also some other nanoparticles that have their own characteristics (Table 1). Micelles are another kind of nanoparticle consisting of amphiphilic molecules that form a core-shell structure [30]. Their great solubility allows them to easily penetrate the increased alveolar fluid barrier present in chronic inflammatory lung diseases.",

Although research on nanoparticles for brain cancer treatment is still in its early stages, these systems hold great potential to revolutionize drug delivery. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common and lethal brain tumors, and its heterogeneous and aggressive nature complicates current treatments, which primarily rely on surgery. One of the significant obstacles to effective treatment is the poor penetration of drugs across the BBB. Moreover, GBM is often referred to as a \u201ccold\u201d tumor, characterized by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and minimal immune cell infiltration, which limits the effectiveness of immunotherapies. Therefore, developing novel, more effective treatments is critical to improving the survival rate of GBM patients. Current strategies for enhancing treatment outcomes focus on the controlled, targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to GBM cells across the BBB using nanoparticles. These therapies must be designed to engage specialized transport systems, allowing for efficient BBB penetration, improved therapeutic efficacy, and reduced systemic toxicity and drug degradation.

Research indicates that statins can inhibit critical processes in cancer development, such as apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Despite their promising anti-cancer effects, the clinical application of statins in oncology has been hampered by their inherent low solubility and bioavailability. These pharmacokinetic challenges can be effectively addressed through the use of nano-based drug delivery systems. Nano-formulations enhance the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of statins by improving their solubility, stability, and targeting ability, thus maximizing their concentration within the tumor microenvironment and minimizing systemic side effects. This review delves into the potential of nanoparticles as carriers for statins in cancer therapy. It explores the mechanisms by which statins exert their anti-cancer effects, such as through the inhibition of the mevalonate pathway, modulation of immune responses, and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, the review examines the development of various statin-loaded nano-formulations, highlighting their advantages over conventional formulations. The novelty of this review lies in its focus on recent advancements in nanoformulations that enhance statin delivery to the tumor microenvironment. By discussing the current advancements and prospects of statin nano-formulations, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these innovative strategies can improve cancer treatment outcomes and enhance the quality of life for patients.

Research indicates that statins can inhibit critical processes in cancer development, such as apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Despite their promising anti-cancer effects, the clinical application of statins in oncology has been hampered by their inherent low solubility and bioavailability. These pharmacokinetic challenges can be effectively addressed through the use of nano-based drug delivery systems. Nano-formulations enhance the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of statins by improving their solubility, stability, and targeting ability, thus maximizing their concentration within the tumor microenvironment and minimizing systemic side effects. This review delves into the potential of nanoparticles as carriers for statins in cancer therapy. It explores the mechanisms by which statins exert their anti-cancer effects, such as through the inhibition of the mevalonate pathway, modulation of immune responses, and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, the review examines the development of various statin-loaded nano-formulations, highlighting their advantages over conventional formulations. The novelty of this review lies in its focus on recent advancements in nanoformulations that enhance statin delivery to the tumor microenvironment. By discussing the current advancements and prospects of statin nano-formulations, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these innovative strategies can improve cancer treatment outcomes and enhance the quality of life for patients. The integration of nanotechnology with statin therapy offers a novel approach to overcoming existing therapeutic limitations and paving the way for more effective and safer cancer treatments.\n## Lipid-based nanoparticles\nOthers. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and all lipid-based nanoparticles in combination with new technologies or other nanoparticles are also included in the category of lipid-based nanoparticles. \n\nLipid-based nanoparticles present several advantages in drug delivery, primarily due to their biodegradable and nontoxic composition, as they are constructed from physiological lipids that reduce systemic toxicity and promote safe administration. These nanoparticles enable controlled drug release, making them particularly suitable for long-term cancer treatment, as they provide sustained therapeutic effects. In addition, they exhibit high physical stability, minimizing the risk of drug leakage during both storage and circulation, which represents an improvement over liposomal systems. Their size and surface properties also contribute to enhanced tumor accumulation through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Furthermore, lipid-based nanoparticles protect sensitive molecules, such as siRNA or DNA, from enzymatic degradation, which is essential for the effective delivery of genetic therapies. 121,122 owever, lipid-based nanoparticles also have limitations. Their capacity to load hydrophilic drugs is restricted, as they are more efficient in encapsulating hydrophobic compounds. The formulation process can be technically challenging, requiring meticulous control over parameters such as particle size and lipid composition to ensure optimal efficacy. Additionally, the surfactants used to stabilize these nanoparticles may cause irritation or toxicity at high concentrations, posing a potential limitation to their clinical application. 122 n cancer therapy, lipid-based nanoparticles are highly effective for delivering RNA-based therapeutics, including siRNA and mRNA, which play a critical role in targeting oncogenes and modulating immune responses. These nanoparticles are also advantageous for targeted chemotherapy, as they can be functionalized to achieve active targeting of tumor cells, thereby increasing the precision of drug delivery.",

            "abstract": "Localization in the central nervous system, diffuse growth, the presence of stem cells, and numerous resistance mechanisms, all make glioblastoma (GBM) an incurable tumor. The standard treatment of GBM consisting of surgery; radio- and chemotherapy with temozolomide provides insufficient therapeutic benefit and needs to be updated with effective modern solutions. One of the most promising and intensively explored therapeutic approaches against GBM is the use of nanotherapy. The first, and so far only, nanoparticle-based therapy approved for GBM treatment is NanoThermTM. It is based on iron oxide nanoparticles and the thermal ablation of the tumor with a magnetic field. Numerous other types of nanotherapies are being evaluated, including polymer and lipid-based nanoformulations, nanodiscs, dendrimers, and metallic, silica, or bioderived nanoparticles, among others. The advantages of these nanoscale drug carriers include improved penetration across the blood\u2013brain barrier, targeted drug delivery, biocompatibility, and lower systemic toxicity, while major problems with their implementation involve scaling up their production and high costs. Nevertheless, taking all the impressive benefits of nanotherapies into consideration, it seems obvious that the combined effort of the scientific world will need to be taken to tackle these challenges and implement these novel therapies into clinics, giving hope that the battle against GBM can finally be won.",

Majchrzak-Celi\u0144ska\n## Abstract\nLocalization in the central nervous system, diffuse growth, the presence of stem cells, and numerous resistance mechanisms, all make glioblastoma (GBM) an incurable tumor. The standard treatment of GBM consisting of surgery; radio- and chemotherapy with temozolomide provides insufficient therapeutic benefit and needs to be updated with effective modern solutions. One of the most promising and intensively explored therapeutic approaches against GBM is the use of nanotherapy. The first, and so far only, nanoparticle-based therapy approved for GBM treatment is NanoThermTM. It is based on iron oxide nanoparticles and the thermal ablation of the tumor with a magnetic field. Numerous other types of nanotherapies are being evaluated, including polymer and lipid-based nanoformulations, nanodiscs, dendrimers, and metallic, silica, or bioderived nanoparticles, among others. The advantages of these nanoscale drug carriers include improved penetration across the blood\u2013brain barrier, targeted drug delivery, biocompatibility, and lower systemic toxicity, while major problems with their implementation involve scaling up their production and high costs. Nevertheless, taking all the impressive benefits of nanotherapies into consideration, it seems obvious that the combined effort of the scientific world will need to be taken to tackle these challenges and implement these novel therapies into clinics, giving hope that the battle against GBM can finally be won.\n## Lipid-Based Nanocarriers\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs), including solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), have been effectively utilized in clinical trials to deliver both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs. These nanoparticles, capable of encapsulating therapeutic agents in aqueous or lipid-based cores, improve drug stability, reduce side effects, and target specific cells, such as cancer cells [128]. These nanocarriers have been well known for many years and are primarily composed of natural materials, making them biocompatible, biodegradable, and safe for therapeutic use [129]. They are particularly valuable in cancer therapy due to their ability to cross the BBB, a critical feature for treating brain tumors like GBM [62,130]. In addition to GBM, LNPs are also promising for drug delivery and imaging in neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease [131][132][133], Alzheimer's disease [134], and strokes [135,136]. Their structure enables drug-controlled release, reducing toxicity and enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. LNPs provide a stable delivery platform for targeted cancer therapy, improving the precision and effectiveness of drug delivery [137]. The primary limitation of LNPs is their tendency to fuse, especially when the average size of the synthesized formulation is below 100 nm. This fusion leads to the leakage of encapsulated substances from the lipid vesicles and enhances dispersibility. However, this issue can be addressed by applying a PEG coating to the surface of the lipid nanoparticles [138]. Ionic liquids (ILs), such as choline-2-hexenoic acid, can further enhance tissue-specific drug delivery by facilitating LNP transport across the BBB using intravenous delivery. ILs help modulate the interaction of LNPs with serum proteins, potentially increasing drug accumulation at the BBB through red blood cell Not only have TMZ or bortezomib been tested in combination with PNPs, but also other cytostatic drugs are being evaluated in this context.\n...\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs), including solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), have been effectively utilized in clinical trials to deliver both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs.

Originally focused on liver targets, LNPs have demonstrated high encapsulation efficiencies for macromolecules such as siRNA and mRNA [140][141][142] and are now being explored for CNS applications.",

Traditional diagnosis methods often detect cancer at a considerably critical stage and the conventional methods of treatment like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy have several limitations, multidrug resistance, cytotoxicity, and lack of specificity are a few examples. These pose substantial challenge for effective and favourable cancer treatment. The advent of nanotechnology has revolutionized the face of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Nanoparticles, which have a size range of 1\u2013100 nm, are biocompatible and have special optical, magnetic, and electrical capabilities, less toxic, more stable, exhibit permeability and retention effect, and are used for precise targeting. There are several classes of nanoparticles each having their own sets of unique properties. NPs have played an important role in the drug delivery system, overcoming the multi-drug resistance, reducing the side-effects as seen in conventional therapeutic methods and hence able to solve the limitations of conventional methods of diagnosis and treatment. This review discusses the four major classes of nanoparticles (Lipid based NPs, Carbon NPs and Metallic NPs and Polymeric NPs): their discovery and introduction in medical field, unique properties and characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, sub-categories and characteristics of these categories, major area of application in Cancer diagnosis and treatment, and latest methodologies where these are used in cancer treatment.",

This biocompatibility minimizes the risk of adverse immune reactions and toxicity, making them ideal for clinical applications. \n\nVersatility in drug delivery: LNPs can encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic agents, including chemotherapeutics, nucleic acids (such as siRNA and mRNA), and proteins. This versatility allows for the targeted delivery of these agents to cancer cells, improving therapeutic outcomes while reducing systemic side effects. \n\nEnhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect: LNPs benefit from the EPR effect, which facilitates their accumulation in tumor tissues due to the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage of tumours. This property enhances the concentration of therapeutic agents at the tumor site, improving treatment efficacy.",

Traditional diagnosis methods often detect cancer at a considerably critical stage and the conventional methods of treatment like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy have several limitations, multidrug resistance, cytotoxicity, and lack of specificity are a few examples. These pose substantial challenge for effective and favourable cancer treatment. The advent of nanotechnology has revolutionized the face of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Nanoparticles, which have a size range of 1\u2013100 nm, are biocompatible and have special optical, magnetic, and electrical capabilities, less toxic, more stable, exhibit permeability and retention effect, and are used for precise targeting. There are several classes of nanoparticles each having their own sets of unique properties. NPs have played an important role in the drug delivery system, overcoming the multi-drug resistance, reducing the side-effects as seen in conventional therapeutic methods and hence able to solve the limitations of conventional methods of diagnosis and treatment. This review discusses the four major classes of nanoparticles (Lipid based NPs, Carbon NPs and Metallic NPs and Polymeric NPs): their discovery and introduction in medical field, unique properties and characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, sub-categories and characteristics of these categories, major area of application in Cancer diagnosis and treatment, and latest methodologies where these are used in cancer treatment.\n## Lipid nanoparticles\nBiocompatibility and safety: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are inherently biocompatible due to their composition, which often mimics natural biological membranes. This biocompatibility minimizes the risk of adverse immune reactions and toxicity, making them ideal for clinical applications. \n\nVersatility in drug delivery: LNPs can encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic agents, including chemotherapeutics, nucleic acids (such as siRNA and mRNA), and proteins. This versatility allows for the targeted delivery of these agents to cancer cells, improving therapeutic outcomes while reducing systemic side effects. \n\nEnhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect: LNPs benefit from the EPR effect, which facilitates their accumulation in tumor tissues due to the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage of tumours. This property enhances the concentration of therapeutic agents at the tumor site, improving treatment efficacy.",

The considerable number of currently ongoing clinical studies are testament to this fact. These efforts towards the development of LNPs warrant an insight into the fundamental developmental aspects of such systems. In this review, we discuss the key design aspects that confer efficacy to a LNP delivery system, i.e., potency, biodegradability, and immunogenicity. We also cover the underlying considerations regarding the route of administration and targeting of LNPs to hepatic and non-hepatic targets. Furthermore, since LNP efficacy is also a function of drug/nucleic acid release within endosomes, we take a holistic view of charged-based targeting approaches of LNPs not only in the context of endosomal escape but also in relation to other comparable target cell internalization strategies. Electrostatic charge-based interactions have been used in the past as a potential strategy to enhance the drug release from pH-sensitive liposomes. In this review, we cover such strategies around endosomal escape and cell internalization in low pH tumor micro-environments.",

Not only mRNA vaccines, but also siRNA-based treatment of polyneuropathy has been approved, as an example of another LNP application. The ongoing clinical trials listed in this article emphasize the breadth of drug cargo that can be delivered through LNPs, as well as the variety of clinical applications that are targeted. From small molecules to ASO, siRNA, mRNA, plasmid DNA, and gene editing, LNPs are being extensively explored for potentially all types of drug cargo. Such medical interventions were thought to be difficult to implement owing to the lack of suitable delivery mechanisms; however, LNPs have provided a big boost to the investigation of all gene therapies, paving the way for the application of precision/personalized medicine much sooner than expected. Many difficult-to-treat health conditions such as oncology, protein replacement, gene silencing, and chronic diseases are now slowly becoming more easily treatable with the advances in this field. Efficient tissue targeting will add more fuel and rigor to the advancements and even gene therapies accessible by ex vivo modulating cells could potentially be replaced by targeting-enabled LNPs and their corresponding nano-delivery systems. It may also prove to be a very handy platform for image diagnostics applications. \n\nConsidering the enormous potential that LNPs carry, in this review, we have discussed the approaches for designing lipid nanoparticles that render them more efficacious. We have covered strategies that have been used to design ionizable lipid and helper lipid constituents of LNP systems. Specifically, the ionizable head group design, pKa tunability, and ionizable and helper lipid tail design and concepts were discussed with examples. Moreover, we also covered approaches pertaining to the safety of such systems, such as biodegradability and immunogenicity. We also covered the key considerations and rationale behind selecting the route of administration and targeting of hepatic and nonhepatic targets. We believe that this paper will provide pertinent efficacy and safety-related information for developing an efficient LNP system.",

The considerable number of currently ongoing clinical studies are testament to this fact. These efforts towards the development of LNPs warrant an insight into the fundamental developmental aspects of such systems. In this review, we discuss the key design aspects that confer efficacy to a LNP delivery system, i.e., potency, biodegradability, and immunogenicity. We also cover the underlying considerations regarding the route of administration and targeting of LNPs to hepatic and non-hepatic targets. Furthermore, since LNP efficacy is also a function of drug/nucleic acid release within endosomes, we take a holistic view of charged-based targeting approaches of LNPs not only in the context of endosomal escape but also in relation to other comparable target cell internalization strategies. Electrostatic charge-based interactions have been used in the past as a potential strategy to enhance the drug release from pH-sensitive liposomes. In this review, we cover such strategies around endosomal escape and cell internalization in low pH tumor micro-environments.\n## Conclusions\nThe tremendous success of COVID-19 vaccines could have not been possible without LNP systems. Not only mRNA vaccines, but also siRNA-based treatment of polyneuropathy has been approved, as an example of another LNP application. The ongoing clinical trials listed in this article emphasize the breadth of drug cargo that can be delivered through LNPs, as well as the variety of clinical applications that are targeted. From small molecules to ASO, siRNA, mRNA, plasmid DNA, and gene editing, LNPs are being extensively explored for potentially all types of drug cargo. Such medical interventions were thought to be difficult to implement owing to the lack of suitable delivery mechanisms; however, LNPs have provided a big boost to the investigation of all gene therapies, paving the way for the application of precision/personalized medicine much sooner than expected. Many difficult-to-treat health conditions such as oncology, protein replacement, gene silencing, and chronic diseases are now slowly becoming more easily treatable with the advances in this field. Efficient tissue targeting will add more fuel and rigor to the advancements and even gene therapies accessible by ex vivo modulating cells could potentially be replaced by targeting-enabled LNPs and their corresponding nano-delivery systems. It may also prove to be a very handy platform for image diagnostics applications. \n\nConsidering the enormous potential that LNPs carry, in this review, we have discussed the approaches for designing lipid nanoparticles that render them more efficacious. We have covered strategies that have been used to design ionizable lipid and helper lipid constituents of LNP systems. Specifically, the ionizable head group design, pKa tunability, and ionizable and helper lipid tail design and concepts were discussed with examples. Moreover, we also covered approaches pertaining to the safety of such systems, such as biodegradability and immunogenicity. We also covered the key considerations and rationale behind selecting the route of administration and targeting of hepatic and nonhepatic targets. We believe that this paper will provide pertinent efficacy and safety-related information for developing an efficient LNP system.",

It has become another important modality of anti-tumor therapy with significant clinical efficacy and advantages compared to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy. Although various kinds of tumor immunotherapeutic drugs have emerged, the challenges faced in the delivery of these drugs, such as poor tumor permeability and low tumor cell uptake rate, had prevented their widespread application. Recently, nanomaterials had emerged as a means for treatment of different diseases due to their targeting properties, biocompatibility and functionalities. Moreover, nanomaterials possess various characteristics that overcome the defects of traditional tumor immunotherapy, such as large drug loading capacity, precise tumor targeting and easy modification, thus leading to their wide application in tumor immunotherapy. There are two main classes of novel nanoparticles mentioned in this review: organic (polymeric nanomaterials, liposomes and lipid nanoparticles) and inorganic (non-metallic nanomaterials and metallic nanomaterials). Besides, the fabrication method for nanoparticles, Nanoemulsions, was also introduced. In summary, this review article mainly discussed the research progress of tumor immunotherapy based on nanomaterials in the past few years and offers a theoretical basis for exploring novel tumor immunotherapy strategies in the future.",

It has become another important modality of anti-tumor therapy with significant clinical efficacy and advantages compared to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy. Although various kinds of tumor immunotherapeutic drugs have emerged, the challenges faced in the delivery of these drugs, such as poor tumor permeability and low tumor cell uptake rate, had prevented their widespread application. Recently, nanomaterials had emerged as a means for treatment of different diseases due to their targeting properties, biocompatibility and functionalities. Moreover, nanomaterials possess various characteristics that overcome the defects of traditional tumor immunotherapy, such as large drug loading capacity, precise tumor targeting and easy modification, thus leading to their wide application in tumor immunotherapy. There are two main classes of novel nanoparticles mentioned in this review: organic (polymeric nanomaterials, liposomes and lipid nanoparticles) and inorganic (non-metallic nanomaterials and metallic nanomaterials). Besides, the fabrication method for nanoparticles, Nanoemulsions, was also introduced. In summary, this review article mainly discussed the research progress of tumor immunotherapy based on nanomaterials in the past few years and offers a theoretical basis for exploring novel tumor immunotherapy strategies in the future.\n## Lipid nanoparticles\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs), an emerging nanomaterial with excellent drug delivery ability, has been extensively explored in the area of tumor therapy [192,193]. The most widely used LNPs included solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC). The advantages of LNPs included biocompatibility, controlled and sustained release of anti-tumor drugs, and lower systemic toxicity, especially hugged the advantage to delivery mRNA for tumor immunotherapy [194,195]. For the components of LNPs, typical LNPs were composed of cationic lipids, ionizable lipids, or helper lipids. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids or surfactants may be also added to improve colloidal stability of the LNPs [196,197]. At present, the potential clinical application of LNPs mainly lies in effectively modulating mRNA delivery to improve the immunotherapeutic effects. Naked mRNA was unstable, and can be rapidly degraded by nucleases and Fig. 9 A summary of liposomes used in tumor immunotherapy to inhibit tumor progression. The 7 kinds of liposomes mentioned in this manuscript increase the infiltration of CD8 + T cells, decrease the level of immune suppressive T cells, promote the maturation of DCs, and induce the macrophage transformation from M2 type to M1 type and restore tumor immunity to inhibit tumor progression self-hydrolysis. Encapsulation of mRNA by LNPs could protect naked mRNA from extracellular ribonucleases and contributed to the intracellular mRNA delivery. As a result, the therapeutic effect of these mRNA can be fully performed. Many studies have convinced this point [198][199][200][201]. \n\nFirst, the LNPs vector have the adjuvant effect. LNP itself can activate the immune response [202].",

Nanoparticles have the advantages of enhancing immunogenicity, targeting delivery, and improving stability, providing a new solution for drug and vaccine delivery. In some clinical studies, a variety of nanoparticle delivery platforms have been gradually applied to a wide range of vaccine applications. Current research priorities are exploring various types of nanoparticles as vaccine delivery systems to enhance vaccine stability and immunogenicity. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown promising potential in preclinical and clinical studies on the efficient delivery of antigens to immune cells. Moreover, lipid nanoparticles and other nanoparticles for nucleic acids, especially for mRNA delivery systems, have shown vast potential for vaccine development. In this review, we present various vaccine platforms with an emphasis on nanoparticles as mRNA vaccine delivery vehicles. We describe several novel nanoparticle delivery platforms for mRNA vaccines, such as lipid-, polymer-, and protein-based nanoparticles. In addition, we provide an overview of the anti-tumor immunity of nanovaccines against different tumors in cancer immunotherapy. Finally, we outline future perspectives and remaining challenges for this promising technology of nanoparticle-based delivery platforms for vaccines.",

Nanoparticles have the advantages of enhancing immunogenicity, targeting delivery, and improving stability, providing a new solution for drug and vaccine delivery. In some clinical studies, a variety of nanoparticle delivery platforms have been gradually applied to a wide range of vaccine applications. Current research priorities are exploring various types of nanoparticles as vaccine delivery systems to enhance vaccine stability and immunogenicity. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown promising potential in preclinical and clinical studies on the efficient delivery of antigens to immune cells. Moreover, lipid nanoparticles and other nanoparticles for nucleic acids, especially for mRNA delivery systems, have shown vast potential for vaccine development. In this review, we present various vaccine platforms with an emphasis on nanoparticles as mRNA vaccine delivery vehicles. We describe several novel nanoparticle delivery platforms for mRNA vaccines, such as lipid-, polymer-, and protein-based nanoparticles. In addition, we provide an overview of the anti-tumor immunity of nanovaccines against different tumors in cancer immunotherapy. Finally, we outline future perspectives and remaining challenges for this promising technology of nanoparticle-based delivery platforms for vaccines.\n## Stability and Modification of Lipid-Based Nanoparticle Delivery Platforms\nTherefore, suitable techniques should be selected in lipid nanoparticle production.\n\nLNP-based delivery platforms are safe and suitable for nucleic acid and therapeutic cargo delivery.Now, it is commonly used in vaccine delivery and development.Due to the similarity of the lipid components to those found in the body, LNPs exhibit excellent biocompatibility.Moreover, the surface of LNPs can be modified.Surface modifications can usually improve the targeting property of nanoparticles.Typically, they are prepared by conjugating a small molecule ligand, peptide, or monoclonal antibody to the surface of the LNP in order to achieve surface attachment of the ligand for the specific recognition and binding to a receptor on the cell [43].The surface modification strategies of LNPs can be categorized into \"pre-modification\" and \"post-modification\".The \"pre-modification\" approach involves either pre-conjugating ligand molecules to lipid molecules or incorporating ligand lipids onto the surface of LNPs, facilitating self-assembly with other components to produce LNPs.On the other hand, in the \"post-modification\" technique, ligand molecules are directly conjugated to the surface of LNPs through affinity adsorption or chemical interactions [44].The advantage of post-modification lies in its exceptional flexibility, which allows for the specific conjugation of antibodies or antibody fragments onto the surface of LNPs, thereby enabling precise targeting toward particular cells or tissues.This feature allows for the precise delivery of antigens to specific cells or tissues, thereby enhancing the treatment efficacy of the vaccine [36].Post-modification not only imparts novel functionalities to LNPs but also exerts a substantial influence on their physical, chemical, and biological stability.However, certain post-modification methods may result in compromised binding affinity of the functional molecules, thereby potentially impacting the long-term stability of LNPs.When deciding between pre-modification and post-modification approaches, a comprehensive evaluation should be undertaken.If a highly flexible and versatile LNP is desired, post-modification may be deemed more suitable.Conversely, if enhanced stability and uniformity are pursued, pre-modification may offer better outcomes.",

In the present study, ELT-liposome and ELT-NLCs were successfully prepared and characterized by assessment of the particle size, zeta potential (ZP), polydispersity index (PDI), encapsulation efficiency (EE), and drug loading (DL). DAPI staining and Flow cytometry techniques were employed to probe anticancer activities of the optimal formulations. The obtained results indicated that the average size of optimized ELT-NLCs was 109 \u00b1 2 nm, while the optimal formulation of ELT-liposome was 130 \u00b1 4 nm. In addition, the values of EE, DL, and cellular uptake were higher in ELT-NLCs than ELT-liposome. Moreover, the stability of ELT-NLCs and ELT-liposome were not significantly changed (P > 0.05) within storage time. The results of anti-cancer assessment indicated that ELT-NLCs caused more cell viability reduction than ELT-liposome and free ELT. According to the Flow cytometry and DAPI staining results, the exposed A549 cells with ELT-NLCs had more rates of apoptosis than ELT-liposome. The obtained data from this study clearly showed that ELT-NLCs had better anti-cancer activity than ELT-liposome, which may be related to the effective nano particle size, PDI, EE, and DL of ELT-NLCs.",

In addition, of this, several nanoscale Drug Delivery Systems (DDSs) such as micelle, poly (D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid(13), liposome3) ), dendrimer (14), and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (15) have been recently developed and examined for ELT delivery in the cancer treatment. \n\nAmong the described drug nanocarriers, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) such as Liposomes, phytosomes, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), etc are available for DDSs of ELT delivery. LNPs as an effective systematic drug administration method is able to enhance the solubilization and stabilization of several drugs by protection of them from the biological fluids, and limitation of nonspecific cytotoxicity (16,17). It is reported that LNPs contain different advantages that make them a unique oral drug delivery system, including low cost raw materials, exclusively compared with phospholipids, easy scale-up and manufacture, high stability and storage, controlled release, and high versatility (17,18). Liposome and NLCs are interesting nanocarriers based on LNPs that could deliver their cargoes via encapsulation route (19,20). The first aim of the present study was to characterize and optimize different formulations of NLC and liposome ELTloaded systems. The second aim was to study in-vitro anti-cancer activity of the optimized formulations of ELT-liposome and ELT-NLC by assessment of their cellular cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and DNA fragmentations.",

Mansoori, R. Yekta, H. Hamishehkar, A. Mohammadi, G. Dehghan, B. Shokouhi, Shaho Ghahremani Dehbokri, B. Baradaran\n## Abstract\nErlotinib (ELT) as a small molecule with poor solubility, poor bioavailability, and instability in gastrointestinal environment, has been considered as a therapeutic agent for Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) therapy through oral administration. In the present study, ELT-liposome and ELT-NLCs were successfully prepared and characterized by assessment of the particle size, zeta potential (ZP), polydispersity index (PDI), encapsulation efficiency (EE), and drug loading (DL). DAPI staining and Flow cytometry techniques were employed to probe anticancer activities of the optimal formulations. The obtained results indicated that the average size of optimized ELT-NLCs was 109 \u00b1 2 nm, while the optimal formulation of ELT-liposome was 130 \u00b1 4 nm. In addition, the values of EE, DL, and cellular uptake were higher in ELT-NLCs than ELT-liposome. Moreover, the stability of ELT-NLCs and ELT-liposome were not significantly changed (P > 0.05) within storage time. The results of anti-cancer assessment indicated that ELT-NLCs caused more cell viability reduction than ELT-liposome and free ELT. According to the Flow cytometry and DAPI staining results, the exposed A549 cells with ELT-NLCs had more rates of apoptosis than ELT-liposome. The obtained data from this study clearly showed that ELT-NLCs had better anti-cancer activity than ELT-liposome, which may be related to the effective nano particle size, PDI, EE, and DL of ELT-NLCs.\n## Introduction\nTherefore, to overcome the mentioned shortages, the development of a new formulation of ELT is essential for clinical domain. In addition, of this, several nanoscale Drug Delivery Systems (DDSs) such as micelle, poly (D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid(13), liposome3) ), dendrimer (14), and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (15) have been recently developed and examined for ELT delivery in the cancer treatment. \n\nAmong the described drug nanocarriers, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) such as Liposomes, phytosomes, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), etc are available for DDSs of ELT delivery. LNPs as an effective systematic drug administration method is able to enhance the solubilization and stabilization of several drugs by protection of them from the biological fluids, and limitation of nonspecific cytotoxicity (16,17). It is reported that LNPs contain different advantages that make them a unique oral drug delivery system, including low cost raw materials, exclusively compared with phospholipids, easy scale-up and manufacture, high stability and storage, controlled release, and high versatility (17,18). Liposome and NLCs are interesting nanocarriers based on LNPs that could deliver their cargoes via encapsulation route (19,20). The first aim of the present study was to characterize and optimize different formulations of NLC and liposome ELTloaded systems. The second aim was to study in-vitro anti-cancer activity of the optimized formulations of ELT-liposome and ELT-NLC by assessment of their cellular cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and DNA fragmentations.",

Among these vectors, LNPs are the most commonly used due to the relative ease of large scaled manufacture, their ability to deliver the encapsulated mRNA to ribosomes (via endosome escape), and flexibility for surface modification with a ligand for specific cell targeting, for example to enhance the uptake into dendritic cells [5,18]. LNPs are versatile drug delivery systems that have been investigated to tackle various disease, including infection and cancer [21]. As LNPs consist of at least one synthetic or natural lipid layer and an aqueous, oil, solid, or amorphous core [22], hydrophilic molecules, such as mRNA, small interference RNA (siRNA) and proteins can be entrapped within the LNP aqueous core, whereas lipophilic compounds can be incorporated into the lipid layers [18]. Thus, LNPs can be co-loaded with an immunopotentiator, also known as adjuvants, to enhance the immune response of the mRNA vaccine. The choice of LNPs for mRNA vaccine delivery has shifted from traditional liposomes, lipoplexes, and cationic nanoemulsions, to more advanced solid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers [20]. LNPs were employed not only by BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, but also by other mRNA vaccines in the development of delivery carriers, which are listed in Table 1.",

            "text": "LNP-based mRNA vaccines are more selective than other treatments. The use of nanomaterials for drug delivery can reduce adverse reactions by preventing the non-specific absorption of therapeutic agents in healthy tissues (94). Therefore, this is more suitable for patients who cannot tolerate traditional treatment because of their poor physical condition. Targeted therapy has also been proven to be an effective method for tumor therapy (95, 96). Because of their benign biocompatibility and low toxicity, endogenous carriers show great potential for the delivery of therapeutic nanoparticles (97, 98). An efficient way to deliver drugs to the lesion is to wrap anticancer agents in nanocarriers (99-101). The main advantage of the LNP-based strategy compared to naked mRNA is that it can deliver many drugs specifically by changing the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs, which increases drug intake in tumor tissues, improves the anti-tumor effect, and reduces non-specific toxicity (102, 103). Currently, many immunotherapies based on mRNA have been applied in clinical trials, and some confirmative results have shown the efficacy results of solid tumor treatments (54). Cancer therapies involve multi-disciplinary participation (104), and the vaccine is in the developing stage. LNP-based mRNA vaccines have obvious advantages, but they have not been widely used in clinical practice. LNP-based vaccines that are currently in the preclinical phase or have been used in clinical trials have been introduced below. Figure 3 shows the anti-cancer mechanism of LNP-based mRNA vaccines in lung cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), and glioma.",

            "text": "This structure grants LNPs excellent drug loading capacity and stability (Zong et al., 2023). Compared to liposomes, LNPs provide higher drug loading capacity and better physical stability due to their solid or semi-solid lipid cores, which allow drugs to be more effectively embedded, enhancing drug stability and loading efficiency (Estap\u00e9 Senti et al., 2024). Additionally, the surface of LNPs can be modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or other hydrophobic molecules to extend their circulation time in the blood and reduce the likelihood of clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (Huang et al., 2023). LNPs also offer significant advantages in targeted delivery and localized release. By modifying the surface with targeting ligands, LNPs can specifically target tumor cells or particular molecules within the tumor microenvironment, enabling precise drug delivery. In the context of mRNA vaccine delivery, LNPs protect mRNA from degradation by nucleases within the body and facilitate its effective entry into target cells (Cheng et al., 2020;Kon et al., 2023). The successful application of LNPs in CRISPR-Cas9 has further validated their potential in nucleic acid drug delivery, laying a foundation for their use in cancer immunotherapy (Rosenblum et al., 2020). \n\nPolymeric Nanoparticles (PNPs) are nanoscale particles made from natural or synthetic polymers, including structures such as solid nanoparticles, nanomicelles, or nanocapsules. Their greatest advantage lies in their highly tunable physicochemical properties. By selecting different polymer materials and synthesis methods, the particle size, shape, surface charge, and degradation rate of PNPs can be precisely controlled (Li et al., 2018;Rajana et al., 2022). For example, by incorporating stimulus-responsive polymers (e.g., pH, temperature, or redox-sensitive polymers), PNPs can trigger drug release in specific pathological environments, thereby enhancing treatment specificity and efficacy (Kim et al., 2024).",

These advantages are possessed because these nanoparticles are synthesized from natural resources. More than that, these nanoparticles have controlled and pH-responsive release capability which is one of the important aspects of a drug delivery system. However, each LNPs, XNPs, and CNCs have specific advantages and disadvantages in drug delivery application, as described in Table 6. The uses of LNPs, XNPs, and CNCs have to be adjusted with several considerations, such as loaded drug characteristics, nanoparticle-drug interactions, release mechanism, and targeted release location. Here, the excellences of nanoparticles are affected by the precursor's characteristics and synthesis methods. In Table 6, an amphiphilic characteristic of LNPs comes from the hydrophilic and hydrophobic tails of lignin, while the ability of LNPs and XNPs in wound treatment is due to the anti-inflammation characteristic of their precursors. In another case, the acid involvement in the synthesis process gives negative surface charges on the LNPs and CNCs. Besides that, these nanoparticles still have several weaknesses that can affect the drug delivery mechanism. The functionalization of nanoparticles using a certain modifying agent can overcome the weaknesses and improve the characteristics. Recent studies on LNPs, XNPs, and CNCs tend toward nanoparticle functionalization for overcoming the weaknesses.",

            "text": "Lipid-based formulations are known for better uptake efficiency at cellular level. Physiological aspects of lipid-cell interaction are vital to understand the therapeutic distribution and ultimate fate of carrier system (Xing et al., 2016). LNPs exhibit many advantages as delivery carriers over other nanocarrier systems (such as polymers, CNTs, metallic NPs etc.), and have seen extensive usage in drug delivery. In addition to the above mentioned concerns of CNTs and metallic NPs, it has been observed that metallo-supramolecular polymers, that can provide the functionality of the metal ion along with the processability of a polymer have some limitations when used in drug delivery processes. For example, the introduction of metal ions in the body can disturb the ion balance and limit certain medical applications (Rowan and Beck, 2005), (Dong et al., 2015). Furthermore, dendritic polymers exhibit many drawbacks which limit their usage in theranostic applications, for instance, several complex and highly expensive synthetic and purification procedures can lead to imprecise or nonspecific structures with low quantifiability. Moreover, these polymers show poor reproducibility and certain biosafety concerns due to their possible toxicity and unexpected removal, which restrict their clinical translation (Jain et al., 2010), (Shcharbin et al., 2014). The development of LNPs paves the way for resolving above stated limitations. \n\nAdvantages of LNPs may include: (1) ease of engineering processes, (2) up-scaling feasibility, (3) excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, (4) negligible toxicity, (5) controlled and targeted drug release potential, (6) improved drug solubility and stability, (7) enhanced bioavailability, (8) potential of encapsulating both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, (9) less expensive, (10) encapsulation of high drug content, (11) potential to cross various physiological barriers, (12) easy validation, and many others which could be favorable for specific delivery route or nature of the payload (Ghasemiyeh and Mohammadi-Samani, 2018), (Attama et al., 2012).",

            "text": "PEGylation (the attachment of polyethylene glycol chains) is another widely used strategy to extend the circulation time of LNPs in vivo by reducing their recognition by the immune system [138]. Furthermore, the preparation method for LNPs is straightforward and cost-effective, lay a foundation for large-scale production and clinical applications. The success of LNPs in clinical applications is best exemplified by their use in mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna's vaccines utilize LNPs to deliver mRNA encoding the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, enabling the body's immune system to recognize and combat the virus. These vaccines have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of LNPs as drug carriers at a global scale, marking a significant milestone in the field of nanomedicine. This success has further fueled research into applying LNPs for a range of other therapies, including cancer treatments and genetic disorders [139]. \n\nHowever, LNPs face several challenges, including potential instability in the biological environment, which can lead to uneven drug release or reduced efficacy. Some LNPs may also induce cytotoxicity or immune responses, which can compromise clinical safety. Additionally, the drug loading capacity of LNPs is currently limited, potentially hindering the efficient delivery of certain drugs. Future advancements are anticipated to address these issues by enhancing stability, reducing toxicity, increasing drug loading capacity, and developing more functional nanoparticles. Improving LNPs to create a safer and more efficient drug delivery platform will drive further innovations and progress in clinical therapies.",

Each delivery system has its own advantages and disadvantages. Generally speaking, the lipid-based delivery systems usually have simple formulation procedures and compositions, good biocompatibility, and high bioavailability. So far, the lipid-based drug formulations are the most common FDA-approved nano-drugs. Despite the great success that LNP delivery technology has achieved in both basic research and clinical translations, there have been sustained efforts focused on developing more efficient and specific LNP delivery systems to apply to new therapeutics to different organs and tissues 12e15 . Considering that each type of cargo molecule (small molecule drugs and biologics) has its distinct physicochemical properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of small molecules; molecular weight, geometry, surface charge, and hydrodynamic size of biologics), the carrier LNP system needs to be carefully tailored for particular delivery applications 16e19 .",

Liposomes are the first nano system approved for protein and drug delivery [37]. LNPs originate from liposomes that deliver small-molecule drugs and are cationic, spherical vesicles. They are composed of phospholipids and cholesterol [38]. They demonstrate high biocompatibility and can enter the cytoplasm through natural biological processes like membrane fusion, owing to the phospholipid bilayer of the plasma membrane [39]. LNPs have been shown to reduce drug toxicity, enhance drug stability, and improve drug bioavailability [40]. Studies have indicated that LNPs are effective immune stimulators in mRNA-based vaccine delivery and enhance the efficacy of protein subunit vaccines [41,42]. Many LNPs-based siRNA drugs have entered the clinical trial stage [43]. However, LNPs also have some disadvantages, such as their complex composition, relatively lower stability, and targeting efficacy [44,45]. Leakage may occur when loaded with drugs, and increasing the dose can have toxic side effects on the organism [46]. Additionally, emulsifiers that produce toxicity to the body further limit the potential application of cationic NPs [47].",

Therefore, using LNPs as drug delivery carrier for the delivery of iron to trigger ferroptosis like cell death for antibacterial application might be a promising strategy. \n\nInspired by the aforementioned researches, here in this study, we used FAC as the iron source and load it with LNPs. The antibacterial performance finally prepared nanoparticle (short for Fe-LNPs) was tested on both Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. aureus) and negative (Escherichia coli, E. coli) strains in vitro. Finally, a S. aureus infected wound model was established to evaluate the in vivo antibacterial profile of Fe-LNPs.",

This structure enables LNPs to effectively encapsulate and deliver diverse oligonucleotides, including siRNA, mRNA, and plasmid DNA. \n\nLNPs are renowned for their excellent stability and efficient intracellular delivery, making them highly suitable for nucleic-acid-based therapy. Lipid-based nanoparticles offer a diverse range of options for drug delivery. Each type exhibits unique properties that can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of the therapeutic cargo. Factors such as the nature of the cargo, desired release kinetics, and the targeted delivery site play crucial roles in selecting the appropriate lipid-based nanoparticles. Ongoing research and development in this field hold immense promise for advancing drug delivery strategies and improving therapeutic outcomes. \n\nRecently, LNPs have been actively investigated for the delivery of RNA-based biopharmaceuticals [11,12]. Although non-viral vectors such as LNP have lower efficiency than viral vectors, the former are biosafe and have the advantage of being able to carry large mRNA sequences [13,14]. Furthermore, LNPs can easily fulfill three requirements for nucleic acid delivery vehicles: efficient encapsulation to resist degradation by nucleases, a mechanism for targeted delivery and intracellular entry, and a manufacturing process that allows for the mass production of uniformly sized nanoparticles [15]. The cargo content and physicochemical properties (particle size, shape, surface charge, etc.) of LNPs can be controlled by adjusting the lipid composition [16]. \n\nNanoparticles containing cationic lipids have been widely studied as carriers of genes and nucleic acids because of their ability to carry negatively charged nucleic acids and attach to the lipid bilayer of cells [17]. However, cytotoxicity due to cationic lipids and rapid elimination from the body are limitations [18]. To compensate for this, ionizable lipids that are neutral in circulation and positively charged only in endosomes have been developed and actively studied [19].",

            "text": "Advances in biomaterials promote the development of nanomedicine. In the above discussion, it is easy to see that each type of nanodrug delivery system has its own advantages. LNPs, which are mainly formed from phospholipids, are nontoxic, biocompatible and biodegradable and can also reduce the toxic effects of carrier molecules, which means they are particularly suitable for oral or other routes of drug delivery. Polymers have various compositions, sizes, morphologies and surface properties that can be adjusted by applying different ingredients and manufacturing methods for specific applications. Tailoring polymers can improve organ selectivity by introducing targeting groups. Meanwhile, some inorganic nanoparticles, such as AgNPs and AuNPs, can bind to viral surface receptors and prevent viruses from entering the host cell. However, it is important to note that LNP has been shown to induce immune reactions on several previous occasions, suggesting that potential immune reactions should be considered. In addition, although inorganic nanoparticles or nanodelivery systems have good antiviral activity, they are difficult to degrade in living organisms and tend to accumulate in the body, causing organ toxicity. In contrast, cationic polymers can bind to negatively charged cell membranes to increase permeability and facilitate endocytosis, but they also show cytotoxicity by damaging the cell membranes and reducing the DNA release rate.\n\nTherefore, some factors need to be considered when developing nanodrugs for antiviral therapy. First, the choice of nanodelivery systems depends on the characteristics of the antiviral drug. For example, the activity of the antiviral drug suramin is often limited by its difficulty in penetrating cell membranes and poor cellular internalization, and the use of cationic LNP can overcome this obstacle very well. To inhibit the adhesion of LNP to mucus and make it easier to pass through epithelial cells, LNP can be modified with PEG to improve their molecularly neutral nature. Second, as a drug delivery vehicle, the efficiency of drug release at the targeted site is also a key problem that needs to be considered. Nucleic acid drugs, for example, are of great interest because of their ability to act directly on diseasecausing target genes or target mRNAs to treat disease at",

The usual approach to prolong the circulation of mRNA-loaded LNPs is the addition of PEG units on the surface of LNPs which cause formation of a hydration layer that prevents clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system [ 50 ]. Moreover, the addition of a ligand to cell-membrane to imitate \"self\" materials can avoid the uptake by phagocytes [ 51 , 52 ]. \n\nMore recently, other new procedures, developed for delivery of nanoparticle-based drugs, include the mononuclear phagocyte system blockade by low-toxicity \"blocking\" agents [ 53 ], macrophage depletion by means of the administration of clodronate/gadolinium chloride [ 54 ] and pre-induced depletion of erythrocytes by administration of a low dose of allogeneic antierythrocyte antibodies [ 55 , 56 ]. It is plausible that these methods could be used in future also to prolong the circulation time of mRNA and to optimize delivery to target tissue. \n\nTo efficiently reach their target to deliver the cargo, LNPs can be also conjugated with specific ligands to the surface that help the identification and the uptake by the intended cells. These ligands can be peptides, antibodies, nucleic acid aptamers, carbohydrates or small molecules [ 22 ]. \n\nOther systems developed as alternatives to LNPs are biological delivery vehicles such as cells or extracellular vesicles. The main advantages of this methodology comprise biocompatibility, wide range of customization, extended longevity in circulation and reduced toxicity [ 57 -60 ]. \n\nHowever, current challenges in their clinical use include the characterization, the isolation method and their purification [ 61 , 62 ].",

            "text": "delivery of nucleic acids into cells makes them superior to other carriers. Since biological membranes and nucleic acids are negatively charged, it is difficult to deliver mRNA across this barrier. LNPs offer an ideal platform for delivering nucleic acid therapies as the ionizable lipids are nearneutrally charged at physiological pH. However, in acidic endosomal compartments (pH-4.5), they become ionized, promoting endosomal escape for effective intracellular delivery [46,47]. Hence, LNPs achieve high encapsulation rate for nucleic acids with improved transfection efficiency. Furthermore, LNPs have relatively low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity compared to liposomes, thus favoring delivery of nucleic acid based therapeutics [48][49][50].\n\nLipids used in formulating these nanoparticles are biocompatible and are well endured by fatty acids, triglycerides, waxes and steroids. In addition, selecting a good combination of emulsifiers could  make the formulation more stable with higher efficiency [52]. In terms of industrial scale up, LNPs offer multiple advantages compared with other carrier systems, such as large scale production using microfluidics or T-junction mixing, stability, and low cost of raw materials [52][53][54]. The most significant parameters in LNPs characterization are particle size, their size distribution, degree of polymorphism, zeta potential, crystallinity, drug loading, drug release and entrapment efficiency [55]. Drug release from LNPs mostly relies on the type of matrix used and the position of drug in the matrix formulation. The ingredients of lipid matrix, manufacturing parameters and surfactant concentrations, such as rate of stirring, temperature etc. can modulate the drug release profile [56]. In a nutshell, the most fundamental rationale of using LNPs, as an alternative to polymeric nanoparticles, is the simplicity of largescale manufacturing and their low toxicity [57,58].",

Nanotechnology is rapidly emerging in the drug delivery sector as it displays exceptional potential for in vivo delivery of biomolecules, drugs and vaccines [36]. These nanoparticulate systems can overcome the limitations inherent in conventional formulations [37]. A particle size of approximately 50 nm for vaccines will lead to highly efficient delivery, irrespective of its chemical composition. LNPs act as protective shields for small molecules against enzymatic degradation, effectively minimizing vaccine protein degradation, phagocytic clearance and prolonged circulation time of the vaccines, allowing precise targeting while reducing off-target effects [38]. LNPs also play a crucial role in enhancing cellular uptake by promoting endocytosis and efficient delivery of mRNA to target tissues, such as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In addition to their targeted delivery capabilities, LNPs offer several other advantages. They are relatively easy to formulate and enable scale-up for large-scale production, exhibit a highly efficient transfection capacity, and possess a low toxicity profile, making them an ideal delivery system for mRNA vaccines [39].

Among these vectors, LNPs are the most commonly used due to the relative ease of large scaled manufacture, their ability to deliver the encapsulated mRNA to ribosomes (via endosome escape), and flexibility for surface modification with a ligand for specific cell targeting, for example to enhance the uptake into dendritic cells [5,18]. LNPs are versatile drug delivery systems that have been investigated to tackle various disease, including (3) within the cell, mRNA-loaded LNPs undergo endosome escape, and release mRNA for protein synthesis. In contrast, (4) naked mRNA can be partially internalised, but the majority is degraded in lysosomes. In addition, the extracellular mRNA is cleaved by the ribonucleases (RNases) while LNPs at the injection site protect of mRNA from RNases. LNPs provide extended local tissue exposure and the pharmacokinetic profile depends on various factors such as the lipids used and particle size. \n\nNanoparticles are nanoscale (1-1000 nm) vesicles that have been explored as non-viral vectors for the intracellular delivery of mRNA while protecting exogenous mRNA from RNase destruction [19].

            "text": "Nanoparticles have a wide range of biomedical applications due to their advanced technology [56]. In particular, LNPs are among the most commonly used mRNA delivery vehicles in both preclinical and clinical studies [57][58][59]. LNPs may present a micelle-like structure that encapsulates nucleic acids inside a non-aqueous core, rather than a lipid bilayer enclosing an aqueous core in traditional liposomes [60][61][62]. Both mRNA and cell membranes are negatively charged, so mRNA cannot cross the cell membrane alone for protein expression. On the contrary, positively charged LNPs have a well-complexed system with the nucleic acid content under the influence of electrostatic action [60,63,64]. Notably, LNPs were initially employed to develop siRNA delivery. Subsequently, the LNP formulation was used to deliver mRNA for cancer immunotherapy in 2014 [65]. In comparison to other drug carriers, LNPs present numerous advantages [12,60,66,67]. For example, LNPs can effectively encapsulate mRNA for effective and efficient delivery into a cell [68]. Moreover, LNPs consists of biocompatible materials suitable for human use, which can be synthesized at a large scale under the GMP level. More importantly, LNPs are robustly synthesized, and their components can be easily adjusted to increase cellular uptake and reduce cellular toxicity [12]. \n\nLNPs are mainly composed of a cationic/ionizable lipid and helper lipids, such as phospholipids, cholesterol, and/or poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) lipids [12,60,69,70]. The structures of lipids commonly used for mRNA delivery are presented in Figure 3 [71], including preclinical studies, clinical stages and authorized lipids. In the context of the LNP system, the cationic/ionizable lipid is a critical component of LNPs.",

In many therapeutic reagents, the performance of therapeutics is dependent on physiological barriers in the human body and delivery efficacy. Therefore, an effective and stable therapeutic delivery promotes pharmaceutical advancement and suitable biological usage of drugs. In the biological and pharmacological industries, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a potential carrier to deliver therapeutics. Since studies reported doxorubicin-loaded liposomes (Doxil\u00ae), LNPs have been applied to numerous clinical trials. Lipid-based nanoparticles, including liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid nanoparticles, have also been developed to deliver active ingredients in vaccines. In this review, we present the type of LNPs used to develop vaccines with attractive advantages. We then discuss messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery for the clinical application of mRNA therapeutic-loaded LNPs and recent research trend of LNP-based vaccine development.",

            "text": "Furthermore, the inherent biocompatibility and safety of LNPs allow them to evade the innate immune system and extend their circulation time [71]. This makes LNPs particularly effective for delivering nucleic acids and hydrophobic protein-based drugs with short circulation half-lives, enabling precise therapeutic gene editing with the CRISPR-Cas9 system. \n\nThe significance of LNPs, with their ability to preserve lipid physicochemical properties in aqueous environments, became apparent with the fact that many small molecule anticancer drugs have low aqueous solubility, requiring encapsulation strategies to enhance delivery [72]. Several liposome-based pharmaceutical formulations have since been approved, showcasing their versatility in encapsulating hydrophilic drugs within their aqueous core and hydrophobic drugs within their lipid bilayer [73]. However, liposome technologies face challenges such as complex manufacturing processes, scalability limitations, and restricted applications for small-molecule drugs. \n\nLNPs were developed to address these limitations. Similar to liposomes, LNPs are composed of phospholipids, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipids, but with the addition of ionizable cationic lipids. These cationic lipids facilitates electrostatic interactions with negatively charged nucleic acids, forming stable nanoparticles [74]. Unlike the bilayer structure of liposomes, LNPs can adopt diverse internal architectures influenced by their nucleic acid cargo, lipid composition, manufacturing methods, and processing conditions. Negatively charged biomolecules such as CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid DNA, mRNA, and gRNA can stably bind to LNPs via electrostatic interactions, enabling the formation of highly efficient delivery systems, as shown in Figure 3a. Due to these properties, LNPs have become the most widely used non-viral delivery system for nucleic acids, with extensive research into their therapeutic applications ongoing [75].",

            "text": "In addition to light-delivery techniques, third-generation photosensitizing agents-an means attempt of improving treatment efficacy-involves delivering PS in the form of NPs, either with or without active targeting. 98 PDT-NPs are intended to improve kinetics and dispersion properties, ease multimodal therapy, and/or address biocompatibility issues related to free PS. These factors become particularly important when working with more recent organic or inorganic PS constructions since they necessitate striking a compromise between efficacy and biocompatibility. 99 Third-generation PDT mostly uses nanoparticle systems, while there are advantages to using traditional molecular PSs in conjunction with antibodies, folate moieties, or other small compounds. 100 Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and their derivatives are frequently used in NPs-based PDT. Lipid-based structures are referred to as LNPs. These structures include solid LNPs, liposomes, and micelles. Due to their proven stability, biocompatibility, favorable distribution characteristics, controlled drug release kinetics, potential for active targeting using aptamers, ability to deliver other anti-cancer medications concurrently, and capacity to make drugs that are inherently toxic safe for human use, these LNPs are PSs. 101 olymeric NPs, specifically poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), are another widely used nanocarrier platform for PSs in addition to LNPs. While PLGA is not as sophisticated as LNPs in this aspect, it's been widely used to administer chemotherapy drugs in preclinical and clinical settings. 100 In comparison to LNPs, PLGA has some advantages in the PS delivery process. It is particularly good in encasing extremely hydrophobic medications, such as those made from phthalocyanates, hypocrellins, and porphyrins. 102 Because of its more stiffness, less permeability, and thicker walls, PLGA also shows a tendency to be more stable and to release drugs at slower rates than LNPs. 103 This property of PLGA is helpful for PDT even if it could make it more difficult to achieve a gradual release with chemotherapy drugs.",

            "text": "LNPs are lipid vesicle delivery systems that are nonviral and multifunctional, comprising ionizable lipids as the primary components, cholesterol, phospholipids for structural integrity, and PEG-modified lipids to aid in maintaining stability (Fig. 2B) [117]. Following extensive research, LNPs have been utilized for the administration of various vaccines and have significantly enhanced both humoral and cellular immune responses. LNPs can stimulate robust follicular Th cells, durable plasma cells, B cells in germinal centers, and memory B cells, resulting in enhanced humoral immune reactions after vaccination [133]. Recently, LNPs have been extensively studied as potential carriers for mRNA vaccines in clinical trials of COVID-19, tumor vaccines, and influenza vaccines. For example, emergency marketing authorizations were granted in 2020 for Pfizer's BNT162b2 vaccine (Comirnaty) and Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine (Spikevax), both of which utilize LNPs for mRNA antigen delivery [134,135]. The successful use of these two mRNA vaccines has yielded exciting results and made significant contributions to the fight against COVID-19. LNPs have accelerated the utilization of mRNAs in humans, and their promising prospects in vaccine development are highly anticipated. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are a type of lipidbased nanocarrier comprising active pharmaceutical ingredients and solid lipids, along with surfactants and/ or co-surfactants. They serve as vaccine delivery systems that entrap drugs within natural or synthetic solid lipids, such as lecithin, acting as carriers [136]. Their internal oil phase was replaced with a solid lipid to reduce the limitations associated with conventional lipid formulations, avoid the use of organic solvents during preparation, provide better stability, reduce drug degradation, and maintain relative stability during storage. SLNs play a pivotal role in various applications in nanotechnology, such as vaccine delivery and cancer treatment, owing to their capacity to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds, biocompatibility, and ease with which their surface can be modified [118].",

Nanotechnology-based delivery systems, including lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles, offer unique advantages for mRNA delivery, such as protection from enzymatic degradation, improved cellular uptake, enhanced intracellular trafficking, and the controlled release of mRNA. Here, we discuss the role of nanotechnology in mRNA delivery and its potential applications. \n\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs): LNPs are one of the most-used nanocarriers for mRNA delivery. They comprise lipids that can self-assemble into nanoparticles, encapsulating mRNA within their lipid bilayers. LNPs can protect mRNA from enzymatic degradation, facilitate cellular uptake through endocytosis, and promote endosomal escape, allowing mRNA to reach the cytoplasm, where it can be translated into protein. LNPs have been successfully used for the delivery of mRNA in mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases such as COVID-19, as well as for mRNA-based gene therapies for genetic disorders. \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles: Polymeric nanoparticles are another type of nanocarrier that can be used for mRNA delivery. These nanoparticles are typically composed of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers, such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polyethyleneimine (PEI), and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Polymeric nanoparticles can encapsulate mRNA within their matrix or conjugate mRNA onto their surface, providing protection and stability to mRNA during delivery. Polymeric nanoparticles can also be engineered to have specific surface properties, such as charge and size, to optimize the cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of mRNA. \n\nInorganic nanoparticles: Inorganic nanoparticles, such as gold and silica nanoparticles, have also been explored for mRNA delivery.",

Many different sizes and properties of nanoparticle carriers have been designed using nanoparticles, which typically range in size from one-tenth of a nanometer to several hundred nanometers, and these nanoparticle carriers can be made of organic materials such as liposomes, polymers and dendrimers, or inorganic materials such as gold and metal oxides [73]. Among them, LNPs are the most advanced nanoparticle carriers that can be used to target specific cells using endogenous or exogenous ligands by encapsulating siRNA, mRNA, and circRNA. Endocytosis of LNPs destabilizes the endosomal membrane and releases nuclear acid cargo such as circRNAs or siRNAs into the cytoplasm. Nanoparticle carriers can solve many of the problems with RNAi molecules, making them less susceptible to degradation and promoting cellular uptake [74][75][76]. \n\nPain, swelling, fever and drowsiness have been documented in human clinical trials of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines [77][78][79]. The first vaccination's side effects may be linked to significant innate inflammation generated by LNPs, in addition to complement activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA) reaction [80]. Immune responses against cells expressing the vaccine protein or its peptide derivatives, on the other hand, may aggravate side effects following the second immunization [81].",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are nonviral delivery systems for small-molecule therapeutics. LNPs are generally composed of four lipids, including phospholipids, especially 2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) or 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-Glycero-3 Phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE). They are less than 100 nm in diameter [1]. LNPs are formed by adding ionizable or cationic lipids to liposomes to encapsulate negatively charged oligonucleotides via electrostatic reactions [2]. A crucial component of the delivery system is the ionizable lipid, which is an amphiphilic molecule with a cationic head group and two hydrophobic tails. Uncharged LNPs commonly bind to the cell surface via hydrophobic interactions or endocytosis. When LNPs are internalized into a cell, the acidic state of the endosome promotes the cationization of ionizable lipids, destroying the endosome membrane and releasing RNA into the cytoplasm [3]. LNPs have mainly been studied for mRNA delivery in vaccines. In addition, LNPs have recently been developed not only as vaccine platforms but also for cancer and gene therapies. According to a recent study, LNPs can be functionalized with antibodies for anticancer drug treatment. Especially, antibodyfunctionalized liposomes are able to target angiogenesis, uncontrolled cell proliferation, and tumor cells with lipid-based nanoparticles. Most of them have been in phase 1 clinical trials [4]. \n\nLiposomes, lipospheres, and microsimulation carrier systems have defects such as rapid drug release, instability, and oxidation.

LNPs have controllable size, shape and charge which are important properties that may affect the efficacy of immune activation. Modification of LNPs can achieve optimal immune responses 110 . As nanovaccines, LNPs can achieve co-delivery of multiple antigens and adjuvants. Besides, the membrane surface of LNPs can display antigen with enhanced representation of native conformations.\n\nLNPs has shown great potentials for nanovaccine development in a number of preclinical and clinical applications. As mentioned earlier, the lipid nanoparticles play a vital role in protecting mRNA vaccines from nuclease for effective delivery. LNPs have successfully been translated for the delivery of mRNA against COVID-19 recently (mRNA-1273 111 and BNT162b2 112 ). There are many other LNPemRNA formulations that are under ongoing clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of major human health threats including virus infections, cancers and genetic diseases as summarized in a recent review 113 . Cationic lipids, ionizable lipids and other types of lipids are all suitable components of LNPs.

            "text": "The application of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for RNA delivery has been actively and extensively explored recently. LNPs have been instrumental in delivering groundbreaking therapeutics, such as the approval of Patisiran (siRNA-based therapeutic) and their use in the mRNA-based vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic (Suzuki and Ishihara, 2021). LNPs generally have a lower risk of immunogenicity compared to viral vectors, while they can carry a relatively larger payload of nucleic acids, and as the recent COVID-19 vaccinations indicated, their production can be scaled up. Not surprisingly, research and development on LNP-based therapeutics for the administration of nucleic acids have accelerated, and several clinical applications are being evaluated (Swetha et al., 2023). In fact, LNPs have been tested in clinical trials for different infectious diseases caused by the zika virus, the Chikungunya virus, and influenza (Han et al., 2023). The following sections also list clinical trials indicating which LNPs have been the cornerstone of this approach. \n\nThe versatility of LNPs, their ability to efficiently deliver various types of nucleic acids, and their biocompatibility make them a promising platform for advancing therapeutic interventions in genetic diseases, cancer, infectious diseases, and beyond (Jung et al., 2022;Pilkington et al., 2021). Finally, significant research is being conducted on developing ionizable lipids, which are major components for the LNP-based formulations and their potential. These molecules promote nucleic acid complexation and endosomal escape, and the synthesis of novel molecules with improved properties for transfection while minimizing toxicity compared to permanently charged cationic lipids has been a proliferative area of research (Swetha et al., 2023).",

The lipid composition of these vaccines was similar to that of Onpattro (trade name of Patirisan by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals), an orphan drug composed of an siRNA-LNP system approved by the US FDA in August 2018 for treating hereditary transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis. 2 NPs are versatile and capable of delivering various therapies, making them suitable for treating a range of diseases. 3 LNPs are a strong candidate for targeted drug delivery in cancer therapy, offering the ability to deliver chemotherapy agents, gene therapies, or immunotherapies directly to tumor cells with precision. The application of LNPs for delivering gene-editing tools like CRISPR-Cas9 4 holds promise in treating genetic disorders, potentially offering breakthroughs in conditions like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and muscular dystrophy. LNPs are being investigated for delivering RNA-based therapies to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, 5 Parkinson's, 6 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Lastly, LNPs provide a valuable platform for delivering treatments for rare diseases where tailored therapies are urgently needed. \n\nWhile most applications and clinical trials involving LNPs have focused on RNA delivery, there is significant promise in using LNPs for DNA delivery. 7 They are a safer and more costeffective alternative to traditional viral vectors for delivering DNA, as they are nonimmunogenic and efficiently encapsulate DNA within their lipid bilayers. However, challenges such as low transfection efficiency (TE) and immune response still need to be addressed.",

Delivery of RNAi based drugs can utilize lipid-based (cholesterol and a-tocopherol) NPs, polymer-based (polyethylene-PEG) NPs, inorganic NPs and a range of exosomemimetic nanovesicles (27,28).\n\nLipid-based NPs (LNPs) include liposomes, micelles, emulsions and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs). LNPs also include stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALPs) (29), lipidoid nanoparticles (LNs), and SLNPs (30). LNPs have a biochemical structure (phosphate/sugar group) that mimics a cell membrane thus allowing fusion with a target cell membrane and its transport RNA into a target cell (24). LNPs, for example, are extensively used to deliver siRNA and small activating ds RNA (saRNA) that target gene promoters (7).\n\nPolymer-based NPs like Polyethylene (PEG) can be complexed with Polyvinylimine (PEI) to form a PEG-PEI based RNA conjugate that increases stability in vivo, as well as enhances the targeting of its RNA based cargo (31). PEG can also be complexed with Poly Lysine (PLL) and Poly Amidoamine (PAMAM) that consist of macromolecules designed to carry RNA. Natural polymers conjugated with RNA include chitosan, atelocollagen and Hyaluronic acid (HA) which, for example, readily binds to CD44 expressing cancer cells (32). Upon delivery in the cytoplasm, the RNAi cargo is released from the polymerbased NP by the cleavage of its di-sulfide linkages (22).\n\nNPs can use a ligand to target delivery where these conjugates promote improved binding and reduced immunogenicity. Upon cell entry the NPs can be separated (cleaved) to facilitate RNA loading into an AGO based RISC. For example, a Ga1NAc-siRNA conjugate readily binds to ASGPR thus",

            "text": "Drug and vaccine development in which the active drug substance is encapsulated with a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) has gained momentum over the past decade as an efficient drug delivery system [1,2]. Several lipid-based delivery systems have been clinically approved to deliver small drug molecules such as doxorubicin and vincristine [3]. In 2018, the first LNP-based drug containing small interfering RNA (siRNA) named Patisiran was approved for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis [4]. Additional LNPs are being evaluated clinically for delivery of a wide variety of nucleic acids, including siRNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), and plasmid DNA, for both therapeutic and vaccine purposes [5][6][7]. LNPs that encapsulate nucleic acid macromolecules are generally comprised of four components: (1) an ionizable amino lipid (cationic lipid); (2) a zwitterionic phospholipid such as 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) or 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC); (3) a neutral lipid such as cholesterol; and (4) a polyethylene glycol-lipid (PEG-lipid) [8]. The ionizable cationic lipid plays a principal role, for example, in siRNA transfection, by mediating cytosolic delivery of the siRNA through facilitated endosomal escape after LNP endocytosis. Neutral lipids, such as DSPC, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol, are selected to modulate the fluidity and phase behavior of the LNP, whereas PEG-lipids are utilized to improve particle circulation half-life and systemic exposure [9].",

[115] developed a novel branched ionizable lipid that significantly improved mRNA stability and delivery efficiency when contained in LNPs.LNPmediated delivery of mRNA vaccines could greatly improve the delivery efficiency of mRNA and without toxicity or unnecessary immunogenicity, making LNPs ideal carriers for developing mRNA tumor vaccines currently.LNPs have made good progress as nonviral delivery carriers to deliver mRNA to the cytoplasm, but the storage and transport of mRNA-LNP vaccines have limited their clinical applications.To solve the problem of storage and transportation, Jia et al. [116] constructed an mRNA nanovaccine using LNPs as a carrier for mRNA that achieved nanovaccine preservation by cross-linking with a hyaluronan dynamic hydrogel.This nanodrug delivery system significantly improved the stability of the mRNA vaccine.Western-blot data showed that compared to free mOVA-treated DC2.4 and RAW264.7 cells, the nanodrug delivery systemmediated mOVA-treated cells showed high expression of OVA, indicating that this nanodrug delivery system-mediated mOVA was not degraded (Fig. 8L and M).All of the above examples showed that nanodrug delivery systems could not only improve the delivery efficiency of tumor vaccines but also help preserve tumor vaccines, which have excellent clinical application prospects.In addition to vaccination applications, mRNA can be used to target immune cells in the vivo to achieve antitumor effects.",

            "text": "Beyond this obvious advantage, further development of LNP-based PDT agents has resulted in some new strategies in leveraging nanoparticles for PDT. \n\nOne optically active LNP agent was first reported by Lovell et al. (2011) with self-assembling porphyrin-lipid nanoparticles (Porphysomes) that exhibited high biocompatibility, minimal systemic toxicity (up to 1,000 mg/kg in mice), photothermal activation in the intact state and photodynamic activation when dissociated after cell uptake (Guidolin et al., 2021). Other iterations of Porphysomes have demonstrated theranostic capabilities with fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging (Muhanna et al., 2015). These examples show that LNP systems for PDT can not only gives the expected biocompatibility and distribution benefits as with chemotherapeutic payloads but can also present opportunities for unique new applications. Some drawbacks can still exist, however, namely, challenges in synthesis to achieve appropriate characteristics of size, polydispersity and encapsulation efficiency (Hou et al., 2021). Another issue is the tendency for LNP encapsulated PS to self-quench, which is why systems such as Porphysomes are not photodynamically active until dissociated into porphyrin-lipid monomers in vitro or in vivo (Muhanna et al., 2015). \n\nBeyond LNPs, the next most common nanocarrier platform for PSs is polymeric nanoparticles such as poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA). PLGA also has a track record of preclinical and clinical use to carry chemotherapeutic agents, albeit less developed than LNPs (Dinakaran et al., 2023). For the PLGA may have some advantages over LNP for photosensitizer delivery. PLGA is particularly effective at encapsulating strongly hydrophobic drugs such as PSs derived from porphyrins, hypocrellins and pthalocyanates (Kou et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Compared to viral vectors, non-viral vectors have the advantages of better biocompatibility, biodegradability, higher loading capacity, low cost, and ease of production (59). Due to their low toxicity and low immunogenicity, non-viral vectors are expected to replace viral vectors. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), a widely used therapeutic nucleic acid delivery vehicle, are typically tens to hundreds of nanometres and can penetrate cell membranes and deliver drugs into cells (60). LNP formulations currently approved for clinical use contain four lipid types: ionizable cationic lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids (61). Ionizable cationic lipids form complexes with negatively charged RNA molecules, and their pH sensitivity enhances the biocompatibility of LNP. At normal physiological pH, ionizable cationic lipids are uncharged, reducing their interaction with the anionic membranes of non-target cells. LNP preparations are usually carried out at acidic pH, where ionizable cationic lipids are protonated and able to bind negatively charged cargoes, destabilizing endosomal membranes and promoting the escape of RNA molecules (62). Therefore, incorporating ionizable cationic lipids into LNP formulations allows efficient payload encapsulation and improved in vivo circulation time and cellular uptake. Phospholipids are mainly found in the outer lipid layer of LNPs and play a role in stabilizing the LNP structure during particle formation. Combinations of phospholipids can be added to LNP formulations to modify their biophysical properties and promote optimal encapsulation, stability, and endosomal release (63). Cholesterol or its derivatives stabilize particles by modulating membrane integrity and rigidity, influencing particle distribution efficiency and biodistribution. PEG lipids enhance LNP stability, modulate particle size, prevent particle aggregation, reduce immunogenicity, and increase circulation time (64).",

Recently, they have gained significant interest, mainly due to the widespread use of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, which would not have been possible without LNP-based mRNA delivery. While many challenges remain in the development of safe and effective LNP-based drug delivery systems, further studies are needed to deepen our understanding of biological and chemical factors prior to broad clinical application. However, researchers assume that targeted delivery systems, such as LNPs, are likely to increase the efficacy and reduce side effects of existing therapies, e.g., immunotherapy, mRNA-based cancer vaccines or CAR therapy [22,26]. \n\nFrom our perspective, major challenges regarding the clinical implementation of LNPs in lung cancer treatment are (1) identifying the target and determining druggability, (2) predicting the quality and stability of LNPs, and (3) enabling specific tissue targeting and tumor penetration. \n\nOverall, however, we believe that LNPs have the potential to become an essential drug delivery system, overcome limitations of traditional therapeutic reagents and open new avenues for translational nanomedicine in lung cancer treatment.",

            "text": "The application of nanotechnology continues to provide effective strategies in treating various chronic diseases and improving treatment outcomes. Using nanocarrier systems such as liposomes, micelles, and nanoparticles for pulmonary drug delivery has been proven to be a promising noninvasive treatment strategy for achieving drug deposition and controlled release in the lungs [10] (Figure 1). These systems involve the use of engineered particles with dimensions on the nanometer scale to deliver drugs directly to target cells in the lungs [21]. Nanoparticles have several advantages over conventional drug delivery methods, including improved bioavailability, enhanced targeting, and reduced toxicity [22,23]. Liposomes are spherical vesicles composed of lipid bilayers that can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs [24]. The size, surface charge, and lipid composition of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be tailored to enhance drug stability, prolong circulation time, and improve biocompatibility [25]. Furthermore, conjugating small-molecule ligands, peptides [26], or monoclonal antibodies [27] to the surface of an LNP can endow it with targeting ability. For example, folate receptors are often found to be overexpressed on macrophages, which makes folate-coupled LNP a great option for delivering antiinflammatory drugs [28]. There are many factors that can affect the release of cargo carried by LNPs, including temperature, changes in pH values, enzymes, light, etc. Among them, the mechanism of pH change is the most studied, and can cause LNPs to undergo phase transition and achieve higher membrane permeability [29]. \n\nIn addition to LNPs, there are also some other nanoparticles that have their own characteristics (Table 1). Micelles are another kind of nanoparticle consisting of amphiphilic molecules that form a core-shell structure [30]. Their great solubility allows them to easily penetrate the increased alveolar fluid barrier present in chronic inflammatory lung diseases.",

            "text": "mRNA presents great potential in the application of viral vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, and genome editing [4,52,53]. Nucleic acid is highly susceptible to degradation by several nucleases in vivo [3], so it is required for the development of effective and safe drug delivery systems (DDSs) to reach specific target cells and produce potent and predictable effects. At present, different types of delivery methods have been commonly exploited as DDSs for nucleic acids (Figure 2) [54]. Particular attention has been paid to designing lipid-based mRNA DDSs that protect nucleic acids and ensure their targeted delivery, controlled release, and enhanced cellular uptake. Nanoparticles have a wide range of biomedical applications due to their advanced technology [56]. In particular, LNPs are among the most commonly used mRNA delivery vehicles in both preclinical and clinical studies [57][58][59]. LNPs may present a micelle-like",

            "text": "The effective delivery of drugs and molecules for disease therapy has been met with many challenges over the years. This is mainly due to limitations of free drug/molecule administration including a lack of stability in the body, poor bioavailability, tissue absorption issues with specificity, and undesirable adverse effects [113]. To overcome these issues, nanotechnology has been exploited to improve the efficacy of drug delivery. Since their development in 1965, lipid particles (LNPs) have gained attention as nano-drug carriers due to their size and ability to traffic small molecules [115]. In the 1990s, LNPs were FDA approved for encapsulating small molecules such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin for cancer treatment [116,117]. Within the last decade, further advances have been made with clinical trials utilising LNP-mRNA vaccine formulations for cancer immunotherapy and against SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the recent COVID-19 pandemic (NCT02316457) [118]. A study by Alanazi et. al has shown that 5-fluorouracil-loaded lipid particles demonstrate a higher in vitro cytotoxicity compared to free drug alone when treated on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells [119]. Despite multiple benefits attributed to the application of liposomes as drug delivery systems, there are many disadvantages associated with their application. Some limitations associated with LNPs include high production costs and comparatively reduced drug loading efficiency due to their structure [120,121]. Due to these LNP-associated drawbacks, the appropriate drug delivery is often hindered, and undesirable side effects can occur, such as drug expulsion [121]. \n\nIn order to overcome LNP drug delivery problems, EVs have recently been considered as the next-generation drug delivery platform [122,123]. EVs are known to possess multiple advantageous characteristics that deem them ideal drug delivery vehicles. One of the major characteristics of EVs is their ability to cross biological barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier, efficiently whilst keeping their structure intact [20]. Another advantage of using EVs as drug vehicles is their ability to reduce the cytotoxicity of drugs.",

            "text": "It is preferable to deliver mRNA based on lipid nanoparticles through endocytosis and then by electrostatic binding, as well as through fusion with the cell membrane through reverse non-bilayer lipid phases. This is because they play a role in protecting the mRNA of lipid nanoparticles, which increases cellular uptake and thus increases endosomal escape to facilitate cytoplasmic delivery (Figure 5) [63]. So far, we have described the many benefits of using lipid nanoparticles in the context of effective vaccination due to their ability to train the immune system [63]. \n\nIn delivering mRNA through nanoparticles, LNPs have two important roles: \n\n(1) Promotion of the release of mRNA from the endosome to the cytoplasm; \n\n(2) Control of the uptake of mRNA into the target host cell. \n\nAs a result, they can provide mRNA bioavailability to ribosomes, in which it produces antigen mRNA, and as mentioned, LNPs can protect mRNA from being destroyed by extracellular RNases by encapsulating them within the nucleus. Another responsibility of LNPs is to improve cellular uptake through various endocytosis pathways, so the postendocytic stage is when LNPs are trapped within the endosome. Despite all of the above, unknown mechanisms still exist and further research is required [44]. The presence of LNPs is useful in delivering mRNA to intracellular ribosomes. After the intramuscular injection of LNP vaccines, extensive local tissue exposure to the injection site is provided by LNPs. Of course, the pharmacokinetics of these vaccines depend on several factors, including surface charge, particle size, the colloidal stability of LNPs, and the biodegradability of cationic or ionizable lipids. LNPs less than 150 nm in size have been shown to be depleted through afferent lymph vessels. Larger LNPs are readily delivered by phagocytic immune cells and then to the lymph nodes [36,44]. In delivering mRNA through nanoparticles, LNPs have two important roles:",

This interest in LNP research has been driven by emerging mRNA-based therapies for several diseases, the execution of which depends on the availability of safe and effective carrier systems. Furthermore, lipid type, size, morphology, and surface charge influence the behavior of LNPs in vivo. It was a long way to optimize LNP fabrication to deliver nucleic acids, which is now probably best characterized by the development of lipid-based mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. Moderna's mRNA-1273 and BioNTech/Pfizer's BNT162b2 vaccines both use LNPs as delivery vehicles of mRNA, expecting to have a significant descending trend of COVID-19 incidence and mortality. mRNA vaccines deliver mRNA into the cytoplasm of host cells, where it can be transcribed into spike proteins to trigger the immune response. However, negative charge of mRNA electrostatically resists the anionic cell membrane, thus preventing its uptake. For that reason, mRNA vaccines require a carrier that not only protects them from degradation but also allows them to enter cells (\"Let's talk about lipid n, 2021).",

            "text": "Lipid-based delivery systems, such as micelles, liposomes, and LNP, can be easily synthesized through chemical reactions [117,118]. The efficiency of delivering RNA therapy to the liver is greatly improved by distinct chemical structures and more reasonable lipid molecular design. LNPs are one of the most widely used non-viral delivery systems for oligonucleotide drugs and mRNA vaccines, and their advantages include ease of production, biodegradability, protection of the embedded RNA from RNase degradation and renal clearance, promotion of cellular uptake, and endosomal escape [119,120]. Recently, LNP has received global attention as an important component of mRNA vaccines, playing a key role in effectively protecting and transporting mRNA into cells. Polymers are the second largest class of nucleic aciddelivery vehicles after lipids. Cationic polymers form stable complexes with anionic nucleic acids, providing a versatile, scalable, and easily adaptable platform for efficient nucleic acid delivery while minimizing the immune response and cytotoxicity [121]. The efficiency of RNA delivery into cells can be altered by adjusting polymer polarity, degradation, and molecular weight. Dendrimers are another type of polymer that deliver RNA [122]. These macromolecules are centered on a core molecule and synthesize highly branched polymers via repetitive growth reactions. Modifying the dendrimer structure can protect nucleotides from enzymatic degradation. \n\nWith the development of nanomaterials, inorganic nanocarriers provide a unique platform for the effective delivery of nucleic acid drugs to tumor cells due to their high stability, good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and mass production, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) [123,124], silica nanoparticles [125], and carbon nanotubes. AuNPs are [126] a classical inorganic nanocarrier with good chemical stability and biocompatibility [127]. Nucleic acid chains are covalently attached to the AuNP core via mercaptan groups. The abovementioned NU-0129 is a siRNA drug designed based on AuNPs to target the oncogene Bcl2L12 in GBM treatment.",

They claimed that the bilayer nanoparticles of the LPP provided better mRNA encapsulation and progressive release of mRNA molecules with polymer degradation as well as excellent dendritic cell targeting for better activation of T-cell immune responses through antigen presentation [41]. Using the SW-BIC-213 delivery platform, a new COVID-19 vaccine has been developed and is currently in phase I trials [42]. Furthermore, to enhance the stability of mRNA, Jacob A. Poliskey et al. utilized a PEGylated polyacridine peptide to bind double-stranded mRNA (dsmRNA) to generate dsmRNA polyplexes that were metabolically stable in the circulation. In addition, Yoshinaga et al. complexed mRNA with derived poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(cationic) block copolymers with phenylboronic acid and polyol groups to obtain polycomposite micelles (PM) with ATP-responsive cross-linked mRNA loading in the inner core to prevent enzymatic degradation [43,44]. \n\nCompared to conventional cationic polymeric carriers, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) made with ionizable lipids have shown many advantages: good biocompatibility, high nucleic acid encapsulation and effective transfection, high tissue penetration for delivery of therapeutic agents, intelligent drug release, low off-target effects, and low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity. Hence, LNPs have become the most studied and widely used third-generation mRNA delivery system [45,46], which has greatly contributed to the development of the mRNA industry and clinical applications such as the application of LNP-assisted mRNA delivery for potent cancer immunotherapy [47]. As shown in Table 3, for nucleic acid drugs, LNPs have more advantages than other delivery systems in terms of the encapsulation effect, expression efficiency, and safety in vitro and vivo.",

            "text": "Nanoparticle chemistry has application to gene and drug delivery. Nanoparticle-based gene delivery, either lipidbased nanoparticles (LNPs) or polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs), are technologies centered on the encapsulation of the payload [230]. The cellular plasma membrane is negatively charged, which makes it difficult for negatively charged pDNA and mRNA to enter the cells by diffusion. Cationic nanoparticles bind to pDNA and mRNA to form lipoplexes and polyplexes that harbor a net positive charge and can enter the cell through endocytosis [231]. \n\nLipid molecules have been used to transport genetic material into cells for a long time [232,233]. Modern LNP systems appeared around the year 2000 to deliver DNA. They consist of four components: phospholipid, lipid-anchored polyethylene glycol (PEG), cholesterol, and ionizable lipid [234,235]. The recent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines utilized this four-component LNP system demonstrating the efficiency and safety of delivering genetic material [236][237][238]. \n\nTheir main drawback is the limited capacity to undergo endosomal escape, which affects the amount of genetic material that may reach the cytoplasm [239]. By incorporating the component that could target specific molecules, LNP delivery systems have the potential for precise in vivo delivery. This aspect was highlighted in a recent study using T cell-targeting LNPs to deliver mRNA encoding the CAR in vivo [172]. Overall, LNPs have low toxicity due to the natural and biological origin of the components and, under proper storage conditions, they may be stable for up to 150 days [240]. \n\nPNPs are another type of vehicle used for drug delivery, composed of natural carbohydrate polymers or synthetic polymers. Some PNP-based systems may exhibit higher stability and mechanical resistance compared to LNP-based systems [241][242][243]. The natural polymer chitosan (CS) is a cationic polysaccharide obtained from the exoskeleton of crustaceans such as crabs and shrimps.",

Consequently, further optimization of LNP formulations is essential for improving their efficacy. Meanwhile, there are currently no clinical trials specifically assessing oral LNPs for CNS disease. This gap in the research highlights an area that warrants further investigation, and we hope that future studies will focus on addressing this issue. \n\nThe lack of established regulatory guidelines from the FDA or other regulatory bodies for products containing nanomaterials presents a significant challenge in the approval of nanomedicines for clinical use. Currently, the evaluation of nanomaterials primarily emphasizes toxicity concerns and the potential commercial benefits of nanoparticles, which can delay both the approval process and subsequent market entry. In addition, research on LNPs has largely concentrated on enhancing target specificity and efficient deposition. Multifunctional LNPs, which combine therapeutic efficacy with target specificity, have also been developed. Concurrently, research is ongoing to explore the potential of conjugating LNPs with other drugs and carrier molecules to further enhance therapeutic outcomes. To validate the effectiveness of LNPs, it is essential to develop and assess their safety in various disease conditions, as well as evaluate novel combination strategies through clinical studies.",

Precise, efficient delivery reduces damage to normal cells, improves treatment effect, and reduces the amount of drug used, hence the growing academic interest in gene delivery. To design more efficient and less harmful delivery vectors, non-viral vectors are gradually replacing the traditional viral vectors. As the most advanced non-viral vectors, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely used, such as Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine \u2014\u2014 a vaccine with a prevention efficacy of up to 75% was designed within a short research and development cycle.

This follows a series of clinical successes beginning with patisiran (Onpattro\u00ae), the first approved RNA interference drug [3,5]. Particularly, the mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines marketed by Moderna and Pfizer, are a great example to show how research and development of drug delivery systems (DDSs) over the years has contributed to the health and welfare of humanity [6,7].\n\nLNPs refer to all nanoparticles composed of lipids, including a variety of classes such as liposomes. Nowadays, the term is often used to refer to stable nucleic acid-lipid nanoparticles, particularly in the field of nucleic acid and mRNA DDSs; therefore, this article follows this narrow usage. The strategy for developing LNPs for delivering nucleic acid and mRNA-based therapeutics has been fairly established, and several review articles focusing on the concepts, basic components, and fundamental technologies have already been published [1e4,8e10]. Thus, they are only briefly described here.\n\nIonizable lipids play a critical role in LNPs [11e13]. Dlin-MC3-DMA [14], used in patisiran, SM-102 [15] and SS-cleavable pHactivated lipid-like material (ssPalm) [16,17], which are biodegradable lipids, and lipidoid C12-200 [18e20] are a few examples for this. In addition to the encapsulation of nucleic acids and mRNAs into LNPs, ionizable lipids contribute to efficient endosomal escape and release of nucleic acids and mRNAs from LNPs after uptake by cells ( Fig. 1) [12]. One of the major challenges in designing DDS was that polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification improved the blood stability of nanoparticle formulations after systemic administration, but also inhibited their uptake into target cells [21e23]. A simple strategy to overcome this problem was the development of 1,2",

            "text": "The targeted delivery of therapeutic molecules to specific sites in the body represents an active area of research in the biomedical sciences involving scientists, clinicians and engineers alike. To be successful, drug delivery systems must overcome limitations that normally render a pharmaceutical agent ineffective, such as biological barriers and poor biodistribution to the desired site of action. At present, several delivery platforms have been incorporated into clinically used products, including viral vectors, molecular conjugates, antibody-drug conjugates and nanoparticles. Of those, nanoparticles are a particularly promising delivery platform because of their capacity to load different types of drugs separately or in combination, their minimal immunogenicity and their easily modulated properties through controlled chemical synthesis 1 .\n\nOne application that has received substantial attention recently is the delivery of nucleic acids for therapeutics and vaccines. Most notably, the rapid and successful deployment of the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna represented a turning point for drug delivery 2,3 . These vaccines rely on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery system to shuttle mRNA past multiple biological barriers that would otherwise prevent efficacy. With over a billion doses of mRNA-LNP vaccines administered globally, LNPs for nucleic acid delivery represent one of the most widely used drug products in history. Additionally, LNPs as delivery platforms have been leveraged in multiple clinical trials for applications such as vaccination, protein replacement therapy, cancer immunotherapy, RNA interference and gene editing 4 . LNPs feature high potency, biocompatibility and the ability to be administered repeatedly, all of which are properties that favour clinical translation 4 . Therefore, it is timely to reflect on the lessons learnt from the successful development of LNPs to help devise design criteria for new clinically translatable nanoparticles based on LNPs and related materials. Polymers represent another class of materials with emerging utility for nucleic acid delivery. Multiple biomedical products, such as controlled release depots and absorbable sutures, already incorporate polymers, laying a foundation for successful clinical translation, and their properties can be controlled using chemical synthesis to produce efficacious delivery systems 5,6 . Collectively, lipid and polymer nanoparticles represent the largest",

            "text": "LNPs are amphiphilic systems composed of various hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, such as cationic or ionized lipids, neutral lipids such as phospholipids or cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol-lipids. LNPs are structurally different from liposomes because LNPs have no continuous lipid bilayer or large internal pool [143]. LNPs were developed as carriers to deliver a variety of molecules to cells, especially with unique advantages in nucleic acid delivery. Because nucleic acids are extremely unstable outside the cell and carry a large amount of anions, they cannot easily pass through the cell membrane. However, encapsulation in cationic liposomes allows easy delivery of nucleic acids into cells. Compared with traditional drug therapy, LNPs have unique advantages including preventing drug degradation, enabling targeted drug delivery, and reducing drug toxicity, which has generated high interest in LNPs for delivery of anti-cancer drugs [144]. Pre-clinical trials show that LNPs can successfully deliver siRNA or mRNA [145,146], so LNPs seem to be a safe and effective delivery tool. \n\nIn the past few years, many preclinical studies of CRISPR/Cas9 delivery leveraged LNPs. Two main methods are used for LNP delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 components: delivery of Cas9 and sgRNA plasmid DNA or mRNA, or delivery of Cas9: sgRNA RNP complex. Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA can be efficiently loaded on LNPs and accurately transported to the liver of mice, effectively mediating mouse transthyretin (Ttr) gene editing [147]. Despite some progress, predicting and rationally designing LNPs for delivery to target tissues other than the liver for precise gene editing remains a problem. In 2020, Cheng et al. created a strategy called selective organ targeting (SORT) by adding supplementary components on the basis of traditional LNPs, precisely changing the profile of RNA delivery in the body and mediating tissuespecific gene editing [148]. SORT allows nanoparticles to deliver gene editing systems to specific organs, which is expected to promote further development of gene correction therapies.",

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are primarily Fig. 1 Diverse nanomedicine systems can be integrated with microneedle technologies for disease monitoring, diagnosis, and therapy comprised of cationic ionizable lipids [71]. In contrast to the hollow core of liposomes, LNPs form a micelle structure with a solid core [72]. LNPs are typically composed of a mixture of lipids, which include ionizable cationic lipids to facilitate cellular uptake, phospholipids to form structures, cholesterol to improve stability, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids to provide steric stabilization [73]. The high stability, simple synthesis, high encapsulation efficiency, and strong transfection capacity make LNPs the gold standard for nucleic acid delivery [74]. Both FDA-approved mRNA vaccines for Covid-19 (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) use LNPs as nanocarriers [41]. Applications of LNPs are currently limited by immunogenicity and uncontrolled biodistribution to organs other than the liver and spleen [75]. \n\nPolymer-based nanoparticles are synthesized from polymers, which are large molecules made of repeating monomers [71]. The properties of polymer-based nanoparticles-including release profiles, targeting, stability, responsiveness, and ability to encapsulate a wide range of agents [76]-can be precisely controlled by modulating polymer chemistry and particle composition [77]. Due to this tunability, polymer-based nanoparticles have gained significant attention in healthcare applications such as gene therapy [42], cancer therapy [45], and diagnosis [48]. Polymeric nanoparticles can be synthesized from either natural polymers-such as chitosan and Poly(Llysine)-or synthetic polymers-such as Poly(lactideco-glycolide), polylactide acid, and poly(caprolactone) [78].",

            "text": "mRNA-LNP therapy is an innovative nucleic acid therapy method that uses lipid nanoparticles as carriers to deliver mRNA into cells, enabling the regulation of specific genes. This approach is characterized by strong targeting, high delivery efficiency, and relatively good safety, making it a promising treatment for certain diseases. The successful application of mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly advanced the development of mRNA-LNP technology, offering new possibilities for treating a wide range of diseases, such as cancer, infectious diseases, and genetic diseases. Given that the physical properties of LNPs, such as particle size, morphology, and surface properties, are significantly affected by the structure and composition of lipids, the efficacy, safety, and drug distribution of LNPs can be improved by optimizing the lipid composition. In addition, the development of targeted mRNA-LNP delivery technologies for specific tissues and cells could further improve the therapeutic efficacy and safety of mRNA-LNPs, expand the application of mRNA technology, and promote advancement of the field. \n\nNon-viral vectors such as LNPs can efficiently load mRNA, improve the transfection efficiency, and trigger an immune response, thereby increasing antibody titers. Biodegradable LNPs can be rapidly eliminated from plasma and tissues, improving their safety and tolerability. Cationic lipids play a key role in determining the delivery efficiency and transfection efficiency of mRNA-LNP preparations, and the toxicity of the vector is related to the structure of the cationic lipids. To improve mRNA delivery efficiency, lipid head groups and hydrophobic tails can be modulated to increase the cellular uptake and endosomal escape of LNPs. In addition, the modulation of the lipid structure enables the cell-specific and tissue-specific delivery of LNPs. As the expression of mRNA in cells is transient, repeated injections of LNPs loaded with mRNA are often required to maintain the therapeutic effects. However, repeated injections may elicit an immune response, such as the production of antibodies against PEG, which may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Therefore, the search for disease-specific mRNA or the development of strategies that can prolong mRNA expression are important for improving drug efficacy and reducing the frequency of injections.",

Notable examples include the lymphocyte-targeting LNPs recently developed by Kraft and the co-workers [163]. In this study, three antiretroviral drugs including lopinavir (hydrophobic), ritonavir (hydrophobic) and tenofovir (hydrophilic) were encapsulated in LNPs. This formulation enables a long-lasting drug profile in plasma and an improved drug levels in lymph nodes of macaques models. Furthermore, LNPs are especially designed for encapsulating nucleic acids (e.g. DNA, siRNA, mRNA and saRNA). \n\nNon-viral vectors have emerged as a safer and versatile alternative to viral vectors (e.g. lentivirus and adenovirus vectors) due to their absence of immunogenic viral proteins. Among the non-viral gene vectors, LNPs have shown robust capability to deliver oligonucleotides in sizes ranging from several nucleotides (e.g. RNA) to millions of nucleotides (e.g. chromosome). The application of LNPs as delivery vehicle for RNA drugs was first approved by the US FDA in 2018 [164]. In late 2020, LNPs become widely known after some pharmaceutical industries developed COVID-19 vaccines using PEGylated LNPs as the delivery vehicle for the fragile mRNA strands [145]. Notable examples include the most advanced mRNA-based vaccines (e.g. mRNA-1237 and BNT162), developed by Moderna, Biontech, Pfizer and Fosun Pharma. The clinical trials investigating the safety, immunogenicity, tolerability and potential efficacy of these vaccine formulations are still ongoing (NCT04368728, NCT04380701, NCT04283461).",

The physical properties of these nanoparticles allow the efficient packaging of the cargo of interest, the uptake of LNPs by endocytosis with a low toxicity profile and finally release their cargo once a lower pH is encountered in the endosomes (Figure 2B) [191,192].

Their versatile nature enables the encapsulation and targeting of various types of medically relevant molecular cargo, including oligonucleotides, proteins, and small molecules for the treatment of diseases, such as cancer. Cancers that form solid tumors are particularly relevant for LNP\u2010based therapeutics due to the enhanced permeation and retention effect that allows nanoparticles to accumulate within the tumor tissue. Additionally, LNPs can be formulated for both locoregional and systemic delivery depending on the tumor type and stage. To date, LNPs have been used extensively in the clinic to reduce systemic toxicity and improve outcomes in cancer patients by encapsulating chemotherapeutic drugs. Next\u2010generation lipid nanoparticles are currently being developed to expand their use in gene therapy and immunotherapy, as well as to enable the co\u2010encapsulation of multiple drugs in a single system. Other developments include the design of targeted LNPs to specific cells and tissues, and triggerable release systems to control cargo delivery at the tumor site. This review paper highlights recent developments in LNP drug delivery formulations and focuses on the treatment of solid tumors, while also discussing some of their current translational limitations and potential opportunities in the field.",

[171,172] However, the challenges still exist for the application of different types of nanoparticle carriers. Lipid NPs are favored by vaccine developers because they have a high drug delivery efficiency and are easily manufactured. The current use of microfluidics to generate LNPs, which encapsulate mRNA in LNPs before entering the body, is the only FDA-approved mRNA delivery technology on the market, and its safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in this pandemic. [173] However, improving the stability of LNP vaccines remains a challenge, particularly in the case of non-thermal formulations. Although materials such as polyethylene glycol can improve the stability of the system, recent reports have shown that mRNA cargoes in Pfizer/Biotech and Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine must still be held at ultra-low temperatures to maintain their stability. [174] o address this issue, the application of engineered nanoscale transport systems can help to improve the overall thermal stability of the cargo carried, and optimizing the appropriate route of administration can help to improve the effectiveness and durability of drug-or vaccine-induced immune protection. \n\nProtein assembly based vaccine candidates are another powerful strategy due to their plasticity and diversity. [175] The use of protein assemblies has several advantages over other nanocarriers: [175][176][177][178] (1) they allow multiple pathogenic units to be retained in an assembled structure, maintaining the original activity of the assembly; (2) repetitive surface patterns and a particulate structure that triggers a strong immune response, and (3) they can be designed to prevent enrichment and amplification of pathogenic components. However, for generic vaccine applications, the selection of VLP candidates based on the type of immune response and the development of effective design strategies remain challenging.",

A variety of delivery platform vehicles are under development to target immune cells, such as antibodies (16), polymers (17), aptamers (18), and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (19,20). In comparison to other NPs, LNPs have attractive biological properties, which include general biocompatibility, biodegradability, and the ability to entrap both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs (15,21). Multiple properties of LNPs can be altered via different lipid composition and ratios or by surface chemistry, including their size, charge, and surface functionality (22). LNPs serve as carriers for a variety of therapeutic molecules: from nucleic acid to proteins, small molecules and chemotherapy drugs, and combinations of the aforementioned agents (22)(23)(24). LNPs shelter their cargo from clearance in the surrounding biological milieu, increasing the half-life in circulation, minimizing systemic toxicity, and hence enabling a wide therapeutic window (15,22,25). In addition, LNPs can promote delivery of their cargo directly to specific immune cell, such as APC or T-lymphocytes (20,26,27). Here, we review the latest developments in nanoparticle-based cancer immunotherapy, centering on LNPs.",

LNPs like liposomes, emulsions, nanocapsules, nanospheres, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and exosomes are employed in drug delivery and the diagnosis of cancer [186,187]. LNPs are spherical nanovesicles comprised of phospholipids, cholesterol, and solid and liquid lipids, and are used to entrap hydrophobic drugs as well as hydrophilic drugs. In addition to these, they also contain surfactants and co-surfactants used to reduce the interfacial tension between two phases and form a monophasic layer. Various anticancer therapeutics have already been formulated as liposomal formulations such as lipoplatin, which is a cisplatin-loaded liposome [188]. Various studies inferred that compared to PNPs, LNPs are considered more beneficial for treatment, because the LNPs are composed of GRAS-recognized biocompatible and biodegradable lipids, making them safe for delivery [189]. was observed that the ICAM-1-targeted Lcn2-liposomes mediated a strong interaction or binding with the TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231) compared to the interaction of the noncancerous cells (MCF-10A) with the TNBC cells. Additionally, it was observed that the knockdown of Lcn2 through ICAM-1-targeted Lcn2-liposomes resulted in a significant decrease in the generation of VEGF (Figure 9), which led to decreased angiogenesis both in vitro as well as in vivo [190].

            "text": "One major reason for using LNP is their ability to control drug release kinetics. The drug delivery kinetics from LNP depends on their composition, the nature of the active molecule, and its localization inside the nanoparticle. The interactions between the active molecule and the liquid and solid lipids are especially crucial. In vitro tests have shown that LNP dispersions generally provide a prolonged release of loaded drugs [7]. The constraints of the in vivo environment can, however, require some adaptations to the design of LNP. To improve the blood half-life of the particles, PEG-based surfactants can be included as membrane ingredients. Adding PEG chains on the surface of the nanoparticle allows to prolong systemic circulation time and decrease immunogenicity [27,28]. \n\nWhile LNP provide stability and enhance the solubility of hydrophobic active molecules, drug release from LNP still, sometimes, displays a characteristic burst effect profile. This is especially the case when the active molecule is located both in the core and at the membrane of the lipid nanoparticle [5]. This specific kinetics can be desirable for transdermal delivery; it creates a mono-layer of the active ingredient on the skin, improving the drug permeation through the stratum corneum [29,30]. However, it is also often seen as undesirable because of its contribution to local or systemic drug toxicity and because it also reduces the blood half-time of the drug. It may lead to a poor delivery of the active ingredient and a poor therapeutic outcome. \n\nMoreover, when LNP are used for dermal, transdermal or ocular drug delivery, they need to be dispersed in a 3D mechanical matrix to remain at the administration site to prevent undesired systemic and local side-effects (irritation, inflammation). The encapsulation of LNP inside a suitable delivery vehicle could prevent such negative features. Indeed, a double encapsulation system-drug loaded into LNP, themselves entrapped in a vehicle material-could provide spatial and temporal control over drug delivery. Moreover, the vehicle, as is the case for certain hydrogels, can display interesting properties such as muco-adhesion and enhanced biocompatibility [31].",

These nanoparticles enable precise drug delivery to target cells, controlled release, and targeted distribution through surface modification with ligands. They are currently being developed as drug delivery systems for various substances and vaccines on the market, including AmBisome, DepoCyt, Doxil, Inflexal, Myocet, Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, and Moderna mRNA vaccines. 1,2 Nanoparticles have garnered significant attention in drug delivery due to their unique properties, such as a high surface area-to-volume ratio, the ability to traverse biological barriers, and the capacity to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs. Various types of nanoparticles, including polymeric, inorganic, and lipid-based nanoparticles, have been developed for drug delivery applications. 3 ipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) constitute a subclass of nanoparticles composed primarily of lipids, which have garnered significant attention in recent years. LNPs present several advantages over alternative nanoparticle systems, including high stability, biocompatibility, and the capability to target specific cells or tissues. This targeted approach enhances drug efficacy while mitigating side effects. Moreover, the customization of LNPs through surface modification with targeting ligands further refines their specificity toward desired cells or tissues, thus optimizing drug delivery efficiency. Structurally, LNPs typically comprise a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core, forming a versatile platform for drug encapsulation. This architecture facilitates the encapsulation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs within the lipid bilayer or aqueous core, respectively, enabling the simultaneous delivery of multiple therapeutic agents. Moreover, the lipid bilayer contributes to the stability of LNPs in biological environments, shielding encapsulated drugs from degradation and extending their circulation time in the bloodstream. 3,4 LNPs can be synthesized using various techniques, such as sonication, 5 microfluidics, 6 and extrusion. 7",

Although the LNPs described here, similar to other nanoparticle delivery systems, yield liver delivery, our top LNP A10 resulted in the lowest liver:placenta ratio compared to the other formulations tested. In the future, we will incorporate targeting ligands into LNPs to improve placental targeting and minimize off-target effects to maternal tissues. Finally, our biodistribution results using luciferase mRNA encapsulated in LNPs demonstrated no delivery of LNPs to the fetus. This, combined with our toxicity analysis, suggests no adverse effects of LNPs to fetuses. These results support the use of LNPs, and in particular, LNP A10, for mRNA delivery to the placenta to treat diseases that originate from placental dysfunction.",

For example, LNPs containing lipidoid 306Oi10 targeted and expressed protein predominantly in the liver via i.v. injection, while the LNPs accumulated in the pancreas (11%), kidneys (12%), and lungs (15%) and expressed protein in the liver (67%), pancreas (17%), and spleen (13%); similarly, the LNPs drained through capillaries and the lymphatic system when administered via s.c. and i.m. 244 It has been reported that cholesteryl-based disulfide bond-containing biodegradable cationic liposome nanoparticles OCholB LNPs have demonstrated the successful delivery of mRNA molecules in the skeletal muscle (via intramuscular injection), lung and spleen (via intravenous injection), and brain (via lateral ventricle infusion). 162 CARTs preferentially targeted professional APCs in secondary lymphoid organs upon i.v. injections and targeted local APCs upon s.c. injection. 179 herefore, the optimal therapeutic efficacy can only be achieved by selecting the appropriate mRNA delivery vectors and routes of administration. Col ectively, LNP-mRNA therapeutics (good manufacturing practices, stability, storage, and safety) have great potential in the treatment of infectious diseases, cancer, and genetic diseases. The development of mRNA delivery systems with high efficiency and safety is of great significance for the wide application of mRNA-based therapeutics. \n\nAPPLICATION mRNA-based therapeutics are expected to become a powerful therapy for a variety of refractory diseases, including infectious diseases, metabolic genetic diseases, cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and other diseases (Fig. 7). A large number of studies have shown that mRNA cannot only mediate better transfection efficiency and longer protein expression but also has greater advantages than DNA and traditional protein drugs; mRNA initiates protein transient translation when reaching the cytoplasm without inserting into the genome, which has a lower insertion risk compared with traditional protein and DNA drugs.",

            "text": "LIPID NANOPARTICLES FOR MRNA DELIVERY Due to their size, polyanionic nature, and hydrophilicity, the intracellular delivery of mRNA molecules cannot generally rely on passive diffusion across cell membranes. Furthermore, nucleic acids are rapidly degraded by endogenous nucleases in physiological fluids. To overcome these challenges, LNPs incorporating ionizable lipids have been developed as delivery vehicles for siRNA and mRNA, serving both to protect the delicate cargo from degradation in vivo and to enable delivery into the cell. LNPs for mRNA delivery generally comprise a zwitterionic phospholipid, cholesterol, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid, and an ionizable lipid. 45,46 Engineering the lipid structure 47 and particle surface has thus been pursued as a strategy to enhance cellular uptake and endosomal escape 48,49 while specific nanostructural features of the LNP, such as nonlamellar lipid phases, have also been suggested to affect delivery efficiency. 50 LNP interfacial interactions with the cell membrane initiate the internalization of the mRNA; then, inside the cell, the more acidic environment protonates the ionizable lipid, reversing the electrostatic interactions to release the RNA cargo for translation and subsequent protein expression. This is of course an oversimplified description, and the reader is directed to some excellent recent reviews that address these intracellular aspects in more detail. 45,51 The LNP morphology, lipid packing, and microenvironment of the encapsulated mRNA are thus plausibly connected to the delivery efficiency, emphasizing the central significance of higher-order structure associated with both the mRNA and LNP. \n\nThe challenges of LNP preparative scale-up and large-scale processing represent another interesting point of distinction between mRNA-vaccines and biologic drugs. While LNPs may be prepared at bench-scale using pipets and simple manual mixing, 52 their cGMP scale-up for clinical/commercial use employs finely controllable rapid-mixing platforms involving multiple processing steps. 53,54 In contrast, the large-scale production of many biologic drugs can be based on relatively simple thaw\u2212filter\u2212fill drug product production processes.",

            "text": "The nanoscale conventional LDDS includes lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), micelles, dendrimers, liposomes, nanoparticles, and other nanomaterials. The delivery systems are documented to deliver the diagnostic and therapeutic agents into the LS (Permana et al. 2021;He et al. 2022). Among these cargoes, LNPs are promising LDDS tools for targeting drugs to the LS due to the inherent lymphatic tropism of these materials in the nanoscale range (He et al. 2022, Noor, 2021, Agrawal et al. 2022). Consequently, LNPs can augment anticancer localization in lymph after metastases of the tumor. This increases the therapeutic effect and lowers the toxicities of anticancer agents (Agrawal et al. 2022). The nonpolar core of LNPs expands the cellular uptake and absorption of lipophilic drugs into the lymph node. Therefore, LNPs are the perfect carrier for treating intracellular infections, such as leishmaniasis, tuberculosis, and parasitic infection (Mitra, 2011). The specific surface modifications with ligands like mannose, or PEG improves macrophage uptake and hence effectively eradicate parasites hiding in macrophages (Agrawal et al. 2022). \n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the developed vaccines were loaded with LNPs that stimulate antibody production following lymphatic delivery of mRNA (He et al. 2022, Noor 2021). Pfizer and Moderna companies launched vaccines against the coronavirus that consist of mRNA loaded within LNPs (Weiss et al. 2020). Moreover, the developed LNPs were engineered with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to produce PEGylated LNPs that increase the stability of the prepared formulation during storage (Cross 2021). \n\nAdditionally, liposomes have selective targeting of anticancer in lymphatic tissue through subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injections (Li et al. 2019b). The drug entrapped in liposomal vesicles was selectively carried onto lymphatic tissue.",

Research has shown that LNPs can be customized for efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs, emphasizing the necessity for stability during nebulization and effective penetration through mucus [64]. \n\nIn oncology, LNPs play a crucial role in targeted drug delivery for lung cancer. By encapsulating chemotherapeutic agents or gene therapies, LNPs enable precise localization within lung tumors, enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity and adverse effects [65,66]. \n\nFurthermore, LNPs loaded with anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics hold promise for treating inflammatory lung diseases by delivering drugs directly to affected areas, thereby improving patient outcomes and quality of life [66,67]. \n\nCurcumin's anti-lung cancer effects are attributed to its potent antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties, as well as its ability to enhance apoptosis [68] (Table 2). Inhalation delivery enhances topotecan exposure to lung tissue and improves its effectiveness against lung cancer [35]. Celecoxib was encapsulated in nanostructured lipid carriers, and their lung deposition in mice revealed that these carriers exhibited favorable fine particle fraction and mass median aerodynamic diameter [69]. Fluticasone propionate (FP)-loaded solid LNPs are more effective in managing oxidative stress compared to FP treatment alone [36]. Inhaled delivery of Irinotecan has shown promise, especially as a second-line therapy for small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) [37]. NLD1, which incorporates high levels of PEG-lipid and cationic lipid helper, demonstrates that increasing PEG content in LNPs improves mRNA delivery to the lungs via nebulization [39]. The optimized lipid nanoparticles for nebulized mRNA delivery to the lungs have been shown to be more effective in preventing H1N1 in mice compared to systemic administration [39].",

            "text": "The LNPs are smart, nanoscale lipid-based carriers for mRNA transport into the cytosol. These particulate nanocarriers can effectively deliver mRNA intracellularly by fusing with the lipid bilayer of the early endosomes, providing the mRNA into the cytoplasm, and safeguarding the mRNA against RNase during systemic circulation [78]. The LNPs have been employed in developing SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines that have received clinical approval. For mRNA administration, LNPs provide substantial advantages, such as simplicity of formulation, modularity, biocompatibility, and high mRNA payload capacity. The LNPs typically consist of three main components: an ionizable lipid (40-50%); cholesterol (38-45%); and a helper phospholipid (10-12%); in some cases, a fourth component is added, such as PEGylated lipid (1-2%) [79], as illustrated in Figure 2. These components function together to enclose and safeguard the naked mRNA [48]. The first lipids that carried an RNA were the cationic DOTMA (1,2-Di-O-octadecenyl-3-trimethylammonium propane) and their synthetic equivalent DOTAP (1,2-Dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane) in 1989 [80]. Since then, numerous additional cationic lipids, such as the widely used Lipofectamine, have been employed for RNA delivery [81]. \n\nchains or a cholesterol moiety. The cationic lipids are preferable for drug delivery applications due to their positively charged surfaces that bind with the negatively charged cell surface, facilitating the permeation of the LNPs into the cells [82]. The LNPs were utilized for delivering mRNA vaccines and drugs against COVID-19, influenza, and tuberculosis [5,83]. When ionizable lipids are introduced into the bloodstream at physiological pH levels, they have a neutral charge, which enhances their safety and extends their circulation time compared to other lipids [18].",

LNPs are also being increasingly used in the field of gene therapy, protein replacement therapy, and mRNA-based vaccines developed against both cancer and infectious diseases [25]. In one study [26], the transfection efficiencies of gene carrier-mediated mRNA were evaluated and compared after in vitro and in vivo administration of naked mRNA (dissolved in Ringer's Lactate) and mRNA nanoparticles formulated in commercial lipid-based transfection agent. This study demonstrated that human and mouse dendritic cells (DCs) can be efficiently transfected using lipid-based formulations of mRNA. The authors also demonstrated that in vivo transfection efficiency produced by lipid-based formulations of mRNA varied according to the route of administration. \n\nTable 1 summarizes some of the work conducted to investigate the preclinical efficacy of mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer when prepared in LNPs or other lipid-based formulations. LNPs to be used particularly in the design of RNA-based vaccines require specific types and proportions of lipid components in addition to special manufacturing procedures. \n\nThe present work reviews the components used for designing LNPs for the purpose of delivery of mRNA-based vaccines and outlines different methods for their production in addition to factors that contribute to the efficacy and uptake of this class of vaccines. In addition, pre-clinical and clinical trials conducted to investigate the potential application of mRNA-based vaccines developed as LNPs against infectious diseases and cancer will be highlighted.",

Viral vectors have been used in laboratories for the stable and efficient interference of lncRNAs. However, their safety hazard means that they are substituted by other vectors in clinical settings. Research about NPs has achieved significant progress due to the safety and nanomaterial development [237]. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be easily modified and are more suitable for encapsulating several nucleic acid drugs. For instance, patisiran was delivered by LNP. In the lncRNA field, LNPs have also achieved ideal results in animal models. The ASO-Au-TAT NPs targeting MALAT1 inhibited cancer metastasis, and the RGD-PEG-ECO/siDANCR nanoparticles could suppress tumor progression [230,238]. Moreover, endogenous exosomes were developed to achieve a lower immunogenicity and better biocompatibility [239]. LncRNA-H19 delivered by high-yielding extracellular vesicle-mimetic nanovesicles exhibited the ability to accelerate wounds healing in a diabetic rat model [240]. Due to the consistent progress of nucleic acid delivery systems, novel therapies targeting lncRNAs are becoming a reality in clinical settings.",

            "text": "Drug delivery system (DDS) is a progressive pharmaceutical formulation that delivers drugs to specific sites and release in a desired manner and rate. A few decades ago, small molecule drugs were the predominant therapeutic agents and their delivery depended heavily on the physicochemical properties of their own structure. In contrast, with the development of pharmaceutical sciences, the content of drugs has been extended to nucleic acids [1], peptides [2], proteins [3], and even cells [4], which are difficult to apply directly in clinical therapy due to the instability of their physicochemical properties. In this context, the role of DDS is increasingly significant, not only limited to improving the solubility of small molecule drugs but also in controlling the release behavior [5], maintaining the activity of drugs [6], overcoming biological barriers [7], and improving pharmacokinetics [8]. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is currently the most widely used and mature DDS in clinical practice. Whether it is more than twenty small molecule DDS formulations that have been marketed or the recent mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, LNP plays a key role in the development of advanced pharmaceuticals [9]. The concept of LNP can be divided into general LNP and special LNP. General LNP is a new DDS that use biocompatible phospholipid materials as carriers to wrap bioactive substances in nuclei or attach them to the surface of nanoparticles. General LNP includes solid lipid nanoparticles, niosomes, transfersomes, nanostructured lipid carriers, micelles, etc., of which liposome is the most representative [10]. And special LNP is described in more articles now as a specific type of particle used to deliver nucleic acids with the development of COVID-19 vaccines [10,11]. Special LNP is a composite vesicular structure composed of four components: PEGylated lipids, ionizable lipids, structural phospholipids, and cholesterol. Here, we refer to LNPs, collectively, as lipid-based nanoparticles to avoid confusion.",

            "text": "Precise delivery of gene-manipulating nucleic acid payloads unlocks a wide range of therapeutic applications. The development of elegant and advanced delivery modalities, such as LNPs, has resolved the challenges related to inefficient delivery and immunogenic responses elicited by naked nucleic acid payloads (1,2). These delivery vehicles can be classified into biological (mostly viral) and nonbiological (lipid-or peptide-based) classes. Viral vectors are clinically approved but carry the limitations of small payload sizes, antivector immunogenicity, and safety issues due to the risk of insertional mutagenesis. Examples of nonviral delivery vehicles include polymers and LNPs. For example, polyacrylamide-polymer nanoparticles have been applied for the entrapment and delivery of nondiffusible compounds as early as the 1970s, and significantly enh anced accumulation of fluorescein molecules in cultured fibroblast cells was achieved compared to free fluoresceintreated cells (3). Presently, LNPs are the most advanced delivery vehicle for the RNA-based therapeutics (4,5). The recent rapid development of two mRNA-LNP vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, as well as a previously approved siRNA-LNP therapeutic, Patisiran \u00ae , has proved the potential of the LNP platform (6)(7)(8). The LNP delivery field initially focused on siRNA delivery, with a recent shift toward mRNA delivery. The shift to mRNA payloads unlocks a myriad of therapeutic applications. These range from expression of antigens of choice as prophylactic viral and bacterial vaccines as well as therapeutic cancer vaccine applications, supplementation of missing proteins for enzyme replacement therapies, and expression of gene editing machinery, such as CRISPR, to gene edit aberrant natively expressed proteins (4,(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16). \n\nDespite the developments in the LNP field, a commonly overlooked aspect regards the very limited release of the nucleic acid payloads in the cytoplasm (17)(18)(19).",

            "text": "The tremendous success of COVID-19 vaccines could have not been possible without LNP systems. Not only mRNA vaccines, but also siRNA-based treatment of polyneuropathy has been approved, as an example of another LNP application. The ongoing clinical trials listed in this article emphasize the breadth of drug cargo that can be delivered through LNPs, as well as the variety of clinical applications that are targeted. From small molecules to ASO, siRNA, mRNA, plasmid DNA, and gene editing, LNPs are being extensively explored for potentially all types of drug cargo. Such medical interventions were thought to be difficult to implement owing to the lack of suitable delivery mechanisms; however, LNPs have provided a big boost to the investigation of all gene therapies, paving the way for the application of precision/personalized medicine much sooner than expected. Many difficult-to-treat health conditions such as oncology, protein replacement, gene silencing, and chronic diseases are now slowly becoming more easily treatable with the advances in this field. Efficient tissue targeting will add more fuel and rigor to the advancements and even gene therapies accessible by ex vivo modulating cells could potentially be replaced by targeting-enabled LNPs and their corresponding nano-delivery systems. It may also prove to be a very handy platform for image diagnostics applications. \n\nConsidering the enormous potential that LNPs carry, in this review, we have discussed the approaches for designing lipid nanoparticles that render them more efficacious. We have covered strategies that have been used to design ionizable lipid and helper lipid constituents of LNP systems. Specifically, the ionizable head group design, pKa tunability, and ionizable and helper lipid tail design and concepts were discussed with examples. Moreover, we also covered approaches pertaining to the safety of such systems, such as biodegradability and immunogenicity. We also covered the key considerations and rationale behind selecting the route of administration and targeting of hepatic and nonhepatic targets. We believe that this paper will provide pertinent efficacy and safety-related information for developing an efficient LNP system.",

            "text": "LNPs have been developed as a promising platform to deliver a variety of therapeutic agents since the 1960s. [24,25] Liposomes were first developed to encapsulate small-molecule chemotherapies as anticancer therapeutics. [26] The benefits of using LNPs to deliver small molecules are to enhance the therapeutic efficacy by increasing the half-life of active compounds in systemic fluids and targeting tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. [27,28] To maintain these advantages, the components of traditional LNPs for small molecule delivery usually contain certain amounts of PEG lipids to prevent the degradation LNPs/drug complex in systemic fluids and to reduce particle size for the EPR effect. [27] However, these designs for traditional LNPs may not be capable of delivering nucleic acid payloads since nucleic acid delivery requires a rapid drug release from LNPs to the cytoplasm to achieve therapeutic gene regulation or expression. [29] Therefore, when applied for nucleic acid delivery, LNPs are expected to prevent degradation in systemic fluids but to rapidly release their cargos by endosomal escape once they are internalized by cells, [30] suggesting that lower amounts of PEG lipids and better functional lipids should be considered when designing LNPs for nucleic acid delivery. Moreover, particle sizes of LNPs could influence mechanisms for the cellular uptake of LNPs. [31] In general, particles smaller than 200 nm are able to enter cells through clathrin-or caveolinmediated endocytosis. [32] Particles larger than 500 nm may en-  ter the cells through phagocytosis, and large particles could also be recognized by macrophages to elicit unnecessary immune responses in human bodies. [33] In addition, a more positive surface charge on LNPs resulted in a more efficient cellular uptake. [34] However, LNPs with extremely high surface charges also correlate with greater cytotoxicity in nonphagocytic cells which is not preferred when considering the safety of LNPs as drug deliv-ery platforms. [35] In vivo, positively charged particles have been shown to selectively target the neovasculature of the tumor. [36] Here, the",

The most widely used LNPs included solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC). The advantages of LNPs included biocompatibility, controlled and sustained release of anti-tumor drugs, and lower systemic toxicity, especially hugged the advantage to delivery mRNA for tumor immunotherapy [194,195]. For the components of LNPs, typical LNPs were composed of cationic lipids, ionizable lipids, or helper lipids. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids or surfactants may be also added to improve colloidal stability of the LNPs [196,197]. At present, the potential clinical application of LNPs mainly lies in effectively modulating mRNA delivery to improve the immunotherapeutic effects. Naked mRNA was unstable, and can be rapidly degraded by nucleases and Fig. 9 A summary of liposomes used in tumor immunotherapy to inhibit tumor progression. The 7 kinds of liposomes mentioned in this manuscript increase the infiltration of CD8 + T cells, decrease the level of immune suppressive T cells, promote the maturation of DCs, and induce the macrophage transformation from M2 type to M1 type and restore tumor immunity to inhibit tumor progression self-hydrolysis. Encapsulation of mRNA by LNPs could protect naked mRNA from extracellular ribonucleases and contributed to the intracellular mRNA delivery. As a result, the therapeutic effect of these mRNA can be fully performed. Many studies have convinced this point [198][199][200][201]. \n\nFirst, the LNPs vector have the adjuvant effect.

            "text": "Rapid advances in lipid-based nanoparticles show an immense impact on cancer treatment and management. Looking into the structural makeup of LNPs, we found that LNPs are composed of lipids that are both biodegradable and biocompatible such as phospholipids, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The inclusion of such less toxic substances, as well as limited use of organic solvents, makes LNPs a safe drug delivery system against TNBC as compared to polymeric and inorganic NPs [4,8]. According to the general prototype, LNPs consist of API, lipids that are designed to sequester, deliver, and promote functionality. Further, to maintain the stability of the dispersions formed by the LNPs, in environmental stresses, surfactants or a combination of surfactants are used, depending on their HLB values [25]. Further, to safeguard the LNPs from the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and to render biological stability, LNPs are often coated with a stealth or biocompatible polymeric layer such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) [6,26,27]. Finally, for possessing an enhanced targeting property, the LNPs may bind with a targeting moiety such as a biological receptor-specific ligand. Such orientation of LNPs and their small size help the LNPs to accumulate frequently on the tumor sites [6]. \n\nIn cancer research, it was observed that approximately 40% of new chemical entities show poor aqueous solubility, which further limits their therapeutic efficiency. Thus, the utilization of hydrophobic LNPs as a vehicle either encapsulates or solubilizes the drug moiety that will further improve the stability of poorly aqueous soluble drugs in the surrounding aqueous media and will prevent the precipitation of the drugs both in vitro and in vivo. Hence, it could be inferred that the development of LNPs shows improved chemotherapeutic efficacy by increasing their solubility [28,29].",

            "text": "However, Figueiredo et al. [32] reported that capecitabine as a hydrophilic drug was difficult to be loaded onto the LNPs so that the LNPs are more potential for carrying hydrophobic drugs. The strong interactions between the LNPs and loaded drugs give a slow release characteristic in the drug delivery system [25], which was proven by several previous studies as shown in Table 3. The resveratrol-loaded, irinotecan-loaded, and curcuminloaded LNPs released over 80% of the loaded drugs at pH 7.4 for 50 h [25], 72 h [30], and 150 h [20], respectively. The drug release from any drug-loaded carriers is a pHresponsive mechanism, which depends on the drug characteristics, carrier characteristics, and interactions between the drug and carrier. As shown in Table 3, many studies proved that the drug-loaded LNPs had a better release and higher amount of released drug at the intestinal condition (pH 7.4) than at pH 2.0 and pH 5.5 [20,30,32]. However, it does not rule out that several drug-loaded LNPs have a better release at lower pH, as mentioned by Zhou et al. [26]. The doxorubicin-loaded LNPs had a higher release at a slightly lower pH (pH 5.5) of the tumor microenvironment [26], which showed the ability of drug-loaded LNPs in targeting more specific release locations. As anti-inflammatory nanoparticles, LNPs can play an important role in the wound healing process. Alqahtani et al. [24] studied empty LNPs treatment, which could fasten the wound closure, where approximately 77% of wounds closed after 12 days. This was faster than untreated wounds and equal to curcumin-treated wounds. \n\nIn drug delivery applications, the use of LNPs as a drug carrier should have low cytotoxicity characteristics. Several previous studies have proven this issue, where LNPs had no significant effect on cell viability.",

            "text": "Lipid nanocarriers have emerged across the pharmaceutical industry as versatile nanomedicine delivery platforms. Their success is attributable to the relative ease of production and scale-up, reduced immune responses, multidose capability, extensive and stable drug loading, and design flexibility. In a highly versatile platform, LNPs have been employed in drug delivery, including nucleic acid-based drugs, and are currently in the spotlight as the lead clinical nonviral delivery system with extensive clinical trials and testing in humans. \n\nUsing LNPs as a delivery vehicle has other benefits, such as target-specific delivery (by introducing targeting ligands on NP surfaces), endosomal escape (by destabilizing the endosomal membrane or enhancing fusion to the endosomal membrane through modifying the lipid compositions), high gene knockout efficiency, suitable drug release, and bypassing extracellular nuclease degradation. [191] Through endocytosis, this complex is taken up by cells. The ability of LNPs to carry both mRNA and siRNA has been widely verified through clinical studies. However, the delivery efficiency of LNPs carrying CRISPR components still needs to be improved. As a result, this approach does not yet satisfy the clinical standards for efficient genome editing. Improvement and modification of the LNP delivery system can significantly enhance its stability and delivery efficiency, which will pave the way for gene editing in treating clinical diseases in the near future. [32,192] he most well-known version of LNPs, the liposome, was the earliest nanomedicine delivery platform approved and successfully employed in clinical applications. Liposomes can encapsulate hydrophilic drugs in their internal aqueous core and entrap hydrophobic drugs in the lipid bilayer's hydrocarbon chain region. Therefore, they can transport various molecules, such as small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. Cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, solid lipid NPs, and nanostructured lipid carriers comprise many of the next generations of LNPs whose structures have provided more complex architectures with enhanced stability and capabilities. [193] urrently, cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, as a vital component of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, have received intense global attention.",

            "text": "Gene therapy has received extensive attention recently as an effective and universal therapy for PF, but its application is severely limited by intracellular delivery efficiency. Both viral and nonviral vectors can be used to mediate gene transfection in target cells. However, the application of viral vectors carries the risks of causing host immune and inflammatory responses and carcinogenesis. Compared with viral vectors, nonviral vectors are widely used in gene therapy to treat diseases because of their low immunogenicity and better genetic stability. 27 Among all nonviral vectors, the LNP platform is the best known and most widely applied, [28][29][30] and it is frequently used to load and deliver genes into cells. In addition to cationic lipids, which are essential excipients, cationic LNPs also include amphiphilic phospholipids, cholesterol, DSPE-PEG, and other helper phospholipids. The differences in the composition of the LNP helper phospholipids could affect the morphology, microstructure, zeta potential, and other physical and chemical properties of LNP complexes, [31][32][33] which may become the key factors affecting the clinical application of LNP-mediated gene transfection efficiency. \n\nPEG has been approved by the FDA as a safe excipient, is widely used in drug delivery and has been described as an \"invisible\" LNP, 34 since when it is grafted on LNPs, the probability of LNPs being cleared by the MPS is reduced and the circulation time of LNPs in the blood can be improved by producing a hydration layer with a large volume. In addition, PEGylated LNPs have excellent advantages in terms of their slow aggregation in blood serum and storage stability. 35 At present, genetic drugs based on LNPs containing PEG have been developed and marketed, such as Macugen 36 and Rexin-G. 37 rein, we used electrostatic forces between positive and negative charges to load pDNA into LNPs for PF treatment.",

            "text": "Later studies employed modern LNPs with nonlipid components for mRNA delivery into NK cells. Nakamura et al. [82] developed a CL1H6-LNP, which achieved a 10-100\u00d7 higher eGFP mRNA expression intensity compared with their benchmark, MC3. While both LNPs had 100% cell transfection efficiencies at high mRNA doses of 0.4 \u03bcg/mL, CL1H6 had higher efficiencies at lower doses, only dropping to 80% at a 0.066 \u03bcg/mL dose compared with 60% by MC3. Cell viability for the CL1H6 was 70% for doses at 0.2 \u03bcg/mL and lower with 40% viability at a higher dose of 0.5 \u03bcg/mL [82]. Douka et al. [83] found similar results, where their LNPs, made using DSPC and SM-102, the latter being the ionizable lipid utilized in the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, resulted in a better transfection efficiency and higher overall eGFP expression versus EP. \n\nMore recently, other studies found success with CAR mRNA cargos. Vital et al. [84] demonstrated the 99% encapsulation efficiency of BCMA or CD19-CAR with LNPs. Moreover, BCMA-CAR expression was maintained for 93% and 70% of cells post-thaw, for 24 and 48 h, respectively, and the CD19-CAR-NK cells successfully killed CD19-positive Raji and Daudi target cells in vitro [84]. While there have not been many other studies using LNPs for CAR-NK cells, success has also been found with LNP-like nanoparticle drug delivery systems, indicating likely success for future LNP studies. Kim et al. developed multifunctional nanoparticles (MF-NPs) designed for genetic manipulation and in vivo tracking. The MF-NPs featured a core-shell structure with a cationic polymer labeled with a near-infrared fluorescent molecule and a polydopamine coating layer.",

            "text": "LNPs, a specific kind of lipid vesicles, feature a lipid core that is homogeneous [ 91 ]. It has been commonly utilized for delivering small-molecule drugs and nucleic acids, providing good biocompatibility, enhanced drug stability, and controlled release, along with some drawbacks such as process complexity, storage stability and size variation [ 92 ,93 ]. LNPs have especially gained plenty of focus on their effectiveness in delivering COVID-19 mRNA vaccines [ 94 ]. LNPs can efficiently encapsulate and deliver molecules of various sizes to the desired regions in animal models. Liposomes, a precursor to LNPs, are incredibly adaptable nanocarriers that have successfully progressed from concept to clinical application due to their ability to transport small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids [ 95 ]. The following generation of LNPs, including solid LNPs, nano structured lipid vectors, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, is characterized by more complicated internal designs and increased physical stabilities. As the accuracy and timing of local drug transport can be controlled across the body, LNPs are utilized for treating various genetic diseases [ 95 ]. While microinjection works well, its widespread use is limited by the need for surgery and specialized injection techniques. Therefore, researchers are focusing on developing oral LNPs. For example, IL-22, a cytokine belonging to the IL-10 family, is strongly associated with IBD susceptibility genes. It is a key regulator of epithelial homeostasis that promotes wound healing during intestinal inflammation. Junsik Sung et al. created LNPs using a basic formulation of specific lipids found in ginger previously reported [ 96 ]. They loaded the mRNA IL-22 into the nanoparticles using a cationic polymer called turbofectamine to achieve stabilization and condensation of mRNA. They assessed the protective effect of the generated particles on the target mRNA and revealed that oral delivery of IL-22/nLNPs led to increased expression of IL-22 in the mouse colonic mucosa and reduced the inflammatory levels without affecting the gut microbial composition [ 97 ].",

In terms of their classification, LNPs include liposomes, which have a hydrophilic core and a lipid bilayer shell, and can encapsulate hydrophilic drugs, like nucleic acids [80]. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) differ from liposomes by lacking a closed lipid bilayer structure and internal aqueous core and can be composed of various lipids, including cholesterol, helper lipids, and PEGylated lipids. Lipid nano-emulsions (LNEs) are nanodroplets stabilized by phospholipids and emulsifiers, while solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have a surfactant monolayer shell and a solid lipid core. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are hybrid formulations between LNEs and SLNs, with cores composed of both liquid oil and solid lipid phases. The principles of nucleic acid delivery via LNPs involve the use of self-assembled nanostructures with a diameter of approximately 100 nm that can bind to negatively charged nucleic acids through electrostatic interactions [80,81]. These nanoparticles encapsulate the nucleic acid drugs in their cores to protect them from nuclease degradation during delivery. Classical LNPs comprise ionizable lipids (ILs) or cationic lipids (CLs), cholesterol, helper lipids, and lipids modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) [82]. \n\nLNPs have been extensively used in the delivery of various nucleic acid drugs, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). LNPs technology is currently one of the most widely used applications for the delivery of nucleic acid drugs.",

Several types of nanoparticles, including LNP, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) conjugates and dynamic polyconjugated (DPCs), are used clinically. The most successful DDS so far is lipid nanoparticle (LNP) developed by Tekmira. LNP, which forms a lipid bilayer membrane similar to the cell membrane, protects siRNA by encapsulation and assists the transport of siRNA to the target tissues. Alnylam has developed a therapeutic agent (ALN-TTR 02) for familial amyloid polyneuropathy by using this LNP, which is currently conducting phase III of clinical trials. In addition, the method for conjugation of atelocollagen and siRNA has also been developed. Atelocollagen makes siRNA less susceptible to degradation by RNase enzymes, which results in a long-lasting RNA silencing effect.",

For these reasons, LNPs, polymers, and inorganic nanomaterials have been employed as nanocarriers for the delivery of small molecule drugs 23,104e106 . These delivery systems have demonstrated to be advantageous in comparison with free drugs, and have been used for the treatment of cancer, infectious diseases, inflammation diseases, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and many others 107e110 .

            "text": "Beyond light delivery approaches, another way to maximize the therapeutic effect is to deliver the PS in a nanoparticle formulation, with or without active targeting, in so-called third-generation agents (Huang et al., 2012). These PDT nanoparticles aim to overcome biocompatibility issues with free PS, improve the kinetics and distribution characteristics and/or enable multimodal therapy. These issues can be particularly important with newer organic or inorganic PS constructs in order to trade biocompatibility and efficacy (Shim et al., 2022). Although some advantages can be achieved through conjugation of standard molecular PSs with antibodies, folate moieties or other small molecules, the majority of third-generation PDT approaches use nanoparticle systems (Dinakaran et al., 2023). \n\nFor nanoparticle-based PDT, the predominant constructs are with lipid nanoparticles (LNP) and their derivatives. LNPs here refer to a family of lipid-based nanoparticles such as micellar structures (single layer phospholipid with hydrophobic interior), liposomes (bi-layer phospholipids with physiologic interior environment), solid LNPs (admixture of lipids along with payload) and similar carriers. These are an attractive carrier system for PS because of the extensive research that has made them stable, biocompatible, have favorable distribution properties and drug release kinetics, provide passive targeting through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect or allow active targeting via aptamers, allow simultaneous co-delivery of other cancer drugs, and make even natively toxic drugs feasible to use in humans (Avci et al., 2014;Dinakaran et al., 2023). Beyond this obvious advantage, further development of LNP-based PDT agents has resulted in some new strategies in leveraging nanoparticles for PDT.",

            "text": "Lipid materials, owing to their lipophilic properties, facilitate efficient delivery within the body. Unlike conventional liposomes, which are spherical structures composed of a phospholipid bilayer with hydrophilic interiors housing nucleic acids [38], current lipid nanocarriers exhibit a more focused approach. Liposomes and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) share similarities in their design, but they differ in their composition and function. Both are lipid-based nanoformulations and are excellent drug delivery vehicles, transporting their cargo within a protective, outer layer of lipids. However, LNPs can take on various forms. LNPs are similar to liposomes, but they are specifically designed to encapsulate a wide range of nucleic acids (RNA and DNA). As a result, LNPs have become the most popular non-viral gene delivery system. Companies such as Exelead develop and manufacture LNPs to encapsulate different types of genetic payloads, including siRNA, mRNA, and saRNA. Traditional liposomes typically have one or more rings of a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous pocket, but not all LNPs have a continuous bilayer structure that would qualify them as lipid vesicles or liposomes. Some LNPs assume a micellar structure, encapsulating drug molecules in a non-aqueous core. An additional lipid aids in accelerating the structural transformation of LNPs within cells, facilitating drug release. Meanwhile, the outer layer is often coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids to reinforce colloidal stability and prevent protein absorption or aggregation in circulation, thus mitigating immune clearance [30]. In addition, delivery systems for RNA delivery via anionic or zwitterionic liposomes have also emerged. Studies by Siddhesh D Patil et al. have shown that the transfection efficiency of some anionic liposomes is similar to that of cationic liposomes, while their toxicity is significantly lower [39]. The preparation process of LNPs can be more conveniently adjusted in size to adapt to more functions under novel methods such as microfluidic (Figure 2A).",

            "text": "Nanostructured drug delivery systems have gained significant attention in immunotherapy, with several formulations receiving FDA approval. LNP-based and liposomal drugs are particularly prominent due to their biocompatibility, drug-loading capacity, and ability to reduce toxicity. One of the most representative examples is Doxil \u00ae , the first FDA-approved nanodrug (1995), which uses PEGylated liposomes to enhance the delivery of doxorubicin in cancer treatment. Other approved formulations using liposomes as nanocarriers, such as Myocet \u00ae , DaunoXome \u00ae , and Onivyde \u00ae , have been developed to treat various cancers, offering prolonged circulation time and reduced side effects. LNPs also played a critical role in mRNA vaccine development during the COVID-19 pandemic, with Comirnaty\u2122 and Spikevax \u00ae demonstrating the versatility of nanotechnology in modern medicine [151][152][153][154]. \n\nPolymer-based nanostructured drug delivery systems have also been explored in immunotherapy, although fewer formulations have received regulatory authorities' approval compared to lipid-based counterparts. One key example is Abraxane \u00ae , an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation approved in 2005 for delivering paclitaxel to treat various cancers. Additionally, polymer micelle-based nanosystems like Genexol \u00ae , Nanoxel \u00ae , and Apealea \u00ae have been developed for delivering paclitaxel or docetaxel to treat advanced cancers, offering improved solubility, reduced toxicity, and enhanced drug delivery to tumor sites. These polymeric systems, along with lipid-based nanoparticles, emphasize the tremendous potential of using nanostructured drug delivery systems in dealing with malignant diseases, offering new perspectives for improving immunotherapeutic treatment options and raising hopes for translating under-research formulations to the clinical setting [33,151,152,154]. \n\nTo provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of clinically approved nanostructured drug delivery systems, we have compiled a summary of key examples, including lipid-and polymer-based formulations.",

            "text": "Messenger RNA (mRNA)-and DNA-based therapies are a rapidly developing direction in the biomedical field. However, efficient delivery of genetic material and other bioactive molecules, such as proteins and small molecules, to specific target sites remains a challenge. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most clinically advanced non-viral gene delivery system because of their high penetrating ability, biocompatibility, and delivery efficiency (Buschmann et al., 2021;Hou et al., 2021;Limongi et al., 2021). LNPs are widely used for the delivery of nucleic acids because of their efficacy in delivery along with their simple synthesis, small size, and serum stability (Mitchell et al., 2021). Ionizable LNP and ionizable amphiphilic Janus dendrimer (IAJD) delivery systems for mRNA are an ideal platform for the delivery of these nucleic acid therapies (Zhang et al., 2021). However, despite many advantages, LNP and IAJD systems are incapable of delivering formulated active substances to designated organs and tissues other than the liver and spleen with high efficiency (Fenton et al., 2018). Thus, there is an urgent need for a delivery system that is similar to LNP in terms of biocompatibility, cell uptake, and release, but is also capable of transferring genetic material with its long-term protection to the vast majority of specific target sites. \n\nPolymeric, hybrid micron and submicron-sized multilayer capsules are a developing universal platform for safe encapsulation and efficient delivery of biomacromolecules (Petrov et al., 2005;Timin et al., 2018b). The significant advantages of these microcapsules as a delivery carrier for genetic material compared with other non-viral carriers include their superior loading capacity, low cytotoxicity, and high colloidal stability (Lepik et al., 2016).",

Lung endothelial cells are an important target for drugs and gene delivery as they are involved in processes such as inflammation, vascular permeability, and tumor growth. Also, they play an important role in cancer development [139,140]. However, efficacy or functional delivery cannot be predicted by solely considering the biodistribution. Endothelial transcytosis and improved tropism to tumor tissue/ cells, internalization rate, intracellular trafficking, and endosomal release are crucial to maximize the delivery or co-delivery of active agents to the site of action in the cell [141]. \n\nState-of-the-art LNPs for siRNA gene silencing, that is, stable antisense-lipid particles (SALPs) and stable nucleic acid-lipid particles (SNALPs), were recently developed as PEGylated lipid carriers based on ionizable lipids with pKa values between 6 and 7.

NLC are mixtures containing solid and liquid lipids, which is a mixture that replaces some of the solid lipids of SLN with liquid lipids, which creates a larger space and increases the drug-carrying capacity after substitution. The good modifiability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability of polymeric nanoparticles, which are often made of biodegradable amine-containing polymers that can self-assemble with RNA, make them promise as delivery systems even though they are not as well-known as LNPs, which are currently the most studied. PNPs can also be made with adjuvant phospholipids, cholesterol, and peg-lipids, depending on the need. Cell-specific targeting can be facilitated by further modifying both LNPs and PNPs with certain ligands [82]. \n\nIn real-world applications, limitations of delivery mechanisms for mRNA tumor vaccines still exist, for example, the most used LNPs are still less stable in complex in vivo environments and are prone to rapid metabolism [117]. Some mRNA vaccines have not yet achieved specific targeting of the immune system, resulting in vaccines being retained at the injection site or in liver tissue [118]. In addition, tumor vaccine therapy requires not only protection through humoral immunity, but more importantly, robust cellular immunity mediated by cytotoxic CD8 + T cells to eradicate malignant cells [82]. These limitations suggest that despite the broad potential of mRNA vaccines, there are still many scientific and technical challenges that need to be addressed for their practical application. \n\nFor LNP-loaded mRNA delivery to increase the effectiveness of mRNA tumor vaccines and broaden the region of immune stimulation, appropriate methods of administration are essential.

Furthermore, the development of bioimaging techniques for therapeutics can result in the development of theranostic agents. The theranostic approach has drawn attention to the development of drugs due to the following advantages: 1) In the preclinical stage, it can help to select appropriate drug candidates based on the imaging results; 2) in clinical trials, companion imaging methods can be used to select patients for enrollment in clinical trials; 3) finally, in clinical practice, unnecessary treatment can be avoided by using companion imaging biomarkers for patient selection. With these benefits, theranostic agents have been successfully developed in recent years. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 177 Lu-dotatate (Lutathera) in neuroendocrine tumors and 177 Lu-PSMA-617 (Pluctivo) in prostate cancer [12]. Additionally, numerous studies have been conducted to develop theranostic nanoparticles because 1) nanoparticles can be functionalized with therapeutics and diagnostics easily and 2) various methods for controlled release of the therapeutics can be applied [13,14].\n\nThis review presents a comprehensive description of the currently available LNP production methods for LNP-based RNA therapeutics and LNP-based RNA therapeutics in clinics and clinical trials, and the PK/PD characteristics of LNP-based RNA therapeutics and the current and potential roles of imaging techniques in the development of LNP-based RNA therapeutics as shown in Figure 1.",

[195] reported a novel modifiable LNP platform called selective organ targeting (SORT) LNP, which adds a fifth lipid component to the established LNP formulation.SORT LNPs delivered different CRISPR cargoes, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA-sgRNA, and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, for efficient genome editing in the liver, lungs, and spleen after i.v.administration.Although this strategy is very promising in expanding the usefulness of LNPs, the possible reason why SORT LNPs preferentially accumulate in the liver is that they are easily opsonized and captured by the hepatocytes, partially due to ApoE binding to the LNPs in the blood steam [196].In addition, selective delivery to the lungs may result from the positive surface charge of intravascular SORT LNPs [195].Therefore, to achieve more success in other tissues, such as the brain, stealth SORT LNPs will be needed [195].This could potentially be a promising start for the application of precision LNPs to target the brain.",

            "text": "Nonetheless, SLNs' ability for large-scale production and consistent reproducibility is favoring their downstream and clinical applications [23]. NLCs have been developed as a continuation of SLNs to improve the encapsulation efficiency and prevent drug leakage. NLC matrices form amorphous structures that are composed of solid and liquid lipid blends [24]. The larger inter-fatty acid chain distances resulting from the presence of distinct lipid molecules in NLCs create more imperfections (irregularities) for drug accommodation and thus better stability during storage [5]. The higher solubility of drugs in liquid lipids can be used to enhance the drug loading [25]. The development of lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles represents a new generation of delivery systems that harness the unique characteristics of polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes that were crucial to their early therapeutic success. Additionally, these lipid nanoparticles were designed to overcome drawbacks, such as structural disintegration, a shortened circulation period, and material leakage, that were identified in prior delivery systems [26]. The polymer controls the release of the drug, whereas the lipid enhances drug permeation across the membrane and facilitates loading. Thus, these hybrid nanoparticles made of polymer and lipid can enhance both the physical stability and biocompatibility of drugs, making them a promising option for an effective drug delivery system [27]. The administration of biologic drugs remains a significant challenge because these large molecules often do not conform to Lipinski's \"rule of five\" criteria and are prone to be unstable both in vitro due to aggregation and in vivo due to enzymatic and chemical degradation. Delivering biologics to their intracellular target while avoiding intracellular degradation pathways poses a significant challenge for many of these molecules. The delivery of oligonucleotide has been most effective using LNPs as a carrier [28]. The LNPs have been extensively characterized [29] and Pieter Cullis's [30] research group has reported the use of LNPs as a means of delivering SiRNA, resulting in the product Onpattro \u00ae (developed with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA), approved by USFDA in August 2018.",

Enhancements like surface functionalization with targeting ligands and surfactant coatings improve brain uptake and access. \n\nThe LNP system, designed to deliver drugs and antibodies to tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMCs), was brought to life through a meticulous formulation process. A lipid-based nanoparticle formulation, crafted with 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine (DOPC), cardiolipin, and cholesterol, forms a hydrophobic membrane with a phospholipid bilayer structure. These components create the perfect environment for the hydrophobic dinaciclib (a small molecule CDK5 inhibitor). The surface was then fortified with a DSPE-PEG2000 compound, a crucial element that stabilizes the nanoparticles, extends their circulation time in the body, and reduces their recognition by the immune system, thereby ensuring the reliable delivery of dinaciclib. The outer layer of LNPs was then functionalized with \u03b1PD-L1 by conjugating it with the terminal maleimide group of DSPE-PEG2000 to enhance their specificity in targeting cells expressing PD-L1. The modification with \u03b1PD-L1 enhances the specificity of the LNPs in targeting cells expressing PD-L1, which is beneficial for targeted drug delivery systems, particularly in cancer treatment. Cryo-EM images revealed that the spherical nanoparticles were less than 100 nm thick and were covered in monoclonal antibodies. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) showed that the \u03b1PD-L1-functionalized lipid nanoparticles (\u03b1PD-L1-LNP) were around 90 nm in diameter, slightly larger than nonmodified LNPs, and had a slightly negative charge, as indicated in the zeta-potential analysis.",

            "text": "Improvements in RNA delivery systems based on LNPs yielded impressive results in the last few years. Nevertheless, the use of LNPs for targeted delivery to desired organs still requires optimization of lipid composition. In our review, we discussed successful examples of variations of lipid composition for targeted delivery to the spleen, lungs, pancreas, thyroid gland, placenta, and testes. Distribution of LNPs to the liver is the most typical after intravenous administration, especially for nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm. Through changes in lipid composition, it is possible to achieve preferential (in some cases, complete) redirection of nanoparticle accumulation to other organs. Apparent pK a of LNPs plays an important role in this effect. For instance, nanoparticles having pK a < 5 (they possess a negative charge in the bloodstream) tend to accumulate in the spleen, whereas particles with pK a > 11 (positive charge) in lungs. A desired value of apparent pK a of LNPs can be achieved by changing the helper lipid (SORT technology) and/or by using a combination of several ionizable cationic lipids. Application of bulkier lipids indirectly affects apparent pK a of LNPs by altering the packing of lipids in the nanoparticle and thereby changing the accessibility of ionizable groups of lipids to protonation. Redirection of LNP accumulation to the spleen can be accomplished via reductions in the amount of \"liver-specific\" cholesterol in the nanoparticles. On the other hand, for some organs, such as eyes and the brain, effective delivery systems based on LNPs have not yet been devised, and in this case, delivery to the target organ is achieved only via direct administration of the therapeutic agent. \n\nAt present, computer technologies are actively utilized to design and improve LNPs: from computer modeling to machine learning and artificial intelligence (Du et al., 2023;Maharjan et al., 2023;Cornebise et al., 2021). During the development of new ionizable lipids, the most time-consuming task is the screening of large numbers of diverse LNPs.",

The benefits sought from lipid nanoparticles range from enormous biological compatibility, simple fabrication, spontaneous scale up, delivery to required targets and toxicity that is null. \n\nGenerally speaking, the lipid nanoparticles can be used for delivery via oral or the parenteral route and have GRAS status approved by FDA. Geometrically they are spherical, uniformly sized with good stability, enhanced cellular penetration efficiency and positive zeta potentials [153]. The emergence of solid lipid nanoparticles as putative drug delivery vehicles as biomimetic agents with potential to carry active therapeutics across blood-brain-barrier and find applications in the treatment of neuropathological problems like, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and brain tumor [154]. The pharmacokinetic fluctuations especially related to absorption of Erlotinib HCl for the treatment of metastatic lung cancer showed poor oral bioavailability and it was improved by the use of solid lipid nanoparticles in the delivery [155]. Wiemann and Keck [156] found that LNPs based drug formulations were better than the traditional formulations including nano emulsion with pure oil containing active ingredient, etc. in dermal drug delivery. A concern that limits its use is the lipolysis of the lipid nanoparticle of the LNPs. Hence, the urge to develop a better drug delivery system continues and it has been highlighted that in oral drug delivery solid LNPs hold much promise as potential therapeutics [157]. d) Emulsion-With size well in nano range, from 10-100 nm, nano emulsion application in drug delivery cannot be denied and it can be produced by dispersing liquid phase as droplets in another liquid phase.",

            "text": "Lipid-based systems, including lipoplex, liposomes, and solid lipid nanoparticles, are promising colloidal nanocarriers for bioactive organic molecules, e.g., ONs [278,279]. These systems are known for excellent drug delivery capabilities, attributed to the protective outer layer of lipids that surround the ON cargo [272,278]. Lipoplexes are formed by the direct electrostatic attraction between polyanionic ONs and synthetic cationic lipids [280]. Despite their unstable nature, lipoplex formulations have been effectively utilized for localized delivery applications. Liposomes and LNPs, while similar in design, differ slightly in composition and function [272,278]. LNPs for the delivery of ONs are typically composed of ionizable cationic lipids, phospholipids, PEG, and cholesterol derivatives [279,281]. \n\nLNPs, perhaps the most advanced in terms of clinical translatability for ON delivery, have been demonstrated to possess a high level of efficiency for ON drug delivery and the ability to target specific tissues [272,278,281]. LNPs are able to protect ONs from degradation and increase their circulation half-life, making them a promising option for treating various diseases [278]. Additionally, LNPs have shown a low level of toxicity, further highlighting their potential as a drug delivery system [278,281]. \n\nThe recent approval of patisiran, an siRNA directed against transthyretin mRNA in an LNP system, has renewed interest in LNPs [11,278,279,282,283]. LNPs form polyelectrolyte complexes by facilitating ionic interactions between the positively charged functional groups and the negatively charged phosphate fraction of the ONs [284]. ONs can be encapsulated within the matrix of the LNPs or attached to their surface through covalent or ionic bonding [285,286]. Ionizable lipids are being developed for in vivo applications to avoid toxicity [287]. PEG lipids are often prudently added to the LNPs to stabilize the structure during manufacturing and storage [279,288].",

            "text": "Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles are a class of scalable and biodegradable nanocarriers that show significant potential for mRNA delivery [205]. Attractive for immunotherapy due to their structural versatility, inorganic nanoparticles with lipid shells have been investigated to effectively encapsulate drugs [206]. LPN is a mature technology platform for safe and effective delivery of RNA drugs. Compared with other nucleic acid drug delivery systems, LPN has great advantages, such as high nucleic acid encapsulation rate and effective cell transfection, high tissue penetration, low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity. For example, researchers have used materials such as ionizable lipid libraries, phospholipids, cholesterol, and lipid-anchored PEG to create a lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle that can effectively deliver mRNA to mouse fetuses [207,208]. After encapsulation of mRNA by lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles and intravenous injection into the fetus, it was demonstrated that lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles enabled functional delivery of mRNA to the liver, lungs, and intestine. Notably, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles were also used to deliver erythropoietin (EPO) mRNA to demonstrate its therapeutic potential. Delivery of EPO mRNA to mouse fetal hepatocytes increased the EPO protein content in the fetus and greatly enhanced the therapeutic effect (Figure 7) [207]. \n\nLipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles retain the properties of lipid nanoparticles while providing more structural options that offer advantages in immunotherapy. Therefore, LNPs are a key technology for mRNA vaccines to effectively protect mRNA and transport it into cells to play an important role, but their complex structures and manufacturing processes can hinder the clinical application of these heterogeneous nanoparticles [209], and further research is needed to overcome these hindrances to achieve better therapeutic results. Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles retain the properties of lipid nanoparticles while providing more structural options that offer advantages in immunotherapy.",

            "text": "In the field of gene editing, the application of nanoparticles has opened new avenues for precise interventions in complex biological systems. These tiny engineered materials can effectively encapsulate and protect gene editing tools, enabling their safe delivery to target  (Jeong et al., 2023). These components collectively enable LNPs to effectively transport biologically active substances like nucleic acids and proteins into cells. The intracellular delivery efficiency of LNPs can be finely tuned through rational design and modification, by altering aspects such as lipid composition, particle size, and surface characteristics (Paunovska et al., 2022;Wang et al., 2023b). The key advantages of LNPs include their extremely small particle size, high stability, and biocompatibility, which enable effective drug protection and delivery efficiency. One of the characteristics of conventional LNPs is their resemblance to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which leads to their recognition and uptake by LDL receptors predominantly present in liver cells (Raguram et al., 2022). This results in the accumulation of LNPs in the liver, posing a limitation for their use in targeting non-hepatic tissues or organs. To overcome this challenge and expand the utility of LNPs beyond hepatic applications, researchers have been developing various innovative strategies. One such approach involves localized LNP injections, where Palanki and colleagues have successfully identified the most effective LNPs in the perinatal mouse brain by administering intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections in fetal and neonatal mice (Palanki et al., 2023). Another strategy is the use of DNA barcoding to identify non-hepatic cell-tropic LNPs (Dahlman et al., 2017;Ni et al., 2022). This method leverages unique DNA barcodes to modify distinct LNPs, resulting in a highly selective and efficient nanodelivery system targeted towards specific cells or tissues. Targeted modification of LNPs to achieve redirection is also a promising approach.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles (NPs) are materials with nano-scale dimensions (e.g., 1-100 nm), which have unique biological properties due their surface properties and size [46]. NPs can be formulated or self-assembled and are broadly used for drug delivery. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based delivery systems have been widely adopted for gene transfection. These systems commonly feature cationic phospholipids, which complex with and condense DNA, and improve their cellular uptake. Current research is focused on improving the properties of LNPs with respect to cell-penetration, endosome escape, reducing toxicity, degradation, and improving long-term storage stability [47,48]. \n\nDue to the large size and negative charge of the Cas9 RNP complex, they cannot be readily transported through negatively charged mammalian cell membranes [21]. A key delivery system to address this issue is the application of cationic lipids to condense the anionic-charged cargo via electrostatic interactions into LNPs, which can facilitate endocytosis through the cell membrane [49,50]. The condensation In vitro [93] of these payloads provides protection from degradation. An optimal equilibrium between the complexation level required for endocytosis and the ability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to be released at its site of action is required for efficient transfection. The use of LNPs instead of traditional viral delivery systems has been shown to lead to less immune responses because LNPs do not containing any viral-sourced immunogenic components. To date, they are being broadly utilized for in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo applications [51]. LNP-based delivery systems provide the possibility for highly efficient and stable nonviral CRISPR/Cas9 delivery. For example, Wang and colleagues [52] used a library of bioreducible LNP-based delivery systems to form Cas9/sgRNA complexes.",

They are further able to complex genetic material such as different types of RNA, if, for example, a potentially cationic stabilizer is added for complexation of the latter. 20 Stabilizers can, depending on the nature of their hydrophilic, ionic, or ionizable head groups, further provide tissue or organ selectivity, 21 regulate biocompatibility 13,22 and release properties. Receptor-targeting molecules can be attached to enable accumulation of the particles in specific cell types or tissues, and the protein adsorption pattern of the particle can be influenced. 23 The choice of the core-forming lipid, on the other hand, can influence particle stability. For example, a lipid with a melting point below body temperature can form a particle with a solid core and, therefore, higher stability (solid lipid nanoparticle, SLNP). 16 If shorter degradation times are desired, choosing a liquid lipid may be of advantage. 24 If the melting point of the lipid is close to body temperature, the stability of the particles may even change at a target location (temperature-responsiveness). 19 Replacing the pure lipid with a lipid mixture in the case of solid lipid nanoparticles helps to prevent expulsion of the stabilizer, which can occur upon crystallization of the lipid. 25 LNP sizes are dependent on both the stabilizer and the ratio of all compounds used in the formulation, and their internal structures can be complex, especially if genetic material is encapsulated. 20,26 odern LNP formulations that are used for, e.g., the encapsulation of mRNA-based vaccines, are comprised of a tailor-made mixture of lipids and stabilizers. 27,28 Ionic or ionizable stabilizers and phospholipids are needed for particle integrity and encapsulation of the payload.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a critical tool in the treatment of genetic/hereditary disorders, infectious diseases, and cancers, among other illnesses. LNP systems have been established to yield a safe and efficacious delivery of nucleic acid and small molecule drugs to target cells in the body. The worldwide use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines has ensured wide acceptability within scientific and regulatory bodies. Such systems have therefore drawn immense attention from academia and industry alike. For example, a search on clinicaltrials.gov reveals a sizeable number of ongoing clinical trials on LNP products. A list of these trials is presented in Table 1. \n\nAs seen from the sheer number of currently ongoing clinical studies (Table 1), LNPs are a field of \"hot pursuit\" for the delivery of nucleic acids, small molecules, and other drug cargos. This highlights the importance of gaining insights into LNP drug delivery systems. \n\nLipid-based delivery systems have come a long way over several decades since their first discovery and use as liposomes, which are lipidic bilayer vesicles broadly encapsulating hydrophobic drugs in the bilayer and hydrophilic drugs in the vesicular core. Liposomes are formed by liquid-crystalline lipid bilayers and have been prepared by complex production methods. To simply the manufacturing process and add rigidity to lipid vesicles, solid lipids were incorporated into the system to form solid lipid nanoparticles. Mixtures of solid and liquid crystalline lipids were used to form nanostructured lipid carriers. Then, with the requirement of incorporating a charged drug cargo, countercharged lipid exploration was initiated in lipid nanostructured delivery systems and the need for less toxic nanocarriers brought about the use of ionizable lipids. The quest for an enhancement in endosomal escape brought about the use of lipids with inverted cubic and hexagonal liquid crystalline phases. The progress of lipidic nanocarriers to the current form of LNPs, which are the most sought after lipidic nanocarriers for clinical use nowadays, has been recently thoroughly reviewed by Tenchov et al.

            "text": "This special mixture minimizes the dissemination of nanoparticles in healthy tissues while causing a selective concentration within the malignant tissue (7). To deliver drugs to tumors specifically, the EPR effect, which is tailored to lipid-based nanoparticles, is crucial for LBNPs. Therapeutic agent concentration in the tumor microenvironment is increased via passive targeting by the EPR effect. This selective accumulation reduces systemic side effects by increasing drug delivery to cancer cells while minimizing exposure to normal tissues, which is very useful in treating cancer (8). \n\nHowever, because of their exceptional biocompatibility, biodegradability, and entrapment effectiveness, LBNPs have also been acknowledged as an appropriate carrier for nucleic acids such as DNA, mRNA, and siRNA (9). The exponential growth of publications since the 1990s proves the LBNPs' ongoing success in treating various diseases and demonstrating their immense promise as next-generation drug delivery vehicles. LBNPs can be divided into three systems based on their nanostructure: liposomes, SLNs, and NLCs (10). The first approved double-stranded small interfering RNA in 2018 delivering LBNP is called ONPATTRO (patisiran) (11). In fact, since the 1980s, LBNPs with cationic lipids or pH-responsive lipids have been used to encapsulate and distribute nucleic acids (12). Ionizable cationic lipids are advantageous when creating LBNP systems since they have positive charges at lower pH values (pH < 6.0) but are neutral at physiological pH. LNPs made of cholesterol, phospholipid (1,2distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC]), ionizable cationic lipids (DLin-MC3-DMA), and polyethylene glycolmodified lipids (PEG2000-C-DMG) ensnape siRNA.",

These nanoparticles enable controlled drug release, making them particularly suitable for long-term cancer treatment, as they provide sustained therapeutic effects. In addition, they exhibit high physical stability, minimizing the risk of drug leakage during both storage and circulation, which represents an improvement over liposomal systems. Their size and surface properties also contribute to enhanced tumor accumulation through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Furthermore, lipid-based nanoparticles protect sensitive molecules, such as siRNA or DNA, from enzymatic degradation, which is essential for the effective delivery of genetic therapies. 121,122 owever, lipid-based nanoparticles also have limitations. Their capacity to load hydrophilic drugs is restricted, as they are more efficient in encapsulating hydrophobic compounds. The formulation process can be technically challenging, requiring meticulous control over parameters such as particle size and lipid composition to ensure optimal efficacy. Additionally, the surfactants used to stabilize these nanoparticles may cause irritation or toxicity at high concentrations, posing a potential limitation to their clinical application. 122 n cancer therapy, lipid-based nanoparticles are highly effective for delivering RNA-based therapeutics, including siRNA and mRNA, which play a critical role in targeting oncogenes and modulating immune responses.

Subsequently, they optimize drug delivery to specific target areas in lung cancer, concurrently minimizing exposure to healthy tissues, thereby increasing the treatment efficacy and decreasing side effects [174]. One example of LNPs is liposomes characterized by an aqueous center enveloped by a lipid bilayer [175]. The liposomes are utilized to encapsulate hydrophilic drugs like cisplatin, resulting in enhanced drug delivery and increased anticancer effectiveness compared to free cisplatin in preclinical trials [176]. LNPs are employed for combining various drugs to combat drug resistance. For instance, transferrin-functionalized protein-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (PLHNs) containing both cisplatin and docetaxel effectively inhibited lung tumor growth in BALB/C mice with lung cancer [177]. Furthermore, a promising strategy for overcoming EGFR resistance entails the use of a pulmonary microsphere system. One study has shown that administering afatinib and paclitaxel to NSCLC cells resistant to EGFR TKIs using a pulmonary microsphere system led to effective treatment of drug-resistant lung cancer [178]. Moreover, targeted delivery facilitated by LNPs can serve as a tool for immunotherapy. For example, combining an anti-PD-1 antibody with LNPs loaded with a STING agonist enhances the NK cell activity in lung metastatic tumors compared to using anti-PD-1 alone [179].",

            "text": "As with the development of other vaccines, using materials to develop nanovaccines is accompanied with many challenges and limitations, which vary depending on the type of nanomaterial used, with inorganic nanoparticles having more challenges than organic ones; and the type of vaccine carried (i.e., is it inactivated, live attenuated, or a protein subunit). Indeed, there are many studies in the literature discussing the challenges associated with the type of nanomaterial used, thereby determining their potential drawbacks, such as ensuring their biodegradability and biocompatibility, tailoring the elected immune response, and the ability to minimize their toxicity [59]. In terms of the vaccine's interactions with the used nanomaterials, studies have shown that some nanoparticles can enhance the efficacy of the carried drug, as shown in a study conducted by Zhao et al. [76]. Other studies suggested the benefit of using LNPs as carriers for the mRNA since great advances were made in this field, with data demonstrating the potential LNPs have in delivering mRNA-based vaccines. This is because LNPs are considered a stable delivery system that can preserve mRNA integrity, maintain their cellular uptake, and enhance the efficiency of their delivery and nucleic acid release in the host cells [59]. Despite having an idea about the challenges and drawbacks associated with the different types of nanomaterials, it is important to fully investigate and study the toxicity, immune interaction, and effect of nanoparticles on the carrying agent each time a nanovaccine is designed (e.g., when designing a vaccine for the MPXV). Finally, other challenges that could be faced and need to be taken into consideration when designing a nanovaccine for the MPXV are the cost effectiveness of the vaccine, the ability to scale it up, and its stability in different environments, as many of the MPX cases are in many counties that cannot afford strict storage and transport requirements.",

            "text": "owever, it should be underlined that one of the main challenges in using LNPs as drug delivery vehicles is their tendency to aggregate. By coating LNPs with PEG, the hydrophilic PEG chains create a steric hindrance that hinders the interaction of LNPs with each other, thus preventing aggregation. Hence, if effective strategies are developed to produce stealth LNPs without relying on PEGylation, it will also be essential to devise methods to reduce their tendency to aggregate. \n\nAnother constraint of the approved LNPs is their untargeted nature, resulting in a lack of specificity regarding their delivery to cells or tissues. This lack of targeting capability increases the potential for unwanted, off-target accumulation of the vaccine components, which can potentially lead to unpredictable side effects. LNP optimization for the efficient transfection of APCs, having a crucial role in the immune response, might improve the efficiency of the current mRNA vaccines. \n\nOne of the primary goals of future research will be to enhance LNP vaccines with a distinct targeting ability, specifically directed toward APCs. Among possible targeting strategies (reviewed in ref 21), one of the most consolidated approaches involves the conjugation of ligands to PEG moieties, creating stealth and targeted nanomedicine. This strategy aims to combine the supposed benefits of PEGylation with the specific binding capabilities of ligands, enabling targeted delivery to specific cells or tissues. However, issues related to ligand specificity, stability, and binding affinity play crucial roles in the success of targeted delivery. Other challenges include the heterogeneity and dynamic nature of target cells, which can exhibit variations in receptor expression and internalization mechanisms. Furthermore, the immune system's response to targeted NPs, such as the development of antidrug antibodies or immune clearance, poses additional hurdles to successful delivery. Despite extensive research in this field, the translation of targeted NP delivery into clinical applications has been therefore hindered, resulting in limited success. 22 In recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs.",

PEI nanoparticles and derivatives have been used experimentally for the delivery of different drugs, including siRNA and microRNAs (miRNAs), for the treatment of liver malignancies, but no clinical studies have yet been performed. 50 Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have very similar composition to cell membranes. Th y are formed by amphiphilic lipids that when dispersed in an aqueous environment spontaneously form spherical structures with a hydrophilic interior. LNPs are a suitable carrier for nucleic acid delivery because of their excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity and immunogenicity, structural flexibility, and ease of large-scale preparation. The use of LNPs has experienced a significant resurgence in GT as vehicles for siRNA and mRNAs. 51 However, the major challenge when developing LNP-based gene therapies is finding effective, tissue-specific delivery strategies. 52 Traditionally, targeting is achieved by physically or chemically conjugating ligands for specific receptors onto the nanoparticle surface. A  geting approach was developed by binding a multivalent GalNAc-cluster to the LNP. These nanoparticles have been shown to deliver mRNA molecules to hepatocytes with high efficiency, correcting mouse models of genetic diseases such as methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), PH1, GSD1a, citrin deficiency, acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), maple syrup urine disease, arginase deficiency, OTC deficiency, and progressive familial cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3). [53][54][55][56][57][58][59] The duration of action of a single dose of mRNA-LNP lasted between 2-3 weeks, requiring repeat administration to prolong a curative effect.

LNPs are clinically proven and the most widely used carriers for delivering oligonucleotide drugs. Composed of four components-ionizable cationic lipids, cholesterol, phospholipids, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified lipids-LNPs form electrostatic bonds with negatively charged nucleic acids [34,47]. However, one major limitation of LNP delivery is their tendency to accumulate in the liver [48]. To improve the intratumoral accumulation of siRNA-loaded LNPs, LNPs were functionalized with the peptide tLyp-1 (truncated Lyp-1) to target pancreatic cancer cells. When injected intravenously into mice bearing pancreatic tumors, the treatment using LNPs in combination with gemcitabine resulted in reduced tumor size and the downregulation of KRAS and phospho-ERK [40]. This highlights that the application of LNPs is not limited to liver-associated diseases and immunotherapy but is viable for developing siRNA-based therapies for KRAS mutant tumors [49]. \n\nFurthermore, various platforms for siKRAS delivery systems have been tested in preclinical settings, including cRGD peptide-modified bioresponsive chimeric polymersomes and aerosol inhalation nanoparticles (siKRAS@GCLPP NP) [50,51].",

LNPs are usually made of four key components: phospholipids assisting in particle structure; cholesterol aiding membrane fusion and stability; cationic or ionic lipids combining with negatively charged genetic material to promote endosomal escape; and PEGylated lipids improving circulatory conveyance and stability [36]. LNPs have increased their relevance to applications involving customized genetic treatments due to their efficacy in nucleic acid delivery, as well as to their small size, ease of synthesis, and stability in the serum [17]. In order to administer these nucleic acid-based therapeutics, ionizable LNPs are a robust delivery platform because they have a physiological near-neutral pH. However, once endocytosed, they become fully charged in the acidic endosomal compartments, facilitating their endosomal escape for intracellular drug delivery [37,38]. Despite these benefits, LNP systems might be hampered by poor drug loading and biodistribution, resulting in their significant uptake by the liver and spleen [21].",

            "text": "Liposomal nanoparticles or LNPs are one of the most progressive drug delivery systems with characteristics that enable targeted delivery at diseased sites including tumors. These have a diameter of about 100 nm, small drug to lipid ratio, good drug input with high retention, and long circulation time. The size of LNPs could be regulated with Total Flow Rate and Flow Rate Ratio; the LNPs could be created to have the size of 60-70 nm, remain stable for 16 weeks and have 81 percent encapsulation efficiency [17][18][19]. Liposomal nanoparticles refer to some of the most recent drug delivery systems with the following benefits in cancer treatment [20]. These nanoparticles improve the drugs' uptake in tumor tissues; minimize drug side effects; and preserve drug integrity. They enhance the specificity of cancer chemotherapeutic agents, reduce the toxic effect on normal tissues, enhance solubility of the drug and deliver drugs in a controlled manner [21,22]. Liposomes can be made in various size and composition to enhance delivery of drugs, some of the formulation are stable for a long time. They can incorporate different anti-cancer agents which in turn increases drug selectivity and decreased side effects [23]. Which can directly affect the cancer cells, an increase in drug selectivity and decrease the general side effects and toxicity of the therapy. As a result, they have the capacity to transport drugs in higher concentration to tissues that have tumours thus enhancing specific therapeutic action and minimizing toxic effects. Another application of liposomes is in drug delivery and imaging agents for assessment of the treatment progress. Nonetheless, due to their immunosuppressive and angiogenetic characteristics, therapy with nanoparticles is still important in cancer treatment Today, researchers are working to resolve issues, such as fragility, site-specific delivery and poor payload release prior to the required site [24][25][26]. Liposomes have shown a very good prospective in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). They help to target the medications at the tumor tissues; an aspect that increases the effectiveness of the treatment.",

            "text": "Fabricating LNP via microfluidics bears several advantages including precise control over parameters, high reproducibility, and the possibility for industrial scale-up [10,11]. Properties of LNP can be affected by various factors, including FRR, TFR, dimensions of the chip, lipid composition, and buffer choice [32,42]. The success of this method was further proven with the admission of the COVID-19 vaccines [10,42]. Besides the delivery of nucleic acids, those lipidbased nanocarriers including liposomes, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) and LNP can be promising formulations for oral drug delivery as well. Nevertheless, these systems should stay physically stable, meaning the particles should maintain a homogenous size distribution and prevent aggregation which could further cause phase separation and escape of the encapsulated drug [43]. Furthermore, the formulation can be impacted by lipid degradation either during storage or within the gastrointestinal tract. Especially changes in pH from acidic conditions in the stomach to neutral or alkaline environments in the intestine, variable concentration of salts, and electrolytes and gastrointestinal enzymes like pancreatic lipase are able to degrade those lipid-based nanocarriers, and continuing decomposition could as well lead to undesired drug release [44][45][46]. Possible strategies to overcome these problems can be based on suitable surface coating, e.g., PEG which sterically stabilizes the particles preventing aggregation and also hampers the adsorption of enzymes [45,47]. Moreover, non-digestible components can be chosen for the composition of the nanoparticles. LNP in our study were based on cholesterol, DSPC as structural lipid, MPEG-2000-DSPE as PEGylated lipid, and positive surfactants providing a positive surface charge of LNP. Cholesterol can improve the stability of LNP by modulating the integrity and rigidity of the cellular membrane [11,42,48,49]. DSPC is able to form a lamellar phase which stabilizes the structure of LNP and furthermore facilitates endosomal escape [11,48].",

The mechanisms of adverse responses of LNP-based vaccines include IgE-mediated allergy, non-IgE-mediated allergy, and autoimmune reaction [59], as visually represented in Figure 5. Thus, these aspects have to be thoroughly considered when designing novel LNP-based formulations and overcome through surface modification strategies. \n\nPolymeric NPs have also been an area of interest in vaccine development (Figure 6). They can encapsulate antigens and protect them from degradation while acting as delivery systems in targeted therapy. These NPs also have natural adjuvant properties that improve immunological responses and allow for the prolonged release of antigens. Polymeric NPs are easily formulated into many types of vaccines because they are biocompatible and biodegradable, reducing toxicity [69,70]. Polymeric NPs have also been an area of interest in vaccine development (Figure 6).

These NPs also have natural adjuvant properties that  In a recent study, researchers developed a surface-modified poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanocarrier system to protect a protein-based antigen for potential oral vaccine delivery. The surface-functionalized PLGA NPs demonstrated enhanced protection of the protein antigen in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids compared to non-functionalized NPs.",

In this review, we focused on the application of nano-encapsulation and conjugation to LNP-based delivery of nucleic acid materials to enable gene therapies. LNPs and LNP-production technologies allow the encapsulation and targeted delivery of a variety of genetic materials, including but not limited to siRNAs, mRNAs, and DNAs, as well as undruggable proteins [96], growth factors promoting tissue regeneration, and other bioactive molecules. \n\nThere are a variety of available techniques for LNP production, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. Compared with conventional LNP-production methods, microfluidic approaches can produce homogeneous-sized LNPs with high encapsulation efficiency and high reproducibility. Additionally, optimized approaches to generating LNP-encapsulated genetic materials with surface decorations suggest that LNPs have accelerated the development of targeted delivery and, ultimately, of further gene therapies. Multifunctional LNPs can be developed by incorporating multiple functionalities such as imaging agents or therapeutic molecules into LNPs. LNP production should be improved so that techniques can be expanded, and scalable manufacturing processes enabled. The next generation of RNA, cell, and gene therapies and combinations thereof, delivered via LNPs, will become essential in personalized nanomedicine for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",

In addition, of this, several nanoscale Drug Delivery Systems (DDSs) such as micelle, poly (D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid(13), liposome3) ), dendrimer (14), and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (15) have been recently developed and examined for ELT delivery in the cancer treatment. \n\nAmong the described drug nanocarriers, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) such as Liposomes, phytosomes, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), etc are available for DDSs of ELT delivery. LNPs as an effective systematic drug administration method is able to enhance the solubilization and stabilization of several drugs by protection of them from the biological fluids, and limitation of nonspecific cytotoxicity (16,17). It is reported that LNPs contain different advantages that make them a unique oral drug delivery system, including low cost raw materials, exclusively compared with phospholipids, easy scale-up and manufacture, high stability and storage, controlled release, and high versatility (17,18). Liposome and NLCs are interesting nanocarriers based on LNPs that could deliver their cargoes via encapsulation route (19,20). The first aim of the present study was to characterize and optimize different formulations of NLC and liposome ELTloaded systems. The second aim was to study in-vitro anti-cancer activity of the optimized formulations of ELT-liposome and ELT-NLC by assessment of their cellular cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and DNA fragmentations.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), based on ionizable lipids, are the most commonly used messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery vectors and play a crucial role in the research and clinical translation of mRNA therapy. By encapsulating mRNA within a lipid core, LNPs safeguard against mRNA degradation, enhance cellular uptake, and facilitate cytoplasmic release upon cellular entry [1]. Notably, LNPs boast an excellent drug-loading capacity, high encapsulation efficiency, sustained release, high stability, low toxicity, and enhanced efficacy. Currently, LNPs are the best choice for delivering nucleic acids. To date, three nucleic acid medicines based on LNPs have been approved. Patisiran, based on DLin-MC3-DMA lipids, is an RNA interference therapeutic drug used for treating hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) [2]. BNT162b2, which is based on ALC-0315 lipids, and mRNA-1273, which is based on SM-102 lipids, are mRNA vaccines used to prevent COVID-19 [3,4]. These applications demonstrate the success of LNP delivery systems for gene drugs and vaccines. \n\nThe momentum of preclinical research and clinical trials for mRNA-LNP drugs is on the rise. However, the current focus predominantly on liver delivery results in a prevalence of liver-targeted delivery among LNPs. DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) LNPs are the most representative vector for liver-targeted delivery. Both SM-102 and ALC-0315 are MC3 LNPs that primarily deliver mRNA to the liver after intravenous injection [5]. However, LNPs for extrahepatic-targeted mRNA delivery are still in the early stages of development. \n\nTo fully utilize the advantages of mRNA technology, such as its low cost, high efficiency, and short developmental cycles, the development of an extrahepatic-targeted delivery strategy for mRNA-LNPs is of great significance. Current research is focused on enhancing the accuracy of mRNA-LNP delivery to specific cells, tissues, or organs to improve the therapeutic effect and minimize potential side-effects.",

Nonetheless, increased fluidity of DOPE due to the unsaturated lipid tails might enhance interaction between LNPs and cellular membranes, facilitating internalization and intracellular release of the payload (Eygeris et al., 2022). \n\nLi et al. (Li et al., 2015a) developed LNP nanoparticles using N 1 ,N 3 , N 5 -tris(2-aminoethyl)benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (TT) lipids. Their study evaluated how the helper lipid affected the transfection of the LNPs and compared DOPE, DSPC, and POPE. The researchers found superior potency of DOPE over DSPC and POPE for mRNA delivery. Similarly, Cheng Q et al. (Cheng et al., 2018) evaluated mRNA delivery in vivo using DOPE and DSPC in dendrimer-based LNP formulations. The authors concluded that DOPE was advantageous in delivering nucleic acids. \n\nInterestingly, in an in vivo study comparing identical LNP formulations with either DOPE or DSPC as helper lipids, LNPs formulated with DOPE preferentially accumulated and exhibited better mRNA delivery to the liver compared to LNPs formulated with DSPC, which presented preferential accumulation to the spleen (Zhang et al., 2021a).",

This property may be more significant for gene drugs, as different lipids may contribute differently to nucleic acid encapsulation and delivery efficiency [45]. \n\nFunctionalization with ligands such as transferrin, lactoferrin, and peptides targeting integrins (e.g., RGD peptide) enhances the specificity of LNPs to glioblastoma cells. For example, NLCs functionalized with cyclic RGD peptides have shown improved targeting efficiency and tumor penetration in GBM mouse models. Additionally, surface modification with polyethylene glycol (PEG) enhances systemic circulation and minimizes immune clearance. Compared to polymeric nanoparticles and inorganic systems, LNPs provide superior biocompatibility, safety, and BBB-crossing potential. Polymeric nanoparticles, while versatile, often face challenges with biodegradability and immune clearance. Inorganic nanoparticles, such as gold or mesoporous silica, excel in imaging and theranostic applications but may exhibit cytotoxicity at higher concentrations. LNPs combine biocompatibility with flexibility for functionalization, making them ideal for targeted and sustained drug delivery in GBM therapy [46].",

            "text": "Traditional four-component LNP systems based on cationic ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and PEG-lipids have been extensively studied as a gene delivery platform [116]. As the functions of the four components are further studied and clarified, a more precise design can be carried out for the structure and content of each component to meet different application requirements. Benefiting from a high-throughput platform, polymeric nano-formulation based on the combination of specific monomers is identified to enable specific cell or organ targeting without requiring the incorporation of targeting ligands and is much more effective than [117][118][119][120]. \n\nThe charge of LNPs may be a key factor in determining their ability to selectively target tissues and organs. Researchers have reported a new strategy termed selective organtargeting (SORT) nanoparticles for tissue-specific CRISPR-Cas9 delivery. They augmented conventional four-component LNPs with a fifth component (termed SORT molecule) to modulate charge to change the LNPs' organ-targeting properties in vivo. Targeted CRISPR-Cas9 delivery to the liver and extrahepatic organs (spleen and lungs) was achieved with different supplemental SORT molecules and molar ratios [119]. Similarly, referring to the formulation protocol of SORT, LNP-assisted RNP delivery generates genome editing in both mouse liver and lungs [120]. The promise of lung-targeted therapeutic genome editing relies on the efficient delivery of gene-editing machinery bypassing mucus barrier and mucociliary clearance. There are research reports shown that replacing DOPE with the cationic lipid DOTAP can effectively improve the delivery efficiency of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in the lungs after systemic administration [69]. Wei and co-workers screened a series of permanently cationic lipids to optimize LNP for higher lung-specific activity. The results showed that DOTAP40 and DDAB30 have more remarkable lung targeting specificity in vivo than others, and the optimized DOTAP40 LNPs could successfully correct the CFTR mutations in cystic fibrosis models [87].",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), including solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), have been effectively utilized in clinical trials to deliver both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs. These nanoparticles, capable of encapsulating therapeutic agents in aqueous or lipid-based cores, improve drug stability, reduce side effects, and target specific cells, such as cancer cells [128]. These nanocarriers have been well known for many years and are primarily composed of natural materials, making them biocompatible, biodegradable, and safe for therapeutic use [129]. They are particularly valuable in cancer therapy due to their ability to cross the BBB, a critical feature for treating brain tumors like GBM [62,130]. In addition to GBM, LNPs are also promising for drug delivery and imaging in neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease [131][132][133], Alzheimer's disease [134], and strokes [135,136]. Their structure enables drug-controlled release, reducing toxicity and enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. LNPs provide a stable delivery platform for targeted cancer therapy, improving the precision and effectiveness of drug delivery [137]. The primary limitation of LNPs is their tendency to fuse, especially when the average size of the synthesized formulation is below 100 nm. This fusion leads to the leakage of encapsulated substances from the lipid vesicles and enhances dispersibility. However, this issue can be addressed by applying a PEG coating to the surface of the lipid nanoparticles [138]. Ionic liquids (ILs), such as choline-2-hexenoic acid, can further enhance tissue-specific drug delivery by facilitating LNP transport across the BBB using intravenous delivery. ILs help modulate the interaction of LNPs with serum proteins, potentially increasing drug accumulation at the BBB through red blood cell hitchhiking [139]. Originally focused on liver targets, LNPs have demonstrated high encapsulation efficiencies for macromolecules such as siRNA and mRNA [140][141][142] and are now being explored for CNS applications.",

Various LNP vaccines have been quickly developed and played vital roles in the COVID-19 pandemic, e.g., the Moderna vaccine 132 , and the application of LNP in nucleic acid (NA) delivery has also been highlighted 133 . Endosomal escape is a vital process for many NA drugs, and the utilization of ionizable lipids and functional helper lipids could provide essential pH-responsiveness in the endosome 134 . Onpattro\u00e2 (anti-transthyretin siRNA-loaded LNP) contains an ionizable cationic lipid (DLineMC3eDMA) which could convert the potential of liposomes to positive in the endosomal environment, resulting in the release of siRNA in target cells 135,136 . With the accumulating library of lipid materials with various functions and characteristics, LNPs holds great potential for versatile delivery of a universal selection of therapeutic agents, with greatly shortened time for formulation screening and optimization. To this end, however, the actual quality of relevant lipids in both laboratory research and scaled-up production requires more emphasis. \n\nBesides liposomes and LNPs, lipids assist in various promising platforms such as nanostructured lipid nanocarriers (NLCs), lipid-drug conjugates, self-emulsifying systems, etc 137e140 . Lipid-based smart vehicles promise a bright future for cancer treatment in the next decade or so. They might become a major arsenal for safer and more efficient treatments by ensuring proper drug localization in tumors and on-demand drug release. Although substantial advances have been made, efforts are still needed to solve the problems of scale-up and clinical verification to transfer lipid-based therapy from laboratories to clinics.",

To further enhance the capability of drug delivery at targeted sites, many ligands conjugating with lipid-based nanoparticles have also been employed, including small compounds, carbohydrates, peptides, proteins, and antibodies. 182,183",

The negatively charged ApoLNPs with cancer cell-specific pro-apoptotic prodrug (SMAC-P-FRRG-DOX) show the highest tumor-targeting efficacy when they are treated with the MSC guidance, compared to their intravenous or intratumoral administration in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. The MSC-guided administration of anticancer drug-encapsulated LNPs is expected to be a potent platform system that facilitates overcoming the limitations of systemic drug administration with low delivery efficiency and serious side effects. \n\nKeywords Micro-syringe, Drug delivery system, Intratumoral administration, Lipid nanoparticle, Anticancer therapy",

            "text": "Nanoparticles-based drug delivery systems offer an advanced and effective approach for the treatment of OSCC, providing several significant advantages over conventional therapies due to their unique properties and capabilities. These systems can encapsulate therapeutic agents, enhancing their solubility, stability, and bioavailability, which is crucial for most anticancer drugs that have poor water solubility and are prone to rapid degradation in the biological environment [10,11]. The nanoscale size of these particles allows them to penetrate tumor tissues more effectively via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. This effect exploits the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage characteristics of solid tumors, leading to higher drug concentrations at the target site thereby reducing the exposure of drug to healthy tissues, and reducing systemic toxicity. Nanoparticles have shown the potential to encapsulate more than one chemotherapeutic drug. The biocompatibility and biodegradability of nanoparticles further ensure safety and tolerability [12][13][14]. Among different classes of nanoparticles, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) emerge as a promising platform with the potential to revolutionize OSCC treatment. LNPs are composed of lipids that are naturally occurring or biologically similar, making them biocompatible and biodegradable, which minimizes the risk of toxicity and adverse effects [15]. Many anticancer drugs have poor water solubility, but LNPs can encapsulate hydrophobic drugs, improving their solubility and stability in the biological environment, which enhances their bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. LNPs demonstrate significantly higher ability to encapsulate lipophilic drugs than other nanoparticle types. LNPs offer excellent storage stability, minimal drug leakage, and controlled drug release, rendering them highly effective nanoplatforms for the delivery of different chemotherapeutic agents [16,17]. Additionally, LNPs can be modified by complexing them with specific target ligands on their surface. This surface modification allows the active targeting of LNPs to the tumors in addition to the passive targeting mechanism [18].",

            "text": "Several in vivo studies have shown that modifications of lipid composition help to \"redirect\" the nanoparticles to the lungs and spleen (Meyer et al., 2022;Dilliard et al., 2021;Gueguen et al., 2024). Pilot studies on rodents were recently published that present successful targeting of LNPs to various types of tumors, to the pancreas, placenta, brain, retina, and spermatocytes (Blakney et al., 2019;Xiong et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2022;Melamed et al., 2023;Young et al., 2022;Tuma et al., 2023;Waggoner et al., 2023;Patel et al., 2019;Ryals et al., 2020;Du et al., 2023). In addition to \"targeting\" of LNPs via the modifications of lipid composition, the incorporation of various protein macromolecules and antibodies into LNPs seems to be another promising field (Lee et al., 2023). \n\nActive targeting of LNPs can be achieved via incorporation of presynthesized vectors (specific lipids or small-molecule compounds conjugated to lipids) into the nanoparticles or via postmodification of LNPs (attachment of antibodies) (Lin et al., 2023). Inclusion of a mannose moiety leads to active transport of the nanoparticles into dendritic cells, which is actively exploited to develop antitumor drugs (Lei et al., 2024) or specific vaccines, for example, against African swine fever (Gong et al., 2024), as well as to improve intradermal delivery of LNPs (Goswami et al., 2019). Another example of a small-molecule compound for active delivery is the use of a neurotransmitter conjugated with an ionizable lipid for designing LNPs for the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system (Ma et al., 2020).",

INPs such as gold NPs, zinc NPs, silver NPs, iron NPs, and very recently novel INPs with nanodiamonds and graphene have been explored in the context of cancer treatment [148,149]. Gold NPs functionalized with tyrosine kinase inhibitor have been explored as a delivery vehicle and found to be effective in the inhibition of dual tyrosine kinase in metastatic breast cancer treatment. In a study by Tsai and associates, it was observed that gold NPs coated with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)/gallate has the ability to enhance the efficacy of doxorubicin delivery and inhibit PC-3 cancer cell proliferation in prostate cancer [150,151]. Silver NPs have the dual function of anticancer therapy as well as cancer cell imaging. Boca-Farcau and colleagues showed that silver NPs along with surface conjugation of folic acid and labeled with a p-aminothiophenol Raman reporter molecule can be used as a targeted cancer cell treatment. Another study demonstrated the cancer cell diagnosis and imaging capacity of silver-gold nanorods [152][153][154]. A lipid-based nanosystem was first introduced into the market by the Dior brand in 1986 [155]. However, it gained popularity after COVID-19 emerged like never before. LNPs can overcome several obstacles encountered in other nanoparticle-based anticancer drug delivery systems such as tissue toxicity, poor cellular uptake, particle aggregation, etc. Hence, LNPs are identified as a promising nanoparticle-based delivery method. This system can co-encapsulate a treatment moiety and imaging agent, providing both therapeutic and diagnostic functionalities [156]. In 2021, Prasad and co-workers developed lipid theranostics by incorporating gold nanoparticles as an imaging tool along with a chemotherapeutic agent.",

            "text": "Respiratory track delivery of drug-loaded LNPs is a direct method for the treatment of various pulmonary and respiratory diseases that relies on the inhalation of aerosolized drug formulations.With a large absorptive surface area, the lungs provide a rapid and widespread delivery pathway while reducing systemic clearance and metabolism. 128Local delivery to the lungs also minimizes the risk of systemic adverse events that can limit a drug's therapeutic index.Resultingly, the dose required for equivalent effects by systemic delivery is typically lower for LNPs delivered by inhaled lipid nanoparticles. 98Inhaled LNPs can be designed for higher tumor selectivity and optimized for sufficient residence time in the lungs.There are, nonetheless, several physiological challenges associated with pulmonary delivery.The heterogeneous structure of the respiratory tract can affect drug delivery, with various resident cell types exhibiting different nanoparticle uptake and sequestration rates. 129Further, clearance mechanisms of the lung that protect its mucosal layer must be considered, especially in diseased lungs.Pathological mucus is typically more dehydrated and viscous, which significantly alters its protein concentration and charge, which in turn can reduce the penetration of lipid nanoparticles. 129This can be overcome through various coatings and conjugations, an example of which is the coating of chitosan residues onto liposomes. 98In acidic formulations, chitosan is protonated, thereby becoming positively charged and more capable of passing through the negatively charged mucins.\n\nTo ensure that damage to healthy lung cells is minimized, LNPs can also be designed to preferentially target and release drugs in lung cancer cells after inhalation.Targeted liposomes loaded with triptolide, as shown in Figure 5a, were delivered through pulmonary administration to mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 96iptolide has been shown to be cytotoxic to cancer cells and sensitizing to chemotherapy in vitro, however, as it is highly toxic and poorly water soluble, liposomal encapsulation is considered a promising delivery option.Conjugation of anti-carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX)",

            "text": "Chemical modifications and nanotechnology-based delivery systems have been developed to encapsulate therapeutic miRNAs [117]. Virus-like nanoparticles and non-viral nanoparticles (NPs) have successfully delivered miRNA mimics or antagonists [118]. These NPs include liposomes, polymers, dendrimers, nanocelles, solid lipid NPs, silica NPs, nanotubes, metal NPs, and quantum dots [115]. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the gold standard delivery agent for nucleic acids [119]. LNPs closely pack oligonucleotides through electrostatic interaction, protecting them from nuclease degradation and overcoming physiological barriers that hinder nucleic acid translation [120]. LNPs efficiently target the liver or other organs by facile modulation of lipid components [121]. A milestone in gene therapy occurred in 2018 when LNPs allowed the translation of the first FDA-approved RNA interference (RNAi)-based drug (Onpattro, Patisiran) [122]. A few years saw the breakthrough achievement of mRNA vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19). An LNP-platform encapsulating miRNA to treat solid tumors reached a phase 1 trial (NCT04675996) [123]. It is expected that non-viral vectors such as LNPs successfully promote the translation of angiomiR by delivering the cargo to specific angiogenesis-promoting cells and highly angiogenic tumors. \n\nNPs can be modified to increase nucleic acid stability in serum and improve their endosomal escape and biocompatibility. Surface functionalization of NPs with a targeting moiety to surface-expressed biomolecules found either on ECs or the tumor cells can increase selectivity and specific uptake in the target tissue (active targeting) [124,125]. Likewise, modulation of NP components with stimuli-responsive materials can promote selective delivery of cargo in the tumor microenvironment [125]. Fine-tuning of physicalchemical properties can also influence the in vivo fate of NPs.",

            "text": "Lipid-based carrier systems mimicking the composition of pulmonary surfactant or the cell membrane enhance the ability to overcome the lungs' biological barriers and reduce toxicity and antigenicity. [12,13] One of the biggest breakthroughs of siRNA therapeutics was the approval of the first siRNA-LNP drug, Onpattro\u00ae (Patisiran) by the FDA (Food and Drug Association, USA) and EMA (European Medicines Agency). Onpattro\u00ae consists of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating siRNA in its lipid matrix to treat hereditary amyloidogenic transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis. [14,15] The target is the liver after intravenous administration. Recently, LNP technology has also enabled the rapid development and approval of mRNAbased vaccines against COVID-19. [16] These types of LNPs consist of phospholipids, cholesterol, polyethylene glycol-conjugated lipids, and ionizable helper lipids. Ionizable helper lipids bind to anionic RNA to enable efficient encapsulation and promote endosomal escape following internalization into the target cell. [17] The major advantage of LNP technology is its adaptability to different siRNA payloads as its physicochemical properties remain similar. [18] Therefore, LNP formulations can potentially be pursued to deliver therapeutic cargoes via different administrative routes for the treatment of a large variety of diseases. \n\nThe lungs are one of the most complex organs and offers advantages of local, over systemic, delivery such as noninvasive access and a large alveolar surface area. [19] Furthermore, the administered dose can be reduced for local effects compared to systemic delivery, resulting in decreased side effects. Regarding RNA delivery to the lungs, the absence of serum proteins on the air-side keeps the nuclease activity relatively low. [20] Therefore, drugs can most effectively be delivered by inhalation and are immediately available to the lungs. [21,22] In order to deliver drugs or nanoparticles to the lungs, incorporation into microparticles with aerodynamic diameters between 1 and 5 \u03bcm are required.",

            "text": "LNPs, typically surrounded and stabilized by lipid bilayers with an aqueous (liposomes), oil, solid, or amorphous core (for nucleic acid delivery), are one of the most common nanoparticle formulations used to deliver anti-cancer drugs or genes because of their stable drug encapsulation and enhanced delivery efficiency [73]. The initial success of several liposome/LNPs-based drugs has fuelled further clinical investigations [74]. The improved therapeutic outcomes of Doxil \u00ae (a liposome formulation of doxorubicin) and the recent approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Silver Spring, MD, USA) for LNP-loaded mRNA vaccines used to prevent COVID-19 have made LNPs a promising drug delivery system for various diseases [75]. Due to uniform particle size distribution, LNPs have exhibited superior biodistribution in vivo, which has established them as outstanding drug carriers for lung cancer treatment [76]. Moreover, since the main components of LNPs (e.g., phospholipids and cholesterol) are very similar to pulmonary surfactants in mammals, several highly biocompatible and biodegradable inhaled LNPs are promising candidates for pulmonary drug delivery [77]. Studies indicated that inhaled LNPs could increase the therapeutic effect of the drug and decrease the systemic toxicity simultaneously because they are able to restrict the drug effect in the pulmonary system for a prolonged time [78]. \n\nVillanueva and colleagues reported the potential of STAT3 decoy-loaded cationic lipid microbubbles (STAT3-MB) combined with ultrasound-targeted microbubble cavitation (UTMC) in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The STAT3 decoy was loaded via charge-charge interaction.",

            "text": "Delivery systems form a versatile foundation for the practical application of mRNA technologies, which play indispensable roles in protecting mRNA, enhancing delivery efficiency, and achieving precise targeting. The evolution of lipid-based delivery systems dates back to the 1960s with the introduction of liposomes. These vesicles, composed of phospholipid bilayers, could encapsulate both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs, marking the beginning of a new era in drug delivery [51,52]. However, limitations in stability and drug-loading capacity prompted the development of solid lipid nanoparticles in the 1990s, which utilized solid lipids to achieve greater physical stability [53]. In the 2000s, nanostructured lipid carriers were introduced, combining solid and liquid lipids to improve drug-loading efficiency and release control, particularly for cancer therapies and sustained drug release [54]. The 2010s witnessed groundbreaking advances with the emergence of ionizable LNPs, which leverage pH-responsive properties to enable efficient nucleic acid delivery [55]. This technology achieved notable recognition in 2018 with the FDA approval of Patisiran, the first LNP-based nucleic acid therapy [56]. Finally, in the 2020s, LNP technology reached its pinnacle with the delivery of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, where it played a crucial role in protecting mRNA and enhancing intracellular delivery, as demonstrated by the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines [57]. \n\nLNPs are typically composed of four fundamental lipid components: ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified lipids [58]. Ionizable lipids, which are neutral at physiological pH, become positively charged in acidic environments such as endosomes. This pH-sensitive property facilitates the fusion of LNPs with the endosomal membrane, enabling the release of mRNA into the cytoplasm. Phospholipids contribute to the bilayer structure of LNPs, mimicking the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, thereby enhancing interactions with membrane structures and improving delivery efficiency.",

            "text": "In the last decade, nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as innovative and promising tools for both diagnostics and therapy; they offer all the physicochemical advantages of nanosystems, and they can be easily modified to suit the desired purpose. As engineered nanomaterials, they proved to be effective drug delivery systems due to their size and their capacity to enter several biological barriers like gastrointestinal walls, blood brain barrier, and cell membranes, overcoming the limitations classically related to traditional drugs [42,43]. Given the promising characteristics of the NPs, several fabrication strategies and a plethora of materials have been explored to the preparation of new nanosystems for BC treatment [24,44,45]. Among them, lipid NPs (LNPs) present major advantages as drug delivery agents by demonstrating precise targeting, reduced side effects, efficient pharmacokinetics and low toxicity, also overcoming the challenge of multidrug resistance [46][47][48][49][50]. Moreover, LNPs production is easily scalable, as demonstrated by several studies and by the massive production of anti-covid vaccines during the last pandemic. \n\nThese are just a few reasons why LNPs have been extensively used as delivery platforms, now standing as the most efficient means of RNA delivery [51][52][53][54][55], exemplified by the approval of Patisiran for amyloidosis therapy in 2018 [56,57]. In the last decade, RNA-LNPs based therapy has also shown effectiveness in BC treatment (Fig. 3), providing a smart, alternative approach and increasing the success rate of BC cure, including the most resistant forms [56,58]. \n\nBut can RNA-LNPs therapy be a standalone approach for BC treatment? This perspective provides an overview of the most recent, mostly within the last 5-years, RNA-based LNPs for BC gene therapy. It focuses on the different types of RNAs used, by giving a perspective on whether RNA-LNPs therapies can be a viable strategy for BC treatment.",

Lipid-based nanocarriers or nanoparticles (LNPs) have various favourable properties, making them an ideal choice. LNPs are characteristically spherical and possess a lipid solid core with a matrix containing soluble lipophilic molecules. As cell membranes are mainly composed of lipids and phospholipids, lipid-based nanocarriers as a drug transport have the natural advantage of better interaction with cells, and therefore facilitating better cellular uptake of transported drug [74]. Furthermore, lipid nanoparticle materials are biocompatible and biodegradable [75]. Several notable classes of lipid-based nanocarriers have been studied for RNA delivery, including liposomes, solid lipid-based nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, lipidoid nanoparticles, lipophilic conjugates, transfersomes, lipospheres and nanoemulsions. [14,76,77]. It is important to note that there are many other lipid-based carrier systems out there; however, Table 1 summarises some of them and their advantages. Positively charged carriers that include stable nucleic acid-lipid particles (SNALPs) and solid-lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). SNALPs are made from a lipid bilayer containing cationic and fusogenic lipids, stabilised with a diffusible polyethylene glycol-lipid (PEG-lipid) while SLNs consist of natural components of protein-free low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). \n\nProtection against harsh environmental situations Ease of large-scale production Nanostructured lipid carriers [75,76] Second generation SLNs formed from a mixture of solid and liquid lipids resulting in an unstructured-matrix due to the different moieties of the constituents.",

Their main advantages over other classes include biocompatibility, biodegradability, safety, as well as incorporation and codelivery of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules, with the latter enabling the theranostic concept and addressing the issue of real-time interaction between diagnosis and therapy. Liposomes, niosomes, transfersomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), lipid nanocapsules (LNCs), core-shell lipid nanoparticles (CLNs), lipid-based micelles and hybrid systems are representatives of this class of nanoparticles (Figure 1) [7,8]. These nanosystems are considered bioinspired because they mimic natural and physiological components and hold great promise as delivery vehicles for nanotheranostic applications [9]. \n\nThe main ingredients of LNPs are lipids and surfactants, including phospholipids, cholesterol, solid and liquid lipids (fats and oils), as well as non-ionic and other surfactants [10]. In many of these cases, the components self-assemble into the liquid crystalline phase, which presents complex dynamics and metastable phases that are critical to the functionality of the systems [11,12]. LNPs can also contain lipids and materials with distinct structures and physicochemical characteristics, which lead to specific self-assembly, properties and biomedical applications (Table 1). The most recent well-known example is that of ionizable cationic lipids. These lipids have a pK a below 6.5 and during their development, they are charged, while they are non-charged in physiological pH. This class of lipids has been fully exploited for the development of some the recent COVID-19 vaccines. When mixed with genetic material, such as siRNA or mRNA, they produce complexes with internal hydrophobic and hydrophilic compartments.",

Based on a library of lipid-like compounds, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, MA, USA) 84 found that efficacious materials such as C12-200 achieved persistent gene silencing and multi-targeted approaches. Kim and colleagues 85 formulated a small lipid nanoparticle-based nanovaccine platform to display the tumor antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), and combined it with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, which led to an effective antitumor effect. Lipid-assisted nanoparticles also improve the antigen load by using a double emulsion method, and subsequently this method enhances intracellular delivery of antigens to activate immunological responses 86 . To further develop lymph node-targeted delivery of vaccines that result in higher humoral and cellular immune responses, Yu et al. 87 used melittin-lipid nanoparticles to confirm the ideal LN-target for cancer immunotherapy. \n\nThe recent use of LNPs as carriers involves their application in lipid-complexed mRNA vaccines, which increase uptake, extend half-life, and favor efficient delivery of mRNA 13,88 . To address insufficient intracellular mRNA expression and deficient presentation to DCs, a variety of LNP-assisted mRNA vaccines have been designed to deliver mRNA and activate a systemic immune response, such as heterocyclic LNPs to activate immunity via the mRNA-mediated STING pathway 89 , mRNA loaded into cationic DOTAP nanoparticles to enhance transfection efficiency 90 , and a nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccine to efficiently provide potent immune responses 91 .",

[17] Overall, the success of LNPs in recent years marks a pivotal shift in the landscape of drug delivery technologies. \n\nHowever, to date, no LNP-based mRNA or DNA delivery systems have been applied to bacteria, although they potentially represent a promising and innovative substitute for other delivery systems to AMR bacteria. The rapid development capability of LNP makes them suitable for targeting AMR bacteria. In this study, we developed bacteria-targeting LNPs with the aim of controlling Escherichia-derived sepsis in vivo (Figure 1). We screened LNPs for their ability to deliver efficiently a Cas13a/gRNA expression vector into bacterial cells. We found that \"LNP-helpers\" capable of weakening the bacterial outer membrane are essential for the delivery of LNPs. When the gRNA was designed to recognize the 16s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, the LNP-encapsulated Cas13a/gRNA expression vector controlled pathogenic bacteria infection in mouse and Galleria mellonela infection models.",

Fenton and co-workers designed a LNP delivery system that can encapsulate mRNA and transfect B lymphocytes in the spleen, inducing protein expression in B cells (Figure 8B) [77]. While LNPs can be transiently observed in the liver and other organs, this LNP can induce the expression of more than 85% of the protein in the spleen. These results suggest that OF-Deg-Lin mRNA LNPs, as delivery vehicles, can significantly enhance protein expression in B lymphocytes in the spleen. It also demonstrates the significant advantages of nanomaterials in achieving organ and cell targeting. Liu et al. developed a novel mRNA delivery vehicle, DAL4-LNP, for delivering cytokines mRNA (Figure 8C) [78]. By intratumorally injection of DAL4-LNP loaded with GFP-coding mRNA (DAL4-LNP-GFP) into B16F10 tumors, the authors observed that LNP can selectively deliver mRNA targeting to CD19 B cells. By flow cytometry analysis, approximately 98% of GFP-positive immune cells are B cells.",

            "text": "The lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is one of the most promising nanotechnologies for the delivery of RNA molecules, such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA), in both in vitro and in vivo situations. The key components of the LNPs are ionizable cationic lipids that contain pH-sensing tertiary amine groups in their structures [1]. The surface of LNPs containing ionizable cationic lipids had a neutral charge under physiological conditions. This neutral charge permits nonspecific electrostatic interaction with biomolecules to be avoided [2,3]. On the other hand, these ionizable cationic lipids develop a positive charge in an acidic environment. The positive charge facilitates the endosomal escape process via interactions with the anionic cellular membranes in the acidic endosomal compartment [4,5]. The usefulness of the LNPs has already been proven in the clinic. In 2018, ONPATTRO \u00ae , an LNP that contained a siRNA (siRNA-LNP) against transthyretin, was approved as the first siRNA therapeutic technology for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis [6]. Although the mainstream of the development of siRNA therapeutics is shifting to the use of ligand-conjugated siRNA, especially to the glycoprotein N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-conjugated siRNA for targeting the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on hepatocytes (i.e., Givlaari \u00ae , Oxlumo \u00ae , Leqivio \u00ae , and Amvuttra \u00ae ), the LNP is still considered to be a key drug delivery system (DDS) technology for nucleic acid delivery [7]. \n\nLNPs have been shown to be important for the delivery of messenger RNA. Transfection with mRNA has been hampered by its high inflammatory properties.",

            "text": "MALAT1 was also the target in preclinical studies with short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to overcome the anti-androgen enzalutamide (Enz) resistance (EnzR) in castration-resistant prostate cancer. The administration of the MALAT1 short interfering RNA (10 mg/kg) for 2 weeks in xenograft mice, injected with EnzR cells, significantly suppressed the EnzR tumors [320]. Even if these RNA-based therapeutic modalities have great potential to generate a new therapeutic approach in disease in general, and in cancer in particular, to reach their full potential they first need to overcome the lipid bilayer of the cell wall to deliver RNA into cells. Indeed, the delivery methods remain the major problem to solve for the widespread development of RNA therapeutics [321]. Besides the cellular barrier, specific pharmacological barriers should also be improved. Indeed, synthetic ncRNA mimics and inhibitors generally degrade rapidly in biological fluids, absorb poorly into the intracellular space, and often may fail to reach specific target locations [305]. The delivery of drugs with nanoparticles can overcome many of these limitations. Indeed, nanocarriers encapsulate drugs and control their pharmacokinetic properties by regulating the drug release and increasing the half-life. To date, the delivery approaches with nanoparticles include lipid-based nanoparticles (LNP), polymer-based nanoparticles (PNP), and lipid-polymer hybrids. LNP are vesicles with a diameter range of 10-500 nm composed of multiple lipid layers stabilized in aqueous media by a single layer of surfactants (phospholipids, poly(ethylene glycol)-based surfactants). LNPs represent a well-established delivery system for gene therapies and are approved by the FDA for liver siRNA delivery [322]. LNPs offer several advantages, including enhanced drug stability, reduced toxicity, and control of the release rate [323,324]. Despite these promising aspects, several drawbacks remain to be addressed.",

            "text": "The authors obtained a good separation profile for liposomes and three main acceptor domains (albumin, HDL, and LDL) [58]. This study confirmed that rigid liposomes and PEGylated fluid liposomes showed higher stability in human plasma when compared to non-PEGylated fluid liposomes. This means that the bilayer composition of a liposomal formulation plays a significant role in stability and drug release in biological media. Hence, separation of the plasma-liposome sample by AF4 seems to be a potential alternative to already established methods. \n\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are typically spherical nanoparticles with a solid lipid core that act as a novel pharmaceutical drug delivery system [84,85]. LNPs were first approved as a drug delivery vehicle in 2018 for the drug Onpattro to treat polyneuropathy in patients with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis [86]. It became more widely known in late 2020 because some COVID-19 vaccines, notably mRNA-1273 [87] and BNT162b [88], used PEGylated-lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery [89]. Similar to liposomal drug formulations, determination of payload content relative to LNP size can be important to understand the efficacy and safety. AF4 has been successfully used for the separation and characterization of lipid-based drug delivery systems; however, electrostatically interacting LNP complexes with the relatively labile lipid-monolayer coating are more prone to destabilization during the focusing step in the conventional AF4 channel [90]. \n\nNon-focusing AF4 channels (frit-inlet or dispersion channel) can circumvent the instability of the LNPs during conventional AF4 separation. In a recent study, Mildner et al., demonstrated AF4 with the frit-inlet channel was well-suited for the analysis of lipid-based nanoparticles for RNA delivery with satisfactory reproducibility and sample recovery [39].",

            "text": "Lipid-based nanoparticles are among the most well established nanoparticle systems applied to delivery of RNA [30].\n\nBy encapsulation of RNA, LNPs protect cargo from extracellular nucleases allowing safe delivery of unmodified ONs to cells. Complexation of ONs with cationic lipids, like 1,2-di-O-octadecenyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTMA) or 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP), neutralize charges, condense long ON chains, and improve encapsulation when mixed with zwitterionic lipids, such as 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC). Delivery of ONs complexed only by DOTMA, or other cationic lipids, is known as lipofection, and is the most popular in vitro transformation method [127]. Unfortunately, most lipofection reagents are not suitable for in vivo delivery due to high cytotoxicity making liposomal formulations more suitable for therapeutic applications [128]. In more recent LNP formulations, cationic lipids are substituted by ionizable lipids, such as analogues of 1,2-dioleyloxy-N,N-dimethyl-3-aminopropane (DODMA), which are positively charged during complexation, neutral once encapsulated, and again positively charged in endosomes, allowing to interact with endogenous, negatively charged lipids and promote cargo release [129]. In in vivo applications, this simple formulation can elicit inflammatory response and if unresolved can create entrained allergic reaction or even death [130]. Therefore, addition of PEGylated lipids to LNP formulations became popular resulting in lower opsonization and increased circulation time. At the same time, PEG coated LNPs show much lower cellular uptake and hindered endosomal escape, creating the so called 'PEG dilemma', where too little PEGylate lipids lowers circulation time but",

            "text": "One nanoparticle that has already been approved for the first-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, is the nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) [9]. Nab-paclitaxel has been confirmed as a safe and effective therapy in combination with carboplatin for patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer [10]. Although nab-paclitaxel is superior to conventional chemotherapies in terms of toxicity, there are still some safety concerns related to albumin-based nanoparticles [11,12]. Lipid nanoparticles, in contrast, have a quite high biocompatibility and are less toxic and immunogenic compared to other nanoparticles [13]. This results from the fact that LNPs are very small particles, mainly built by lipids and other biochemical compounds [8]. Administration routes are usually either systemic (intravenous injection) or local (e.g., intramuscular, intradermal, and subcutaneous injection), mainly depending on the therapeutic indication. For lung cancer, another possible application route of LNP-based agents is added: topical administration by direct inhalation into the lungs [14]. Current research suggests that LNPs hold the potential to serve as a safe and effective pulmonary drug delivery platform, allowing high concentrations at the desired site with less systemic toxicity [15]. \n\nThe current relevance of LNPs in the therapy of solid tumors, including lung cancer, also becomes evident when looking at the accepted and published abstracts at the ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology) Annual Meeting and the AACR (American Association for Cancer Research) Annual Meeting this year. It's not only the high number of ongoing areas of research concerning first-in-human studies on the efficacy, safety, and dosing of different LNP-associated anticancer agents that is remarkable [16,17], but also the forward-looking nature of the projects [18,19].",

            "text": "The present study examined a siRNA-based approach targeting SAT1 expression in GB. While siRNA-based therapeutics have enormous potential for targeted silencing of critical pathways involved in cell signaling and metabolism in cancer [34,35], safe and effective delivery is crucial. In this regard, LNPs have both biocompatibility and loading efficiency as merits for consideration. The lipid composition of the LNPs plays a significant role in determining the drug entrapment efficiency, size, surface charge and blood circulation half-life. Usually, a mixture of lipids is used in LNP formulation to achieve the desired physicochemical and drug loading/delivery properties. We focused on DODAP, DSPC, cholesterol, DSPE-PEG2000 and DiO as the lipid components for our initial formulation trial. DODAP is an ionizing lipid (PKa: 6.6-7) that carries a cationic charge at acidic pH and, therefore, can electrostatically bind to the negatively charged siRNA. Hence, the high encapsulation efficiency (>95%) of siRNA observed in the present study could be attributed to the presence of DODAP in the lipid mix. The LNPs used in the present study also included a PEG lipid component to aid in the optimization of both the size and stability of the LNPs. It has been reported that increasing the PEG lipid composition can reduce the size of the LNPs [36]. While highly hydrophilic nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm in diameter are rapidly cleared from the circulation via extravasation and renal clearance [37], nanoparticles larger than 200 nm in diameter are efficiently removed by the reticuloendothelial system [38]. As our intended target resides within the brain, we postulated that LNP sizes between 60-100 nm in diameter would have the greatest chance for delivery across the BBB when combined with the transient opening of the BBB using cadherin peptides. The incorporation of PEG (1.5%) into the LNP formulation resulted in a LNP of approximately 80 nm in diameter that retained a high siRNA encapsulation efficiency.",

            "text": "delivery. Multiple biomedical products, such as controlled release depots and absorbable sutures, already incorporate polymers, laying a foundation for successful clinical translation, and their properties can be controlled using chemical synthesis to produce efficacious delivery systems 5,6 . Collectively, lipid and polymer nanoparticles represent the largest share of non-viral systems studied for nucleic acid delivery.\n\nIn this Review, we discuss recent advances in the engineering of lipid and polymer nanoparticles for the delivery of genetic drugs to specific organs and cell types in the body. Other approaches and materials have been excellently summarized elsewhere [7][8][9][10] . Genetic drugs based on nucleic acid biomolecules must reach the cytosol of target cells while avoiding bystander cells, which necessitates the design of tissue-targeted delivery systems. As cell-based assays can be a poor predictor of in vivo performance, we limit our scope to delivery systems whose organ-targeting properties have been validated in animal models 11 . Although we emphasize targeting specific organs and cell types via intravenous (i.v.) administration, alternative modes of administration can also be used to control the biological fate of a delivery system 12 . Three mechanisms, passive, active and endogenous targeting (Box 1), are leveraged to engineer nanoparticles that reach specific organs through the vascular network. Delivery using passive and active targeting has been extensively investigated for decades. However, endogenous targeting represents an emerging paradigm based on a growing understanding of how the protein corona impacts delivery. The examples we provide highlight mechanisms for organ-specific delivery of genetic drugs, but we anticipate that these Review article that appears to depend on the choice of nucleic acid cargo, the lipid composition of the LNP, formulation method and processing 23 .\n\nThe structure and properties of LNPs depend on both the chemistry of the constituent lipids and their molar proportions. Thus, it is important to understand the function of each lipid in an LNP, identify or synthesize appropriate lipid molecules to execute those functions and test the efficacy of different LNP chemical compositions and combinations in vivo 24 . Optimization of the chemistry of the ionizable cationic lipid component of LNPs has been the focus of extensive efforts 15 . A",

            "text": "intravenous, subcutaneous, among others) (Pillai and Panchagnula, 2001;Alexis, 2005). By using in vivo application, based on omnipresent toxicological literatures, biodegradable nanoparticles have an advantage over non-biodegradable nanoparticles because they are fully absorbed or eliminated from the body and usually require no further treatments for removal of possible accumulation inside the body (Yasukawa et al., 2004). \n\nPolymeric NPs are colloidal particles solid in nature, which possess unique features such as higher surface to mass ratio, quantum properties, biodegradability, lower toxicity, and the ability to adsorb and carry other molecules (Schmidt and Malwitz, 2003;Alexis et al., 2008;Pecher and Mecking, 2010;Lu et al., 2011). Polymeric NP application in the drug delivery field is one of the most important issues in pharmaceuticals. Depending on their synthesis, polymeric NPs can form two types of structures used in drug delivery: nanosphere (matrix where the drug is uniformly dispersed) and nanocapsule (the drug is embedded in a cavity and the cavity is surrounded by a polymeric membrane) (Sharma, 2019). The development of polymeric NPs requires that the major component is comoposed of a polymer and includes drug/polymer conjugates, polymer micelles, polymersomes, and nanoparticles (Fonseca et al., 2015). Two important features must be taken into account when developing polymeric NPs as drug delivery systems: (1) the chemical characteristics of the polymer should not compromise the action of the active ingredients and (2) the physical properties of the polymer must be consistent and reproducible (Villanova et al., 2010). Although the definition of NPs describes their dimensions between 1 and 100 nm, in the area of drug delivery, relatively large (size > 100 nm) NPs may be needed to load a sufficient amount of drug onto particles (Baran et al., 2002;Cascone et al., 2002;Kipp, 2004).",

            "text": "NPs, as a strong adjuvant, enhance protection through synergistic effects since they allow for the generation of cocktail vaccines in a single particle and for the delivery of numerous nucleic acids to the same target cell [62]. There has been new research into liposomal, polymeric, inorganic, lipidoid, and peptide-based nanoparticles, with a wide range of different 3D structures, sizes, and modifications, all aimed at increasing the effectiveness of nucleic acid delivery. The recent systems for mRNA vaccine delivery are liposome nanoparticles (LNP), which are lipid bilayer-coated artificial vesicles. Cationic lipids bind to negatively charged nucleic acids through their positive-charged hydrophilic heads, and the hydrophobic lipid tails encapsulate them. On the other hand, neutral lipids can be used to improve transfection efficiency and stability. The quantity of charged groups per molecule, geometric shape, and type of the lipid anchor are all important factors in transfection efficiency [62]. The LNP-encapsulated saRNAs induce higher antibody titers, pathogen neutralization (IC50), and antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses than electroporated pDNA [62]. Recently, the combination of LNPs with dendritic cell (DC) targeting, UTR optimization, lipopolymer design, and ionizable lipids has advanced the field of saRNA vaccination. However, there are concerns about the toxicity of cationic LNPs, caused by membrane disruption, as well as endosomal escapes that interact with LNPs. \n\nPolymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) that are also used for mRNA vaccine delivery are typically made from biocompatible and biodegradable polymers. They have a wide range of physicochemical properties, which may be structurally modified for regulated release of the gene contents [62]. Cationic polymers encapsulate mRNA via electrostatic interactions to generate polymer-mRNA polyplexes. Polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM) and polyethylenimine (PEI) are two commonly used polymers. PNPs preserve mRNAs and also facilitate their entrance into cells.",

            "text": "The LNPs are composed mainly of phospholipids, organized in a bi-layered structure. LNPs form vesicles in the presence of water, increasing the solubility and stability of anticancer drugs when loaded into the carrier [28]. The LNP-based vehicles can encapsulate both soluble and insoluble drugs [29]. In addition to phospholipids, other compounds, including cholesterol, may be loaded onto the carriers. Cholesterol, in the LNP-based vehicles, reduces the membrane fluidity of the NPs, enhances its penetrability to insoluble drugs, and improves their stability in the circulation [28]. \n\nsiRNA delivery of LNPs encapsulating siRNA facilitates effective and specific silencing of oncogenes, such as the tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) expressed on cancer cells since they are recognized as regulators of oncogenesis [30]. The most frequently utilized nanosystems for siRNA drug delivery include cationic, ionizable, neutral liposomes, exosomes, and other synthetic nanocarriers. These are simply prepared liposome-based delivery systems that have several benefits for in vitro and in vivo delivery of siRNA. \n\nThe innate immune system provides a first line, and the adaptive immune system provides a second line, of the body's defense [1]. The size of the LNP determines the Th1 response (IFN\u03b3 production) and Th2 response (IL-4 production). Particles of 40 to 50 nm improved Th1 stimulation, while larger-sized (>100 nm) particles activated the Th2 response [31]. The white blood cells and erythrocytes interact with LNPs depending on their various characteristics. These may affect the delivery of LNPs forming aggregates with the abundant erythrocytes, which may be toxic to immune cells [32]. The geometry of the LNPs may also influence the cellular internalization. The rod-like LNPs are internalized by the leukocytes with high efficiency, followed by spherical-and cylindrical-like NPs. However, cube-like LNPs are internalized less efficiently [32].",

They are novel bionanomaterials that can be used to encapsulate a wide range of biomolecules, such as mRNA, as demonstrated by the current successes of COVID\u201019 mRNA vaccines. Therefore, it is important to provide a perspective on LNPs for RNA delivery, which further offers useful guidance for researchers who want to work in the RNA\u2010based LNP field. This perspective first summarizes the approaches for the preparation of LNPs, followed by the introduction of the key characterization parameters. Then, the in vitro cell experiments to study LNP performance, including cell selection, cell viability, cellular association/uptake, endosomal escape, and their efficacy, were summarized. Finally, the in vivo animal experiments in the aspects of animal selection, administration, dosing and safety, and their therapeutic efficacy were discussed. The authors hope this perspective can offer valuable guidance to researchers who enter the field of RNA\u2010based LNPs and help them understand the crucial parameters that RNA\u2010based LNPs demand.",

RNA drugs administered intravenously need to be protected against excessive degradation by serum RNases and overcome the cell membrane barriers to gain access to intracellular targets. After entering cells through endocytosis or other mechanisms, RNA therapeutics are released in the cytoplasm, translocated, and incorporated into corresponding ribonucleoprotein complexes to silence target transcripts. As chemical modifications largely improve the metabolic stability and PK properties, RNA drug may be encapsulated in nanoparticle using different systems such as LNP and LPP. In addition, conjugation of a trivalent GalNAc to the RNA drug or use of antibody can improve the efficiency of delivery to targeted cells.\n\nRNA-Based Therapies for the delivery of the gRNA-Cas9 RNP complex for genome editing .\n\nTo optimize LNP formulations, some hydrophobic moieties, such as cholesterol-lipid poly(ethylene glycol)-lipid, may be included to improve RNA delivery efficiency, and the ionizable property of LNP seems to be a determinant factor (Akinc et al., 2008;Love et al., 2010;Dahlman et al., 2014). Furthermore, as polyethyleniminebased polyplexes provide excellent delivery efficiency but pose a high risk of toxicity (Lv et al., 2006), lipidation of the polyethylenimine-RNA polyplex offers lipopolyplex (LPP), which may retain the benefits of both materials while reducing the toxicity of polyplex (Rezaee et al., 2016). Indeed, some recent studies have demonstrated that LPP showed more favorable biological properties for the delivery of nucleic acid agents (Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2010;Ewe et al., 2014Ewe et al., , 2017, including these novel BERAs produced and folded in living cells (Zhang et al., 2018;Jilek et al., 2019).\n\nRNAs may be covalently conjugated to specific ligands, ranging from relatively smaller molecules (e.g., aptame",

            "text": "In this study, an MSC-based sustained-releasing drug delivery system was newly designed for the tumorexclusive delivery of anticancer nanoDDS. The favorable LNP composition that can promote sufficient intratumoral drug infusion and distribution was proposed for the MSC-guided administration. The utilization of LNP encapsulation was confirmed to be advantageous in achieving prolonged tumor retention and suppressing extratumoral leakage, as compared with the MSC-guided administration of free drugs. Cancer-specific and proapoptotic SMAC-P-FRRG-DOX prodrugs were encapsulated into LNPs to form ApoLNPs, and the ApoLNPs were proven with their s pro-apoptotic property and cathepsin B specificity in cancer cells. When ApoLNPs were administered through MSC, their tumor accumulation was notably increased whereas its off-target delivery was significantly reduced compared to intravenous or intratumoral administration. Finally, the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-guided ApoLNP administration was confirmed in vivo, showing the strict inhibition of IAPs expression as well as tumor growth. The MSC-guided intratumoral LNP administration was expected to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of conventional nanoDDSs by overcoming the low delivery efficiency at targeted tumor tissues. In recent studies on cancer immunotherapy, intratumoral administration is being frequently adopted more and more since it was discovered that combination therapy with the cancer-specific and simultaneous delivery of two or more immunotherapeutic agents is essential for sufficient stimulation of anticancer immune responses. The MSC-guided intratumoral LNP administration can be also a potential platform strategy in intratumoral immunotherapy as it delivers multiple immunotherapeutic agents exclusively into the tumor tissues at a precise ratio, thereby possibly enhancing the immune activation efficacy.",

Although scientists are overcoming some of these limitations 15 , they have fuelled the search for alternative drug delivery vehicles. Concurrent advances in the development of synthetic materials that encapsulate RNA, such as polymers, lipids and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), have invigorated research into non-viral-based delivery systems, leading to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of subcutaneously administered N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-siRNA conjugates that target hepatocytes [16][17][18] , intravenously administered LNP-based siRNA drugs that target hepatocytes 19 , and emergency use authorization (EUA) and FDA approval 20 for intramuscularly administered LNP-based mRNA COVID vaccines 21,22 . These approvals suggest that improved delivery to non-liver tissues (also known as extrahepatic tissues) as well as local delivery to the central nervous system, eye and ear could result in new drugs. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems may also be useful for non-viral DNA delivery, which has been reviewed elsewhere 23 .\n\nHere, we detail the expanding number of therapeutic RNA payloads and highlight how the downstream biochemical mechanism of action influences delivery. After reviewing the chemistries commonly used in drug delivery systems as well as the approaches to targeting specific cells, we describe the series of experiments used to characterize nanoparticles in preclinical studies (hereafter referred to as the nanoparticle discovery pipeline) and identify opportunities to improve the efficiency of this pipeline. Finally, we describe the advantages, disadvantages and hallmarks of existing FDA-approved and EUA-approved RNA delivery systems.\n\nTherapeutic RNA payloads RNA drugs are often classified by the biochemical mechanism of action used to manipulate genes or gene expression (Fig. 1).

Biodegradable NPs include lipid-based NPs (LNP) and polymer-based NPs, while non-biodegradable NPs consist of carbon NPs [37] . Drug molecules, nucleic acids, antibodies, and specialized targeted moieties can be efficiently delivered using liposomes and numerous polymers. Stimuli-sensitive nanoparticulate systems have gained much popularity in the treatment of liver fibrosis. Organic nanoparticles have an edge in terms of better encapsulation efficiency and a high loading capacity, along with good biocompatibility, increased bioavailability, and decreased systemic side effects and toxicity. They are considered the primary choice in the therapy of cirrhosis when a sustainable site-specific delivery system has to be developed. LNP has established itself as an emerging field for treating liver fibrosis. LNPs mainly consist of stable nucleic acid LNPs (SNALPs), liposomes, and solid lipid NPs (SLNs) [23] . LNPs are non-viral vectors used not only for therapeutic agent delivery but have also emerged in gene delivery owing to their ease of formulation and high versatility. Simple surface modification properties enable targeted drug delivery in LNPs. Their composition, particle size, and surface characteristics help in the evaluation of in vivo studies. Liposomes are one of the major LNPs, and there is a growing research interest in both preclinical and clinical stages for sitespecific delivery in liver fibrosis. They are potent carriers, and liposome-based delivery is considered the best amongst its peers for carrier-mediated delivery in liver fibrosis. Prominent properties include entrapment of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, bioavailability, biocompatibility, and low toxicity. This in contrast comes at a high price for production, low solubility, and chances of having a leakage, which hinders its further development [23] .",

            "text": "Generally, there are two types of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) [103]. Both SLNs and NLCs have spherical shape and their average size usually ranges from 40 to 1000 nm. LNPs can be produced by several techniques such as highpressure or high-speed homogenization, supercritical fluid extraction of emulsions, solvent emulsification/evaporation, spray drying, and ultrasonication [104][105][106].\n\nLNPs are composed of a lipid solid matrix lipid and surfactants that provide stability [107]. SLN matrix is constituted by biocompatible, biodegradable, and GRAS solid lipids, which are solid at room and body temperature (e.g., highly purified triglycerides, partial glycerides, fatty acids, and steroids) [108]. The matrix of NCLs is also solid at room/body temperature; however, unlike SLNs, often it is composed of a mixture of solid and liquid lipids [101]. Figure 5 shows a scheme of these formulations, where structural differences between both LNPs are observed.\n\nIn the last years, a great attention has been paid to LNPs as an interesting and cost-effective alternative to polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, and emulsions. LNPs are cheaper and safer than polymeric carriers, as their production is an organic solvent-free process [103]. Likewise, compared to conventional liposomes, nanoparticle solid matrix allows a higher control release and specific delivery of the loaded agent, which minimizes side effects [109]. LNPs show other benefits as compared to other systems, including ease of preparation and high scale production and sterilization [110,111], excellent physical stability, and chemical versatility. Moreover, incorporation into the nanoparticle matrix can protect molecules from light, moisture, chemical degradation, and oxidation [109] and favor their penetration through mucus barrier due to nanosize [103,[112][113][114].\n\n(i) Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs).

Modern-day advancement of GQD-, CNT-, and UCNP-based drug delivery comes with enormous photophysical properties enabling PDT, bioimaging, and payload delivery by a sub-nanometre vehicle. These phenomena give multiple advantages for NP-based drug delivery where a single NPbased vehicle can be used for drug delivery and/or bioimaging/biosensor, thereby tracking the payload for a longer period inside the tumour sites. Drug delivery using NPs reduces toxicity in healthy cells, provides drug stability, and improves solubility, drug loading capacity, and half-life. Contrary to conventional chemical cancer treatment methods, NP-based cancer treatment provides better biocompatibility, specificity, controlled drug release, less cytotoxicity, prolonged half-life, and high loading capacity of drugs [269].",

            "text": "Herein, the drugs become in contact with the tumor lesion to elicit their cytotoxic or immunomodulatory effect (Manspeaker and Thomas 2020). In this regard, the corona vaccines were developed and loaded into lipids nanoparticles (LNPs) to stimulate antibody production by the LS (He et al. 2022, Noor 2021). Pfizer and Moderna companies launched vaccines against the coronavirus that consist of mRNA loaded within LNPs (Weiss et al. 2020). Moreover, the developed LNPs were engineered with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to produce PEGylated LNPs that increase their stability during storage (Cross 2021). \n\nDespite the success of conventional drug delivery systems to deliver therapeutic agents into the target cells, however, they still have limitations due to the presence of foreign materials (Ren et al. 2016). Therefore, nature and endogenous cargoes such as cells, EVs, lipoproteins, and other payloads are suggested as LDDS. These payloads are devoid of the limitations associated with conventional drug delivery systems (Ke and Afonin 2021). Thus, the endogenous delivery systems evade biocompatibility, immunological reactions, and overcoming the biological barrier (Ren et al. 2016). The EVs such as exosomes, oncosomes, and others are endogenous trucks of nucleic acids, peptides, proteins, lipids, and therapeutic agents (Ke and Afonin 2021). Essentially, the integration of conventional and biological drug delivery vehicles resulted in the assembly of hybrid drug delivery systems (Sherif et al. 2019). \n\nHybrid cargoes gather advantages over both conventional and biological cargoes. Moreover, they could deliver the medicine into the cellular and subcellular compartments of the liver, spleen, lungs, bone marrow, tumor cells, and other cells in a specific manner (Harisa and Faris 2019;Harisa et al. 2017). Cooperatively, hybrid drug delivery cargoes are suggested to govern the advantages of conventional and biological delivery systems (Harisa and Faris 2019;Harisa et al. 2017).",

            "text": "LNPs typically contain cationic ionizable lipid, cholesterol, helper phospholipid, and PEG-lipid, and they are capable of co-delivering mRNAs with other forms of nucleic acids. Polymeric NPs and peptide-based NPs (CPPs), which consist of cationic amine groups or amino acids, respectively, can bind with anionic mRNA through electrostatic interaction to form nanosized particles. (B) Passive targeting and active targeting are two approaches for drug delivery to specific cells. Passive targeting uses natural transport systems, whereas active targeting involves the addition of targeting moieties to achieve on-target delivery. The composition, size, charge, and hydrophobicity of delivery vehicles can impact the binding of proteins to nanoparticles in the bloodstream, which affects their trafficking and uptake in passive targeting. Active targeting uses ligands such as antibodies and aptamers to selectively target specific cells, which can provide precise control of drug distribution in organs or cancer. \n\nRecently, attempts have been made to increase LNP delivery efficiency by tuning the structure of ionizable lipids given their critical roles on governing NP formation, cellular uptake, and endosome escape [117]. Novel ionizable lipids can be designed through the number and structure of tails, the presence of biodegradable and unsaturated bonds, and their hybrid delivery with polymers or dendrimers [109]. Liu et al. synthesized new ionizable lipids containing diamino groups with various head groups. This diamino lipid derivative (DAL4) was used with cholesterol, phospholipids, and PEG-lipids to encapsulate mRNAs and to form LNPs. DAL4-LNP showed superior mRNA delivery efficiency compared to conventional ionizable lipid MC3-LNP in vitro and also induced efficient protein expression in tumors and B cells upon intratumoral injection. In addition, in vivo delivery of DAL4-LNP-mediated IL-12 and IL-27 mRNA induced robust anti-tumor immune responses and sustained tumor suppression even after the discontinuation of the treatment [118].",

They are widely used in therapeutics and drug delivery because conjugating mRNA with LNPs protects it from enzymatic degradation, increasing the levels of interferon interacting genes by 15-25 folds when compared to neutral or negatively charged NPs, mediating efficient drug uptake through a sophisticated permeation mechanism, and simultaneously ensuring targeted vaccine delivery [49]. As a result, the creation of a steady, powerful, and long-lasting immune response is aided, which might better protect the host from infection. The synthetic lipids have two unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon chains that are either bonded to a quaternary amine, unlike natural lipids [50].\n\nThe LNPs-based systems utilize two cationic liposomes namely, 1,2-di-O-octadecyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTMA) and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) for nucleic acid delivery [51]. These liposomes serve as suitable drug and nucleic acid delivery systems and are considered viable candidates not only for their utilization as nano-adjuvants in vaccines but are also currently being explored as potential candidates for drug carriers. Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Vaccine are two of the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines which are LNP-based mRNA vaccines used all over the world [52,53].",

LNPs consist of ionizable cationic lipids, cholesterol, phospholipids and PEG-lipids (Fig. 3B\u2460). Ionizable cationic lipids are the core components. Cationic lipids form \"lipoplexes\" by electrostatically binding to negatively-charged nucleic acids, which have been widely used in vitro for nucleic acid transfections (e.g., Lipofectamine\u2122 RNAiMAX transfection reagents). Helper lipids, phospholipids and cholesterol promote formulation stability and delivery efficiency [88]. PEG-lipid can control particle size, prevent particle aggregation, and lengthen in vivo circulation lifetimes [89]. Other reviews have comprehensively discussed the advanced formulation of LNPs' optimization characteristics and production methods [90].\n\nUsing the LNP-mediated siRNA delivery as an example [91] (Fig. 3B). The acid dissociation constant (pKa) determines the nanoparticles' ionization behavior and surface charge, thereby influencing the delivery process. Firstly, positively charged LNPs prevent anionic RNAs from nucleases by coating RNAs and help RNAs across the cell membrane through receptor-mediated endocytosis. After entering the cells, the charges on the nanoparticle increase as the pH decrease (from 7 to 5.5) during endosomal maturation. Nanoparticles with a pKa in this range are protonated and create a buffering capacity. The buffering capacity of nanoparticles and/or membrane destabilization causes osmotic swelling and endosome breaking. The charges on nanoparticles decrease in the cytosol and weaken the binding to siRNAs [92]. The siRNAs then escape from endosomes into the cytosol, the critical rate-limiting step for its delivery. As a result, siRNAs cleave target RNAs by associating with the RISC. Other RNA entities may be translated to proteins or translocated in the nucleus. Therefore, optimizing LNPs' pKa dramatically increases the delivery efficiency",

To produce its effect, mRNA is required to transverse cell membranes and enter the cell's cytosol to be translated into the desired protein.\n\nHowever, due to the large size and negative charges of the compound, it can rarely do so. This is where the role of the LNPs comes in: they encapsulate mRNA and aid the delivery into the cells to enable the downstream effect of encoding for the spike protein to generate an immune response [9,22,23]. Altogether, the nanosize, lipophilic, and biomimetic features of LNPs facilitate its favorable effect of delivering mRNA into the cells' cytoplasm to begin translation, as demonstrated in Figure 3.\n\nLNPs are made from four lipids that provide (1) structural integrity, (2) drive mRNA loading, then release inside the cell, and (3) stabilization in the body, as well as for the product's shelf-life [24][25][26]. The first LNPbased product was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018, ONPATTRO\u00ae (patisiran), which delivers short-interfering RNA to treat polyneuropathies induced by hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis [27]. The four lipids in BNT162b2 comprise an ionizable cationic lipid (i.e. ALC-0315), cholesterol, distearoylphosphatidylcholine, and a polyethylene glycol-conjugated (PEGylated) lipid (i.e. ALC-0159) [28]. The development of LNPs hails from research into nanoparticles that biologically mimic the bilayer of the cell wall and are stealth-like, avoiding rapid clearance from the body [29][30][31][32][33]. The ionizable cationic lipid enables mRNA complexation at low pH, as the lipid possesses a charge to electrostatically bind mRNA, while then becoming",

In fact, LNPs are currently being used in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Cationic LNPs composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP)/cholesterol (chol) LNPs have been classified as one of the most efficient gene delivery systems and are being tested in numerous clinical trials. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of the molar ratio of DOTAP/chol, PEGylation, and lipid to mRNA ratio on mRNA transfection, and explore the applications of DOTAP/chol LNPs in pDNA and oligonucleotide transfection. Here we showed that PEGylation significantly decreased mRNA transfection efficiency of DOTAP/chol LNPs. Among non-PEGylated LNP formulations, 1:3 molar ratio of DOTAP/chol in DOTAP/chol LNPs showed the highest mRNA transfection efficiency. Furthermore, the optimal ratio of DOTAP/chol LNPs to mRNA was tested to be 62.5 \u00b5M lipid to 1 \u03bcg mRNA. More importantly, these mRNA-loaded nanoparticles were stable for 60 days at 4 \u00b0C storage without showing reduction in transfection efficacy. We further found that DOTAP/chol LNPs were able to transfect pDNA and oligonucleotides, demonstrating the ability of these LNPs to transport the cargo into the cell nucleus. The influence of various factors in the formulation of DOTAP/chol cationic LNPs is thus described and will help improve drug delivery of nucleic acid\u2013based vaccines and therapies.",

The announcement of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines breakthrough in November 2020 has gained the attention of scientists and manufacturers. Practically, a vital part of these vaccines' success is based on their drug delivery particle, the lipid nanoparticle carrier. This system solves the delivery challenges by transporting the vaccine to the proper cellular populations and subcellular locations [92]. \n\nMoreover, LNPs can fulfill the basic conditions of an RNA/DNA delivery system. They can also preserve nucleic acids from digestion when they move to the target cell.

Compared to conventional vaccines, RNAbased vaccines are more suitable for immunization during pandemics of infectious diseases due to their rapid and cost-effective production processes. The potential of using LNPs as delivery systems for mRNA-based vaccines were evaluated in many preclinical studies and proved to be effective in protecting the mRNA from extracellular degradation in addition to enabling the entry of the nucleic acid to the target cell. However, the challenges that may appear in translating the work from animal to human clinical studies have limited the number of RNA-based vaccines reaching the market in LNP formulations. As the initial approval of Onpattro \u00ae and development of various nanocarriers for mRNA, the technology of LNPs has been validated to encapsulate mRNA-based vaccines and to deliver RNA therapeutics for other applications, such as gene editing and the production of therapeutic proteins. Some formulation adjustments should be carried out to obtain high efficacy of the final parenterally administered LNP. These changes should be suitable for induction of innate immunity to treat a specific infection or a disease. Generally, the work presented in this review on LNPs as delivery systems for mRNA-based vaccines will serve as a basis for building up knowledge to further improve the efficacy and tolerability of other nucleic acid products designed in LNP formulations.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely recognized as crucial carriers of mRNA in therapeutic and vaccine development. The typical lipid composition of mRNA-LNP systems includes an ionizable lipid, a helper lipid, a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid, and cholesterol. Concerns arise regarding cholesterol's susceptibility to oxidation, potentially leading to undesired immunological responses and toxicity. In this study, we formulated novel LNPs by replacing cholesterol with phytochemical-derived compounds, specifically ginsenoside Rg2 and its derivative phytosterol protopanaxadiol (PPD), and validated their efficacy as mRNA delivery systems. The mRNA-LNP complexes were manually prepared through a simple mixing process. The biocompatibility of these Rg2-based LNPs (Rg2-LNP) and PPD-based LNPs (PPD-LNP) was assessed through cell viability assays, while the protective function of LNPs for mRNA was demonstrated by RNase treatment. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) mRNA delivery and expression in A549 and HeLa cells were analyzed using optical microscopy and flow cytometry. The expression efficiency of Rg2-LNP and PPD-LNP was compared with that of commercially available LNPs, with both novel formulations demonstrating superior transfection and EGFP expression. Furthermore, in vivo tests following intramuscular (I.M.) injection in hairless mice demonstrated efficient luciferase (Luc) mRNA delivery and effective Luc expression using Rg2-LNP and PPD-LNP compared to commercial LNPs. Results indicated that the efficiency of EGFP and Luc expression in Rg2-LNP and PPD-LNP surpassed that of the cholesterol-based LNP formulation. These findings suggest that Rg2-LNP and PPD-LNP are promising candidates for future drug and gene delivery systems.",

            "text": "Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) LNPs are one of the widely utilized non-viral vectors for delivering RNA-based drugs. Typically, LNPs are composed of four components with distinct functions, including permanently charged cationic or ionizable cationic lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids [1]. Initial LNPs employ permanent cationic lipids, which enable efficient encapsulation of negatively charged RNAs through electrostatic interaction. However, these permanently charged cationic lipids can be toxic to cells and make stimulus after entering the blood, with positive charges, leading to elimination from the body by the immune system [54]. Alternatively, ionizable cationic lipids remain neutral in physiological environment, ensuring higher safety, and become positively charged in the acidic endosomal environment of lower pH to facilitate endosomal escape of encapsulated drugs [55]. And Lee et al. found that ionizable cationic lipids with unsaturated tails could improve the delivery efficiency of LNPs due to the increased lipid fusion ability [56]. Cholesterol shows a rigid hydrophobic structure and can be inserted into the gap of the liposome membrane to enhance the stability of the LNP vector. Common helper lipids, such as DOPE, have a relatively small head group to form a tapered shape that facilitates the formation of hexagonal phase II, a transitional form during membrane fusion or bilayer rupture, finally promoting endosomal escape [57,58]. PEG-lipids play a significant role in reducing the opsonization effect of serum proteins and non-specific uptake of LNPs, extending the circulation time and half-life of LNPs in vivo [59]. Recently, studies demonstrated that some LNPs with dual-component enabled mRNA delivery as well [60]. Additionally, stability is an important issue to be taken into consideration during storage and transportation of LNP formulations. And changing formulation to lyophilized form or adding cryoprotectant, such as mannitol and sucrose, are feasible methods to improve the stability of LNP formulations [61].",

            "text": "Lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) are another major type of lipid nanoparticle that combines the advantages of lipids and polymers for various biomedical applications. 117 PNs have polymer cores that contain therapeutic substances and lipid/lipid-PEG shells as a \"stealth\" coating for improved in vivo circulation. 134 This unique structural composition offers optimal biocompatibility and physical stability, making them an ideal vehicle for drug delivery. 117 LPNs have been successfully used to encapsulate various pharmaceuticals, including nucleic acids, for sustained release and improved stability. Furthermore, incorporating functional groups on the polymer surface facilitates the targeted drug delivery to specific cells or tissues. \n\nDensity functional theory (DFT) simulations, one of the computational modeling methods, were utilized to gain a better understanding of the interaction mechanism between the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) and the polymers within LNPs. 135 The study aimed to improve the therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin (DOX) in lipid nanoparticles (LPNs). By analysis of the DOX-loaded LPNs, researchers found that polymers interacted strongly with DOX at various sites, forming stable complexes. The simulations indicated energetically favorable binding, suggesting a potential for enhancing oral bioavailability. LPNs are gaining recognition as an advanced substitute for traditional liposomal and polymeric drug delivery systems due to their wide range of advantages, encompassing applications in combinatorial/active targeted drug deliveries, cancer gene therapy, vaccine development, and novel diagnostic imaging methods. 136 Encouraging results from Phase I and II clinical trials demonstrate the potential of LPNs in delivering the anticancer drug Docetaxel, particularly for lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancers 120\u2212123 (Table 1). Nevertheless, LPNs encounter certain challenges, such as potential polymer component toxicity and difficulties in achieving consistent particle size and shape. 18 Ongoing research endeavors aim to address these obstacles and further advance LPNs for use in diverse biomedical applications. Despite the challenges, LPNs exhibit great promise for drug delivery due to their distinctive properties and versatility in addressing various biomedical needs.",

Their primary advantage is the improvement of the bioavailability of drugs, specifically lipophilic molecules that can be better solubilized in the lipid core than in aqueous environments. The lipophilic core of lipid nanoparticles entraps active ingredients, while the surfactant membrane, generally consisting solely or partially of phospholipids, ensures the stability of LNP in hydrophilic environment.

In the next generation of the lipid nanoparticle, NLCs are modified SLNs which improve the stability and capacity loading. Three structural models of NLCs have been proposed. These LNPs have potential applications in drug delivery field, research, cosmetics, clinical medicine, etc. This article focuses on features, structure and innovation of LNPs and presents a wide discussion about preparation methods, advantages, disadvantages and applications of LNPs by focusing on SLNs and NLCs.",

Thus, several different compositions of four-component particles based on the MC3 lipid and helper lipid DOPE or DPPC have turned out to be targetable to lungs when administered intratracheally (Zhang et al., 2020). It should be pointed out that in both studies on delivery to lungs (Massaro et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2020), the proportion of a helper lipid (15-20 mol%) was higher as compared to standard (10 mol%) systems of LNPs, possibly indicating the necessity of increasing the helper lipid content for delivery to lungs. \n\nThe route of administration also has a significant impact on kinetics of nanoparticle distribution. In Pardi et al. (2015), effects of various administration routes were studied toward the pharmacokinetics of four-component LNPs based on new ionizable lipid L319. After subcutaneous or intradermal administration of mRNA with LNPs, reporter protein expression was observed at the injection site, whereas after intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or intravenous (retro-orbital) administration, at the injection site and in the liver. Upon intratracheal administration, the expression was noted in the lungs and liver. In that paper, intradermal administration caused the most prolonged reporter protein expression: 9 days. In all likelihood, this outcome is due to longer retention of LNPs in the dermis. There are reports of other patterns for nanoparticle distribution. For instance, in Huysmans et al. (2019), it was demonstrated that when administered subcutaneously, LNPs remain at the injection site, with partial migration to a draining lymph node after 24 h. Moreover, additional use of electroporation immediately after the subcutaneous administration of LNPs enhanced the expression of the reporter protein by two orders of magnitude (Huysmans et al., 2019).",

            "text": "Following mRNA production via in vitro transcription (IVT) and subsequent purification, the subsequent challenge lies in delivering the mRNA vaccine to the cytoplasm of target cells. This task is complicated by the vulnerability of naked mRNA to degradation by ribonucleases, as well as the barriers posed by the negative charge of both the mRNA and the cell membrane [202]. These challenges limit mRNA entry into the cell. Consequently, various delivery methods for mRNA have been developed, including the use of lipids, polymers, lipid-polymer hybrids, and peptide nanoparticles. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as one of the most promising and widely used materials for mRNA delivery [203]. Particularly, the success of LNP-based mRNA vaccines against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has underscored the potential of expanding the application of LNPs [204]. LNPs are composed of various components that contribute to maintaining the stability and compatibility of its structure. These include ionizable lipids that encapsulate mRNA through electrostatic interactions and enable endosomal release of mRNA into the cytoplasm; the polyethylene glycol (PEG) structure enhances the LNP circulation half-life; the phospholipids and cholesterols stabilize the lipid bilayer structure and aid in membrane fusion and endosome escape [205]. \n\nIn 2018, DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) LNPs, a type of ionizable lipid, were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for siRNA delivery to hepatocytes for treating transthyretin (TTR)-induced amyloidosis [206]. Subsequently, MC3-LNPs have been utilized for mRNA delivery in cancer immunotherapy. For instance, BisCCL2/5i mRNA-MC3-LNP was developed to deliver mRNAs encoding a single-domain antibody against CCL2 and CCL5 chemokines, which blocked these chemokine signaling pathways and induced tumor-associated macrophages to polarize toward the antitumor M1 phenotype [207].",

            "text": "In addition to reducing toxicity and immunogenicity, liposomes encapsulation enhances drug stability. Liposomes are ideal materials for targeted delivery of various types of RNA, considering the advancements in nanomaterials, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), are becoming increasingly popular in preclinical trials exploring the functional and therapeutic potential of RNA. Among them, LNPsbased mRNA intracellular delivery systems have entered numerous large clinical trials, particularly following significant progress in COVID-19 vaccine development. The key distinction between LNPs and conventional liposomes lies in their micellar structures within the particle core [212], providing better stability and reducing the likelihood of RNA degradation. Moreover, LNPs typically have smaller particle sizes, facilitating easier penetration of cell membranes and enhanced intracellular delivery efficiency, thereby increasing the biological activity of RNA. Importantly, the composition of lipid nanoparticles reduces the presence of permanent charges, mitigating high cytotoxicity associated with carrier systems. By stabilizing the membrane structure of nanomaterials, it also increases the chances of escape scape from the endosome and lowers the risk of immunogenic reactions, thus improving their safety in clinical applications [213]. Apart from the successful local delivery of LNP-mRNA vaccines, LNPs enable targeted delivery to organs through systemic administration [214]. Additionally, due to the challenge of targeting highly specific nuclear lncRNA with nuclear envelope protection, combining LNPs with ASOs provides a promising approach. LNP-ASO combination allows for targeted delivery of nuclear lncRNA with good compatibility and immunogenicity. For instance, in a lung cancer xenograft animal model, LNP-encapsulated ASOs targeting nuclear lncRNA MALAT1 demonstrated significant inhibition of tumor metastasis and notable therapeutic efficacy [215]. These studies have shown potential for therapeutic approaches based on lncRNA. Although clinical trials targeting lncRNA using LNPs have not yet commenced, in vitro and in vivo preclinical experiments involving lncRNA delivery frequently employ LNPs [216,217].",

The ordered phospholipid molecular bilayer forms a closed vesicle, and the hydrophilic cavity structure is formed inside. Liposome can be used to deliver drugs or genetic materials into cells, taking advantage of their ability to fuse with cell membranes. Lipid NPs (LNPs) are a special type of NPs different from liposomes. LNPs exist in the interior through the electrostatic complexation of cationic phospholipids and negatively charged nucleic acid substances, forming a multilayer core dispersed between lipid layers. Liposomes have played an important role in the field of drug delivery, involving numerous indications, and LNPs are currently used for delivery of nucleic acid substances. 45 Compared with viral vectors, LNPs have the following advantages: (1) LNPs do not have pre-existing immunogenicity and have fewer interference from natural immune mechanisms; (2) they have less chance of contamination and risk of random integration into the genome; (3) easy control of raw materials and mature process development technology; and (4) controllable quality standard and clear development path. At the same time, in order to further break the bottleneck, the following aspects need to be optimized: (1) optimize the relationship between distribution in the body and efficacy/toxicity; \n\n(2) expand the application range of drug and gene delivery; and (3) optimize the effective delivery of the vector to target cells and reduce the ineffective delivery to non-target cells. \n\nA number of lipid-based non-viral vectors have been investigated for MSCs transfection. For example, Garcia-Garcia et al. recently described that using LNPs to induce Smurf1 gene silence could promote osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. 46 Imran Vhora et al. have also shown that novel ionizable lipid nucleic acid NPs can be successfully used for whole-body BMP-9 gene delivery, inducing BMSCs osteogenesis and improving bone regeneration in rats after oophorectomies. 47 Mi-RNAs can also be delivered via lipid-based vectors.",

An important factor describing vaccine immunogenicity is the capacity to achieve mucosal antibodies upon i.m. administration. In this study, mucosal antibodies were found in the majority of the doses given by LNPs, but not with pABOL. When given i.n., LNP formulations exhibited systemic antibody titers; however, these were lower than the same dose i.m. Overall, this study shows that the selection of the delivery vehicle can drive the fate and the therapeutic application and effect [112]. \n\nWhen considering the nanoparticle's physicochemical properties, surface charge has been previously reported to be involved in the nanoparticle's biodistribution [106], as well as the phospholipid selection [105]. Furthermore, the fact that LNPs exhibited a higher immunogenicity can be explained by increasing evidence that LNPs can act as adjuvants [135]. In this study, Alameh et al. compared three different treatments: first, rHA mRNA-loaded LNPs; second, empty LNPs (e-LNPs) with hemagglutinin recombinant protein (rHA); and third, a well-known adjuvant (Addavax) with rHA. Results showed that the first and second groups exhibited similar antibody titers, demonstrating the adjuvant capacity of e-LNPs [135].",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), including solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), have been effectively utilized in clinical trials to deliver both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs. These nanoparticles, capable of encapsulating therapeutic agents in aqueous or lipid-based cores, improve drug stability, reduce side effects, and target specific cells, such as cancer cells [128]. These nanocarriers have been well known for many years and are primarily composed of natural materials, making them biocompatible, biodegradable, and safe for therapeutic use [129]. They are particularly valuable in cancer therapy due to their ability to cross the BBB, a critical feature for treating brain tumors like GBM [62,130]. In addition to GBM, LNPs are also promising for drug delivery and imaging in neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease [131][132][133], Alzheimer's disease [134], and strokes [135,136]. Their structure enables drug-controlled release, reducing toxicity and enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. LNPs provide a stable delivery platform for targeted cancer therapy, improving the precision and effectiveness of drug delivery [137]. The primary limitation of LNPs is their tendency to fuse, especially when the average size of the synthesized formulation is below 100 nm. This fusion leads to the leakage of encapsulated substances from the lipid vesicles and enhances dispersibility. However, this issue can be addressed by applying a PEG coating to the surface of the lipid nanoparticles [138]. Ionic liquids (ILs), such as choline-2-hexenoic acid, can further enhance tissue-specific drug delivery by facilitating LNP transport across the BBB using intravenous delivery. ILs help modulate the interaction of LNPs with serum proteins, potentially increasing drug accumulation at the BBB through red blood cell Not only have TMZ or bortezomib been tested in combination with PNPs, but also other cytostatic drugs are being evaluated in this context.",

There are three main lignocellulosic-derived nanoparticles discussed in this review. First, lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) are an amphiphilic nanoparticle which has versatile interactions toward hydrophilic or hydrophobic drugs. The synthesis methods of LNPs play an important role in this amphiphilic characteristic. Second, xylan nanoparticles (XNPs) are a hemicellulose-derived nanoparticle, where additional pretreatment is needed to obtain a high purity xylan before the synthesis of XNPs. This process is quite long and challenging, but XNPs have a lot of potential as a drug carrier due to their stronger interactions with various drugs. Third, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are a widely exploited nanoparticle, especially in drug delivery applications. CNCs have low cytotoxicity, therefore they are suitable for use as a drug carrier. The research possibilities for these three nanoparticles are still wide and there is potential in drug delivery applications, especially for enhancing their characteristics with further surface modifications adjusted to the drugs.",

            "text": "Liposomes and LNP have been extensively used as delivery vehicles for the treatment of cancer, genetic disease, and other health issues, making them an essential asset in the pharmaceutical industry (25)(26)(27)(28). While they have slight differences in composition and structure, these lipidbased nanoformulations generally encapsulate a variety of pharmaceutical cargos within a protective, outer layer of lipids. Liposomes are bilayer or multilayer lipid vesicles in which an aqueous volume is entirely enclosed by a membrane composed of amphiphilic phospholipids (29)(30)(31)(32). They are composed of phospholipid molecules which are able to self-assemble into a lipid bilayer or multilayer vesicles in an aqueous environment (33). During this process, the liposomes can selectively load therapeutic agents by entrapping hydrophilic molecules in the aqueous core and hydrophobic molecules in the lipid bilayer (34). LNP consist of a solid lipid core, manufactured from either solid lipids or a mixture of liquid and solid lipids (35). Such structures were especially engineered toward encapsulating nucleic acids (such as RNA and DNA), therefore LNP are the most popular non-viral gene delivery system (36). Liposomes and LNP drug delivery systems have many advantages over systemic drug delivery (37). They can prevent unwanted degradation of drug and reduce exposure to healthy cells (38). This in turn increases biodistribution and payload of drug at target sites (39). Moreover, these systems are less toxic compared with other nanoparticles due to their biocompatible and bio-degradable characteristics (40,41). \n\nBoth liposomes and LNP can be engineered to enter cancer cells via a passive or active targeting strategy (42). \n\nPassive targeting relies on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect which means well-vascularised tumors exhibit discontinuous endothelial cell lining (43). This leaky endothelium can be used as an access point by nanoparticles smaller than 150 nm in size (44).",

In the same cell model but using a different cationic lipid to formulate the LNP, Sahay et al. reported that downregulation of Cdc42 and Rac1 led to 80% decrease in LNP uptake, whereas inhibition of clathrin heavy chain-1 and caveolin-1 had little impact on LNP entry. 205 Together, these studies highlight areas in the design of LNP, which need further optimization and understanding to achieve efficient intracellular delivery.\n\nSince LNP delivery efficiency is influenced by the formation of a protein corona in biological media, one may expect that a healthy individual or a patient suffering of a pathology affecting the serum composition, will have different serum-protein diversity and concentration which could possibly affect the protein-corona composition of LNP and thus alter their activity in vivo, as observed for PLGA nanoparticles. 206 In addition, it is important to note that lipid self-assembly and therefore LNP morphology is driven by biophysical parameters including composition, temperature, pressure, electrostatics and lipid packing which have already been extensively reviewed and are therefore not addressed here. 207\u2212209 Therefore, the morphology and functional response of an RNA-LNP system administrated into a patient with abnormal body temperature (e.g., fever or low-body-temperature-related syndrome) may differ (e.g., protein-corona formation and delivery efficiency) when compared to a healthy volunteer. To date, LNPs have shown efficient delivery of RNA to the liver using passive cellular targeting (size control and protein adsorption). Compositional variations in LNPs have been demonstrated to enhance LNP accumulation in the lung and spleen; 210 however, delivery to other organs remains challenging. Like liposomal systems, LNPs can take advantage of \"natural\" and synthetic targeting processes to actively reach specific tissues and cells. The main strategies rely on proteins, peptides or natural ligands, antibodies or antibody fragments, as well as aptamers. Antibody-mediated targeting has demonstrated success in gene-silencing with LNP systems. As an example, Rameshetti et al. used an anti-CD4",

The nanoparticles are <100 nm in size, and a wide range of drugs, including hydrophilic and hydrophobic small drugs, flavonoids, vaccines and biological molecules, can be delivered by these NPs [81][82][83]. Application of NPs in drug delivery can be mentioned in diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and Alzheimer's disease [84]. The NPs help improve several features to attain improved bioavailability, as shown in Fig . 3 [85]. \n\nAP acts well in pharmacological aspect, but due to its poor solubility, its clinical application has been limited. Therefore, new formulations or methods should be developed to improve solubility of AP and its bioavailability [86]. Numerous kinds of nanomaterials such as metallic-based nanomaterials, lipid-based and polymeric nanoparticles were developed in order to the highly effective delivery of AP [86][87][88]. The oral bioavailability of AP nanoparticles was about 5 fold upper compared to the naked AP, and this formulation shows no toxic outcome on the organs of mice [89]. Various studies have revealed that solid dispersion (SD) can be effectively applied in order to the improving the dissolution level of poorly water-soluble drugs [90]. Metallic nanoparticles and carbon-based nanomaterials have been broadly applied as drug delivery systems, predominantly in targeted therapy [91]. Lipid-based nanocarriers are applied to progress the high-efficiency delivery and bioavailability of AP. Furthermore, the appliances of lipid-based nanoparticles to overcome the MDR have been proposed based on improved permeability of membrane [92,93].",

            "text": ".\n\nZwitterionic materials such as poly(carboxybetaine) are other alternative materials to PEG. Their strong hydration ability confers stealth properties that are potentially even greater than traditional PEG approaches. Furthermore, they contain abundant reactive groups that can be leveraged for specific properties (e.g. conjugation) and can be prepared as hydrolysable esters with 'transforming' properties upon hydrolysis [77]. As their development has mostly been focussed on use as anti-fouling surface coating materials, there is little research on their use in LNP formulations (or drug delivery systems at large). They are, however, a very promising candidate for next-generation stealth materials, as they provide strong stealth behaviour and other benefits not afforded by PEG.\n\nConclusion and future applications of LNPs mRNA/LNPs have shown significant potential to address the rapid outbreak of a global pandemic like COVID-19. The ease and speed at which the mRNA cargo can be formulated with viral antigen without affecting the physical properties of the vaccine have outpaced the development of traditional vaccines. This same quality also allows LNPs to address potential viral mutations, which would decrease the efficacy of an initial vaccine formulation. The use of this cutting-edge vaccine technology to address the pandemic has rapidly advanced the field and LNP vaccines are likely to be increasingly adopted for a range of other diseases in the coming years.\n\nAlthough the success of LNPs has been remarkable, there is still significant room to enhance their effectiveness and safety. We have identified a number of areas with significant potential for optimisation. Although some of these parameters are specific to the development of viral vaccines, others (protection of mRNA, optimisation of cytosolic delivery and controlling the release of cargo) can also be applied to LNP formulations in a wider context. LNP carriers have already shown promise in a wide range of therapeutic contexts, including cancer treatment [2] and gene therapy [10]. The success of LNP vaccines is likely to draw renewed interest in the field of LNP formulations. It is our hope that the knowledge gained from the development and clinical use of LNPs in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines gives new impetus to investment in and development of other LNP therapeutics.",

This aggregation-limiting factor is crucial for a dry powder, which must form solid masses much larger than the normal LNP diameter, but then dissolve easily on the surface of the lung, releasing LNPs that are small enough to effectively transfect. Although a variety of PEG lipids are used in reported LNP formulations, the key consideration is the quantity of poly(ethylene glycol) those lipids add to the LNP itself. A greater quantity of PEG has been previously reported to greatly improve particle stability for aerosolized delivery, [16,46] but the more-stable particles created with these high PEG contents can exhibit reduced activity. [16] We prepared LNPs with increasing concentrations of PEG lipid and quantified the LNP size before and after SFD and resuspension in water, as well as their biologic activity following SFD (Figure 2d,e). We found that 3 mol % PEG lipid, comparable to our recently reported nebulizationoptimized T1-5 formulation, [18] but much lower than those reported recently by other groups was optimal both in minimizing irreversible aggregation and in preserving activity. [16,46] We suspect that the choice of DOTAP as a helper lipid as described above plays a significant role in allowing a reduction of PEG content without compromising particle stability.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles are rapidly developing as drug carriers. Lipid nanoparticles are widely employed in drug delivery. Many different types of lipid nanoparticles have been engineered, such as lipid nanocapsules, lipid drug conjugates, SLNs, and NLCs. NLCs involve the modification of SLNs. The structural arrangement of solid and liquid lipids of NLCs is not fixed in design. Thus, the structure is flexible, and high encapsulation efficiency and drug loading can be attained, and leakage impeded while retaining the features of SLNs. NLCs, as a new generation of lipid nanoparticles, offer many advantages and a wide range of applications, such as in drug delivery, with broad prospects for further development. NLCs are the most important type of drug delivery and are prepared mainly using HPH, which is a well-established technique; however, the disadvantages related to this production method (high operating temperatures and cavitation forces), as well as the need for encapsulating many types of drugs with different physico-chemical features and various stability and solubility problems, led to the development of new types of lipid nanoparticles and innovative preparation methods. At present, research on NLCs is limited to preclinical studies, with clinical applications remaining far from realization. There are some limitations, such as the presence of organic solvent residue, uneven distribution, complex production process, poor stability, and so on. \n\nTherefore, PNPs entered the field as a better drug carrier. Compared to NLCs, PNPs not only can effectively transport the drug to a specific target site, such as the organs or tissues affected by the disease, but also increase the efficacy of drugs in diseased tissue. Meanwhile, PNPs can reduce the side effects on the surrounding normal tissue and organs, enhance the stability of the drug, and make the release more gradual and better controlled. Many have benefitted from the ability to control or adjust the drug release, which is achieved through the modification of nanoparticle surfaces, development of new carrier materials, and the study of targeted drugs.",

Since nucleic acids are relatively unstable outside the cell and carry many anions, they cannot easily cross the cell membrane. However, the ionic and polar head in cationic liposomes allows for easy delivery of nucleic acids into cells. Compared with conventional drug delivery, LNPs have interesting features including monitoring the cargo, targeted delivery systems, and reduced toxicity. These features have made LNPs attractive for the delivery of anticancer drugs. 106 Preclinical trials found that LNPs can effectively transfer siRNA or mRNA 107,108 ; therefore, LNPs seem to be a safe and suitable transfer method. 109 Within the past years, numerous preclinical studies about CRISPR/Cas9 delivery using LNPs have been performed. Two fundamental strategies are utilized for LNP delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 components like transferring the Cas9/sgRNA plasmid and transferring the Cas9/sgRNA RNP complex. Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA can be effectively stacked on LNPs and precisely transported to the liver of mice while intervening in the mouse model for transthyretin (Ttr). 110 Despite several advances, routine prediction, and planning of LNP delivery to target tissues other than the liver for precise gene modification remains a challenge. Organ-specific targeting allows nanoparticles to provide gene-editing frameworks for specific organs, which is expected to encourage the development of gene-regulating therapies. 111",

            "text": "Polymer-based NPs are submicron-sized polymeric colloidal particles in which a therapeutic agent of interest can be embedded or encapsulated within their polymeric matrix or adsorbed or conjugated onto the surface (Labhasetwar et al., 1998;Mahapatro & Singh, 2011). It can effectively improve the immune responses. Polymer properties such as biocompatibility, low toxicity and biodegradability have highlighted polymeric NPs as an interesting delivery strategy (Conniot et al., 2014). \n\nSimilar to polymeric micelles, the first great advantage of using polymeric NPs is to allow encapsulation of bioactive molecules and protect them against enzymatic and hydrolytic degradation. For instance, it has been found that insulinloaded NPs have preserved insulin activity and produced blood glucose reduction in diabetic rats for up to 14 days following the oral administration (Damge et al., 2007;Mahapatro & Singh, 2011). \n\nMeanwhile, polymeric NPs do enhance the immunity. Luo et al. ( 2017) reported a minimalist nanovaccine, which comprise a simple physical mixture of an antigen and synthetic polymeric NPs, PC7A NP, which generates a much stronger cytotoxic T-cell response with low systemic cytokine expression than using antigen alone. In his meticulous research, the PC7A used ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen whose loading efficiency was measured to be >75% for different candidate polymer NPs. After his across-the-aboard experiments in vitro and in vivo, the conclusion is that the polymeric NPs led to potent tumor growth inhibition in melanoma, colon cancer and human papilloma virusE6/E7 tumor models. Besides, the combination of the PC7A nanovaccine and an anti-PD-1 antibody also showed great synergy. \n\nLastly, this approach that building a polymeric nanoparticle model has a tendency to merge with other methods to achieve a better efficacy in the recent time. Except synergizing with anti-PD-1 antibody above, the example is about the design of biohybrid drug delivery systems, which combine cells with synthetic systems to overcome biological hurdles.",

The use of nanoparticles can ensure the stability and solubility of the loaded ingredients or drugs, promote transmembrane transport, and significantly improve hemostatic efficacy. Nanoparticles formed from natural and synthetic polymers exhibit good drugloading stability and are easily surface-modified. Controlled release and targeting of drugs can be achieved by modulating the properties of polymers and by realizing surface modifications. Nanoparticles are classified into several categories according to their chemical composition: liposome-based nanoparticles (LNPs), polymeric nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles. \n\nLNPs are extensively studied as drug delivery carriers. These nanoparticles generally comprise ionized cationic lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol lipids. LNPs exploit the properties of phospholipid molecules to penetrate cell membranes, laying the foundation for the development of drug delivery carriers. Chen et al. used LNPs to wrap hemostatic macromolecules such as thrombin and studied the activation of platelets in the presence of LNPs loaded with thrombin. They conducted in vitro platelet contraction assays and thromboelastography tests to arrive at the results [222]. It was observed that platelet endocytosis of LNPs loaded with thrombin significantly increased the sensitivity of platelets toward collagen and significantly accelerated the time to clot formation. An increase in clot stiffness was also observed. Its introduction into the plasma of patients suffering from coagulation disorders also markedly accelerated the time of formation of blood clots. Attention should be paid to the fact that thrombin not fully encapsulated by LNPs may activate platelets prematurely, resulting in rapid platelet activation and thrombosis. LNPs equipped with ADP could also effectively activate and aggregate platelets, thus significantly shortening the clotting time in a rabbit liver defect model. Thrombus formation in arteries is avoided under these conditions [222].",

Recently, the use of LNPs as mRNA delivery vehicles has become a leading technology in the application of vaccines [18][19][20].

This paradigm shift is exemplified by the finding that cholesterol removal can address the persistent challenge of preventing nanoparticle accumulation in hepatic tissues, which can be explained by tuning the affinity to reduced lipoprotein adsorption 88 . By modulating and simplifying intrinsic LNPs components, researchers have achieved concurrent mRNA accumulation and translation in targeted organs like the lung and liver. This innovative targeting strategy shows promise for enhancing the precision of mRNA therapies across diverse diseases and may apply to existing LBNPs systems. However, it is important to note that the optimal LNPs formulation likely depends on the specific therapeutic target and delivery requirements, and traditional components may still play crucial roles in various applications. These advancements collectively represent a significant step forward in the development of more precisely targeted and efficient mRNA delivery systems, potentially expanding the therapeutic potential of mRNA-based treatments.",

Due to this biomimetic property these have been employed in several clinical applications including cancer diagnostics and therapeutics [98]. LNPs are mostly studied in cancer immunotherapies using protein/peptide, nucleic acid, and immunestimulating molecules transportation. Low cytotoxicity because of their biomimetic properties is the key benefit of using these particles. For immunotherapy an attempt was made to inhibit STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins) pathway which is known to be immunosuppressing by using PH sensitive lipoplex particles for siRNA cytosolic delivery towards suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1). Upon the lipoplex administration subcutaneously, reduced SOCS1 expression was observed in dendritic cells, and increased levels of IL6 and IFN-\u03b3 resulting in antitumor activity [77]. \n\nGold nanoparticles have been considered to have great feasibility for cancer immunotherapy. A recent study reported that pegylated IL10 in combination with chemotherapy is in stage III of a scientific trial, only IL10 among the cytokines has yet reached stage III of an experimental trial. It has been observed that Poly Ethyl Glycol (PEG) conjugation increases the half-life of both IL10 & gold nanoparticles and it also inhibits the aggregation of nanoparticles [99].",

            "text": "Nanotechnology is revolutionising research and development in healthcare. Currently, the most advanced clinical grade nanotechnologies in cancer are LNPs. Unfortunately there remains scepticism from the big pharma industry and from clinicians themselves regarding the efficacy and safety of such nanoparticle technologies. Such scepticism will only be solved with the advent of reliable cGMP-grade manufacturing processes and reliable preclinical ADME/toxicology data, followed by a range of successful first-in-man studies. While these data are being acquired, nanoparticle technologies continue to be innovated in the laboratory. The ultimate push will be for targeted trig-anostic  drug  -ABCD nanoparticles (targeted  T  NPs) that are enabled for targeted delivery then triggered release of  active therapeutic agents (or drug entities), all monitored by simultaneous, real-time diagnostic imaging using  different imaging agent probes integrated into the nanoparticle. Of the latter, both NIR and 19 F-NMR spectroscopy probes [80] could have real clinical potential alongside MRI. Such multiplicity of functions offers the very real opportunity for highly personalized drug nanoparticles assembly from selected tool-kits of chemical components, highly refined for specific, personalized delivery applications. As this vision begins to take shape, so we will be looking on a very different world of innovative, interactive healthcare products with vastly more potential to treat and even to cure cancer than has ever been seen before. Inevitably, words of balance and caution need to be expressed as well. This review has focused on LNPs and particularly on those that conform to the ABCD nanoparticle structural paradigm. There is plenty enough good reason for this focus given prospects for LNPs that conform to this paradigm in vivo, in pre-clinical studies and even in clinic. However, nanoparticles now come in many shapes and sizes ranging from polymer-based nanoparticles (PNPs) to hard, inorganic nanoparticle structures, such as the highly novel and advanced targeted 2 T 2 NP system mentioned above. However, in general, although many such systems are showing promise in vivo, few PNPs or inorganic nanoparticle structures have advanced significantly towards clinical applications.",

            "text": "Liposomes are an artificially prepared drug delivery system capable of encapsulating the active ingredient within a lipid bilayer to form a mini globular carrier [66,67]. Their half-life in the circulatory system can be extended by covering the surface with inert polymeric molecules such as oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, polysaccharides, and synthetic polymers [68]. Liposomes are generally used to construct novel vaccine adjuvant delivery systems that protect the long-lasting, slow release of pathogen antigens, a key component in vaccines, and enhance the immunogenicity of vaccines. Studies have shown that some liposomes have unique immunostimulatory functions on their own and are able to induce a broad spectrum of acquired immunity under special conditions [67,69]. In summary, the lymph node targeted liposomes benefit from the development of microfluidic technology, making the manufacturing process relatively easier, though still face challenges in how to increase the stability and sustained release of liposomes to promote a stronger immune response. \n\nWith the development of nanoscience and technology, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely studied. LNPs are a new type of lipid drug loading system and one of the most advanced nucleic acid delivery platforms to date. The first RNA interference (RNAi) drugs also took advantage of LNPs as carrier [70][71][72]. LNPs are multicomponent systems, typically spherical vesicles composed of ionizable lipids or cationic lipidoid compounds, auxiliary lipid cholesterol, protective agent polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid conjugates, and gene-based drugs or vaccine that enable the entry of gene carrying drugs into cells [73]. Gene drugs or vaccines are encapsulated to avoid degradation, which would greatly enhance the bioavailability of the loaded drugs and reduce the requirement for dosage [74][75][76]. To date, mRNA vaccine induced hepatic damage has been reported in a series of recent studies [77][78][79].",

            "text": "Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) are another popular nanoparticle of choice and have been clinically used for a variety of FDA-approved applications, ranging from ONPATTRO \u00ae polyneuropathy therapy to the mRNA-1274 (Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech, New York, NY, USA) COVID-19 vaccines [47,48]. One reason for this is their high degree of biocompatibility and their reduced risk of producing inflammatory responses due to lipids' status as a natural component of the cell membrane [21]. Another advantage is the ability of liposomal NPs to encapsulate hydrophobic molecules in their lipid bilayer, hydrophilic molecules in their aqueous core, or both simultaneously, giving them compatibility with diverse payloads. Conversely, other lipid-containing NPs incorporate hydrophobic molecules into the lipid construct before mixing with the aqueous phase for NP synthesis [49]. LNPs have been shown to deliver not only small molecules, such as anti-cancer drugs and chemotherapy agents [50,51], but also, more recently, nucleic acids. LNPs encapsulated with siRNA targeting ApoB [52], PCSK9 [53], PLK1 [54], VEGF, and KSP [52] expression are just a few examples, along with those delivering self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) [55] and mRNA [50][51][52][53][54][55]. The enhanced flexibility for payloads of diverse chemical properties also allows opportunities for the co-delivery of molecules, such as a combination of antigenic material with tolerogenic agents (e.g., suppressive cytokines and broad immunosuppressants) [56]. Additionally, other LNPs have been surface-modified with engineered peptides and whole membrane proteins, providing further avenues for their possible use as antigen-specific immune tolerance therapeutics [57]. Finally, a low-shear extrusion manufacturing method can minimize the protein denaturation risk during encapsulation.",

Overcoming challenges in safe and effective mRNA delivery to target tissues and cells, along with controlling release from the delivery vehicle, remains pivotal in mRNA-based therapies. This review elucidates the structure of LNPs, the mechanism for mRNA delivery, and the targeted delivery of LNPs to various cells and tissues, including leukocytes, T-cells, dendritic cells, Kupffer cells, hepatic endothelial cells, and hepatic and extrahepatic tissues. Here, we discuss the applications of mRNA\u2013LNP vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases and for the treatment of cancer and various genetic diseases. Although challenges remain in terms of delivery efficiency, specific tissue targeting, toxicity, and storage stability, mRNA\u2013LNP technology holds extensive potential for the treatment of diseases.",

Recent advancements in nanoparticle (NP) technologies offer promising solutions, with potential applications in drug delivery, neuroprotection, and neuroregeneration. By examining current research, we explore how NPs can cross the BBB, deliver medications directly to targeted CNS regions, and enhance both diagnostics and treatment. Key NP strategies, such as passive targeting, receptor-mediated transport, and stimuli-responsive systems, demonstrate encouraging results. Studies show that NPs may improve drug delivery, minimize side effects, and increase therapeutic effectiveness in models of Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, stroke, and glioblastoma.

Among the 100,000 available possibilities, zirconium-based metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates in biomedical applications. Zr-MOFs can be easily synthesized as small-size NPs compatible with intravenous injection, whereas the ease of decorating their external surfaces with functional groups allows for targeted treatment. Despite these benefits, Zr-MOFs suffer degradation and aggregation in real, in vivo conditions, whereas the loaded drugs will suffer the burst effect\u2014i.e., the fast release of drugs in less than 48 h. To tackle these issues, we developed a simple but effective bilayer coating strategy in a generic, two-step process. In this work, bilayer-coated MOF NU-901 remained well dispersed in biologically relevant fluids such as buffers and cell growth media. Additionally, the coating enhances the long-term stability of drug-loaded MOFs in water by simultaneously preventing sustained leakage of the drug and aggregation of the MOF particles. We evaluated our materials for the encapsulation and transport of pemetrexed, the standard-of-care chemotherapy in mesothelioma. The bilayer coating allowed for a slowed release of pemetrexed over 7 days, superior to the typical 48 h release found in bare MOFs. This slow release and the related performance were studied in vitro using both A549 lung cancer and 3T mesothelioma cells. Using high-resolution microscopy, we found the successful uptake of bilayer-coated MOFs by the cells with an accumulation in the lysosomes. The pemetrex-loaded NU-901 was indeed cytotoxic to 3T and A549 cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrated the general approach by extending the coating strategy using two additional lipids and four surfactants. This research highlights how a simple yet effective bilayer coating provides new insights into the design of promising MOF-based drug delivery systems.",

The mesoscopic structure of such complex multicomponent and polydisperse nanoparticulate systems is most relevant for their drug delivery properties, medical efficiency, shelf life, and possible side effects. However, the knowledge on the structural details of such formulations is very limited. Essentially no such information is publicly available for pharmaceutical dispersions approved by numerous medicine agencies for the use in humans and loaded with mRNA encoding a mimic of the spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as, e.g., the Comirnaty formulation (BioNTech/Pfizer). Here, we present a simple preparation method to mimic the Comirnaty drug-free LNPs including a comparison of their structural properties with those of Comirnaty. Strong evidence for the liquid state of the LNPs in both systems is found in contrast to the designation of the LNPs as solid lipid nanoparticles by BioNTech.

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) produced by antisolvent precipitation (ASP) are used in formulations for mRNA drug delivery. The mesoscopic structure of such complex multicomponent and polydisperse nanoparticulate systems is most relevant for their drug delivery properties, medical efficiency, shelf life, and possible side effects. However, the knowledge on the structural details of such formulations is very limited. Essentially no such information is publicly available for pharmaceutical dispersions approved by numerous medicine agencies for the use in humans and loaded with mRNA encoding a mimic of the spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as, e.g., the Comirnaty formulation (BioNTech/Pfizer). Here, we present a simple preparation method to mimic the Comirnaty drug-free LNPs including a comparison of their structural properties with those of Comirnaty. Strong evidence for the liquid state of the LNPs in both systems is found in contrast to the designation of the LNPs as solid lipid nanoparticles by BioNTech.

The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Oip5-as1 can regulate various cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Oip5-as1 may have potential as a therapeutic target for MI/R injury as its upregulated expression has been associated with reduced infarct size and improved cardiac function in animal models, although how to effectively and safely overexpress Oip5-as1 in vivo remains unclear. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a versatile technology for targeted drug delivery in numerous therapeutic applications. Herein, we aimed to assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of LNPs coloaded with Oip5-as1 and a cardiomyocyte-specific binding peptide (LNP@Oip5-as1@CMP) in a murine model of MI/R injury. To achieve this, LNP@Oip5-as1@CMP was synthesized via ethanol injection method. The structural components of LNP@Oip5-as1@CMP were physicochemically analyzed. A hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model in HL-1 cells and coronary artery ligation in mice were used to simulate MI/R injury. Our results demonstrated that LNPs designed for cardiomyocyte targeting and efficient Oip5-as1 delivery were successfully synthesized. In HL-1 cells, LNP@Oip5-as1@CMP treatment significantly reduced mitochondrial apoptosis caused by H/R injury. In the murine MI/R model, the intravenous administration of LNP@Oip5-as1@CMP significantly decreased myocardial infarct size and improved cardiac function. Mechanistic investigations revealed that Oip5-as1 delivery inhibited the p53 signaling pathway. However, the cardioprotective effects of Oip5-as1 were abrogated by administrating Nutlin-3a, a p53 activator. Furthermore, no signs of major organ damage were detected after LNP@Oip5-as1@CMP injection. Our study reveals the therapeutic potential of LNPs for targeted Oip5-as1 delivery in mitigating MI/R injury. These findings pave the way for advanced targeted treatments in cardiovascular diseases, emphasizing the promise of lncRNA-based therapies.",

However, significant challenges limit these therapies from accommodating current patient demand including supply chain limitations and wait times associated with availability of GMP quality viral vectors and long needle-to-needle time from initiation of treatment to receiving the final drug product. As of yet other competitive therapies including bi-specific antibodies and allogeneic CAR-T have not achieved the same level of therapeutic efficacy as conventional autologous T cell therapies highlighting the critical unmet need for same day treatment options for autologous CAR-T products.\n RNA Gene Writers leverage target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) biochemistry evolved from non-LTR retrotransposon mobile genetic elements to modify the genetic information in cells using RNA templates and without the need to introduce DNA breaks. Moreover, RNA Gene Writers can be engineered to catalyze a variety of editing reactions, such as the introduction of gene-length DNA sequences, substitutions, insertions, and deletions. These edits can be achieved with all-RNA delivery in primary cells and in vivo, eliminating the necessity for viral vectors and DNA template-based gene editing.\n LNP-RNA delivery of RNA Gene Writers resulted in the integration and expression of transgenes in >60% of primary human T cells in vitro. Furthermore, our LNPs deliver RNA to T cells in vivo, with 80% reporter expression in a humanized mouse model and 45% in non-human primates (NHP). We have demonstrated LNP delivery of RNA Writers into primary human T cells with an RNA template encoding a CAR cassette can achieve >20% CAR+ T cells without detriments to cell viability or proliferative capacity and have demonstrated ability to mediate tumor cell killing in vitro. Moreover, RNA Gene Writer derived CAR-T cells can be introduced into mouse xenograft models to clear antigen specific tumors in vivo. CAR mRNA can also be packaged into proprietary LNP formulations and delivered to primary human T cells in a mixture of lymphocytes commonly found in patient leukapheresis to generate CAR-T cells in vitro. This opens the possibility of using RNA Gene Writers to develop a same-day CAR-T treatment.\n In addition, the modularity of our RNA Gene Writing technology allows multiplex editing to co-introduce multiple genetic changes including generation of universal and more potent CAR-T cells through the knock-out of B2M and TRAC at comparable levels (>80% double knockout) to Cas9 nucleases. Further, we show that we can achieve both edits simultaneously in 80% of T cells that have achieved CAR transgene insertion via another RNA Gene Writer enzyme. Importantly, we have demonstrated successful B2M and TRAC double knock-out without inducing translocations (undetectable vs 8% translocations with Cas9).\n RNA Gene Writing technology is uniquely positioned for same-day delivery of all-RNA components toenable a wide range of editing applications, from gene knock-out to gene integration. The ability to package the RNA Gene Writer system into LNPs unlocks the potential for the genetic engineering of autologous T cell therapies to enable same-day delivery a current limitation of conventional lentiviral-based CAR-T therapies.",

Advances in protein engineering and materials science have contributed to novel nanoscale targeting approaches that may bring new hope to cancer patients. Several therapeutic nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use. However, to date, there are only a few clinically approved nanocarriers that incorporate molecules to selectively bind and target cancer cells. This review examines some of the approved formulations and discusses the challenges in translating basic research to the clinic. We detail the arsenal of nanocarriers and molecules available for selective tumour targeting, and emphasize the challenges in cancer treatment. Cancer remains one of the world's most devastating diseases, with more than 10 million new cases every year 1. However, mortality has decreased in the past two years 2 owing to better understanding of tumour biology and improved diagnostic devices and treatments. Current cancer treatments include surgical intervention, radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, which often also kill healthy cells and cause toxicity to the patient. It would therefore be desirable to develop chemotherapeutics that can either passively or actively target cancerous cells. Passive targeting exploits the characteristic features of tumour biology that allow nanocarriers to accumulate in the tumour by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect 2. Passively targeting nanocarriers first reached clinical trials in the mid-1980s, and the first products, based on liposomes and polymer\u2013protein conjugates, were marketed in the mid-1990s. Later, therapeutic nanocarriers based on this strategy were approved for wider use (Table 1) and methods of further enhancing targeting of drugs to cancer cells were investigated. Active approaches achieve this by conjugating nanocarriers containing chemotherapeutics with molecules that bind to overexpressed antigens or receptors on the target cells. Recent reviews provide perspective on the use of nanotechnology as a fundamental tool in cancer research and nanomedicine 3,4. Here we focus on the potential of nanocarriers and molecules that can selectively target tumours, and highlight the challenges in translating some of the basic research to the clinic. PaSSive anD aCtive targeting Nanocarriers encounter numerous barriers en route to their target, such as mucosal barriers and non-specific uptake 5,6. To address the challenges of targeting tumours with nanotechnology, it is necessary to combine the rational design of nanocarriers with the fundamental understanding of tumour biology (Box 1). General features of tumours include leaky blood vessels and poor lymphatic drainage. Whereas free drugs may diffuse non-specifically, a nanocarrier can \u2026"

Since biological membranes and nucleic acids are negatively charged, it is difficult to deliver mRNA across this barrier. LNPs offer an ideal platform for delivering nucleic acid therapies as the ionizable lipids are nearneutrally charged at physiological pH. However, in acidic endosomal compartments (pH-4.5), they become ionized, promoting endosomal escape for effective intracellular delivery (Reichmuth et al., 2016)(Hajj et al., 2017). Hence, LNPs achieve high encapsulation rate for nucleic acids with improved transfection efficiency. Furthermore, LNPs have relatively low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity compared to liposomes, thus favoring delivery of nucleic acid based therapeutics (Cullis et al., 2017)(Uchida et al., 2020)(Billingsley et al., 2020)...In terms of industrial scale up, LNPs offer multiple advantages compared with other carrier systems, such as large scale production using microfluidics or T-junction mixing, stability, and low cost of raw materials [52](Elia et al., 2021)(Buschmann et al., 2021)...In a nutshell, the most fundamental rationale of using LNPs, as an alternative to polymeric nanoparticles, is the simplicity of largescale manufacturing and their low toxicity (Wang et al., 2016)(Constantinides, 1995).",

Efficient delivery of mRNA vaccines will be key for their success and translation to the clinic. Among potential nonviral vectors, lipid nanoparticles are particularly promising. Indeed, lipid nanoparticles can be synthesized with relative ease in a scalable manner, protect the mRNA against degradation, facilitate endosomal escape, can be targeted to the desired cell type by surface decoration with ligands, and as needed, can be codelivered with adjuvants.",

However, current CAR T cell engineering methods use viral delivery, which induces permanent CAR expression that leads to severe adverse effects. mRNA has been explored as a promising strategy for inducing transient CAR expression in T cells to mitigate the adverse effects associated with viral expression, but it most commonly requires electroporation for T cell transfection which can be cytotoxic. Here, ionizable lipids nanoparticles (LNPs) were designed for ex vivo mRNA delivery to human T cells. A library of 24 ionizable lipids was synthesized, formulated into LNPs, and screened for luciferase mRNA delivery to Jurkat cells, revealing seven formulations capable of enhanced mRNA delivery over lipofectamine. The top-performing LNP formulation, C14-4, was selected for CAR mRNA delivery to primary human T cells. This platform induced CAR expression equivalent to electroporation with substantially improved cytotoxicity. CAR T cells engineered via C14-4 LNP treatment were then compared to electroporated CAR T cells in a co-culture assay with Nalm-6 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, and we show that both CAR T cell engineering methods elicit potent cancer killing activity. These results demonstrate the ability of ionizable LNPs to deliver mRNA to primary human T cells for functional protein expression and indicate the potential of LNPs to enhance mRNA-based CAR T cell engineering methods.",

As mRNA presents no risk of integration into the host genome and does not require nuclear entry for transfection, which allows protein production even in non-dividing cells, mRNA-based approaches can be envisioned as safe and practical therapeutic strategies. Nevertheless, mRNA presents unfavorable characteristics, such as large size, immunogenicity, limited cellular uptake and sensitivity to enzymatic degradation, which hinder its use as therapeutic agent. While mRNA stability and immunogenicity have been ameliorated by direct modifications on the mRNA structure, further improvements in mRNA delivery are still needed for promoting its activity in biological settings. In this regard, nanomedicine has shown the ability for spatiotemporally controlling the function of a myriad of bioactive agents in vivo.

The urgent need for a vaccine has led to the development of various immunization approaches. mRNA vaccines represent a cell-free, simple, and rapid platform for immunization, and therefore have been employed in recent studies toward the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Herein, we present the design of an mRNA vaccine, based on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)-encapsulated SARS-CoV-2 human Fc-conjugated receptor-binding domain (RBD-hFc). Several ionizable lipids have been evaluated in vivo in a luciferase (luc) mRNA reporter assay, and two leading LNPs formulations have been chosen for the subsequent RBD-hFc mRNA vaccine strategy. Intramuscular administration of LNP RBD-hFc mRNA elicited robust humoral response, a high level of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased cellular response in BALB/c mice. The data in the current study demonstrate the potential of these lipids as promising candidates for LNP-based mRNA vaccines in general and for a COVID19 vaccine in particular."

Since biological membranes and nucleic acids are negatively charged, it is difficult to deliver mRNA across this barrier. LNPs offer an ideal platform for delivering nucleic acid therapies as the ionizable lipids are nearneutrally charged at physiological pH. However, in acidic endosomal compartments (pH-4.5), they become ionized, promoting endosomal escape for effective intracellular delivery (Reichmuth et al., 2016)(Hajj et al., 2017). Hence, LNPs achieve high encapsulation rate for nucleic acids with improved transfection efficiency. Furthermore, LNPs have relatively low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity compared to liposomes, thus favoring delivery of nucleic acid based therapeutics (Cullis et al., 2017)(Uchida et al., 2020)(Billingsley et al., 2020)"

In addition to the above mentioned concerns of CNTs and metallic NPs, it has been observed that metallo-supramolecular polymers, that can provide the functionality of the metal ion along with the processability of a polymer have some limitations when used in drug delivery processes. For example, the introduction of metal ions in the body can disturb the ion balance and limit certain medical applications (Rowan and Beck, 2005), (Dong et al., 2015). Furthermore, dendritic polymers exhibit many drawbacks which limit their usage in theranostic applications, for instance, several complex and highly expensive synthetic and purification procedures can lead to imprecise or nonspecific structures with low quantifiability. Moreover, these polymers show poor reproducibility and certain biosafety concerns due to their possible toxicity and unexpected removal, which restrict their clinical translation (Jain et al., 2010), (Shcharbin et al., 2014).

In recent years, several clinical trials of RNAi therapeutics especially siRNAs have been conducted with limited success so far. For systemic administration of these poorly permeable and easily degradable macromolecules, it is obvious that a safe and efficient delivery platform is highly desirable. Because of high biocompatibility, biodegradability and solid track record for clinical use, nanocarriers made of lipids and/or phospholipids have been commonly employed to facilitate RNA delivery. In this article, the key features of the major sub-classes of lipid-based nanocarriers, e.g. liposomes, lipid nanoparticles and lipid nanoemulsions, will be reviewed. Focus of the discussion is on the various challenges researchers face when developing lipid-based RNA nanocarriers, such as the toxicity of cationic lipids and issues related to PEGylated lipids, as well as the strategies employed in tackling these challenges. It is hoped that by understanding more about the pros and cons of these most frequently used RNA delivery systems, the pharmaceutical scientists, biomedical researchers and clinicians will be more successful in overcoming some of the obstacles that currently limit the clinical translation of RNAi therapy."

ORLN was characterized by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Results In vitro enzymatic stability studies showed higher concentrations of insulin in cells incubated with ORLN-encapsulated insulin than in those incubated with free insulin solution in artificial intestinal fluid (pH 6.5). The protective effect of ORLN was attributed to its special release behavior and the formulation of the PC shell and oil barrier. Furthermore, an in vivo oral efficacy study confirmed that blood glucose levels were markedly decreased after ORLN administration in both healthy and diabetic mice. In vivo pharmacokinetic results showed that the bioavailability of ORLN-conjugated insulin was approximately 28.7% relative to that of the group subcutaneously administered with an aqueous solution of insulin, indicating enhanced oral absorption. Conclusions In summary, the ORLN system developed here shows promise as a nanocarrier for improving the oral absorption of insulin.",

During vaccination, naked or vehicle loaded mRNA vaccines efficiently express tumor antigens in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), facilitate APC activation and innate/adaptive immune stimulation. mRNA cancer vaccine precedes other conventional vaccine platforms due to high potency, safe administration, rapid development potentials, and cost-effective manufacturing. However, mRNA vaccine applications have been limited by instability, innate immunogenicity, and inefficient in vivo delivery. Appropriate mRNA structure modifications (i.e., codon optimizations, nucleotide modifications, self-amplifying mRNAs, etc.) and formulation methods (i.e., lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymers, peptides, etc.) have been investigated to overcome these issues. Tuning the administration routes and co-delivery of multiple mRNA vaccines with other immunotherapeutic agents (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors) have further boosted the host anti-tumor immunity and increased the likelihood of tumor cell eradication. With the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of LNP-loaded mRNA vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 and the promising therapeutic outcomes of mRNA cancer vaccines achieved in several clinical trials against multiple aggressive solid tumors, we envision the rapid advancing of mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy in the near future. This review provides a detailed overview of the recent progress and existing challenges of mRNA cancer vaccines and future considerations of applying mRNA vaccine for cancer immunotherapies."

Nucleotide vaccines, including mRNA vaccines with their intracellular antigen synthesis, have been shown to be potent activators of a cytotoxic immune response. The intracellular delivery of mRNA vaccines to the cytosol of antigen presenting immune cells is still not sufficiently well understood. Here, we report on the development of a lipid nanoparticle formulation for the delivery of mRNA vaccines to induce a cytotoxic CD 8 T cell response. We show transfection of dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. The efficacy of the vaccine was tested in an aggressive B16F10 melanoma model. We found a strong CD 8 T cell activation after a single immunization. Treatment of B16F10 melanoma tumors with lipid nanoparticles containing mRNA coding for the tumor-associated antigens gp100 and TRP2 resulted in tumor shrinkage and extended the overall survival of the treated mice. The immune response can be further increased by the incorporation of the adjuvant LPS. In conclusion, the lipid nanoparticle formulation presented here is a promising vector for mRNA vaccine delivery, one that is capable of inducing a strong cytotoxic T cell response. Further optimization, including the incorporation of different adjuvants, will likely enhance the potency of the vaccine."

Results A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. Conclusions A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines.

The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle\u2013encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19. Methods This phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 99 centers across the United States. Persons at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or its complications were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular injections of mRNA-1273 (100 \u03bcg) or placebo 28 days apart. The primary end point was prevention of Covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Results The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic, virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the mRNA-1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001). Efficacy was similar across key secondary analyses, including assessment 14 days after the first dose, analyses that included participants who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, and analyses in participants 65 years of age or older. Severe Covid-19 occurred in 30 participants, with one fatality; all 30 were in the placebo group. Moderate, transient reactogenicity after vaccination occurred more frequently in the mRNA-1273 group. Serious adverse events were rare, and the incidence was similar in the two groups. Conclusions The mRNA-1273 vaccine showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing Covid-19 illness, including severe disease. Aside from transient local and systemic reactions, no safety concerns were identified.

Most notably, the rapid and successful deployment of the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna represented a turning point for drug delivery (Baden et al., 2020)(Polack et al., 2020) . These vaccines rely on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery system to shuttle mRNA past multiple biological barriers that would otherwise prevent efficacy. With over a billion doses of mRNA-LNP vaccines administered globally, LNPs for nucleic acid delivery represent one of the most widely used drug products in history. Additionally, LNPs as delivery platforms have been leveraged in multiple clinical trials for applications such as vaccination, protein replacement therapy, cancer immunotherapy, RNA interference and gene editing (Hou et al., 2021) . LNPs feature high potency, biocompatibility and the ability to be administered repeatedly, all of which are properties that favour clinical translation (Hou et al., 2021) ."

Lipid nanoparticles are loaded with therapeutics and may not contain an enclosed bilayer. The majority of those clinically approved have diameters of 50-300 nm. The growing interest in nanomedicine has fueled lipid-drug and lipid-protein studies, which provide a foundation for developing lipid particles that improve drug potency and reduce off-target effects. Integrating advances in lipid membrane research has enabled therapeutic development. At present, about 600 clinical trials involve lipid particle drug delivery systems. Greater understanding of pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and disposition of lipid-drug particles facilitated particle surface hydration technology (with polyethylene glycol) to reduce rapid clearance and provide sufficient blood circulation time for drug to reach target tissues and cells. Surface hydration enabled the liposome-encapsulated cancer drug doxorubicin (Doxil) to gain clinical approval in 1995. Fifteen lipidic therapeutics are now clinically approved. Although much research involves attaching lipid particles to ligands selective for occult cells and tissues, preparation procedures are often complex and pose scale-up challenges. With emerging knowledge in drug target and lipid-drug distribution in the body, a systems approach that integrates knowledge to design and scale lipid-drug particles may further advance translation of these systems to improve therapeutic safety and efficacy."

During vaccination, naked or vehicle loaded mRNA vaccines efficiently express tumor antigens in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), facilitate APC activation and innate/adaptive immune stimulation. mRNA cancer vaccine precedes other conventional vaccine platforms due to high potency, safe administration, rapid development potentials, and cost-effective manufacturing. However, mRNA vaccine applications have been limited by instability, innate immunogenicity, and inefficient in vivo delivery. Appropriate mRNA structure modifications (i.e., codon optimizations, nucleotide modifications, self-amplifying mRNAs, etc.) and formulation methods (i.e., lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymers, peptides, etc.) have been investigated to overcome these issues. Tuning the administration routes and co-delivery of multiple mRNA vaccines with other immunotherapeutic agents (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors) have further boosted the host anti-tumor immunity and increased the likelihood of tumor cell eradication. With the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of LNP-loaded mRNA vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 and the promising therapeutic outcomes of mRNA cancer vaccines achieved in several clinical trials against multiple aggressive solid tumors, we envision the rapid advancing of mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy in the near future.

Recently, researchers have attempted to remotely control the in vivo behavior of drugs with light to overcome the shortcomings of conventional drug delivery systems. Photodynamic and photothermal systems are representative strategies wherein a photosensitive material is activated in response to a specific wavelength of light. Photosensitive materials generally exhibit poor solubility and low biocompatibility. Additionally, their low photostability negatively affects delivery performance. A formulation of lipid-based nanoparticles containing photosensitive substances can help achieve photosensitive drug delivery with improved biocompatibility. The lipid bilayer structure, which can be assembled and disassembled by modulating the surrounding conditions (temperature, pH, etc.), can also be crucial for controlled release of drugs. To the best of our knowledge, translation research on photoresponsive nanoparticles is scarce. However, as various drugs based on lipid nanoparticles have been clinically approved, the development potential of the lipid-based photoresponsive nanoparticles seems high. Thus, the identification of valid indications and development of optimum medical devices will increase the interest in photoresponsive material-based nanoparticles.",

The strategy to use the immune system as an approach for treating cancer has recently gained momentum. Messenger RNA (mRNA) has been assessed as an up-and-coming resource for the evolution of advanced cancer immunotherapies over the past decades. However, degradation in extracellular compartments and during endosomal escape remain obstacles for efficient mRNA delivery and limit the therapeutic applications of this approach. Lipid-based nanocarriers are gaining significant attention as non-viral mRNA vectors. Various lipid-based nanocarrier types have been developed to enhance the stability of mRNA molecules, facilitate their transfection, and ensure delivery to an intracellular compartment suitable for further processing. This review discusses the development of novel mRNA delivery systems using lipids for effective cancer immunotherapy. mRNAs are superior to other biomolecules for developing therapeutic drugs and vaccines with multiple medical applications that are currently being explored by researchers in various biomedical fields. Lipid-based mRNA nanoparticles can improve the potency of the mRNA by enhancing its stability, enabling its cellular uptake, and facilitating its endosomal escape. Targetability of these therapeutics can be increased by conjugating their surface with the desired ligands or targeting agents. Lipid\u2013mRNA nanoparticles are increasingly being incorporated in cancer immunotherapy applications, including vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell treatment, and several such nanoparticles are being assessed in clinical trials.

Nucleic acid particles need to be small, stable and functional in terms of selective cell uptake and controlled release of encapsulated nucleic acids. Here we report on small (\u223c38 nm) monomolecular nucleic acid/lipid particles (mNALPs) that contain single molecules of short double-stranded oligonucleotides covered by a tight, highly curved lipid bilayer. The particles consist of DOPE, DOTAP, DOPC and DSPE-PEG(2000) and are assembled with 21 bp double-stranded DNA or small interfering RNA by solvent exchange on a hydrodynamic-focusing microfluidic chip. In comparison to vortex mixing by hand this method increases the encapsulation efficiency by 20%, and yields particles with a narrower size distribution, negligible aggregate formation and high stability in blood plasma and serum. Modification of mNALPs with folate-conjugated PEG-lipids results in specific binding and uptake by epithelial carcinoma KB cells overexpressing folate receptors. Binding is significantly reduced by competitive inhibition using free folate and is not observed with non-targeted mNALPs, revealing high specificity. The functionalized mNALPs show gene silencing in the presence of chloroquine, an endosome-destabilizing agent. Together, the robust self-assembly of small-sized mNALPs with their high stability and receptor-specific cell uptake demonstrate that the tight, PEG-grafted lipid-bilayer encapsulation may offer a promising approach towards the delivery of short double-stranded oligonucleotides."

Traditional pharmacotherapeutic treatment approaches (i.e., bronchodilators, corticosteroids, chemotherapeutics, peptide-based agents, etc.) are not satisfactory to cure or impede diseases. With the advent of nanotechnology, drug delivery to an intended site is still difficult, but the nanoparticle's physicochemical properties can accomplish targeted therapeutic delivery. Based on their surface, size, density, and physical-chemical properties, nanoparticles have demonstrated enhanced pharmacokinetics of actives, achieving the spotlight in the drug delivery research field. In this review, the authors have highlighted different nanoparticle-based therapeutic delivery approaches to treat chronic pulmonary diseases along with the preparation techniques. The authors have remarked the nanosuspension delivery via nebulization and dry powder carrier is further effective in the lung delivery system since the particles released from these systems are innumerable to composite nanoparticles. The authors have also outlined the inhaled particle's toxicity, patented nanoparticle-based pulmonary formulations, and commercial pulmonary drug delivery devices (PDD) in other sections. Recently advanced formulations employing nanoparticles as therapeutic carriers for the efficient treatment of chronic pulmonary diseases are also canvassed."

Currently in the spotlight as vital components of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, LNPs play a key role in effectively protecting and transporting mRNA to cells. Liposomes, an early version of LNPs, are a versatile nanomedicine delivery platform. A number of liposomal drugs have been approved and applied to medical practice. Subsequent generations of lipid nanocarriers, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, exhibit more complex architectures and enhanced physical stabilities. With their ability to encapsulate and deliver therapeutics to specific locations within the body and to release their contents at a desired time, LNPs provide a valuable platform for treatment of a variety of diseases. Here, we present a landscape of LNP-related scientific publications, including patents and journal articles, based on analysis of the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific knowledge. Rising trends are identified, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and solid lipid nanoparticles becoming the preferred platforms for numerous formulations. Recent advancements in LNP formulations as drug delivery platforms, such as antitumor and nucleic acid therapeutics and vaccine delivery systems, are discussed. Challenges and growth opportunities are also evaluated in other areas, such as medical imaging, cosmetics, nutrition, and agrochemicals. This report is intended to serve as a useful resource for those interested in LNP nanotechnologies, their applications, and the global research effort for their development."

This study reports on the design and optimization of a multifunctional envelope\u2010type nanodevice (MEND) for an efficient siRNA delivery to the lung endothelium based on GALA\u2010peptide targeting ability. The incorporation of a pH\u2010sensitive lipid (YSK05) results in a dramatic improvement in silencing efficiency by enhancing endosomal escape, but this also causes a reduction in the lung selectivity. Contrary to the assumption that active targeting is largely dependent on the presence of a targeting ligand, the findings of the present study indicate that nanocarrier composition is critical for achieving the organ selectivity. Interestingly, helper lipids substantially mask the liver delivery resulting in optimum lung targeting. The optimized YSK05\u2010MEND is 40\u2010fold more efficient than a previously developed MEND, with a robust lung endothelium gene knockdown at small doses. The YSK05\u2010MEND strongly inhibits a metastatic lung cancer model and exerts superior control over lung metastasis compared to chemotherapy or the previously developed MEND. The YSK05\u2010MEND is well\u2010tolerated in mice after acute or chronic administration.

Inhibiting the intrinsic NER function may enhance the antitumor activity of cisplatin and conquer cisplatin resistance. Herein, we report the design, optimization, and application of a self-assembled lipid nanoparticle (LNP) system to simultaneously deliver a cisplatin prodrug together with siRNA targeting endonuclease xeroderma pigmentosum group F (XPF), a crucial component in the NER pathway. The LNP is able to efficiently encapsulate both the platinum prodrug and siRNA molecules with a tuned ratio. Both platinum prodrug and XPF-targeted siRNA are efficiently carried into cells and released; the former damages DNA and the latter specifically downregulates both mRNA and protein levels of XPF to potentiate the platinum drug, leading to enhanced expression levels of apoptosis markers and improved cytotoxicity in both cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant human lung cancer cells. Our results demonstrate an effective approach to utilize a multi-targeted nanoparticle system that can specifically silence an NER-related gene to promote apoptosis induced by cisplatin, especially in cisplatin-refractory tumors."

Currently in the spotlight as vital components of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, LNPs play a key role in effectively protecting and transporting mRNA to cells. Liposomes, an early version of LNPs, are a versatile nanomedicine delivery platform. A number of liposomal drugs have been approved and applied to medical practice. Subsequent generations of lipid nanocarriers, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, exhibit more complex architectures and enhanced physical stabilities. With their ability to encapsulate and deliver therapeutics to specific locations within the body and to release their contents at a desired time, LNPs provide a valuable platform for treatment of a variety of diseases. Here, we present a landscape of LNP-related scientific publications, including patents and journal articles, based on analysis of the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific knowledge. Rising trends are identified, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and solid lipid nanoparticles becoming the preferred platforms for numerous formulations. Recent advancements in LNP formulations as drug delivery platforms, such as antitumor and nucleic acid therapeutics and vaccine delivery systems, are discussed. Challenges and growth opportunities are also evaluated in other areas, such as medical imaging, cosmetics, nutrition, and agrochemicals. This report is intended to serve as a useful resource for those interested in LNP nanotechnologies, their applications, and the global research effort for their development."

Their versatile nature enables the encapsulation and targeting of various types of medically relevant molecular cargo, including oligonucleotides, proteins, and small molecules for the treatment of diseases, such as cancer. Cancers that form solid tumors are particularly relevant for LNP\u2010based therapeutics due to the enhanced permeation and retention effect that allows nanoparticles to accumulate within the tumor tissue. Additionally, LNPs can be formulated for both locoregional and systemic delivery depending on the tumor type and stage. To date, LNPs have been used extensively in the clinic to reduce systemic toxicity and improve outcomes in cancer patients by encapsulating chemotherapeutic drugs. Next\u2010generation lipid nanoparticles are currently being developed to expand their use in gene therapy and immunotherapy, as well as to enable the co\u2010encapsulation of multiple drugs in a single system.

                    "[267076387 | John et al. | 2024 | Citations: 30]": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have gained prominence as primary carriers for delivering a diverse array of therapeutic agents. Biological products have achieved a solid presence in clinical settings, and the anticipation of creating novel variants is increasing. These products predominantly encompass therapeutic proteins, nucleic acids and messenger RNA. The advancement of efficient LNP-based delivery systems for biologics that can overcome their limitations remains a highly favorable formulation strategy. Moreover, given their small size, biocompatibility, and biodegradation, LNPs can proficiently transport therapeutic moiety into the cells without significant toxicity and adverse reactions. This is especially crucial for the existing and upcoming biopharmaceuticals since large molecules as a group present several challenges that can be overcome by LNPs. This review describes the LNP technology for the delivery of biologics and summarizes the developments in the chemistry, manufacturing, and characterization of lipids used in the development of LNPs for biologics. Finally, we present a perspective on the potential opportunities and the current challenges pertaining to LNP technology."

Compared to liposomes, LNPs provide higher drug loading capacity and better physical stability due to their solid or semi-solid lipid cores, which allow drugs to be more effectively embedded, enhancing drug stability and loading efficiency (Sent\u00ed et al., 2024). Additionally, the surface of LNPs can be modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or other hydrophobic molecules to extend their circulation time in the blood and reduce the likelihood of clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (Huang et al., 2023). LNPs also offer significant advantages in targeted delivery and localized release. By modifying the surface with targeting ligands, LNPs can specifically target tumor cells or particular molecules within the tumor microenvironment, enabling precise drug delivery. In the context of mRNA vaccine delivery, LNPs protect mRNA from degradation by nucleases within the body and facilitate its effective entry into target cells (Cheng et al., 2020)(Kim et al., 2024).

Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues.

Herein, we explore the utilization of lipid-assisted poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(D,L-lactide) (PEG-b-PLA) nanoparticles to achieve ultrahigh loading capability for SN38. Through the introduction of cationic, anionic, or neutral lipids, the SN38 loading efficiency and loading capacity is elevated to >90% and >10% respectively. These lipids efficiently attenuate the intermolecular \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking of SN38, thereby disrupting its crystalline structure. Moreover, we assess the therapeutic activity of SN38-loaded formulations in various tumor models and identify an anionic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) sodium salt (DOPG)-assisted formulation that exhibits the highest anticancer activity and has favorable biosafety.

However, due to the lack of fine-tuning technologies for RNA nanostructures, the relationship between physicochemical properties and siRNA efficacy of polymeric siRNA nanoparticles (PRNs) with different sizes has not yet been fully elucidated. Herein, we scrutinized the effects of size/surface chemistry-tuned PRNs on the biological and physiological interactions with tumors. PRNs with adjusted size and surface properties were prepared using sequential engineering processes: RCT, condensation, and nanolayer deposition of functional biopolymers. Through the RCT process, nanoparticles of three sizes with a diameter of 50-200 nm were fabricated and terminated with three types of biopolymers: poly-l-lysine (PLL), poly-l-glutamate (PLG), and hyaluronic acid (HA) for different surface properties. Among the PRNs, HA-layered nanoparticles with a diameter of \u223c200 nm exhibited the most effective systemic delivery, resulting in superior anticancer effects in an orthotopic breast tumor model due to the CD44 receptor targeting and optimized nanosized structure. Depending on the type of PRNs, the in vivo siRNA delivery with protein expression inhibition differed by up to approximately 20-fold. These findings indicate that the types of layered biopolymers and the PRNs size mediate efficient polymeric siRNA delivery to the targeted tumors, resulting in high RNAi-induced therapeutic efficacy. This RNA-nanotechnology-based size/surface editing can overcome the limitations of siRNA therapeutics and represents a potent built-in module method to design RNA therapeutics tailored for targeted cancer therapy."

Herein, the main challenges of chemotherapy, and how they can be overcome with the help of nanomedicine, are approached. Natural pathways to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) are detailed, and different in vivo studies where these pathways are mimicked functionalizing the nanomaterial surface are shown. Later, lipid-based nanocarriers, such as liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers, are presented. To finish, recent studies that have used lipid-based nanosystems carrying not only therapeutic agents, yet also magnetic nanoparticles, are described. Although the advantages of using these types of nanosystems are explained, including their biocompatibility, the possibility of modifying their surface to enhance the cell targeting, and their intrinsic ability of BBB crossing, it is important to mention that research in this field is still at its early stage, and extensive preclinical and clinical investigations are mandatory in the close future."

Their primary advantage is the improvement of the bioavailability of drugs, specifically lipophilic molecules that can be better solubilized in the lipid core than in aqueous environments. The lipophilic core of lipid nanoparticles entraps active ingredients, while the surfactant membrane, generally consisting solely or partially of phospholipids, ensures the stability of LNP in hydrophilic environment. LNP are particularly well suited for transdermal drug delivery. Indeed, lipid nanoparticles are known to create a mono-layer film on the skin, limiting water evaporation and improving skin hydration (Wissing et al., 2001)...One major reason for using LNP is their ability to control drug release kinetics...To improve the blood half-life of the particles, PEG-based surfactants can be included as membrane ingredients.

                    "[3328751 | Pozzi et al. | 2014 | Citations: 483]": "When nanoparticles (NPs) enter a physiological environment, medium components compete for binding to the NP surface leading to formation of a rich protein shell known as the \"protein corona\". Unfortunately, opsonins are also adsorbed. These proteins are immediately recognized by the phagocyte system with rapid clearance of the NPs from the bloodstream. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating of NPs (PEGylation) is the most efficient anti-opsonization strategy. Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages. However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system. To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains. Nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis allowed us to accurately determine the corona composition showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins. Due to the abundance of apolipoproteins, we exploited the \"protein corona effect\" to deliver cationic liposome-human plasma complexes to human prostate cancer PC3 cells that express a high level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in order to evaluate the cellular uptake efficiency of the systems used. Combining laser scanning confocal microscopy with flow cytometry analysis in PC3 cells we demonstrated that MC-PEG2k is the best compromise between an anti-opsonization strategy and active targeting and could be a promising candidate to treat prostate cancer in vivo."

The lipophilic core of lipid nanoparticles entraps active ingredients, while the surfactant membrane, generally consisting solely or partially of phospholipids, ensures the stability of LNP in hydrophilic environment.

For example, NLCs functionalized with cyclic RGD peptides have shown improved targeting efficiency and tumor penetration in GBM mouse models. Additionally, surface modification with polyethylene glycol (PEG) enhances systemic circulation and minimizes immune clearance. Compared to polymeric nanoparticles and inorganic systems, LNPs provide superior biocompatibility, safety, and BBB-crossing potential. Polymeric nanoparticles, while versatile, often face challenges with biodegradability and immune clearance. Inorganic nanoparticles, such as gold or mesoporous silica, excel in imaging and theranostic applications but may exhibit cytotoxicity at higher concentrations. LNPs combine biocompatibility with flexibility for functionalization, making them ideal for targeted and sustained drug delivery in GBM therapy (Iturrioz-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2020)."

                            "LNPs, which are mainly formed from phospholipids, are nontoxic, biocompatible and biodegradable and can also reduce the toxic effects of carrier molecules, which means they are particularly suitable for oral or other routes of drug delivery. Polymers have various compositions, sizes, morphologies and surface properties that can be adjusted by applying different ingredients and manufacturing methods for specific applications. Tailoring polymers can improve organ selectivity by introducing targeting groups. Meanwhile, some inorganic nanoparticles, such as AgNPs and AuNPs, can bind to viral surface receptors and prevent viruses from entering the host cell. However, it is important to note that LNP has been shown to induce immune reactions on several previous occasions, suggesting that potential immune reactions should be considered. In addition, although inorganic nanoparticles or nanodelivery systems have good antiviral activity, they are difficult to degrade in living organisms and tend to accumulate in the body, causing organ toxicity. In contrast, cationic polymers can bind to negatively charged cell membranes to increase permeability and facilitate endocytosis, but they also show cytotoxicity by damaging the cell membranes and reducing the DNA release rate."

These vaccines rely on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery system to shuttle mRNA past multiple biological barriers that would otherwise prevent efficacy. With over a billion doses of mRNA-LNP vaccines administered globally, LNPs for nucleic acid delivery represent one of the most widely used drug products in history. Additionally, LNPs as delivery platforms have been leveraged in multiple clinical trials for applications such as vaccination, protein replacement therapy, cancer immunotherapy, RNA interference and gene editing (Hou et al., 2021) . LNPs feature high potency, biocompatibility and the ability to be administered repeatedly, all of which are properties that favour clinical translation (Hou et al., 2021) ."

The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle\u2013encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19. Methods This phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 99 centers across the United States. Persons at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or its complications were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular injections of mRNA-1273 (100 \u03bcg) or placebo 28 days apart. The primary end point was prevention of Covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Results The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic, virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the mRNA-1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001). Efficacy was similar across key secondary analyses, including assessment 14 days after the first dose, analyses that included participants who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, and analyses in participants 65 years of age or older. Severe Covid-19 occurred in 30 participants, with one fatality; all 30 were in the placebo group. Moderate, transient reactogenicity after vaccination occurred more frequently in the mRNA-1273 group. Serious adverse events were rare, and the incidence was similar in the two groups. Conclusions The mRNA-1273 vaccine showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing Covid-19 illness, including severe disease. Aside from transient local and systemic reactions, no safety concerns were identified.

                            "Abstract Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. Methods In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 \u03bcg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle\u2013formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety. Results A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. Conclusions A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines.

                            "Nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis and therapy. Advances in protein engineering and materials science have contributed to novel nanoscale targeting approaches that may bring new hope to cancer patients. Several therapeutic nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use. However, to date, there are only a few clinically approved nanocarriers that incorporate molecules to selectively bind and target cancer cells. This review examines some of the approved formulations and discusses the challenges in translating basic research to the clinic. We detail the arsenal of nanocarriers and molecules available for selective tumour targeting, and emphasize the challenges in cancer treatment. Cancer remains one of the world's most devastating diseases, with more than 10 million new cases every year 1. However, mortality has decreased in the past two years 2 owing to better understanding of tumour biology and improved diagnostic devices and treatments. Current cancer treatments include surgical intervention, radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, which often also kill healthy cells and cause toxicity to the patient. It would therefore be desirable to develop chemotherapeutics that can either passively or actively target cancerous cells. Passive targeting exploits the characteristic features of tumour biology that allow nanocarriers to accumulate in the tumour by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect 2. Passively targeting nanocarriers first reached clinical trials in the mid-1980s, and the first products, based on liposomes and polymer\u2013protein conjugates, were marketed in the mid-1990s. Later, therapeutic nanocarriers based on this strategy were approved for wider use (Table 1) and methods of further enhancing targeting of drugs to cancer cells were investigated. Active approaches achieve this by conjugating nanocarriers containing chemotherapeutics with molecules that bind to overexpressed antigens or receptors on the target cells. Recent reviews provide perspective on the use of nanotechnology as a fundamental tool in cancer research and nanomedicine 3,4. Here we focus on the potential of nanocarriers and molecules that can selectively target tumours, and highlight the challenges in translating some of the basic research to the clinic. PaSSive anD aCtive targeting Nanocarriers encounter numerous barriers en route to their target, such as mucosal barriers and non-specific uptake 5,6. To address the challenges of targeting tumours with nanotechnology, it is necessary to combine the rational design of nanocarriers with the fundamental understanding of tumour biology (Box 1). General features of tumours include leaky blood vessels and poor lymphatic drainage. Whereas free drugs may diffuse non-specifically, a nanocarrier can \u2026"

These nanoparticles enable controlled drug release, making them particularly suitable for long-term cancer treatment, as they provide sustained therapeutic effects. In addition, they exhibit high physical stability, minimizing the risk of drug leakage during both storage and circulation, which represents an improvement over liposomal systems. Their size and surface properties also contribute to enhanced tumor accumulation through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Furthermore, lipid-based nanoparticles protect sensitive molecules, such as siRNA or DNA, from enzymatic degradation, which is essential for the effective delivery of genetic therapies."

                            "LNPs are composed of biodegradable and biocompatible lipids, which minimize the risk of toxicity and adverse effects. LNPs can encapsulate hydrophobic drugs, improving their solubility and stability in the biological environment, thereby enhancing their bioavailability. LNPs demonstrate significantly higher ability to encapsulate lipophilic drugs than other nanoparticle types. LNPs offer excellent storage stability, minimal drug leakage, and controlled drug release, making them highly effective nanoplatforms for the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. Additionally, LNPs can be modified by complexing them with specific target ligands on their surface. This surface modification allows the active targeting of LNPs to the tumors in addition to the passive targeting mechanism. Furthermore, the PEGylation of LNPs improves their hydrophilicity and enhances their biological half-life by reducing clearance by the reticuloendothelial system."

                            "LNPs exhibit many advantages as delivery carriers over other nanocarrier systems (such as polymers, CNTs, metallic NPs etc.), and have seen extensive usage in drug delivery. In addition to the above mentioned concerns of CNTs and metallic NPs, it has been observed that metallo-supramolecular polymers, that can provide the functionality of the metal ion along with the processability of a polymer have some limitations when used in drug delivery processes. For example, the introduction of metal ions in the body can disturb the ion balance and limit certain medical applications (Rowan and Beck, 2005), (Dong et al., 2015). Furthermore, dendritic polymers exhibit many drawbacks which limit their usage in theranostic applications, for instance, several complex and highly expensive synthetic and purification procedures can lead to imprecise or nonspecific structures with low quantifiability. Moreover, these polymers show poor reproducibility and certain biosafety concerns due to their possible toxicity and unexpected removal, which restrict their clinical translation (Jain et al., 2010), (Shcharbin et al., 2014). The development of LNPs paves the way for resolving above stated limitations.\n\nAdvantages of LNPs may include: (1) ease of engineering processes, (2) up-scaling feasibility, (3) excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, (4) negligible toxicity, (5) controlled and targeted drug release potential, (6) improved drug solubility and stability, (7) enhanced bioavailability, (8) potential of encapsulating both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, (9) less expensive, (10) encapsulation of high drug content, (11) potential to cross various physiological barriers, (12) easy validation, and many others which could be favorable for specific delivery route or nature of the payload (Ghasemiyeh and Mohammadi-Samani, 2018), (Attama et al., 2012)."

These nanoparticles enable precise drug delivery to target cells, controlled release, and targeted distribution through surface modification with ligands",
                            "Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) constitute a subclass of nanoparticles composed primarily of lipids, which have garnered significant attention in recent years. LNPs present several advantages over alternative nanoparticle systems, including high stability, biocompatibility, and the capability to target specific cells or tissues. This targeted approach enhances drug efficacy while mitigating side effects. Moreover, the customization of LNPs through surface modification with targeting ligands further refines their specificity toward desired cells or tissues, thus optimizing drug delivery efficiency. Structurally, LNPs typically comprise a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core, forming a versatile platform for drug encapsulation. This architecture facilitates the encapsulation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs within the lipid bilayer or aqueous core, respectively, enabling the simultaneous delivery of multiple therapeutic agents. Moreover, the lipid bilayer contributes to the stability of LNPs in biological environments, shielding encapsulated drugs from degradation and extending their circulation time in the bloodstream."

In recent years, several clinical trials of RNAi therapeutics especially siRNAs have been conducted with limited success so far. For systemic administration of these poorly permeable and easily degradable macromolecules, it is obvious that a safe and efficient delivery platform is highly desirable. Because of high biocompatibility, biodegradability and solid track record for clinical use, nanocarriers made of lipids and/or phospholipids have been commonly employed to facilitate RNA delivery. In this article, the key features of the major sub-classes of lipid-based nanocarriers, e.g. liposomes, lipid nanoparticles and lipid nanoemulsions, will be reviewed. Focus of the discussion is on the various challenges researchers face when developing lipid-based RNA nanocarriers, such as the toxicity of cationic lipids and issues related to PEGylated lipids, as well as the strategies employed in tackling these challenges. It is hoped that by understanding more about the pros and cons of these most frequently used RNA delivery systems, the pharmaceutical scientists, biomedical researchers and clinicians will be more successful in overcoming some of the obstacles that currently limit the clinical translation of RNAi therapy."

Liposomes are spherical vesicles composed of lipid bilayers that can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs (Dymek et al., 2022). The size, surface charge, and lipid composition of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be tailored to enhance drug stability, prolong circulation time, and improve biocompatibility (Guimar\u00e3es et al., 2021). Furthermore, conjugating small-molecule ligands, peptides (Thorley et al., 2013), or monoclonal antibodies (Pohlit et al., 2017) to the surface of an LNP can endow it with targeting ability. For example, folate receptors are often found to be overexpressed on macrophages, which makes folate-coupled LNP a great option for delivering antiinflammatory drugs (Kularatne et al., 2010)."

Traditional pharmacotherapeutic treatment approaches (i.e., bronchodilators, corticosteroids, chemotherapeutics, peptide-based agents, etc.) are not satisfactory to cure or impede diseases. With the advent of nanotechnology, drug delivery to an intended site is still difficult, but the nanoparticle's physicochemical properties can accomplish targeted therapeutic delivery. Based on their surface, size, density, and physical-chemical properties, nanoparticles have demonstrated enhanced pharmacokinetics of actives, achieving the spotlight in the drug delivery research field. In this review, the authors have highlighted different nanoparticle-based therapeutic delivery approaches to treat chronic pulmonary diseases along with the preparation techniques. The authors have remarked the nanosuspension delivery via nebulization and dry powder carrier is further effective in the lung delivery system since the particles released from these systems are innumerable to composite nanoparticles. The authors have also outlined the inhaled particle's toxicity, patented nanoparticle-based pulmonary formulations, and commercial pulmonary drug delivery devices (PDD) in other sections. Recently advanced formulations employing nanoparticles as therapeutic carriers for the efficient treatment of chronic pulmonary diseases are also canvassed."

                            "Nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis and therapy. Advances in protein engineering and materials science have contributed to novel nanoscale targeting approaches that may bring new hope to cancer patients. Several therapeutic nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use. However, to date, there are only a few clinically approved nanocarriers that incorporate molecules to selectively bind and target cancer cells. This review examines some of the approved formulations and discusses the challenges in translating basic research to the clinic. We detail the arsenal of nanocarriers and molecules available for selective tumour targeting, and emphasize the challenges in cancer treatment. Cancer remains one of the world's most devastating diseases, with more than 10 million new cases every year 1. However, mortality has decreased in the past two years 2 owing to better understanding of tumour biology and improved diagnostic devices and treatments. Current cancer treatments include surgical intervention, radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, which often also kill healthy cells and cause toxicity to the patient. It would therefore be desirable to develop chemotherapeutics that can either passively or actively target cancerous cells. Passive targeting exploits the characteristic features of tumour biology that allow nanocarriers to accumulate in the tumour by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect 2. Passively targeting nanocarriers first reached clinical trials in the mid-1980s, and the first products, based on liposomes and polymer\u2013protein conjugates, were marketed in the mid-1990s. Later, therapeutic nanocarriers based on this strategy were approved for wider use (Table 1) and methods of further enhancing targeting of drugs to cancer cells were investigated. Active approaches achieve this by conjugating nanocarriers containing chemotherapeutics with molecules that bind to overexpressed antigens or receptors on the target cells. Recent reviews provide perspective on the use of nanotechnology as a fundamental tool in cancer research and nanomedicine 3,4. Here we focus on the potential of nanocarriers and molecules that can selectively target tumours, and highlight the challenges in translating some of the basic research to the clinic. PaSSive anD aCtive targeting Nanocarriers encounter numerous barriers en route to their target, such as mucosal barriers and non-specific uptake 5,6. To address the challenges of targeting tumours with nanotechnology, it is necessary to combine the rational design of nanocarriers with the fundamental understanding of tumour biology (Box 1). General features of tumours include leaky blood vessels and poor lymphatic drainage. Whereas free drugs may diffuse non-specifically, a nanocarrier can \u2026"

Their primary advantage is the improvement of the bioavailability of drugs, specifically lipophilic molecules that can be better solubilized in the lipid core than in aqueous environments. The lipophilic core of lipid nanoparticles entraps active ingredients, while the surfactant membrane, generally consisting solely or partially of phospholipids, ensures the stability of LNP in hydrophilic environment. LNP are particularly well suited for transdermal drug delivery. Indeed, lipid nanoparticles are known to create a mono-layer film on the skin, limiting water evaporation and improving skin hydration (Wissing et al., 2001)",

                            "When nanoparticles (NPs) enter a physiological environment, medium components compete for binding to the NP surface leading to formation of a rich protein shell known as the \"protein corona\". Unfortunately, opsonins are also adsorbed. These proteins are immediately recognized by the phagocyte system with rapid clearance of the NPs from the bloodstream. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating of NPs (PEGylation) is the most efficient anti-opsonization strategy. Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages. However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system. To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains. Nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis allowed us to accurately determine the corona composition showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins. Due to the abundance of apolipoproteins, we exploited the \"protein corona effect\" to deliver cationic liposome-human plasma complexes to human prostate cancer PC3 cells that express a high level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in order to evaluate the cellular uptake efficiency of the systems used. Combining laser scanning confocal microscopy with flow cytometry analysis in PC3 cells we demonstrated that MC-PEG2k is the best compromise between an anti-opsonization strategy and active targeting and could be a promising candidate to treat prostate cancer in vivo."

Compared to liposomes, LNPs provide higher drug loading capacity and better physical stability due to their solid or semi-solid lipid cores, which allow drugs to be more effectively embedded, enhancing drug stability and loading efficiency (Sent\u00ed et al., 2024). Additionally, the surface of LNPs can be modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or other hydrophobic molecules to extend their circulation time in the blood and reduce the likelihood of clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (Huang et al., 2023). LNPs also offer significant advantages in targeted delivery and localized release. By modifying the surface with targeting ligands, LNPs can specifically target tumor cells or particular molecules within the tumor microenvironment, enabling precise drug delivery. In the context of mRNA vaccine delivery, LNPs protect mRNA from degradation by nucleases within the body and facilitate its effective entry into target cells (Cheng et al., 2020)(Kim et al., 2024). The successful application of LNPs in CRISPR-Cas9 has further validated their potential in nucleic acid drug delivery, laying a foundation for their use in cancer immunotherapy (Rosenblum et al., 2020)."

In addition to the above mentioned concerns of CNTs and metallic NPs, it has been observed that metallo-supramolecular polymers, that can provide the functionality of the metal ion along with the processability of a polymer have some limitations when used in drug delivery processes. For example, the introduction of metal ions in the body can disturb the ion balance and limit certain medical applications (Rowan and Beck, 2005), (Dong et al., 2015). Furthermore, dendritic polymers exhibit many drawbacks which limit their usage in theranostic applications, for instance, several complex and highly expensive synthetic and purification procedures can lead to imprecise or nonspecific structures with low quantifiability. Moreover, these polymers show poor reproducibility and certain biosafety concerns due to their possible toxicity and unexpected removal, which restrict their clinical translation (Jain et al., 2010), (Shcharbin et al., 2014). The development of LNPs paves the way for resolving above stated limitations.\n\nAdvantages of LNPs may include: (1) ease of engineering processes, (2) up-scaling feasibility, (3) excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, (4) negligible toxicity, (5) controlled and targeted drug release potential, (6) improved drug solubility and stability, (7) enhanced bioavailability, (8) potential of encapsulating both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, (9) less expensive, (10) encapsulation of high drug content, (11) potential to cross various physiological barriers, (12) easy validation, and many others which could be favorable for specific delivery route or nature of the payload (Ghasemiyeh and Mohammadi-Samani, 2018), (Attama et al., 2012)."

Lipid-based nanoparticles offer a diverse range of options for drug delivery. Each type exhibits unique properties that can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of the therapeutic cargo. Factors such as the nature of the cargo, desired release kinetics, and the targeted delivery site play crucial roles in selecting the appropriate lipid-based nanoparticles. Ongoing research and development in this field hold immense promise for advancing drug delivery strategies and improving therapeutic outcomes",

Furthermore, LNPs can easily fulfill three requirements for nucleic acid delivery vehicles: efficient encapsulation to resist degradation by nucleases, a mechanism for targeted delivery and intracellular entry, and a manufacturing process that allows for the mass production of uniformly sized nanoparticles (2017). The cargo content and physicochemical properties (particle size, shape, surface charge, etc.) of LNPs can be controlled by adjusting the lipid composition (Baran-Rachwalska et al., 2020)."

However, it is currently impossible to rationally design nanoparticles that selectively target specific tissues. Here, we report a strategy termed selective organ targeting (SORT) wherein multiple classes of lipid nanoparticles are systematically engineered to exclusively edit extrahepatic tissues via addition of a supplemental SORT molecule. Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes. SORT is compatible with multiple gene editing techniques, including mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/single guide RNA and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and is envisioned to aid the development of protein replacement and gene correction therapeutics in targeted tissues. The addition of selective organ targeting molecules to nanoparticles allows the specific targeting of extrahepatic tissues, enabling gene editing of distinct cell populations outside the liver."

                            "delivery of nucleic acids into cells makes them superior to other carriers. Since biological membranes and nucleic acids are negatively charged, it is difficult to deliver mRNA across this barrier. LNPs offer an ideal platform for delivering nucleic acid therapies as the ionizable lipids are nearneutrally charged at physiological pH. However, in acidic endosomal compartments (pH-4.5), they become ionized, promoting endosomal escape for effective intracellular delivery (Reichmuth et al., 2016)(Hajj et al., 2017). Hence, LNPs achieve high encapsulation rate for nucleic acids with improved transfection efficiency. Furthermore, LNPs have relatively low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity compared to liposomes, thus favoring delivery of nucleic acid based therapeutics (Cullis et al., 2017)(Uchida et al., 2020)(Billingsley et al., 2020)",
                            "In terms of industrial scale up, LNPs offer multiple advantages compared with other carrier systems, such as large scale production using microfluidics or T-junction mixing, stability, and low cost of raw materials [52](Elia et al., 2021)(Buschmann et al., 2021)",
                            "In a nutshell, the most fundamental rationale of using LNPs, as an alternative to polymeric nanoparticles, is the simplicity of largescale manufacturing and their low toxicity (Wang et al., 2016)(Constantinides, 1995)."

                            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causal agent of COVID-19 and stands at the center of the current global human pandemic, with death toll exceeding one million. The urgent need for a vaccine has led to the development of various immunization approaches. mRNA vaccines represent a cell-free, simple, and rapid platform for immunization, and therefore have been employed in recent studies toward the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Herein, we present the design of an mRNA vaccine, based on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)-encapsulated SARS-CoV-2 human Fc-conjugated receptor-binding domain (RBD-hFc). Several ionizable lipids have been evaluated in vivo in a luciferase (luc) mRNA reporter assay, and two leading LNPs formulations have been chosen for the subsequent RBD-hFc mRNA vaccine strategy. Intramuscular administration of LNP RBD-hFc mRNA elicited robust humoral response, a high level of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased cellular response in BALB/c mice. The data in the current study demonstrate the potential of these lipids as promising candidates for LNP-based mRNA vaccines in general and for a COVID19 vaccine in particular."

Lipid-based nanoparticles offer a diverse range of options for drug delivery. Each type exhibits unique properties that can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of the therapeutic cargo. Factors such as the nature of the cargo, desired release kinetics, and the targeted delivery site play crucial roles in selecting the appropriate lipid-based nanoparticles. Ongoing research and development in this field hold immense promise for advancing drug delivery strategies and improving therapeutic outcomes",

Furthermore, LNPs can easily fulfill three requirements for nucleic acid delivery vehicles: efficient encapsulation to resist degradation by nucleases, a mechanism for targeted delivery and intracellular entry, and a manufacturing process that allows for the mass production of uniformly sized nanoparticles (2017). The cargo content and physicochemical properties (particle size, shape, surface charge, etc.) of LNPs can be controlled by adjusting the lipid composition (Baran-Rachwalska et al., 2020)."

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged across the pharmaceutical industry as promising vehicles to deliver a variety of therapeutics. Currently in the spotlight as vital components of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, LNPs play a key role in effectively protecting and transporting mRNA to cells. Liposomes, an early version of LNPs, are a versatile nanomedicine delivery platform. A number of liposomal drugs have been approved and applied to medical practice. Subsequent generations of lipid nanocarriers, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, exhibit more complex architectures and enhanced physical stabilities. With their ability to encapsulate and deliver therapeutics to specific locations within the body and to release their contents at a desired time, LNPs provide a valuable platform for treatment of a variety of diseases. Here, we present a landscape of LNP-related scientific publications, including patents and journal articles, based on analysis of the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific knowledge. Rising trends are identified, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and solid lipid nanoparticles becoming the preferred platforms for numerous formulations. Recent advancements in LNP formulations as drug delivery platforms, such as antitumor and nucleic acid therapeutics and vaccine delivery systems, are discussed. Challenges and growth opportunities are also evaluated in other areas, such as medical imaging, cosmetics, nutrition, and agrochemicals. This report is intended to serve as a useful resource for those interested in LNP nanotechnologies, their applications, and the global research effort for their development."

                            "Nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis and therapy. Advances in protein engineering and materials science have contributed to novel nanoscale targeting approaches that may bring new hope to cancer patients. Several therapeutic nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use. However, to date, there are only a few clinically approved nanocarriers that incorporate molecules to selectively bind and target cancer cells. This review examines some of the approved formulations and discusses the challenges in translating basic research to the clinic. We detail the arsenal of nanocarriers and molecules available for selective tumour targeting, and emphasize the challenges in cancer treatment. Cancer remains one of the world's most devastating diseases, with more than 10 million new cases every year 1. However, mortality has decreased in the past two years 2 owing to better understanding of tumour biology and improved diagnostic devices and treatments. Current cancer treatments include surgical intervention, radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, which often also kill healthy cells and cause toxicity to the patient. It would therefore be desirable to develop chemotherapeutics that can either passively or actively target cancerous cells. Passive targeting exploits the characteristic features of tumour biology that allow nanocarriers to accumulate in the tumour by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect 2. Passively targeting nanocarriers first reached clinical trials in the mid-1980s, and the first products, based on liposomes and polymer\u2013protein conjugates, were marketed in the mid-1990s. Later, therapeutic nanocarriers based on this strategy were approved for wider use (Table 1) and methods of further enhancing targeting of drugs to cancer cells were investigated. Active approaches achieve this by conjugating nanocarriers containing chemotherapeutics with molecules that bind to overexpressed antigens or receptors on the target cells. Recent reviews provide perspective on the use of nanotechnology as a fundamental tool in cancer research and nanomedicine 3,4. Here we focus on the potential of nanocarriers and molecules that can selectively target tumours, and highlight the challenges in translating some of the basic research to the clinic. PaSSive anD aCtive targeting Nanocarriers encounter numerous barriers en route to their target, such as mucosal barriers and non-specific uptake 5,6. To address the challenges of targeting tumours with nanotechnology, it is necessary to combine the rational design of nanocarriers with the fundamental understanding of tumour biology (Box 1). General features of tumours include leaky blood vessels and poor lymphatic drainage. Whereas free drugs may diffuse non-specifically, a nanocarrier can \u2026"

                            "This structure grants LNPs excellent drug loading capacity and stability (Zong et al., 2023). Compared to liposomes, LNPs provide higher drug loading capacity and better physical stability due to their solid or semi-solid lipid cores, which allow drugs to be more effectively embedded, enhancing drug stability and loading efficiency (Sent\u00ed et al., 2024). Additionally, the surface of LNPs can be modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or other hydrophobic molecules to extend their circulation time in the blood and reduce the likelihood of clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (Huang et al., 2023). LNPs also offer significant advantages in targeted delivery and localized release. By modifying the surface with targeting ligands, LNPs can specifically target tumor cells or particular molecules within the tumor microenvironment, enabling precise drug delivery. In the context of mRNA vaccine delivery, LNPs protect mRNA from degradation by nucleases within the body and facilitate its effective entry into target cells (Cheng et al., 2020)(Kim et al., 2024). The successful application of LNPs in CRISPR-Cas9 has further validated their potential in nucleic acid drug delivery, laying a foundation for their use in cancer immunotherapy (Rosenblum et al., 2020)."

Efficient delivery of mRNA vaccines will be key for their success and translation to the clinic. Among potential nonviral vectors, lipid nanoparticles are particularly promising.

                            "delivery of nucleic acids into cells makes them superior to other carriers. Since biological membranes and nucleic acids are negatively charged, it is difficult to deliver mRNA across this barrier. LNPs offer an ideal platform for delivering nucleic acid therapies as the ionizable lipids are nearneutrally charged at physiological pH. However, in acidic endosomal compartments (pH-4.5), they become ionized, promoting endosomal escape for effective intracellular delivery (Reichmuth et al., 2016)(Hajj et al., 2017). Hence, LNPs achieve high encapsulation rate for nucleic acids with improved transfection efficiency. Furthermore, LNPs have relatively low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity compared to liposomes, thus favoring delivery of nucleic acid based therapeutics (Cullis et al., 2017)(Uchida et al., 2020)(Billingsley et al., 2020)",
                            "In terms of industrial scale up, LNPs offer multiple advantages compared with other carrier systems, such as large scale production using microfluidics or T-junction mixing, stability, and low cost of raw materials [52](Elia et al., 2021)(Buschmann et al., 2021)",
                            "In a nutshell, the most fundamental rationale of using LNPs, as an alternative to polymeric nanoparticles, is the simplicity of largescale manufacturing and their low toxicity (Wang et al., 2016)(Constantinides, 1995)."

                            "CAR T cell therapy relies on the ex vivo manipulation of patient T cells to create a potent, cancer-targeting therapy, shown to be capable of inducing remission in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and large B cell lymphoma. However, current CAR T cell engineering methods use viral delivery, which induces permanent CAR expression that leads to severe adverse effects. mRNA has been explored as a promising strategy for inducing transient CAR expression in T cells to mitigate the adverse effects associated with viral expression, but it most commonly requires electroporation for T cell transfection which can be cytotoxic. Here, ionizable lipids nanoparticles (LNPs) were designed for ex vivo mRNA delivery to human T cells. A library of 24 ionizable lipids was synthesized, formulated into LNPs, and screened for luciferase mRNA delivery to Jurkat cells, revealing seven formulations capable of enhanced mRNA delivery over lipofectamine. The top-performing LNP formulation, C14-4, was selected for CAR mRNA delivery to primary human T cells. This platform induced CAR expression equivalent to electroporation with substantially improved cytotoxicity. CAR T cells engineered via C14-4 LNP treatment were then compared to electroporated CAR T cells in a co-culture assay with Nalm-6 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, and we show that both CAR T cell engineering methods elicit potent cancer killing activity. These results demonstrate the ability of ionizable LNPs to deliver mRNA to primary human T cells for functional protein expression and indicate the potential of LNPs to enhance mRNA-based CAR T cell engineering methods."

This biocompatibility minimizes the risk of adverse immune reactions and toxicity, making them ideal for clinical applications. \n\nVersatility in drug delivery: LNPs can encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic agents, including chemotherapeutics, nucleic acids (such as siRNA and mRNA), and proteins. This versatility allows for the targeted delivery of these agents to cancer cells, improving therapeutic outcomes while reducing systemic side effects. \n\nEnhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect: LNPs benefit from the EPR effect, which facilitates their accumulation in tumor tissues due to the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage of tumours. This property enhances the concentration of therapeutic agents at the tumor site, improving treatment efficacy."

Their primary advantage is the improvement of the bioavailability of drugs, specifically lipophilic molecules that can be better solubilized in the lipid core than in aqueous environments. The lipophilic core of lipid nanoparticles entraps active ingredients, while the surfactant membrane, generally consisting solely or partially of phospholipids, ensures the stability of LNP in hydrophilic environment. LNP are particularly well suited for transdermal drug delivery. Indeed, lipid nanoparticles are known to create a mono-layer film on the skin, limiting water evaporation and improving skin hydration (Wissing et al., 2001)",

                            "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged across the pharmaceutical industry as promising vehicles to deliver a variety of therapeutics. Currently in the spotlight as vital components of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, LNPs play a key role in effectively protecting and transporting mRNA to cells. Liposomes, an early version of LNPs, are a versatile nanomedicine delivery platform. A number of liposomal drugs have been approved and applied to medical practice. Subsequent generations of lipid nanocarriers, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, exhibit more complex architectures and enhanced physical stabilities. With their ability to encapsulate and deliver therapeutics to specific locations within the body and to release their contents at a desired time, LNPs provide a valuable platform for treatment of a variety of diseases. Here, we present a landscape of LNP-related scientific publications, including patents and journal articles, based on analysis of the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific knowledge. Rising trends are identified, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and solid lipid nanoparticles becoming the preferred platforms for numerous formulations. Recent advancements in LNP formulations as drug delivery platforms, such as antitumor and nucleic acid therapeutics and vaccine delivery systems, are discussed. Challenges and growth opportunities are also evaluated in other areas, such as medical imaging, cosmetics, nutrition, and agrochemicals. This report is intended to serve as a useful resource for those interested in LNP nanotechnologies, their applications, and the global research effort for their development."

                            "When nanoparticles (NPs) enter a physiological environment, medium components compete for binding to the NP surface leading to formation of a rich protein shell known as the \"protein corona\". Unfortunately, opsonins are also adsorbed. These proteins are immediately recognized by the phagocyte system with rapid clearance of the NPs from the bloodstream. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating of NPs (PEGylation) is the most efficient anti-opsonization strategy. Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages. However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system. To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains. Nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis allowed us to accurately determine the corona composition showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins. Due to the abundance of apolipoproteins, we exploited the \"protein corona effect\" to deliver cationic liposome-human plasma complexes to human prostate cancer PC3 cells that express a high level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in order to evaluate the cellular uptake efficiency of the systems used. Combining laser scanning confocal microscopy with flow cytometry analysis in PC3 cells we demonstrated that MC-PEG2k is the best compromise between an anti-opsonization strategy and active targeting and could be a promising candidate to treat prostate cancer in vivo."

                            "The development of efficient gene delivery systems targeting the lung endothelium remains a serious challenge. This study reports on the design and optimization of a multifunctional envelope\u2010type nanodevice (MEND) for an efficient siRNA delivery to the lung endothelium based on GALA\u2010peptide targeting ability. The incorporation of a pH\u2010sensitive lipid (YSK05) results in a dramatic improvement in silencing efficiency by enhancing endosomal escape, but this also causes a reduction in the lung selectivity. Contrary to the assumption that active targeting is largely dependent on the presence of a targeting ligand, the findings of the present study indicate that nanocarrier composition is critical for achieving the organ selectivity. Interestingly, helper lipids substantially mask the liver delivery resulting in optimum lung targeting. The optimized YSK05\u2010MEND is 40\u2010fold more efficient than a previously developed MEND, with a robust lung endothelium gene knockdown at small doses. The YSK05\u2010MEND strongly inhibits a metastatic lung cancer model and exerts superior control over lung metastasis compared to chemotherapy or the previously developed MEND. The YSK05\u2010MEND is well\u2010tolerated in mice after acute or chronic administration. As far as it is known, YSK05\u2010MEND achieves the most efficient lung endothelium gene silencing reported thus far with a median effective dose of 0.01 mg siRNA kg\u22121 while minimally affecting the endothelium of other organs."

                            "DNA damage repair through the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway is one of the major reasons for the decreased antitumor efficacy of platinum-based anticancer drugs that have been widely applied in the clinic. Inhibiting the intrinsic NER function may enhance the antitumor activity of cisplatin and conquer cisplatin resistance. Herein, we report the design, optimization, and application of a self-assembled lipid nanoparticle (LNP) system to simultaneously deliver a cisplatin prodrug together with siRNA targeting endonuclease xeroderma pigmentosum group F (XPF), a crucial component in the NER pathway. The LNP is able to efficiently encapsulate both the platinum prodrug and siRNA molecules with a tuned ratio. Both platinum prodrug and XPF-targeted siRNA are efficiently carried into cells and released; the former damages DNA and the latter specifically downregulates both mRNA and protein levels of XPF to potentiate the platinum drug, leading to enhanced expression levels of apoptosis markers and improved cytotoxicity in both cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant human lung cancer cells. Our results demonstrate an effective approach to utilize a multi-targeted nanoparticle system that can specifically silence an NER-related gene to promote apoptosis induced by cisplatin, especially in cisplatin-refractory tumors."

                            "mRNA vaccines have become a promising platform for cancer immunotherapy. During vaccination, naked or vehicle loaded mRNA vaccines efficiently express tumor antigens in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), facilitate APC activation and innate/adaptive immune stimulation. mRNA cancer vaccine precedes other conventional vaccine platforms due to high potency, safe administration, rapid development potentials, and cost-effective manufacturing. However, mRNA vaccine applications have been limited by instability, innate immunogenicity, and inefficient in vivo delivery. Appropriate mRNA structure modifications (i.e., codon optimizations, nucleotide modifications, self-amplifying mRNAs, etc.) and formulation methods (i.e., lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymers, peptides, etc.) have been investigated to overcome these issues. Tuning the administration routes and co-delivery of multiple mRNA vaccines with other immunotherapeutic agents (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors) have further boosted the host anti-tumor immunity and increased the likelihood of tumor cell eradication. With the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of LNP-loaded mRNA vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 and the promising therapeutic outcomes of mRNA cancer vaccines achieved in several clinical trials against multiple aggressive solid tumors, we envision the rapid advancing of mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy in the near future. This review provides a detailed overview of the recent progress and existing challenges of mRNA cancer vaccines and future considerations of applying mRNA vaccine for cancer immunotherapies."

                            "Lipid nanocarriers have emerged across the pharmaceutical industry as versatile nanomedicine delivery platforms. Their success is attributable to the relative ease of production and scale-up, reduced immune responses, multidose capability, extensive and stable drug loading, and design flexibility. In a highly versatile platform, LNPs have been employed in drug delivery, including nucleic acid-based drugs, and are currently in the spotlight as the lead clinical nonviral delivery system with extensive clinical trials and testing in humans.\n\nUsing LNPs as a delivery vehicle has other benefits, such as target-specific delivery (by introducing targeting ligands on NP surfaces), endosomal escape (by destabilizing the endosomal membrane or enhancing fusion to the endosomal membrane through modifying the lipid compositions), high gene knockout efficiency, suitable drug release, and bypassing extracellular nuclease degradation.

Their versatile nature enables the encapsulation and targeting of various types of medically relevant molecular cargo, including oligonucleotides, proteins, and small molecules for the treatment of diseases, such as cancer. Cancers that form solid tumors are particularly relevant for LNP\u2010based therapeutics due to the enhanced permeation and retention effect that allows nanoparticles to accumulate within the tumor tissue. Additionally, LNPs can be formulated for both locoregional and systemic delivery depending on the tumor type and stage. To date, LNPs have been used extensively in the clinic to reduce systemic toxicity and improve outcomes in cancer patients by encapsulating chemotherapeutic drugs. Next\u2010generation lipid nanoparticles are currently being developed to expand their use in gene therapy and immunotherapy, as well as to enable the co\u2010encapsulation of multiple drugs in a single system. Other developments include the design of targeted LNPs to specific cells and tissues, and triggerable release systems to control cargo delivery at the tumor site.

                            "One application that has received substantial attention recently is the delivery of nucleic acids for therapeutics and vaccines. Most notably, the rapid and successful deployment of the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna represented a turning point for drug delivery (Baden et al., 2020)(Polack et al., 2020) . These vaccines rely on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery system to shuttle mRNA past multiple biological barriers that would otherwise prevent efficacy. With over a billion doses of mRNA-LNP vaccines administered globally, LNPs for nucleic acid delivery represent one of the most widely used drug products in history. Additionally, LNPs as delivery platforms have been leveraged in multiple clinical trials for applications such as vaccination, protein replacement therapy, cancer immunotherapy, RNA interference and gene editing (Hou et al., 2021) . LNPs feature high potency, biocompatibility and the ability to be administered repeatedly, all of which are properties that favour clinical translation (Hou et al., 2021) ."

                            "Abstract Background Vaccines are needed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to protect persons who are at high risk for complications. The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle\u2013encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19. Methods This phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 99 centers across the United States. Persons at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or its complications were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular injections of mRNA-1273 (100 \u03bcg) or placebo 28 days apart. The primary end point was prevention of Covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Results The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic, virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the mRNA-1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001). Efficacy was similar across key secondary analyses, including assessment 14 days after the first dose, analyses that included participants who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, and analyses in participants 65 years of age or older. Severe Covid-19 occurred in 30 participants, with one fatality; all 30 were in the placebo group. Moderate, transient reactogenicity after vaccination occurred more frequently in the mRNA-1273 group. Serious adverse events were rare, and the incidence was similar in the two groups. Conclusions The mRNA-1273 vaccine showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing Covid-19 illness, including severe disease. Aside from transient local and systemic reactions, no safety concerns were identified.

                            "Abstract Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. Methods In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 \u03bcg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle\u2013formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety. Results A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. Conclusions A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines.

They comprise lipids that can self-assemble into nanoparticles, encapsulating mRNA within their lipid bilayers. LNPs can protect mRNA from enzymatic degradation, facilitate cellular uptake through endocytosis, and promote endosomal escape, allowing mRNA to reach the cytoplasm, where it can be translated into protein. LNPs have been successfully used for the delivery of mRNA in mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases such as COVID-19, as well as for mRNA-based gene therapies for genetic disorders."

                            "The induction of a strong cytotoxic T cell response is an important prerequisite for successful immunotherapy against many viral diseases and tumors. Nucleotide vaccines, including mRNA vaccines with their intracellular antigen synthesis, have been shown to be potent activators of a cytotoxic immune response. The intracellular delivery of mRNA vaccines to the cytosol of antigen presenting immune cells is still not sufficiently well understood. Here, we report on the development of a lipid nanoparticle formulation for the delivery of mRNA vaccines to induce a cytotoxic CD 8 T cell response. We show transfection of dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. The efficacy of the vaccine was tested in an aggressive B16F10 melanoma model. We found a strong CD 8 T cell activation after a single immunization. Treatment of B16F10 melanoma tumors with lipid nanoparticles containing mRNA coding for the tumor-associated antigens gp100 and TRP2 resulted in tumor shrinkage and extended the overall survival of the treated mice. The immune response can be further increased by the incorporation of the adjuvant LPS. In conclusion, the lipid nanoparticle formulation presented here is a promising vector for mRNA vaccine delivery, one that is capable of inducing a strong cytotoxic T cell response. Further optimization, including the incorporation of different adjuvants, will likely enhance the potency of the vaccine."

                            "mRNA vaccines have become a promising platform for cancer immunotherapy. During vaccination, naked or vehicle loaded mRNA vaccines efficiently express tumor antigens in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), facilitate APC activation and innate/adaptive immune stimulation. mRNA cancer vaccine precedes other conventional vaccine platforms due to high potency, safe administration, rapid development potentials, and cost-effective manufacturing. However, mRNA vaccine applications have been limited by instability, innate immunogenicity, and inefficient in vivo delivery. Appropriate mRNA structure modifications (i.e., codon optimizations, nucleotide modifications, self-amplifying mRNAs, etc.) and formulation methods (i.e., lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymers, peptides, etc.) have been investigated to overcome these issues. Tuning the administration routes and co-delivery of multiple mRNA vaccines with other immunotherapeutic agents (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors) have further boosted the host anti-tumor immunity and increased the likelihood of tumor cell eradication. With the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of LNP-loaded mRNA vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 and the promising therapeutic outcomes of mRNA cancer vaccines achieved in several clinical trials against multiple aggressive solid tumors, we envision the rapid advancing of mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy in the near future. This review provides a detailed overview of the recent progress and existing challenges of mRNA cancer vaccines and future considerations of applying mRNA vaccine for cancer immunotherapies."

                            "The development of efficient gene delivery systems targeting the lung endothelium remains a serious challenge. This study reports on the design and optimization of a multifunctional envelope\u2010type nanodevice (MEND) for an efficient siRNA delivery to the lung endothelium based on GALA\u2010peptide targeting ability. The incorporation of a pH\u2010sensitive lipid (YSK05) results in a dramatic improvement in silencing efficiency by enhancing endosomal escape, but this also causes a reduction in the lung selectivity. Contrary to the assumption that active targeting is largely dependent on the presence of a targeting ligand, the findings of the present study indicate that nanocarrier composition is critical for achieving the organ selectivity. Interestingly, helper lipids substantially mask the liver delivery resulting in optimum lung targeting. The optimized YSK05\u2010MEND is 40\u2010fold more efficient than a previously developed MEND, with a robust lung endothelium gene knockdown at small doses. The YSK05\u2010MEND strongly inhibits a metastatic lung cancer model and exerts superior control over lung metastasis compared to chemotherapy or the previously developed MEND. The YSK05\u2010MEND is well\u2010tolerated in mice after acute or chronic administration. As far as it is known, YSK05\u2010MEND achieves the most efficient lung endothelium gene silencing reported thus far with a median effective dose of 0.01 mg siRNA kg\u22121 while minimally affecting the endothelium of other organs."

                            "DNA damage repair through the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway is one of the major reasons for the decreased antitumor efficacy of platinum-based anticancer drugs that have been widely applied in the clinic. Inhibiting the intrinsic NER function may enhance the antitumor activity of cisplatin and conquer cisplatin resistance. Herein, we report the design, optimization, and application of a self-assembled lipid nanoparticle (LNP) system to simultaneously deliver a cisplatin prodrug together with siRNA targeting endonuclease xeroderma pigmentosum group F (XPF), a crucial component in the NER pathway. The LNP is able to efficiently encapsulate both the platinum prodrug and siRNA molecules with a tuned ratio. Both platinum prodrug and XPF-targeted siRNA are efficiently carried into cells and released; the former damages DNA and the latter specifically downregulates both mRNA and protein levels of XPF to potentiate the platinum drug, leading to enhanced expression levels of apoptosis markers and improved cytotoxicity in both cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant human lung cancer cells. Our results demonstrate an effective approach to utilize a multi-targeted nanoparticle system that can specifically silence an NER-related gene to promote apoptosis induced by cisplatin, especially in cisplatin-refractory tumors."

                            "Cancer remains a serious health concern worldwide, and different approaches are being developed for its treatment. The strategy to use the immune system as an approach for treating cancer has recently gained momentum. Messenger RNA (mRNA) has been assessed as an up-and-coming resource for the evolution of advanced cancer immunotherapies over the past decades. However, degradation in extracellular compartments and during endosomal escape remain obstacles for efficient mRNA delivery and limit the therapeutic applications of this approach. Lipid-based nanocarriers are gaining significant attention as non-viral mRNA vectors. Various lipid-based nanocarrier types have been developed to enhance the stability of mRNA molecules, facilitate their transfection, and ensure delivery to an intracellular compartment suitable for further processing. This review discusses the development of novel mRNA delivery systems using lipids for effective cancer immunotherapy. mRNAs are superior to other biomolecules for developing therapeutic drugs and vaccines with multiple medical applications that are currently being explored by researchers in various biomedical fields. Lipid-based mRNA nanoparticles can improve the potency of the mRNA by enhancing its stability, enabling its cellular uptake, and facilitating its endosomal escape. Targetability of these therapeutics can be increased by conjugating their surface with the desired ligands or targeting agents. Lipid\u2013mRNA nanoparticles are increasingly being incorporated in cancer immunotherapy applications, including vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell treatment, and several such nanoparticles are being assessed in clinical trials. Further research that assesses key variables for transfection efficiency of lipid\u2013mRNA nanoparticles will expedite the development of improved therapeutics."

                            "Non-viral delivery of nucleic acids for therapies based on RNA interference requires a rational design and optimal self-assembly strategies. Nucleic acid particles need to be small, stable and functional in terms of selective cell uptake and controlled release of encapsulated nucleic acids. Here we report on small (\u223c38 nm) monomolecular nucleic acid/lipid particles (mNALPs) that contain single molecules of short double-stranded oligonucleotides covered by a tight, highly curved lipid bilayer. The particles consist of DOPE, DOTAP, DOPC and DSPE-PEG(2000) and are assembled with 21 bp double-stranded DNA or small interfering RNA by solvent exchange on a hydrodynamic-focusing microfluidic chip. In comparison to vortex mixing by hand this method increases the encapsulation efficiency by 20%, and yields particles with a narrower size distribution, negligible aggregate formation and high stability in blood plasma and serum. Modification of mNALPs with folate-conjugated PEG-lipids results in specific binding and uptake by epithelial carcinoma KB cells overexpressing folate receptors. Binding is significantly reduced by competitive inhibition using free folate and is not observed with non-targeted mNALPs, revealing high specificity. The functionalized mNALPs show gene silencing in the presence of chloroquine, an endosome-destabilizing agent. Together, the robust self-assembly of small-sized mNALPs with their high stability and receptor-specific cell uptake demonstrate that the tight, PEG-grafted lipid-bilayer encapsulation may offer a promising approach towards the delivery of short double-stranded oligonucleotides."

From small molecules to ASO, siRNA, mRNA, plasmid DNA, and gene editing, LNPs are being extensively explored for potentially all types of drug cargo. Such medical interventions were thought to be difficult to implement owing to the lack of suitable delivery mechanisms; however, LNPs have provided a big boost to the investigation of all gene therapies, paving the way for the application of precision/personalized medicine much sooner than expected. Many difficult-to-treat health conditions such as oncology, protein replacement, gene silencing, and chronic diseases are now slowly becoming more easily treatable with the advances in this field. Efficient tissue targeting will add more fuel and rigor to the advancements and even gene therapies accessible by ex vivo modulating cells could potentially be replaced by targeting-enabled LNPs and their corresponding nano-delivery systems. It may also prove to be a very handy platform for image diagnostics applications."

Treatment strategies for glioblastoma are majorly comprised of surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy along with combination therapy. Treatment of GBM is itself a tedious task but the involved barriers in GBM are one of the main impediments to move one step closer to the treatment of GBM. Basically, two of the barriers are of utmost importance in this regard, namely blood brain barrier (BBB) and blood brain tumor barrier (BBTB). This review will address different challenges and barriers in the treatment of GBM along with their etiology. The role and recent progress of lipid-based nanocarriers like liposomes, solid lipid nanocarriers (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), lipoplexes, and lipid hybrid carriers in the effective management of GBM will be discussed in detail.

                            "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and malignant neoplasia having origin in the brain. The current treatments involve surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, being complete surgical resection the best option for the patient survival chances. However, in those cases where a complete removal is not possible, radiation and chemotherapy are applied. Herein, the main challenges of chemotherapy, and how they can be overcome with the help of nanomedicine, are approached. Natural pathways to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) are detailed, and different in vivo studies where these pathways are mimicked functionalizing the nanomaterial surface are shown. Later, lipid-based nanocarriers, such as liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers, are presented. To finish, recent studies that have used lipid-based nanosystems carrying not only therapeutic agents, yet also magnetic nanoparticles, are described. Although the advantages of using these types of nanosystems are explained, including their biocompatibility, the possibility of modifying their surface to enhance the cell targeting, and their intrinsic ability of BBB crossing, it is important to mention that research in this field is still at its early stage, and extensive preclinical and clinical investigations are mandatory in the close future."

                            "Messenger RNA (mRNA) has emerged as a new category of therapeutic agent to prevent and treat various diseases. To function in vivo, mRNA requires safe, effective and stable delivery systems that protect the nucleic acid from degradation and that allow cellular uptake and mRNA release. Lipid nanoparticles have successfully entered the clinic for the delivery of mRNA; in particular, lipid nanoparticle\u2013mRNA vaccines are now in clinical use against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which marks a milestone for mRNA therapeutics. In this Review, we discuss the design of lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery and examine physiological barriers and possible administration routes for lipid nanoparticle\u2013mRNA systems. We then consider key points for the clinical translation of lipid nanoparticle\u2013mRNA formulations, including good manufacturing practice, stability, storage and safety, and highlight preclinical and clinical studies of lipid nanoparticle\u2013mRNA therapeutics for infectious diseases, cancer and genetic disorders. Finally, we give an outlook to future possibilities and remaining challenges for this promising technology.

                            "Lipid nanocarriers have emerged across the pharmaceutical industry as versatile nanomedicine delivery platforms. Their success is attributable to the relative ease of production and scale-up, reduced immune responses, multidose capability, extensive and stable drug loading, and design flexibility. In a highly versatile platform, LNPs have been employed in drug delivery, including nucleic acid-based drugs, and are currently in the spotlight as the lead clinical nonviral delivery system with extensive clinical trials and testing in humans.\n\nUsing LNPs as a delivery vehicle has other benefits, such as target-specific delivery (by introducing targeting ligands on NP surfaces), endosomal escape (by destabilizing the endosomal membrane or enhancing fusion to the endosomal membrane through modifying the lipid compositions), high gene knockout efficiency, suitable drug release, and bypassing extracellular nuclease degradation.

                "tldr": "Despite their many advantages, LNPs face challenges including potential immune reactions, manufacturing complexities for certain applications, and limited cellular targeting specificity without additional modifications. These limitations must be balanced against their considerable benefits when designing LNP-based therapeutics. (3 sources)",
                "text": "\nWhile lipid nanoparticles offer numerous advantages over other nanocarrier systems, they are not without limitations that require careful consideration during development and application. One significant concern is the potential for immune reactions. Despite their general biocompatibility, LNPs have been shown to induce immune reactions in some instances, highlighting the importance of considering immunogenicity when developing LNP-based therapeutics. <Paper corpusId=\"247363319\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThis immunological risk must be balanced against the comparatively more severe toxicological profiles of alternative nanoparticle systems. Many competing technologies, particularly non-lipid based systems, may induce significant toxicologies in humans that are not typically observed with LNP systems. For these alternative systems, substantial preclinical evaluation is essential, and clinical trials need to be conducted with extreme caution. <Paper corpusId=\"17608468\" paperTitle=\"(Miller, 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nManufacturing considerations also present challenges for LNP development. Although LNPs generally offer manufacturing advantages compared to other nanocarrier systems, achieving consistent quality in large-scale production can be technically demanding for certain applications. The complexity increases when developing LNPs with specific targeting capabilities or when incorporating multiple therapeutic agents. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nAnother limitation of basic LNP formulations is their relatively non-specific biodistribution without additional targeting modifications. While LNPs can be modified with targeting ligands to enhance specificity, unmodified LNPs may distribute broadly throughout the body, potentially limiting their efficacy for highly targeted applications. This contrasts with some polymer-based systems that can be more readily tailored for organ selectivity through the introduction of targeting groups. <Paper corpusId=\"247363319\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nDespite these limitations, LNPs remain favorable compared to alternative delivery systems. For instance, while cationic polymers can effectively bind to negatively charged cell membranes and increase permeability to facilitate endocytosis, they also demonstrate cytotoxicity by damaging cell membranes and reducing DNA release rates. Similarly, inorganic nanoparticles, despite their antiviral properties, face challenges with biodegradation and tend to accumulate in the body, potentially causing organ toxicity. <Paper corpusId=\"247363319\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nThe evolution of LNP technology has addressed many earlier limitations found in previous nanocarriers like conventional liposomes. Modern LNPs offer more efficient encapsulation of genetic material, enhanced cellular uptake, and reduced immunogenicity compared to these earlier systems, making them increasingly favorable for therapeutic applications. <Paper corpusId=\"274231005\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nWhen considering these limitations alongside their substantial benefits, LNPs remain well-positioned to make a significant impact on nanomedicine applications, particularly in cancer therapy and genetic medicine. Their favorable risk-benefit profile, especially regarding toxicity and manufacturing feasibility, continues to support their prominence in clinical development pipelines. <Paper corpusId=\"17608468\" paperTitle=\"(Miller, 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>",

                            "LNPs, which are mainly formed from phospholipids, are nontoxic, biocompatible and biodegradable and can also reduce the toxic effects of carrier molecules, which means they are particularly suitable for oral or other routes of drug delivery. Polymers have various compositions, sizes, morphologies and surface properties that can be adjusted by applying different ingredients and manufacturing methods for specific applications. Tailoring polymers can improve organ selectivity by introducing targeting groups. Meanwhile, some inorganic nanoparticles, such as AgNPs and AuNPs, can bind to viral surface receptors and prevent viruses from entering the host cell. However, it is important to note that LNP has been shown to induce immune reactions on several previous occasions, suggesting that potential immune reactions should be considered. In addition, although inorganic nanoparticles or nanodelivery systems have good antiviral activity, they are difficult to degrade in living organisms and tend to accumulate in the body, causing organ toxicity. In contrast, cationic polymers can bind to negatively charged cell membranes to increase permeability and facilitate endocytosis, but they also show cytotoxicity by damaging the cell membranes and reducing the DNA release rate."
