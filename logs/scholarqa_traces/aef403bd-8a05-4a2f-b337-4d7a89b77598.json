The complex metabolic network of production cells and production mechanism of recombinant antibodies have gradually become clear. Raab et al. developed a cell line through genetic engineering by a novel bottom-up microRNA (miRNA) screening approach for optimizing the production and secretion of therapeutic antibodies (Raab et al., 2022). At present, the expression level and quality control of recombinant antibodies has always been one of the important bottlenecks restricting the development of antibody drugs. \n\nThe high-efficiency expression and quality of recombinant antibodies can be affected by multiple factors, which can be achieved by genetic engineering, including the optimization of antibody gene sequence, construction of efficient expression vector, optimization of antibody expression system, modification of antibody host cells, and glycosylation site modification (Table 3). The application of these optimization strategies can effectively shorten the time of antibody generation and improve the expression of target antibodies. However, different optimization strategies have advantages and disadvantages, and how to effectively integrate these optimization strategies to make it an efficient operation system needs further study. Under different process conditions, the differences in the yield of recombinant antibodies by the production cell lines can be analyzed from the levels of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, laying a solid foundation for large-scale cell culture processes. In the future, the large-scale production of recombinant antibodies and development of culture processes will develop rapidly in the direction of stabilizing production capacity and improving quality. Furthermore, big data and multi-omics technologies are also beneficial to provide new research directions, more and more process analytical technologies are applied to cell culture processes, which will provide more ideas for improving the efficiency of recombinant antibodies. Therefore, the focus shifts towards how to control the quality of recombinant antibody drugs scientifically and rationally, researchers should further combine the clinical evaluation and post-market safety monitoring, and continue to explore quality control.",

Manufacturers must carefully evaluate their production strategies based on scale-dependent considerations, with different approaches optimal at varying production volumes. The emergence of machine learning applications and advanced analytics has created new opportunities for process optimization and real-time control, though implementation requires significant investment in infrastructure and expertise. According to recent studies, 39 the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in bioprocess development has demonstrated remarkable potential in improving process understanding and control. \n\nFuture research directions should focus on several key areas: \n\nThe field of mAb manufacturing continues to evolve rapidly, driven by technological advances and increasing demand for biological therapeutics. Success in this evolving landscape will require continued innovation in process design, optimization strategies, and implementation approaches. As highlighted by Nikolados and Oyarz\u00fan, 27,44 the integration of deep learning and other advanced technologies offers promising pathways for future developments in protein expression optimization and process control. \n\nThe future of mAb manufacturing lies in the successful integration of these elements, creating more efficient, flexible, and reliable production processes while maintaining product quality and regulatory compliance.

                    "text": "David et al 18 conducted a thorough side-by-side comparability research where continuous downstream processing showed equivalent product quality attributes to conventional batch processing with notable benefits. By 6-fold and chromatography resin use by 2.4-fold compared to fed-batch platforms, the study found that continuous manufacturing drastically cut buffer consumption. Moreover, they showed that changing from batch to continuous processing had no appreciable effect on final drug substance properties like stability profiles, processrelated contaminants, and product quality parameters. This highlights the possibility of using constant manufacturing at any level of the product life. Botelho Ferreira et al 19 also showed another creative way by effectively using the current fed-batch infrastructure for continuous processing, thereby implementing a hybrid manufacturing technique. Their approach performed perfusion operation in a 200-L single-use bioreactor using downstream processes intended for future continuous manufacturing platform compatibility. By allowing 2.1 kg of monoclonal antibody to be produced in two GMP runs, this method showed that \"existing fed-batch infrastructure can be adapted to continuous manufacturing without significant additional investments\". Cha et al 20  commercial-scale production, determining that perfusion cultures attained 1.6-fold higher peak viable cell density with longer culture duration, thus generating a total product amount increase of over 450% while improving purification yield. Their economic study indicated that perfusion mode might lower the cost of goods while preserving product quality, therefore demonstrating its feasibility as a practical method of commercial antibody manufacturing. The choice of these manufacturing approaches depends on various factors, such as production scale, facility constraints, and economic objectives. While continuous processing shows promise of cost reduction and improved efficiency, batch processing maintains advantages in regulatory compliance and operational simplicity. Hybrid systems offer a balanced approach, particularly suitable for facilities requiring flexibility in production capacity and product types.",

                    "text": "2][3] Despite their clinical success, mAb manufacturing presents various challenges that impact their accessibility and commercial viability. Recent studies indicate that process development and manufacturing costs constitute 13%-17% of the total research and development (R&D) budget from the pre-clinical to approval stages, with material preparation costs reaching approximately 60-70 million USD for successful market entries. 4 he manufacturing of mAbs faces several critical challenges that demand immediate attention. Current production processes often suffer from inefficiencies in cell line development, media optimization, and downstream processing. 5,6 raditional batch manufacturing approaches, though well-established, frequently result in suboptimal resource utilization and extended production cycles. Furthermore, heavy reliance on expensive components, such as protein A in purification steps, contributes significantly to the overall cost of goods (COGs), with recent research demonstrating the potential of 23% cost reduction through alternative purification platforms. 7 he economic considerations in mAb manufacturing are particularly pressing given the increasing demand for these therapeutics. Production costs directly influence drug pricing and accessibility, making cost optimization a crucial factor in the industry's sustainable growth. Transitioning from traditional stainless steel facilities to single-use continuous facilities can offer up to 35% cost savings in meeting annual production demand of 100-500 kg, though this gain diminishes at higher scales. 8 iven these challenges, there is a critical need to address high production costs and process inefficiencies in mAb manufacturing. Current production methods often require substantial capital investment, face scalability challenges, and struggle with batch-to-batch consistency. These inefficiencies not only impact production economics but also affect product quality 9 and time-to-market. The industry requires innovative solutions to optimize production processes while maintaining product quality and regulatory compliance. \n\nThree main production techniques-batch, fed-batch, and continuous (perfusion) processing-present different advantages and constraints that greatly affect process economics and product quality when looking at manufacturing options for biopharmaceuticals (Figure 1). Although logistically straightforward, batch processing causes nutrition depletion and waste accumulation, which compromises product quality and causes early cell death. 10 By means of strategic feeding schedules, fed-batch processing solves these constraints; nonetheless, it creates process complexity and scale-up difficulties. 11",

The analysis addresses critical challenges in current manufacturing processes while evaluating innovative solutions to improve production efficiency and economic viability. Methods We conducted a comprehensive analysis of recent literature on mAb manufacturing, examining traditional batch processing, continuous processing, and hybrid systems. The review evaluates cost optimization strategies, including media development and process integration, while assessing the impact of emerging technologies, such as machine learning and advanced analytics, on manufacturing efficiency. Results Recent studies demonstrate that continuous processing can achieve up to 35% cost savings compared to traditional batch processing to meet an annual production demand of 100\u2013500 kg, though this gain diminishes at larger scales. Hybrid facilities show accelerated break-even points, reaching profitability 2\u20132.5 years earlier than traditional facilities. Advanced media optimization strategies, incorporating novel tripeptide delivery methods, have demonstrated up to 35% improvement in mAb titers. Integration of machine learning and advanced analytics has significantly enhanced process control and optimization capabilities. Conclusion The evolution of mAb manufacturing technologies offers promising pathways for improving production efficiency and reducing costs. Scale-dependent considerations remain crucial in selecting optimal manufacturing strategies, while emerging technologies present new opportunities for process optimization. Future developments in continuous processing, advanced analytics, and cell line engineering will be essential in meeting growing global demand while ensuring economic viability and accessibility of mAb therapeutics.\n## Introduction\n2][3] Despite their clinical success, mAb manufacturing presents various challenges that impact their accessibility and commercial viability. Recent studies indicate that process development and manufacturing costs constitute 13%-17% of the total research and development (R&D) budget from the pre-clinical to approval stages, with material preparation costs reaching approximately 60-70 million USD for successful market entries. 4 he manufacturing of mAbs faces several critical challenges that demand immediate attention. Current production processes often suffer from inefficiencies in cell line development, media optimization, and downstream processing. 5,6 raditional batch manufacturing approaches, though well-established, frequently result in suboptimal resource utilization and extended production cycles. Furthermore, heavy reliance on expensive components, such as protein A in purification steps, contributes significantly to the overall cost of goods (COGs), with recent research demonstrating the potential of 23% cost reduction through alternative purification platforms. 7 he economic considerations in mAb manufacturing are particularly pressing given the increasing demand for these therapeutics. Production costs directly influence drug pricing and accessibility, making cost optimization a crucial factor in the industry's sustainable growth. Transitioning from traditional stainless steel facilities to single-use continuous facilities can offer up to 35% cost savings in meeting annual production demand of 100-500 kg, though this gain diminishes at higher scales. 8 iven these challenges, there is a critical need to address high production costs and process inefficiencies in mAb manufacturing. Current production methods often require substantial capital investment, face scalability challenges, and struggle with batch-to-batch consistency. These inefficiencies not only impact production economics but also affect product quality 9 and time-to-market. The industry requires innovative solutions to optimize production processes while maintaining product quality and regulatory compliance. \n\nThree main production techniques-batch, fed-batch, and continuous (perfusion) processing-present different advantages and constraints that greatly affect process economics and product quality when looking at manufacturing options for biopharmaceuticals (Figure 1). Although logistically straightforward, batch processing causes nutrition depletion and waste accumulation, which compromises product quality and causes early cell death. 10 By means of strategic feeding schedules, fed-batch processing solves these constraints; nonetheless, it creates process complexity and scale-up difficulties. 11\n...\nBy means of strategic feeding schedules, fed-batch processing solves these constraints; nonetheless, it creates process complexity and scale-up difficulties. 11 With cost savings of roughly 35% for annual production demand between 100 and 500 kg, continuous processing achieves the highest cell densities (50-100\u00d710 6 cells/mL vs 15-25\u00d710 6 cells/mL for fed-batch) and volumetric productivity (0.5-2.0 g/L/day vs 0.2-0.5 g/L/day for fed-batch) as shown in Table 1. \n\nThe advantages of certain fermentation techniques in biopharmaceutical manufacturing are rather well supported by recent studies. A particularly successful technique for improving product yields in recombinant proteins manufacture has been Fed-batch fermentation. Mendes et al 12 revealed that fed-batch bioreactor production of recombinant BCG showed enhanced specific growth rates after day 4 in pH 7.4-controlled cultures, hence lowering the cultivation time relative to simple batch processing. Their research also showed that fed-batch samples showed substantial recovery of viable cell counts post-lyophilization, implying that extra nutrient supplementation during fermentation may protect cells during downstream processing. Continuous fermentation techniques have many interesting benefits for maximizing output. Continuous fermentation of penicillium brevicompactum achieved notably better productivity (0.025 g/L/h) of mycophenolic acid compared to fed-batch (0.007 g/L/h) and batch fermentation (0.006 g/L/h), Anand and Srivastava 13 found in their comparative investigation.

These results imply that, with suitable application of continuous processing technologies, similar efficiency benefits could be obtained in monoclonal antibody production. \n\nThis review aims to comprehensively evaluate current manufacturing approaches, analyze cost reduction strategies, and assess emerging technologies in mAb production.\n\n## Manufacturing Approaches and Process Design in mAb Production\nDavid et al 18 conducted a thorough side-by-side comparability research where continuous downstream processing showed equivalent product quality attributes to conventional batch processing with notable benefits. By 6-fold and chromatography resin use by 2.4-fold compared to fed-batch platforms, the study found that continuous manufacturing drastically cut buffer consumption. Moreover, they showed that changing from batch to continuous processing had no appreciable effect on final drug substance properties like stability profiles, processrelated contaminants, and product quality parameters. This highlights the possibility of using constant manufacturing at any level of the product life. Botelho Ferreira et al 19 also showed another creative way by effectively using the current fed-batch infrastructure for continuous processing, thereby implementing a hybrid manufacturing technique. Their approach performed perfusion operation in a 200-L single-use bioreactor using downstream processes intended for future continuous manufacturing platform compatibility. By allowing 2.1 kg of monoclonal antibody to be produced in two GMP runs, this method showed that \"existing fed-batch infrastructure can be adapted to continuous manufacturing without significant additional investments\". Cha et al 20  commercial-scale production, determining that perfusion cultures attained 1.6-fold higher peak viable cell density with longer culture duration, thus generating a total product amount increase of over 450% while improving purification yield. Their economic study indicated that perfusion mode might lower the cost of goods while preserving product quality, therefore demonstrating its feasibility as a practical method of commercial antibody manufacturing. The choice of these manufacturing approaches depends on various factors, such as production scale, facility constraints, and economic objectives. While continuous processing shows promise of cost reduction and improved efficiency, batch processing maintains advantages in regulatory compliance and operational simplicity. Hybrid systems offer a balanced approach, particularly suitable for facilities requiring flexibility in production capacity and product types.\n\n## Conclusions and Future Perspectives\nThe comprehensive analysis of mAb manufacturing reveals significant advances in process optimization, cost reduction strategies, and emerging technologies while highlighting critical areas for future development and research. \n\nKey findings demonstrate a clear evolution in manufacturing approaches, with continuous processing showing substantial cost advantages of up to 35% for specific production scales. 8 The integration of single-use technologies and hybrid systems has enabled greater flexibility and reduced capital investment requirements, with hybrid facilities achieving breakeven points 2-2.5 years earlier than traditional stainless steel facilities. 43 Additionally, advances in media optimization and process integration have led to significant improvements in production efficiency and cost reduction. \n\nThe implications for the biopharmaceutical industry are substantial. Manufacturers must carefully evaluate their production strategies based on scale-dependent considerations, with different approaches optimal at varying production volumes. The emergence of machine learning applications and advanced analytics has created new opportunities for process optimization and real-time control, though implementation requires significant investment in infrastructure and expertise. According to recent studies, 39 the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in bioprocess development has demonstrated remarkable potential in improving process understanding and control. \n\nFuture research directions should focus on several key areas: \n\nThe field of mAb manufacturing continues to evolve rapidly, driven by technological advances and increasing demand for biological therapeutics. Success in this evolving landscape will require continued innovation in process design, optimization strategies, and implementation approaches. As highlighted by Nikolados and Oyarz\u00fan, 27,44 the integration of deep learning and other advanced technologies offers promising pathways for future developments in protein expression optimization and process control. \n\nThe future of mAb manufacturing lies in the successful integration of these elements, creating more efficient, flexible, and reliable production processes while maintaining product quality and regulatory compliance. Continued R&D in these areas will be crucial for meeting the growing global demand for mAb therapeutics while ensuring their economic viability and accessibility.",

A variety of downstream processing technological advances have led to a paradigm shift in how therapeutic antibodies are developed and manufactured. A key driver of change has been the increased adoption of single-use technologies for process development and manufacturing. An early-stage developability assessment of potential lead antibodies, using both in silico and high-throughput experimental approaches, is critical to de-risk development and identify molecules amenable to manufacturing. Both statistical and mechanistic modelling approaches are being increasingly applied to downstream process development, allowing for deeper process understanding of chromatographic unit operations. Given the greater adoption of perfusion processes for antibody production, continuous and semi-continuous downstream processes are being increasingly explored as alternatives to batch processes. As part of the Quality by Design (QbD) paradigm, ever more sophisticated process analytical technologies play a key role in understanding antibody product quality in real-time. We should expect that computational prediction and modelling approaches will continue to be advanced and exploited, given the increasing sophistication and robustness of predictive methods compared to the costs, time, and resources required for experimental studies.",

Many aspects of their protein chemistry and structure must be considered as part of their design, optimization, development, and manufacturing. An ever-increasing array of antibody formats, fragments, and conjugates are produced in mammalian, insect, or bacterial cells. Isolation of these molecules from product-and process-related impurities such that they possess the correct attributes for their intended therapeutic purpose is the task of downstream processing (DSP). The success of DSP process development and manufacturing is heavily interdependent on the quality of the therapeutic antibody design, including its chemical and structural properties, as well as the upstream process (USP) and associated USP and DSP analytical technologies available to measure product attributes and process parameters. \n\nDSP of therapeutic antibodies continues to undergo revolutionary change. Over the years, DSP has often been described as the rate-limiting bottleneck in therapeutic antibody production. New technologies and paradigms of working have emerged in recent years that are helping to relieve this situation. Pressure continues to increase productivity while decreasing the cost of goods (CoGs). There is also the need for rapid process development of downstream processes for lead therapeutic antibodies to enable a faster path to regulatory submission and commercialization. \n\nThe aim of this article has not been to provide a comprehensive review of recent advances in DSP but rather to provide a summary of recent trends and technologies in selected areas, including those that seem of particular importance for therapeutic antibody DSP process development and manufacturing. It is hoped that this review also provides the interested reader a glimpse of where some active subject matter areas within DSP are advancing in the near future.",

Matte\n## Abstract\nDespite the advent of many new therapies, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies remain a prominent biologics product, with a market value of billions of dollars annually. A variety of downstream processing technological advances have led to a paradigm shift in how therapeutic antibodies are developed and manufactured. A key driver of change has been the increased adoption of single-use technologies for process development and manufacturing. An early-stage developability assessment of potential lead antibodies, using both in silico and high-throughput experimental approaches, is critical to de-risk development and identify molecules amenable to manufacturing. Both statistical and mechanistic modelling approaches are being increasingly applied to downstream process development, allowing for deeper process understanding of chromatographic unit operations. Given the greater adoption of perfusion processes for antibody production, continuous and semi-continuous downstream processes are being increasingly explored as alternatives to batch processes. As part of the Quality by Design (QbD) paradigm, ever more sophisticated process analytical technologies play a key role in understanding antibody product quality in real-time. We should expect that computational prediction and modelling approaches will continue to be advanced and exploited, given the increasing sophistication and robustness of predictive methods compared to the costs, time, and resources required for experimental studies.\n## Introduction\nTherapeutic antibodies are complex molecules. Many aspects of their protein chemistry and structure must be considered as part of their design, optimization, development, and manufacturing. An ever-increasing array of antibody formats, fragments, and conjugates are produced in mammalian, insect, or bacterial cells. Isolation of these molecules from product-and process-related impurities such that they possess the correct attributes for their intended therapeutic purpose is the task of downstream processing (DSP). The success of DSP process development and manufacturing is heavily interdependent on the quality of the therapeutic antibody design, including its chemical and structural properties, as well as the upstream process (USP) and associated USP and DSP analytical technologies available to measure product attributes and process parameters. \n\nDSP of therapeutic antibodies continues to undergo revolutionary change. Over the years, DSP has often been described as the rate-limiting bottleneck in therapeutic antibody production. New technologies and paradigms of working have emerged in recent years that are helping to relieve this situation. Pressure continues to increase productivity while decreasing the cost of goods (CoGs). There is also the need for rapid process development of downstream processes for lead therapeutic antibodies to enable a faster path to regulatory submission and commercialization. \n\nThe aim of this article has not been to provide a comprehensive review of recent advances in DSP but rather to provide a summary of recent trends and technologies in selected areas, including those that seem of particular importance for therapeutic antibody DSP process development and manufacturing. It is hoped that this review also provides the interested reader a glimpse of where some active subject matter areas within DSP are advancing in the near future.\n\n## Continuous Downstream Processing\nTraditional batch or fed-batch production processes yield a specific volumetric and mass quantity of product upon harvest and clarification. The product is isolated during the downstream process, which normally consists of a Protein-A chromatography capture step, low pH viral inactivation, one or more polishing chromatography steps, virus nanofiltration, and a UF/DF step to properly formulate the drug substance prior to sterile filtration and bulk filling. Each unit operation is discrete while, at the same time, integrated continuously together into a holistic process workflow (reviewed in [24,25]). \n\nThe advent of perfusion-based upstream processes has contributed to developing continuous DSP processes for antibody purification. In a continuous process, the product is constantly removed from the perfusion bioreactor and processed in a series of steps analogous to those used for batch or fed-batch DSP. In a fully continuous DSP process, each step would lead directly into the next in a seamless and automated manner. Facility and technological limitations might prevent the design of a fully continuous DSP process, necessitating some steps to be performed semi-continuously. The case for operating DSP processes in continuous versus batch mode needs to be carefully evaluated with an appropriate risk assessment to make the appropriate decision based on the operational scale, stage of product development, regulatory strategy, and availability of facilities and equipment. Cost of goods modelling for DSP processing using stainless steel, SU, and continuous processes for mAbs produced at various scales has revealed clear cost advantages for continuous processing, in most scenarios, but especially at higher production volume, higher final product mass, and antibody titer [17,26]. A summary of the status of continuous mAb manufacturing adoption for several biotech companies has recently been published [24]. \n\nFor harvesting from perfusion bioreactors, TFF and ATF (alternating tangential flow) filtration are possible. In ATF, alternating pressure and vacuum are applied to the permeate flow using a diaphragm pump. As a result, the reverse flow is used to reduce the fouling of the hollow fiber membrane [27]. Cells and higher molecular weight materials are recirculated back to the bioreactor while the product permeate can be directed towards capture chromatography.",

Several expression platforms have been employed for the production of these recombinant proteins, from which E. coli and CHO cell-based systems have emerged as the most promising hosts for higher expression. Because antibody fragments such as Fabs and scFvs are smaller than traditional antibody structures and do not require specific patterns of glycosylation decoration for therapeutic efficacy, it is possible to express them in systems with reduced post-translational modification capacity and high expression yield, for example, in plant and insect cell-based systems. In this review, we describe different bioengineering technologies along with their opportunities and difficulties to manufacture antibody fragments with consideration of stability, efficacy and safety for humans. There is still potential for a new production technology with a view of being simple, fast and cost-effective while maintaining the stability and efficacy of biotherapeutic fragments.",

Grabowska, Hamid Heidari Kashkoli, Reihaneh Mirhassani, David B. Guiliano, C. Dolphin, H. Khalili\n## Abstract\nAntibody fragments are used in the clinic as important therapeutic proteins for treatment of indications where better tissue penetration and less immunogenic molecules are needed. Several expression platforms have been employed for the production of these recombinant proteins, from which E. coli and CHO cell-based systems have emerged as the most promising hosts for higher expression. Because antibody fragments such as Fabs and scFvs are smaller than traditional antibody structures and do not require specific patterns of glycosylation decoration for therapeutic efficacy, it is possible to express them in systems with reduced post-translational modification capacity and high expression yield, for example, in plant and insect cell-based systems. In this review, we describe different bioengineering technologies along with their opportunities and difficulties to manufacture antibody fragments with consideration of stability, efficacy and safety for humans. There is still potential for a new production technology with a view of being simple, fast and cost-effective while maintaining the stability and efficacy of biotherapeutic fragments.\n## Technologies to Bioengineer the Antibody Fragments (Fabs and scFvs)\nWhile antibody fragments can be produced using enzymatic digestion of monoclonal antibodies, they can also be manufactured using recombinant heterologous protein expression systems.Host platforms such as bacteria, yeast, fungi, mammalian cells or even whole animals and plants have been successfully employed.While some of the biotherapeutics were originally extracted from human tissue and in relatively small amounts, the vast majority of therapeutic biologics on the market today are recombinant proteins, generated using reliable and consistent cell-based production platforms.Using recombinant DNA technologies, large amount of highly purified biologics can be produced, but challenges with the purity and quality still exist.In the following section, different bioengineering technologies are discussed, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages for production of antibody fragments.",

Gustavsson, Otto Tronarp, M. Nilsson, Kristoffer Rudenholm Hansson, I. Lundstr\u00f6m, C. Mandenius, D. Aili\n## Abstract\nTherapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide new means for treatments of a wide range of diseases and comprise a large fraction of all new approved drugs. Production of mAbs is expensive compared to conventional drug production, primarily due to the complex processes involved. The affinity purification step is dominating the cost of goods in mAb manufacturing. Process intensification and automation could reduce costs, but the lack of real-time process analytical technologies (PAT) complicates this development. We show a specific and robust fiber optical localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensor technology that is optimized for in-line product detection in the effluent in affinity capture steps. The sensor system comprises a flow cell and a replaceable sensor chip functionalized with biorecognition elements for specific analyte detection. The high selectivity of the sensor enable detection of mAbs in complex sample matrices at concentrations below 2.5 \u03bcg mL-1. In place regeneration of the sensor chips allowed for continuous monitoring of multiple consecutive chromatographic separation cycles. Excellent performance was obtained at different purification scales with flow rates up to 200 mL min-1. This sensor technology facilitates efficient column loading, optimization, and control of chromatography systems, which can pave the way for continuous operation and automation of protein purification steps.\n",

This is especially important where multi-epitope neutralization is required to prevent the development of immune-evading viral mutants that can emerge upon treatment with monoclonal antibodies. Using microfluidics, flow sorting, and a targeted integration cell line, a first-in-class recombinant hyperimmune globulin therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 (GIGA-2050) was generated. Using processes similar to conventional monoclonal antibody manufacturing, GIGA-2050, comprising 12,500 antibodies, was scaled-up for clinical manufacturing and multiple development/tox lots were assessed for consistency. Antibody sequence diversity, cell growth, productivity, and product quality were assessed across different manufacturing sites and production scales. GIGA-2050 was purified and tested for good laboratory procedures (GLP) toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and in vivo efficacy against natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice. The GIGA-2050 master cell bank was highly stable, producing material at consistent yield and product quality up to >70 generations. Good manufacturing practices (GMP) and development batches of GIGA-2050 showed consistent product quality, impurity clearance, potency, and protection in an in vivo efficacy model. Nonhuman primate toxicology and pharmacokinetics studies suggest that GIGA-2050 is safe and has a half-life similar to other recombinant human IgG1 antibodies.

Adler\n## Abstract\nConventionally, hyperimmune globulin drugs manufactured from pooled immunoglobulins from vaccinated or convalescent donors have been used in treating infections where no treatment is available. This is especially important where multi-epitope neutralization is required to prevent the development of immune-evading viral mutants that can emerge upon treatment with monoclonal antibodies. Using microfluidics, flow sorting, and a targeted integration cell line, a first-in-class recombinant hyperimmune globulin therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 (GIGA-2050) was generated. Using processes similar to conventional monoclonal antibody manufacturing, GIGA-2050, comprising 12,500 antibodies, was scaled-up for clinical manufacturing and multiple development/tox lots were assessed for consistency. Antibody sequence diversity, cell growth, productivity, and product quality were assessed across different manufacturing sites and production scales. GIGA-2050 was purified and tested for good laboratory procedures (GLP) toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and in vivo efficacy against natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice. The GIGA-2050 master cell bank was highly stable, producing material at consistent yield and product quality up to >70 generations. Good manufacturing practices (GMP) and development batches of GIGA-2050 showed consistent product quality, impurity clearance, potency, and protection in an in vivo efficacy model. Nonhuman primate toxicology and pharmacokinetics studies suggest that GIGA-2050 is safe and has a half-life similar to other recombinant human IgG1 antibodies. These results supported a successful investigational new drug application for GIGA-2050. This study demonstrates that a new class of drugs, recombinant hyperimmune globulins, can be manufactured consistently at the clinical scale and presents a new approach to treating infectious diseases that targets multiple epitopes of a virus.\n## Manufacturing GIGA-2050\nWhen developing the GIGA-2050 manufacturing process, the aim was to model it on a typical mAb manufacturing platform approach, to take advantage of existing expertise and infrastructure in the contract manufacturing and development space. The strategy to manufacture GIGA-2050 can be used to manufacture any recombinant hyperimmune globulin at any site that manufactures mAbs, as outlined in Figure 1.

In this report, we incorporated a process analytical technology (PAT) tool into our N-1 perfusion platform, using an in-line capacitance probe to automatically adjust the perfusion rate based on real-time VCD measurements. The capacitance measurements correlated linearly with the offline VCD at all cell densities tested (i.e., up to 130 \u00d7 106 cells/mL). Online control of the perfusion rate via the cell-specific perfusion rate (CSPR) decreased media usage by approximately 25% when compared with a platform volume-specific perfusion rate approach and did not lead to any detrimental effects on cell growth. This PAT tool was applied to six mAbs, and a platform CSPR of 0.04 nL/cell/day was selected, which enabled rapid growth and maintenance of high viabilities for four of six cell lines. In addition, small-scale capacitance data were used in the scaling-up of N-1 perfusion processes in the pilot plant and in the GMP manufacturing suite.

This study is based upon the design and testing of a HTPD platform for integration of the protein A and low pH VI operations. This was achieved by using a design and simulation software before execution on an automated liquid handler. The operations were successfully translated to the micro\u2010scale, as assessed by analysis of recoveries and molecular weight content. The integrated platform was then used as a tool to assess the effect of pH on HMWC during low pH hold. The laboratory\u2010scale and micro\u2010scale elution pools showed comparable HMWC across the pH range 3.2\u20133.7.

Eslami, Alois Jungbauer\n## Abstract\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is rapidly advancing, driven by the need for cutting\u2010edge technologies to meet the growing demand for life\u2010saving treatments. In this context, Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a promising solution to address the complexity of modern biopharmaceutical production processes. Its ability to optimize operations and ensure consistent product yields has made it an attractive option for manufacturers in this sector. Furthermore, MPC's alignment with the Process Analytical Technology (PAT) initiative provides an additional layer of assurance, facilitating real\u2010time monitoring and enabling swift adjustments to maintain process integrity. This comprehensive review delves into the various applications of MPC, ranging from robust control to stochastic model predictive control, thereby equipping biotechnologists and process engineers with a powerful toolset. By harnessing the capabilities of MPC, as elucidated in this review, manufacturers can confidently navigate the intricate bioprocessing landscape and unlock this approach's full potential in their production processes.\n## | Biotechnology\nProduction of biological products is often divided into two main steps, the upstream processing in a bioreactor and the downstream processing for the recovery of the product by a combination of centrifugation, filtration, chromatography, and membrane filtration.\n\nAs the upstream processing is the initial step in biotechnology, thus product quality is of paramount importance, and optimizing this step leads to significant improvements in overall production.\n\nUpstream processing involves cell cultivation and harvesting biological material, such as proteins, enzymes, and antibodies, while maintaining its quality and purity.The outcome of this step is heavily dependent on controlling and maintaining process variables such as nutrition feeding, temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen at an optimal level.This step can be performed via batch, fed-batch, or perfusion modes, each with its advantages and limitations.Similarly, downstream processing poses challenges due to the complexity and variability of the starting material.Multi-component adsorption isotherms, variable impurities, and contaminants in the crude feedstock make it challenging to design and optimize downstream processing steps, such as purification and separation.\n\nIn discussing the challenges faced by the biopharmaceutical industry in meeting the growing demand for biologics while maintaining quality requirements, Narayanan et al. 191 highlight the need for advancements in bioprocessing, particularly in process intensification, to address these challenges.In addition, they stress the importance of collaborations between different parties to establish a more digitalized and automated biotherapeutic process development and manufacturing, aligning the industry with the standards of Industry 4.0.\n\nModel predictive control offers a promising solution to ensure the final product meets the required specifications.In addition, MPC can exploit the benefits of the process by minimizing by-products, improving productivity and yield, and even reducing production costs.\n\nHowever, as stated before, the performance of any model-based controller, including MPC, largely depends on the accuracy of the process model used.In the context of bioprocessing, obtaining a reliable and accurate process model is particularly challenging given model uncertainties, the system's nonlinear structure, and the slow process dynamics. 192,193The complexity of process models primarily arises from the high sensitivity of biological products to process conditions, including temperature, pH, and substrate concentrations.",

Increases in mAb titre has been achieved mainly by cell culture media/feed improvement and cell line engineering to increase cell density and specific mAb productivity. However, this improvement has shifted the bottleneck to downstream purification steps. The higher accumulation of the main cell-derived impurities, host cell proteins (HCPs), in the supernatant can negatively affect product integrity and immunogenicity in addition to increasing the cost of capture and polishing steps. Mathematical modelling of bioprocess dynamics is a valuable tool to improve industrial production at fast rate and low cost. Herein, a single stage volume-based population balance model (PBM) has been built to capture Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell behaviour in fed-batch bioreactors. Using cell volume as the internal variable, the model captures the dynamics of mAb and HCP accumulation extracellularly under physiological and mild hypothermic culture conditions. Model-based analysis and orthogonal measurements of lactate dehydrogenase activity and double-stranded DNA concentration in the supernatant show that a significant proportion of HCPs found in the extracellular matrix is secreted by viable cells. The PBM then served as a platform for generating operating strategies that optimise antibody titre and increase cost-efficiency while minimising impurity levels.",

                    "text": "As the production of therapeutic proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), are being produced at increasingly larger scales, the industry is moving towards continuous processing to achieve increased efficiency [1]. The implementation of perfusion culture methods offers greater productivity, a smaller facility footprint and reduced cost of goods [2] but widespread uptake of the technology has been hindered by high risk of batch failure and by the complexity of set-up. Recent technological advancements have led to reduced failure rates, increased the productivity of perfusion cultures and reduced batch to batch variability when compared to fed-batch [3,4]. Additionally, the long-term steady-state perfusion culture operation ensures consistent product quality [5], which has led to regulatory bodies to drive initiatives to promote the implementation of continuous biomanufacturing [6]. \n\nIt has been suggested that the success of perfusion culture methodologies relies on the ability to reduce perfusion rate, ideally to rates below 1 vessel volume per day (VVD) [7]. This ensures the achievement of high titers using minimal liquid throughput, thus reducing the operating costs. In order to achieve a reduction in perfusion rate, cell lines must be carefully selected, and media optimized to ensure appropriate nutritional depth and osmolality. The use of high-throughput mL-scale devices offer the possibility to select the best-performing cell lines and conduct media studies by running experiments in parallel, thus reducing timescales and costs associated with early phase development. While devices like microwell plates and micro-bioreactors have been widely used for fed-batch cultures, equivalent platforms for perfusion culture are still in development. As perfusion operation requires optimisation of multiple process parameters, this can be a resource-intensive and low-throughput when performed in L-scale benchtop bioreactors. As an alternative, pseudo perfusion in shake flasks, spin tubes or microwell plates is often used. \n\nA few examples of these pseudo-perfusion systems have previously been described, with discrete media exchange and cell retention incorporated into pre-existing fed-batch processes for CHO cell culture.",

The implementation of perfusion culture methods offers greater productivity, a smaller facility footprint and reduced cost of goods [2] but widespread uptake of the technology has been hindered by high risk of batch failure and by the complexity of set-up. Recent technological advancements have led to reduced failure rates, increased the productivity of perfusion cultures and reduced batch to batch variability when compared to fed-batch [3,4]. Additionally, the long-term steady-state perfusion culture operation ensures consistent product quality [5], which has led to regulatory bodies to drive initiatives to promote the implementation of continuous biomanufacturing [6]. \n\nIt has been suggested that the success of perfusion culture methodologies relies on the ability to reduce perfusion rate, ideally to rates below 1 vessel volume per day (VVD) [7]. This ensures the achievement of high titers using minimal liquid throughput, thus reducing the operating costs. In order to achieve a reduction in perfusion rate, cell lines must be carefully selected, and media optimized to ensure appropriate nutritional depth and osmolality. The use of high-throughput mL-scale devices offer the possibility to select the best-performing cell lines and conduct media studies by running experiments in parallel, thus reducing timescales and costs associated with early phase development. While devices like microwell plates and micro-bioreactors have been widely used for fed-batch cultures, equivalent platforms for perfusion culture are still in development. As perfusion operation requires optimisation of multiple process parameters, this can be a resource-intensive and low-throughput when performed in L-scale benchtop bioreactors. As an alternative, pseudo perfusion in shake flasks, spin tubes or microwell plates is often used. \n\nA few examples of these pseudo-perfusion systems have previously been described, with discrete media exchange and cell retention incorporated into pre-existing fed-batch processes for CHO cell culture.",

Different treatments for COVID-19, such as anti-COVID-19 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), have been developed under tight timelines. Not only mAb product and clinical development but also chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) process development at pandemic speed are required to address this highly unmet patient need. CMC development consists of early- and late-stage process development to ensure sufficient mAb manufacturing yield and consistent product quality for patient safety and efficacy. Here, we report a case study of late-stage cell culture process development at pandemic speed for mAb1 and mAb2 production as a combination therapy for a highly unmet patient treatment. We completed late-stage cell culture process characterization (PC) within approximately 4 months from the cell culture process definition to the initiation of the manufacturing process performance qualification (PPQ) campaign for mAb1 and mAb2, in comparison to a standard one-year PC timeline. Different strategies were presented in detail at different PC steps, i.e., pre-PC risk assessment, scale-down model development and qualification, formal PC experiments, and in-process control strategy development for a successful PPQ campaign that did not sacrifice quality. The strategies we present may be applied to accelerate late-stage process development for other biologics to reduce timelines.",

Cell culture upstream process development includes two different stages: 1) the early-stage process development for investigational new drug (IND) application to the start of first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1 clinical trials, and 2) the late-stage development toward BLA submission for commercial use. \n\nEarly-stage process development consists of cell-line generation, lead clone selection, initial cell culture process development with the lead clone research cell bank (RCB), master cell bank (MCB) creation from the lead clone RCB and MCB release, and the early-stage process definition or lock for the good manufacturing practice (GMP) FIH campaign. 9][20] To address COVID-19 pandemic needs, multiple reports have demonstrated that the early-stage process development can be shortened further from 12-16 to approximately 4-6 months for the development of neutralizing mAbs. 15,21,22 ate-stage upstream process development consists of commercial process development, process characterization (PC), and in-process control strategy development. In comparison to the early-stage upstream process, the major goals of commercial process development, usually using MCB, working cell bank (WCB), or their cell age equivalent development cell banks (DCBs), are to improve upstream titer for cost reduction, process robustness, and scale-up manufacturing for a much larger quantity of commercial drug substance generation, while maintaining comparable product quality profile. 23,24 Then, the commercial process is locked for pivotal GMP campaign to generate drug substance for Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, long-term stability study (LTSS), PC, and defining an in-process control strategy (IPC) for process performance qualification (PPQ), which are regulatory requirements for BLA submission. 24 Quality by design (QbD) principles have been used throughout all stages of process development in the industry. ][27][28] Late-stage process development is usually not on the critical path for standard mAb product development, since late-stage clinical trials take much more time than process development.",

Cell culture upstream process development includes two different stages: 1) the early-stage process development for investigational new drug (IND) application to the start of first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1 clinical trials, and 2) the late-stage development toward BLA submission for commercial use. \n\nEarly-stage process development consists of cell-line generation, lead clone selection, initial cell culture process development with the lead clone research cell bank (RCB), master cell bank (MCB) creation from the lead clone RCB and MCB release, and the early-stage process definition or lock for the good manufacturing practice (GMP) FIH campaign. 9][20] To address COVID-19 pandemic needs, multiple reports have demonstrated that the early-stage process development can be shortened further from 12-16 to approximately 4-6 months for the development of neutralizing mAbs. 15,21,22 ate-stage upstream process development consists of commercial process development, process characterization (PC), and in-process control strategy development. In comparison to the early-stage upstream process, the major goals of commercial process development, usually using MCB, working cell bank (WCB), or their cell age equivalent development cell banks (DCBs), are to improve upstream titer for cost reduction, process robustness, and scale-up manufacturing for a much larger quantity of commercial drug substance generation, while maintaining comparable product quality profile. 23,24 Then, the commercial process is locked for pivotal GMP campaign to generate drug substance for Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, long-term stability study (LTSS), PC, and defining an in-process control strategy (IPC) for process performance qualification (PPQ), which are regulatory requirements for BLA submission. 24 Quality by design (QbD) principles have been used throughout all stages of process development in the industry. ][27][28] Late-stage process development is usually not on the critical path for standard mAb product development, since late-stage clinical trials take much more time than process development.",

In this article, we describe the development of a large-area microfluidic bioreactor (LM bioreactor) for mammalian cell culture that works at laminar flow and perfusion conditions. The 184 cm2 32 cisterns LM bioreactor is the largest polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device fabricated by photopolymer flexographic master mold methodology, reaching a final volume of 2.8 mL. The LM bioreactor was connected to a syringe pump system for culture media perfusion, and the cells\u2019 culture was monitored by photomicrograph imaging. CHO-ahIFN-\u03b12b adherent cell line expressing the anti-hIFN-a2b recombinant scFv-Fc monoclonal antibody (mAb) for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus were cultured on the LM bioreactor. Cell culture and mAb production in the LM bioreactor could be sustained for 18 days. Moreover, the anti-hIFN-a2b produced in the LM bioreactor showed higher affinity and neutralizing antiproliferative activity compared to those mAbs produced in the control condition. We demonstrate for the first-time, a large area microfluidic bioreactor for mammalian cell culture that enables a controlled microenvironment suitable for the development of high-quality biologics with potential for therapeutic use.",

Attallah, Daniel Chamorro, M. Oggero, R. Booth, S. Ferrero, S. Bhansali, Maximiliano S. Perez, B. Lerner, G. Helguera\n## Abstract\nTo produce innovative biopharmaceuticals, highly flexible, adaptable, robust, and affordable bioprocess platforms for bioreactors are essential. In this article, we describe the development of a large-area microfluidic bioreactor (LM bioreactor) for mammalian cell culture that works at laminar flow and perfusion conditions. The 184 cm2 32 cisterns LM bioreactor is the largest polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device fabricated by photopolymer flexographic master mold methodology, reaching a final volume of 2.8 mL. The LM bioreactor was connected to a syringe pump system for culture media perfusion, and the cells\u2019 culture was monitored by photomicrograph imaging. CHO-ahIFN-\u03b12b adherent cell line expressing the anti-hIFN-a2b recombinant scFv-Fc monoclonal antibody (mAb) for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus were cultured on the LM bioreactor. Cell culture and mAb production in the LM bioreactor could be sustained for 18 days. Moreover, the anti-hIFN-a2b produced in the LM bioreactor showed higher affinity and neutralizing antiproliferative activity compared to those mAbs produced in the control condition. We demonstrate for the first-time, a large area microfluidic bioreactor for mammalian cell culture that enables a controlled microenvironment suitable for the development of high-quality biologics with potential for therapeutic use.\n## Introduction\nThe fact that mammalian cells are relatively difficult to work with due to factors such as medium complexity, serum requirement, low yield, and shear sensitivity has important implications in terms of manufacturability and scalability of mAbs [18]. The commercial production of mAbs and other biotherapeutic products is currently based on synthesis in 5 to 20 m 3 bioreactor tanks with mammalian cells by shaking suspension culture operated in a fed-batch or perfusion mode [19][20][21]. The commercial production of mAbs in stirred tanks faces challenges related to product and process quality, such as demands for higher productivity, glycosylation control, reproducibility, as well as other process controls [19,21,22]. Most of these challenges are related to the great temporal and spatial variability of the intrinsic conditions of the fermenters. One way to improve the understanding and control of mAb production in bioreactors is to downscale the system through miniaturization in the form of microfluidic devices [23]. \n\nThere are few studies on the use of LOC-type devices to produce recombinant proteins [24]. In previous work, we have demonstrated the feasibility of the production of an anti-hIFN-\u03b12b recombinant mAb with Chinese hamster ovary, CHO, and human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells in standard-size microfluidic devices with a final volume of 32.22 \u00b5L [25]. It was possible to increase the concentration of the antibodies up to 7.3 times higher (1120 pg of mAb per cell) than that obtained by standard culture methodologies (using T-flasks). Moreover, the functional activity of the antibodies produced in the microdevice (neutralization of the cellular cytokine signaling) did not present a significant difference from those obtained in the control culture. In this context, the main objective of the present work is to scale up the production of recombinant proteins in the large-area microfluidic bioreactor (LM bioreactor).

As a consequence, a variety of production processes have been established within the biomanufacturing industry. However, the rapidly increasing demand for therapeutic molecules amid the recent COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that there still is a clear need to establish novel, highly productive, and flexible production processes. Within this work, we designed a novel discontinuous process by combining two intensification strategies, thus increasing inoculation density and media exchange via a fluidized bed centrifuge, to fulfill the need for a flexible and highly productive production process for therapeutic molecules. To establish this new process, firstly, a small-scale experiment was conducted to verify synergies between both intensification strategies, followed by a process transfer towards the proof-of-concept scale. The combination of these two-process intensification measures revealed overall synergies resulting in decreased process duration (\u221237%) and strongly enhanced product formation (+116%) in comparison to the not-intensified standard operation. This led to an impressive threefold increase in space-time yield, while only negligible differences in product quality could be observed. Overall, this novel process not only increases the ways to react to emergency situations thanks to its flexibility and possible short development times, but also represents a possible alternative to the current established processes due to high increases in productivity, in comparison to standard fed-batch operations.\n",

Moreover, there is a trend towards moving from fed-batch to continuous perfusion processes; a development that is influencing the requirements for bioreactor design and process control. In this study, the transfer of fed-batch and perfusion experiments between different cylindrical stirred lab-scale bioreactors and Thermo Scientific\u2019sTM (Waltham, MA, USA) cubical HyPerformaTM DynaDriveTM Single-Use Bioreactor was investigated. Different scaling parameters were used, which were selected based on the requirements of the respective processes. Peak cell densities of up to 49 \u00d7 106 cells mL\u22121 and antibody titers of up to 5.2 g L\u22121 were achieved in 15- to 16-day fed-batch experiments. In 50-day perfusion cultivations, a viable cell volume of >100 mm3 mL\u22121 was maintained and more than 1 g L\u22121 d\u22121 of antibodies were harvested. The perfusion processes were automated with both cell bleed control and glucose concentration control.

A critical step in their manufacturing is viral transduction, which enables the delivery of therapeutic genes into immune cells. However, the complexity of this process presents significant challenges for optimization and scalability. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of viral transduction process in immune cell therapy manufacturing, highlighting key design considerations to support the development of safe, effective, and scalable production methods. Additionally, it examines current technological challenges in immune cell transduction and explores future innovations poised to advance the field.\n## Scaling up without compromising quality\nScaling up viral transduction while maintaining consistent efficiency and product quality poses significant challenges. While efficient transduction can be achieved at small scales, ensuring uniform outcomes in large-scale manufacturing requires addressing critical factors such as maintaining homogeneous transduction efficiency, preserving immune cell phenotype and function, and minimizing batch-to-batch variability [139,140]. \n\nTo overcome these challenges, the use of closedsystem bioreactors offers precise control over key culture conditions such as pH, temperature, cell density, and viral exposure, while maintaining sterility and minimizing contamination risks [121,122]. Additionally, the development and integration of advanced realtime monitoring technologies into bioreactors enables continuous assessment of critical parameters, such as viral titre, and allows dynamic adjustments to optimize transduction conditions [141]. The incorporation of continuous perfusion systems can also support highdensity cell culture, improving nutrient exchange and enhancing both transduction efficiency and post-transduction expansion [7]. Collectively, these innovations help facilitate the transition from laboratoryscale to commercial-scale immune cell manufacturing, addressing the complexities of large-scale viral transduction.",

While a classical simulated moving bed (SMB) system operation can typically achieve a 2-component separation between the weakly bound impurities and target species, here we present an advanced SMB approach that can achieve a 3-component separation, including the removal of the strongly bound impurities from the target species. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the enhanced removal of strongly bound host cell proteins (HCP) from the target monoclonal antibody (mAb) through the utilisation of the advanced SMB approach in a non-affinity cation exchange (CEX) capture step. In this way, 1 less polishing step was required to achieve the therapeutic requirements of < 100 ppm HCP and the overall process recovery was increased by ~ 6% compared to the corresponding process that utilised a batch CEX operation. The non-affinity CEX capture platform technology established through the utilisation of the advanced SMB approach presented here can potentially be further applied to address the downstream processing challenges presented by other challenging biotherapeutic modalities to yield a final target product with improved purity and recovery.",

The establishment of robust manufacturing platform technologies is therefore important to ensure a smooth and rapid transition from the discovery of product candidates to clinical trials and commercial production. In recent years, remarkable developments in upstream processing have led to a steady and significant increase in mAb titers [2][3][4][5]. However, the high product titers, along with the concomitant increase in host cell proteins (HCP) and other impurities [6,7] often challenge the efficiency of traditional purification methods, resulting in a shift in the manufacturing costs from upstream processing towards downstream processing [2][3][4]. As such, it is critical for further developments in downstream processing to occur so as to ensure that products of high purity can be obtained in a productive manner. \n\nOne of the promising developments in this aspect is multi-column counter current chromatography. In single column batch chromatography, there is typically an under utilization of the resin, as the loading phase is stopped before the product starts to breakthrough, so as to prevent product loss. An increase in resin utilization can be achieved in multi-column chromatography systems by having a 2 nd column to capture the target compound that breaks through from the 1 st column. Another limitation in batch chromatography is that there is often a tradeoff between purity and recovery, where impure fractions containing products may be collected or discarded accordingly in order to achieve high recovery or high purity (Fig 1A). This can however be at least partially circumvented by collecting high-purity fractions and recycling the portions where peaks overlap for another cycle of separation. An example of such a system is the simulated moving bed (SMB) system, where a two-component separation between the weakly bound species (raffinate) and the target component (extract) can typically be achieved in a classical operation [8].",

Chen, Zi Ying Zheng, Farouq Bin Mahfut, Yuansheng Yang, Masahiro Ogino, Kazuo Okada, Kohei Sato, Wei Zhang\n## Abstract\nOne of the key challenges in downstream bioprocessing is to obtain products of high purity in a productive fashion through the effective removal of process and product related impurities. While a classical simulated moving bed (SMB) system operation can typically achieve a 2-component separation between the weakly bound impurities and target species, here we present an advanced SMB approach that can achieve a 3-component separation, including the removal of the strongly bound impurities from the target species. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the enhanced removal of strongly bound host cell proteins (HCP) from the target monoclonal antibody (mAb) through the utilisation of the advanced SMB approach in a non-affinity cation exchange (CEX) capture step. In this way, 1 less polishing step was required to achieve the therapeutic requirements of < 100 ppm HCP and the overall process recovery was increased by ~ 6% compared to the corresponding process that utilised a batch CEX operation. The non-affinity CEX capture platform technology established through the utilisation of the advanced SMB approach presented here can potentially be further applied to address the downstream processing challenges presented by other challenging biotherapeutic modalities to yield a final target product with improved purity and recovery.\n## Introduction\nOne of the leading classes of biopharmaceutical therapeutics in today's market is that of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), with the mAb market size valued at USD 144 billion in 2020 and is expected to almost double by 2027 [1]. The establishment of robust manufacturing platform technologies is therefore important to ensure a smooth and rapid transition from the discovery of product candidates to clinical trials and commercial production. In recent years, remarkable developments in upstream processing have led to a steady and significant increase in mAb titers [2][3][4][5]. However, the high product titers, along with the concomitant increase in host cell proteins (HCP) and other impurities [6,7] often challenge the efficiency of traditional purification methods, resulting in a shift in the manufacturing costs from upstream processing towards downstream processing [2][3][4]. As such, it is critical for further developments in downstream processing to occur so as to ensure that products of high purity can be obtained in a productive manner. \n\nOne of the promising developments in this aspect is multi-column counter current chromatography. In single column batch chromatography, there is typically an under utilization of the resin, as the loading phase is stopped before the product starts to breakthrough, so as to prevent product loss. An increase in resin utilization can be achieved in multi-column chromatography systems by having a 2 nd column to capture the target compound that breaks through from the 1 st column. Another limitation in batch chromatography is that there is often a tradeoff between purity and recovery, where impure fractions containing products may be collected or discarded accordingly in order to achieve high recovery or high purity (Fig 1A). This can however be at least partially circumvented by collecting high-purity fractions and recycling the portions where peaks overlap for another cycle of separation. An example of such a system is the simulated moving bed (SMB) system, where a two-component separation between the weakly bound species (raffinate) and the target component (extract) can typically be achieved in a classical operation [8].",

The robustness of this technology is utilised as a standardised purification scheme to many mAbs derived from cell culture production systems. The pressure to accelerate drug development has challenged process scientists and vendors to continuously improve approaches to shorten product development timelines, ideally at reduced cost with little or no impact on product quality. This is observed in the upstream process, where improvement efforts resulting in approximately five-fold increases in mAb titres have been realised [3][4][5]. This increase in product yield has shifted the bottleneck of the production process from upstream to downstream, principally the mAb capture step [4,6]. \n\nProtein A (ProtA) resins are the mainstay for mAb capture and can constitute more than 50% of the downstream cost of mAb production [7][8][9].

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are laboratory-produced antibodies designed to target specific cells such as cancerous cells in the human body [3]. Over the years, mAbs have gained significance as essential elements in various clinical diagnostic tests, and have been used in the treatment of diverse diseases including autoimmune diseases, cancer, and infections [3], [4], [5]. \n\nWith its vital role in the pharmaceutical industry, the market size of mAbs is projected to reach an impressive $138.6 billion by 2024 [6]. However, the high annual cost of mAb treatments poses a significant challenge, as it can amount to approximately $35,000 per patient [2]. This cost is attributed to the required high doses and the expensive production process. Consequently, optimizing its production is imperative. \n\nThe majority of steps in mAb manufacturing rely on batch operations, such as batch/fed-batch culture and chromatography purification. Due to the increasing pressure to drive down cost, there is a growing interest in a transition towards a fully-continuous production process. This transition offers potential advantages, including enhanced product quality, quantity, and stability, as well as the elimination of expenses associated with storing intermediate products. In comparison, batch operations suffer from various drawbacks such as lower efficiency, higher costs, challenges in scaling up, and compromised product quality [7]. \n\nSeveral studies have explored the continuous manufacturing of mAbs [6], [8], [9]. The continuous production process can be divided into two main components: the upstream process and the downstream process. In the upstream process, a perfusion bioreactor is utilized to continuously supply nutrients for cell nourishment. In a study by Papathanasiou et al. [10], a GS-NS0 cell culture system was considered for mAb production within the bioreactor. To maintain a high cell density, a cell retention device is typically incorporated to recycle cells from the effluent stream of the bioreactor. The remaining contents are directed downstream for product purification through a number of chromatography steps. \n\nTo maintain continuous flow, the first step of the downstream process usually employs two or more chromatography columns.",

            "text": "2][3] Despite their clinical success, mAb manufacturing presents various challenges that impact their accessibility and commercial viability. Recent studies indicate that process development and manufacturing costs constitute 13%-17% of the total research and development (R&D) budget from the pre-clinical to approval stages, with material preparation costs reaching approximately 60-70 million USD for successful market entries. 4 he manufacturing of mAbs faces several critical challenges that demand immediate attention. Current production processes often suffer from inefficiencies in cell line development, media optimization, and downstream processing. 5,6 raditional batch manufacturing approaches, though well-established, frequently result in suboptimal resource utilization and extended production cycles. Furthermore, heavy reliance on expensive components, such as protein A in purification steps, contributes significantly to the overall cost of goods (COGs), with recent research demonstrating the potential of 23% cost reduction through alternative purification platforms. 7 he economic considerations in mAb manufacturing are particularly pressing given the increasing demand for these therapeutics. Production costs directly influence drug pricing and accessibility, making cost optimization a crucial factor in the industry's sustainable growth. Transitioning from traditional stainless steel facilities to single-use continuous facilities can offer up to 35% cost savings in meeting annual production demand of 100-500 kg, though this gain diminishes at higher scales. 8 iven these challenges, there is a critical need to address high production costs and process inefficiencies in mAb manufacturing. Current production methods often require substantial capital investment, face scalability challenges, and struggle with batch-to-batch consistency. These inefficiencies not only impact production economics but also affect product quality 9 and time-to-market. The industry requires innovative solutions to optimize production processes while maintaining product quality and regulatory compliance. \n\nThree main production techniques-batch, fed-batch, and continuous (perfusion) processing-present different advantages and constraints that greatly affect process economics and product quality when looking at manufacturing options for biopharmaceuticals (Figure 1). Although logistically straightforward, batch processing causes nutrition depletion and waste accumulation, which compromises product quality and causes early cell death. 10 By means of strategic feeding schedules, fed-batch processing solves these constraints; nonetheless, it creates process complexity and scale-up difficulties. 11",

Both process types comprise opposing advantages and disadvantages in areas such as plant utilization, feasible cell densities, media consumption and process monitoring effort. In this study, we show feasibility of a promising novel hybrid process strategy that combines beneficial attributes of both process formats. In detail, our strategy comprises a short duration FB, followed by a fast media exchange and cell density readjustment, marking the start of the next FB cycle. Utilizing a small-scale screening tool, we were able to identify beneficial process parameters, including FB interval duration and reinoculation cell density, that allow for multiple cycles of the outlined process in a reproducible manner. In addition, we could demonstrate scalability of the process to a 5L benchtop system, using a fluidized-bed centrifuge as scalable media exchange system. The novel process showed increased productivity (+217%) as well as longer cultivation duration, in comparison to a standard FB with a significantly lower media consumption per produced product (\u221250%) and a decreased need for process monitoring, in comparison to a perfusion cultivation. Further, the process revealed constant glycosylation pattern in comparison to the perfusion cultivation and has strong potential for further scale-up, due to the use of fully scalable cultivation and media exchange platforms. In summary, we have developed a novel hybrid process strategy that tackles the key challenges of current biomanufacturing of either low productivity or high media consumption, representing a new and innovative approach for future process intensification efforts.",

            "text": "Biopharmaceuticals enable the treatment of many serious, chronic diseases, such as various types of cancer and immunological disorders (Singh et al., 2018;Taylor et al., 2021). In recent years, efforts to develop novel therapeutic products, especially monoclonal antibodies (mAb), resulted in the approval of approximately 10 mAb-based drugs per year (The Antibody Society, 2022) and in the approval of the 100th mAb product by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2021 (Mullard, 2021). As the number of novel therapies continues to grow, more patients can be treated, increasing global demand for large quantities of affordable mAb-based drugs. \n\nHowever, current industrial mAb processes, producing over 100 kg of mAb annually, are cost-intensive with average production costs above 100 USD per gram of mAb (Gillespie, 2021;Yang et al., 2019). An inherent reason for the elaborate biomanufacturing is the complex structure of mAbs, that requires production by mammalian cells, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) suspension cell lines, which secrete the product into the medium (Reinhart et al., 2015). Thus, biomanufacturing consists of a series of cell culture steps for seed train and production (upstream process), a subsequent cell clarification step for separation of the product containing supernatant from the cells, and a multitude of purification steps using chromatographic and filtration operations (downstream process). To increase productivities and decrease the cost of goods (CoGs) of these steps, intensification and process integration is required (Pollard et al., 2016). For this purpose, various approaches are already available at research scale and well described in scientific literature (Kruse et al., 2019;M\u00fcller et al., 2022;Subramanian, 2015). \n\nA general trend that has already made its way into the production scale is the application of single-use (SU) based unit operations (UO) due to higher flexibility, lower hardware costs, and reduced setup times (Eibl & Eibl, 2019;Samaras et al., 2022).",

            "text": "GIGA-2050 is the first example of a new class of drugs, recombinant polyclonal hyperimmune globulins. Prior to this work, pioneering groups have worked on manufacturing methods for much smaller mixtures of recombinant antibodies [16]. Unlike GIGA-2050, these prior methods involved creation of separate MCBs for each mAb, followed by mixing the MCBs prior to bioproduction. For example, rozrolimupab was a mixture of 25 antibodies, whereas GIGA-2050 consists of >10,000 different antibodies. Rozrolimupab completed a Phase 2 study for treatment of primary immune thrombocytopenia [17] but has apparently been discontinued by the manufacturer. Our methods uniquely enable large-scale GMP production of mixtures of thousands of antibodies. \n\nAs multivalent antibody therapeutics, recombinant hyperimmune globulins represent a potent treatment for infectious disease that decreases the likelihood of antigenic escape. Although this is a new class of drug, it will not require construction of new manufacturing facilities; instead, we have shown that GIGA-2050 can be manufactured using existing infrastructure already in place for manufacturing of mAbs. In 2011, the global capacity for mammalian cell production in bioreactors was approximately 0.5 million liters [18]. Capacity has continued to grow over the past decade, so should the need arise, manufacturing of a recombinant hyperimmune globulin could be scaled to produce millions of doses. \n\nWe have demonstrated that a conventional mAb platform approach can be applied to a recombinant hyperimmune globulin product to achieve desired separation of aggregates and process related impurities. The platform production process has produced the GIGA-2050 drug substance and drug product lots at different scales and manufacturing sites that have demonstrated no substantial differences in the purity measurements and impurity clearance for in-process steps and analytically comparable characteristics and quality attributes of the final drug substance. In the future, we hope to apply similar methods to larger scale GMP runs, for example, bioreactors with a capacity of 1000 L or higher.",

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated the first, to our knowledge, integrated continuous bioprocess (ICB) designed for the production of acid\u2010sensitive monoclonal antibodies, prone to aggregate at low pH, on pilot scale. A high cell density perfusion culture, stably maintained at 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/ml, was integrated with the downstream process, consisting of a capture step with the recently developed Protein A ligand, ZCa; a solvent/detergent\u2010based virus inactivation; and two ion\u2010exchange chromatography steps. The use of a mild pH in the downstream process makes this ICB suitable for the purification of acid\u2010sensitive monoclonal antibodies. Integration and automation of the downstream process were achieved using the Orbit software, and the same equipment and control system were used in initial small\u2010scale trials and the pilot\u2010scale downstream process. High recovery yields of around 90% and a productivity close to 1\u2009g purified antibody/L/day were achieved, with a stable glycosylation pattern and efficient removal of impurities, such as host cell proteins and DNA. Finally, negligible levels of antibody aggregates were detected owing to the mild conditions used throughout the process. The present work paves the way for future industrial\u2010scale integrated continuous biomanufacturing of all types of antibodies, regardless of acid stability.",

            "text": "The fact that mammalian cells are relatively difficult to work with due to factors such as medium complexity, serum requirement, low yield, and shear sensitivity has important implications in terms of manufacturability and scalability of mAbs [18]. The commercial production of mAbs and other biotherapeutic products is currently based on synthesis in 5 to 20 m 3 bioreactor tanks with mammalian cells by shaking suspension culture operated in a fed-batch or perfusion mode [19][20][21]. The commercial production of mAbs in stirred tanks faces challenges related to product and process quality, such as demands for higher productivity, glycosylation control, reproducibility, as well as other process controls [19,21,22]. Most of these challenges are related to the great temporal and spatial variability of the intrinsic conditions of the fermenters. One way to improve the understanding and control of mAb production in bioreactors is to downscale the system through miniaturization in the form of microfluidic devices [23]. \n\nThere are few studies on the use of LOC-type devices to produce recombinant proteins [24]. In previous work, we have demonstrated the feasibility of the production of an anti-hIFN-\u03b12b recombinant mAb with Chinese hamster ovary, CHO, and human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells in standard-size microfluidic devices with a final volume of 32.22 \u00b5L [25]. It was possible to increase the concentration of the antibodies up to 7.3 times higher (1120 pg of mAb per cell) than that obtained by standard culture methodologies (using T-flasks). Moreover, the functional activity of the antibodies produced in the microdevice (neutralization of the cellular cytokine signaling) did not present a significant difference from those obtained in the control culture. In this context, the main objective of the present work is to scale up the production of recombinant proteins in the large-area microfluidic bioreactor (LM bioreactor). To achieve that, we developed the LM bioreactor with a novel fabrication technique [26] and we validated the technology by producing and characterizing mAbs.",

            "text": "Development of biotechnological processes in general, with a special emphasis on animal cell culture, is aimed at defining bioprocess solutions that warrant high volumetric productivity, batch-to-batch consistency and homogenous product quality at low costs [179]. Walther et al. [180] have recognized two major needs for future biomanufacturing: increased flexibility and reduced cost of goods. Construction of a manufacturing facility still represents the main cost, requiring significant time and capital. The \"village scale\" concept was proposed by van der Weele and Tramper [181], where small-scale production facilities would be desirable from the technological and societal point of view when it comes to solving the global problem of CM supply. Although operational costs for some biotechnological products have decreased considerably, operating expenses remain high for many novel and non-standard products, such as CM. The shift from batch to continuous bioprocessing offers the possibility to minimize the costs of goods and maximize flexibility, with additional benefits including simplified scale-up, standardization and more consistent product quality. This transition has been successfully implemented in many branches of biotechnological production [180], such as in the production of therapeutic proteins [182]. A similar positive framework for continuous processing was given by Fisher et al. [183] for both upstream and downstream processes, with a potential to provide production flexibility, reduce product shortages and variability, simplify scale-up procedures, improve product quality, increase productivity, reduce facility footprints, and reduce overall production costs. However, the commercial implementation of continuous mode of operation or perfusion in mammalian cell culture, as well as in CM production, has not been simple and rapid compared to microbial fermentations due to much smaller processing capacity with much higher product value, more complicated quality standards and stringent regulatory requirements for animal cell culture products [184]. Mammalian animal cell culture can be more difficult to operate and maintain desired bioprocess parameters compared to microbial fermentations due to slower growth rates, complex media systems, and more demanding requirements when it comes to process parameter controls [185].",

Despite this success, there remain opportunities to drive down the manufacturing costs of antibody-based therapies through cost efficiency measures. To reduce production costs, novel process intensification methods based on state-of-the-art fed-batch and perfusion have been implemented during the last few years. Building on process intensification, we demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a novel, innovative hybrid process that combines the robustness of a fed-batch operation with the benefits of a complete media exchange enabled through a fluidized bed centrifuge (FBC). In an initial small-scale FBC-mimic screening, we investigated multiple process parameters, resulting in increased cell proliferation and an elongated viability profile. Consecutively, the most productive process scenario was transferred to the 5-L scale, further optimized and compared to a standard fed-batch process. Our data show that the novel hybrid process enables significantly higher peak cell densities (163%) and an impressive increase in mAb amount of approximately 254% while utilizing the same reactor size and process duration of the standard fed-batch operation. Furthermore, our data show comparable critical quality attributes (CQAs) between the processes and reveal scale-up possibilities and no need for extensive additional process monitoring. Therefore, this novel process intensification strategy yields strong potential for transfer into future industrial manufacturing processes.",

Of note, the speed to clinics was considered to outweigh potential risks of increased cost of goods manufactured (COG) that might result from a cell line with low population doubling level limit that could impede the scalability to larger manufacturing scales [18]. Furthermore, advanced expression technology such as targeted integration may eventually obsolete the cell line stability study for all biologics development [14,[27][28][29][30]. \n\nFollowing MCB creation, the next milestone on critical path to IND is GMP production of drug substance. Prior to release of MCB into a GMP production facility, conventional industry practice requires biosafety tests to be performed on MCB to prevent potential crosscontamination, which will instigate costly and timeconsuming efforts in decontamination, investigation and 98 Antibody Therapeutics, 2024  [23]. \n\nAnother important feature enabling the acceleration of CMC timeline is the leverage of proven platform technologies and processes to minimize the lead times of various process development and manufacturing activities. Process development activities for biologics generally include upstream, downstream, analytical method and formulation development, while manufacturing activities commonly encompass non-GMP pilot production, GMP drug substance production and GMP drug product production and filling. The use of proven platform technologies can shorten these activities into simplistic performance and feasibility checks, without multiple rounds of sequential workflows typically performed in a traditional CMC program. For instance, Regeneron emphasized the importance of prior knowledge and platform aspects in upstream and downstream processes to achieve rapid upstream process transfers and optimization of downstream purification steps of casirivimab and imdevimab [24]. Leveraging prior downstream knowledge, screening of chromatographical process parameters were performed within a development window of only several days between the first research batch and the toxicological batch. The toxicological batch was subsequently used as the only downstream process verification batch before the production of first-in-human clinical material.",

            "text": "All manufacturing sectors face unique challenges during scaleup. There is a false narrative surrounding bioindustrial manufacturing that the ability of engineered cells to self-replicate eliminates these challenges. Scale-up of a bioindustrial manufacturing process from bench-scale to industrial-scale faces a variety of risks and unknowns, for example, the performance of a fermentation process replicated at production-relevant volumes may exhibit different behavior than predicted from much smaller volumes, depending in part on scale-down experience of the developer ( Delvigne et al., 2017 ;Marques et al., 2010 ;Micheletti et al., 2006 ;Wang et al., 2020 ) . Milliliter-scale fermentation vessels may not accurately reflect strain performance in kiloliter-scale vessels. Many unique challenges exist in downstream processing ( DSP ) . Molecular intermediates and products from fermentations must typically be purified from complex aqueous media. End products of metabolic pathways can share physicochemical properties with shunt metabolites and pathway intermediates that must be purified away using sometimes tedious and expensive separation processes. However, process-guided approaches to strain engineering, coupled with application of downstream processing modeling, can mitigate such issues. For protein-based products purification, workflows often need to maintain the three-dimensional structure throughout DSP/purification so as not to lose activity ( Hearn, 2017 ) . Lastly, because the producing organisms are selfreplicating, maintaining genetic stability is critical to maintaining production quality. The use of scale-down fermentation models can be used to validate genetic stability before going to scale, thus minimizing the potential impact on production scale-up.",

Low-pH VI in periodic batches or continuous plug-flow reactors are in general the methods of choice for postcapture antibodies (Coffman et al., 2021). Changing a process from batch to continuous purification leads to similar product quality attributes, as revealed by a comparability study using similar parameters in both process modes (David et al., 2020). This will pave the way to adapt batch processing for clinical trial production to continuous large-scale production. \n\nThe implementation of an ICB requires the full automation and control of the upstream and downstream systems. The environmental parameters in the upstream process are routinely monitored and controlled, while monitoring and control of nutrients, metabolites and proteins are approached by \"Process Analytical Technology,\" a vivid research field. The automation of the downstream process has a SCHWARZ ET AL. \n\n| 2153 different challenge in terms of the multiplicity of the units relying on different equipment and control systems to be integrated. For that purpose, we have used the research software Orbit, previously developed for the control of integrated continuous downstream bioprocesses (Andersson et al., 2017;Gomis-Fons et al., 2019;Gomis-Fons, Schwarz, et al., 2020). Orbit saves user specifications, information about the downstream sequence, process events, signals, and data, thus allowing real-time control and automation of all downstream units centralized in a single control system. Orbit also allows the implementation of complex flow paths in the chromatography systems and their synchronization, enabling simultaneous control of several systems and the integration of the downstream unit operations. \n\nThis article reports the results obtained from a pilot-scale ICB with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) produced in a 30 L high cell density perfusion bioreactor and simultaneous purification by a continuous downstream system.",

            "text": "David et al 18 conducted a thorough side-by-side comparability research where continuous downstream processing showed equivalent product quality attributes to conventional batch processing with notable benefits. By 6-fold and chromatography resin use by 2.4-fold compared to fed-batch platforms, the study found that continuous manufacturing drastically cut buffer consumption. Moreover, they showed that changing from batch to continuous processing had no appreciable effect on final drug substance properties like stability profiles, processrelated contaminants, and product quality parameters. This highlights the possibility of using constant manufacturing at any level of the product life. Botelho Ferreira et al 19 also showed another creative way by effectively using the current fed-batch infrastructure for continuous processing, thereby implementing a hybrid manufacturing technique. Their approach performed perfusion operation in a 200-L single-use bioreactor using downstream processes intended for future continuous manufacturing platform compatibility. By allowing 2.1 kg of monoclonal antibody to be produced in two GMP runs, this method showed that \"existing fed-batch infrastructure can be adapted to continuous manufacturing without significant additional investments\". Cha et al 20  commercial-scale production, determining that perfusion cultures attained 1.6-fold higher peak viable cell density with longer culture duration, thus generating a total product amount increase of over 450% while improving purification yield. Their economic study indicated that perfusion mode might lower the cost of goods while preserving product quality, therefore demonstrating its feasibility as a practical method of commercial antibody manufacturing. The choice of these manufacturing approaches depends on various factors, such as production scale, facility constraints, and economic objectives. While continuous processing shows promise of cost reduction and improved efficiency, batch processing maintains advantages in regulatory compliance and operational simplicity. Hybrid systems offer a balanced approach, particularly suitable for facilities requiring flexibility in production capacity and product types.",

(2022). The upstream process consisted of a high cell-density perfusion bioreactor with a membrane system for production of clear cell-free supernatant. \n\nBetween the upstream process and the downstream process there was a harvest tank making it possible to disconnect the downstream process for up to 20 h. Under normal conditions, the feed flow rate to the downstream process was set for the control of the liquid amount in the harvest tank, meaning that the production rate in the complete process was controlled by the perfusion rate selected in the upstream process. \n\nThe downstream process consisted by four units; continuous periodic counter-current chromatography system (PCC) for antibody capture, a viral inactivation unit (VI) based on two parallel batch reactors, one cation exchange chromatography step in bind-andelute mode mainly for aggregate removal and finally one anionexchange chromatography step in flow-through mode for final polishing. The PCC and the loading of VI was configured on one \u00c4KTA setup and the VI control together with the IEX polishing train on a second \u00c4KTA setup. Each setup was controlled by an installation of the research software Orbit, through the Unicorn control system for the \u00c4KTA system. The lab-scale process was operated continuously for 9 days and the pilot-scale process for 19 days.",

Here, the Z Ca resin is applied in an ICB on pilot scale for the first time, as part of a three-column PCC setup, with the subsequent VI step, based on a solvent/ detergent method to avoid subjecting the antibodies to low pH throughout the process, and two polishing steps (Figure 1). High productivity and resin utilization are combined with mild purification of antibodies using this high-capacity, calciumdependent resin. Moreover, the ability to remove process and product-related impurities is here evaluated on pilot scale. \n\nAlthough the mAb used in this study was not particularly prone to aggregation at low pH, it provided a good model to assess the performance of the pilot-scale process. The ICB proposed in this study was developed through collaborative effort between academia and industry with expertise in cell culture and purification process development, protein-ligand design for chromatography and process automation. The feasibility for long-term continuous process operation was validated at first in a small-scale run with a 200 ml bioreactor. After final optimizations for enhancing process robustness, the ICB was scaled up by a volumetric factor of 150, using the same equipment for the downstream process, thus allowing a smooth and easy scale-up. \n\nThe pilot-scale process was then successfully run in a test-bed facility for biological production.",

            "text": "In recent years, with the development and application of proteomics technology, the development of large-scale culture of animal cells for antibody drug production has devolved from the simple optimization of some process parameters to the recent omics research, e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics, and fluxomics. The complex metabolic network of production cells and production mechanism of recombinant antibodies have gradually become clear. Raab et al. developed a cell line through genetic engineering by a novel bottom-up microRNA (miRNA) screening approach for optimizing the production and secretion of therapeutic antibodies (Raab et al., 2022). At present, the expression level and quality control of recombinant antibodies has always been one of the important bottlenecks restricting the development of antibody drugs. \n\nThe high-efficiency expression and quality of recombinant antibodies can be affected by multiple factors, which can be achieved by genetic engineering, including the optimization of antibody gene sequence, construction of efficient expression vector, optimization of antibody expression system, modification of antibody host cells, and glycosylation site modification (Table 3). The application of these optimization strategies can effectively shorten the time of antibody generation and improve the expression of target antibodies. However, different optimization strategies have advantages and disadvantages, and how to effectively integrate these optimization strategies to make it an efficient operation system needs further study. Under different process conditions, the differences in the yield of recombinant antibodies by the production cell lines can be analyzed from the levels of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, laying a solid foundation for large-scale cell culture processes. In the future, the large-scale production of recombinant antibodies and development of culture processes will develop rapidly in the direction of stabilizing production capacity and improving quality. Furthermore, big data and multi-omics technologies are also beneficial to provide new research directions, more and more process analytical technologies are applied to cell culture processes, which will provide more ideas for improving the efficiency of recombinant antibodies. Therefore, the focus shifts towards how to control the quality of recombinant antibody drugs scientifically and rationally, researchers should further combine the clinical evaluation and post-market safety monitoring, and continue to explore quality control.",

While efficient transduction can be achieved at small scales, ensuring uniform outcomes in large-scale manufacturing requires addressing critical factors such as maintaining homogeneous transduction efficiency, preserving immune cell phenotype and function, and minimizing batch-to-batch variability [139,140]. \n\nTo overcome these challenges, the use of closedsystem bioreactors offers precise control over key culture conditions such as pH, temperature, cell density, and viral exposure, while maintaining sterility and minimizing contamination risks [121,122]. Additionally, the development and integration of advanced realtime monitoring technologies into bioreactors enables continuous assessment of critical parameters, such as viral titre, and allows dynamic adjustments to optimize transduction conditions [141]. The incorporation of continuous perfusion systems can also support highdensity cell culture, improving nutrient exchange and enhancing both transduction efficiency and post-transduction expansion [7]. Collectively, these innovations help facilitate the transition from laboratoryscale to commercial-scale immune cell manufacturing, addressing the complexities of large-scale viral transduction.",

            "text": "A major fraction of the costs in biopharmaceutical manufacturing are for drug discovery and process development. Infrastructure costs are very difficult to quantify because they often depend on whether a greenfield facility or an existing, depreciated facility is used or adapted for a new product. To accelerate process development, what is known as a \"platform process\" has been introduced. A platform process works for a family of biopharmaceutical products and has been implemented mainly with antibody drugs (Shukla et al., 2007). In a platform process, the individual steps and their sequence are identical. No two biopharmaceuticals are the same and therefore, as a compromise, either modifications are introduced, or the yield and economics of the process are often killed to maintain the standard platform process. This compromise may lead to suboptimal processes that are then later operated at full scale, as each step is subordinated to time-to-market. Biopharmaceuticals are still manufactured in batch mode, primarily because it is a highly regulated industry. Despite the large number of different biopharmaceuticals and the diversity of molecules, the number of applied unit operations is still manageable. \n\nIn terms of recovery, the concept of capture purification and polishing is established everywhere. Essentially, only a handful of processes are used, such as microfiltration and centrifugation for harvest and solid-liquid separation, chromatography for capture, purification, and polishing, and to a lesser extent precipitation and flocculation for capture. Often buffers are exchanged by ultradiafiltration, which is also commonly used for formulation. Unique to the industry is the expectation of virus clearance to mitigate the potential presence of endogenous to producing cells and/or adventitious virus that can be introduced to the process through cell substrates, raw materials or other inputs during the manufacture of the therapeutic products. Through process optimization over the past decade with emphasis on increasing bioreactor titers and optimizing the process, a cost of goods of antibodies as low as $70 per g has been reported (Hammerschmidt et al., 2014;Love et al., 2013). This is only possible because antibody production is platformable. Much higher COGs have been reported for other products.",

Otherwise, more inputs could be defined (Wohlenberg et al. 2022) or the process could be made more versatile in general, for example, by including other operating modes such as continuous (perfusion mode) or semicontinuous feeding (Schellenberg 2023). The integration of additional sensors for online or inline monitoring would also be ideal to monitor as many parameters/inputs as possible and to be able to determine their influence on the process performance. This would also raise the amount of data for training of the algorithm. \n\nTo investigate whether the conditions optimized in this study and the associated increase in mAb titer can also be achieved in other reactor systems, especially on a larger scale, it would be useful to scale up this process in the next steps to a range of 2-10 L, for example. This would clarify the scale-up behavior and applicability of these suggested cultivation conditions. In addition, the antibody produced under optimized conditions could subsequently be purified using the standard downstream steps and the bioactivity investigated to determine whether there are any effects caused by the upstream process. However, it has been shown already that changes in the production part of this established mAb production process do not significantly affect the bioactivity of the antibody (Wohlenberg et al. 2022;Wohlenberg et al. 2023).",

Well researched technologies include continuous chromatography [101,104], clarification technologies [105] and viral inactivation [106] and tools include microbial engineering [103] and specialist microorganisms [107].

            "text": "Mass production of blockbuster marketed drugs was mainstream in the biopharmaceutical CDMO industry in the early 2000s. In recent years, however, the pipelines of biologics, such as rare diseases, have increased (Lu et al., 2020), which favors production schemes with a wider variety and smaller quantity. As a result, the demand for highly flexible single-use reactors has been increased (Jacquemart et al., 2016). Single-use equipment is disposable equipment made from plastic and is mainly used for the upstream process of biological production. Because each lot of production is prepared with new single-use equipment, cleaning and the accompanying validation are not required. Thus, production can be started faster than in stainless bioreactors. It has been demonstrated that there is no difference in product quality between single-use and stainless-steel reactors (Beck et al., 2020). \n\nHigh-density culture or continuous culture methods have attracted attention as another technology in the upstream process to reduce capital costs and improve productivity (Jyothilekshmi and Jayaprakash, 2021). Continuous production allows for large quantities of culture in small facilities. Moreover, by continuous medium replacement, the concentrations of metabolites, such as lactic acid or ammonia, are kept low, increasing the lifetime of cells. Continuous culture may improve product quality. The perfusion process produces significantly lower bispecific antibody aggregates compared to the fed-batch process (Sinharoy et al., 2020). \n\nBy cell engineering and the optimization of the culture process, antibody productivity has significantly increased up to approximately 10 g/L culture. Accordingly, the downstream process has been optimized (Chahar et al., 2020). The general first step in antibody purification is affinity chromatography using resin-conjugating protein A, which binds to the antibody's constant region. This step requires a large amount of the expensive protein A resin, raising production costs (Xenopoulos, 2015). The continuous chromatography method has attracted attention to solve this problem. Fedorenko et al. (2020) developed continuous countercurrent tangential chromatography (CCTC), which efficiently purifies antibodies with a smaller amount of column resin.",

The total run time could have been extended since no sign of deterioration of the process performance was observed until the end of the run. The steady-state operation of the perfusion bioreactor ensured a continuous flow of harvest with consistent product quality and relatively stable mAb titer. The culture process was designed to reduce the time devoted to the cell expansion, ensure high mAb productivity, low medium renewal and high cell viability during the steady-state phase at very high cell density of 100 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml. Thanks to the present rational approach for the selection of the medium, feed concentrates, glucose concentration and renewal rate, a healthy culture with a low level of the toxic by-product lactate was obtained at low CSPR. Furthermore, the whole upstream process from the perfusion seed culture to the production bioreactor was performed with single-use equipment. \n\nA novel downstream process was integrated for the continuous purification of mAb under mild conditions using the novel Protein A ligand, Z Ca , which enables elution with a sodium chloride buffer at close to neutral pH. The feasibility of Z Ca for antibody capture, connected to a subsequent VI step using a solvent/detergentbased method instead of acid, was successfully demonstrated for the first time in a continuous downstream process on pilot scale.",

            "text": "By means of strategic feeding schedules, fed-batch processing solves these constraints; nonetheless, it creates process complexity and scale-up difficulties. 11 With cost savings of roughly 35% for annual production demand between 100 and 500 kg, continuous processing achieves the highest cell densities (50-100\u00d710 6 cells/mL vs 15-25\u00d710 6 cells/mL for fed-batch) and volumetric productivity (0.5-2.0 g/L/day vs 0.2-0.5 g/L/day for fed-batch) as shown in Table 1. \n\nThe advantages of certain fermentation techniques in biopharmaceutical manufacturing are rather well supported by recent studies. A particularly successful technique for improving product yields in recombinant proteins manufacture has been Fed-batch fermentation. Mendes et al 12 revealed that fed-batch bioreactor production of recombinant BCG showed enhanced specific growth rates after day 4 in pH 7.4-controlled cultures, hence lowering the cultivation time relative to simple batch processing. Their research also showed that fed-batch samples showed substantial recovery of viable cell counts post-lyophilization, implying that extra nutrient supplementation during fermentation may protect cells during downstream processing. Continuous fermentation techniques have many interesting benefits for maximizing output. Continuous fermentation of penicillium brevicompactum achieved notably better productivity (0.025 g/L/h) of mycophenolic acid compared to fed-batch (0.007 g/L/h) and batch fermentation (0.006 g/L/h), Anand and Srivastava 13 found in their comparative investigation. With an ideal dilution rate of 0.015 h-1, their studies found that continuous culture essentially reduced substrate inhibitory effects and preserved the organism in a stronger adaptive condition. Though they remain vulnerable to contamination difficulties, Yi 14 pointed out that continuous fermentation systems run free through constant or occasional injection of fresh nutrient medium without any limits. These results imply that, with suitable application of continuous processing technologies, similar efficiency benefits could be obtained in monoclonal antibody production. \n\nThis review aims to comprehensively evaluate current manufacturing approaches, analyze cost reduction strategies, and assess emerging technologies in mAb production.",

            "text": "Both Yongky et al. 19 and Mah\u00e9 et al. 9 report sizable titer increases up to 200% as compared with low inoculation processes. This agrees with the highest titer increases achieved in this study (average of 170% increase) when comparing the 12-day titers of the HID and LID processes. Further, the highest titers achieved using the intensified platform presented in this study are between 9 and 10 g/L in a 12-day process, which are aligned with the highest titers reported in literature using a fed-batch paradigm. 5,9 though intensification of the bioreactor process can increase titers and therefore decrease the cost of goods of the bioreactor step, the cost of goods of the drug substance is driven by the entire bioprocess, including the downstream product purification process. Two potential challenges for the downstream process associated with this intensified upstream process are increased cell densities and increased harvest titers. Notably, in the process presented in this study, the peak viable cell concentrations were similar in the LID and HID processes for the same clone (data not shown), thus did not create an increased challenge for cell removal. The total integrated viable cell concentration is elevated in the HID process; therefore, one may expect an increase in host cell protein upon harvest. The elevated titers from the HID process can create a bottleneck for the capture step. Connecting the HID process with intensified capture technologies, such as higher binding capacity resins, and simulated moving bed chromatography, have been used to increase the capture step capacity to handle increased bioreactor titers. 25 Overall, although downstream bottlenecks can arise when intensifying upstream bioreactor processes, some of these can be addressed by adoption of new technologies for limiting unit operations. Continuing innovation in downstream technologies is needed to continue to keep pace with upstream titer increases. \n\nAll clones and products accessed for product quality achieved comparable aggregate levels and purity in both the HID and the control LID process indicating that the HID process does not detrimentally impact these attributes. Some differences in the charge variant profiles were observed and differences in culture duration may have an impact. Previous studies have shown that longer culture durations can lend to a higher proportion of acidic species and a lower proportion of main peak species. 26",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and derived products such as antibody-drug conjugates, Fcfusion proteins and antibody fragments, are widely used in many diagnostic and therapeutic applications [1]. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the most commonly used host for industrial mAb production, accounting for 84% of currently approved products [2]. mAb yield increased from 50 mg/L in 1986 to 3-10 g/L in 2010s as a result of a variety of genetic and process optimisation techniques that led to increased cell density and specific mAb productivity [3][4][5]. However, achieving higher cell densities has also led to the accumulation of cell-derived impurities over culture duration, posing challenges for downstream separation [6,7]. \n\nHost cell proteins (HCPs) are a heterogeneous mixture of proteins secreted by viable cells and intracellular proteins released from dead and lysed cells toward the end of the culture [7]. \n\nIn their majority, HCPs are removed in the downstream step of protein A affinity chromatography, however, some persist after this unit operation and their removal requires further chromatographic separation steps [8]. Certain HCPs have proteolytic activity and can cause product fragmentation (and subsequent aggregation) while others can lead to immunogenic responses in patients if not fully removed [6]. The concentration and properties of residual HCPs present in process intermediates and the drug product are therefore of significant interest [9,10]. \n\nHCP concentration typically increases with cell culture duration and correlates with the number of dead cells, even though HCPs are also known to be secreted by viable cells [6,11]. Although the goal of upstream operations has typically been to increase yield, which often involves improved feeding regimes to increase culture longevity, this is not necessarily beneficial from the point of view of downstream processing effort and cost. The ability to quantify the trade-off between increased yield and raised purification effort could therefore support decision-making during process development, such as optimal harvest time. Including the level of impurities in upstream process models paves the way for multi-objective optimisation of both upstream processing steps and the entire flowsheet to reduce the process development and manufacturing cost of therapeutic proteins and increase overall process efficiency.",

However, the cost of many mAbs is still prohibitive (>$50,000 per patient per year), significantly limiting the accessibility of these life-saving therapeutics (Hernandez et al., 2018). \n\nRecently, several regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration, have encouraged the adoption of continuous bioprocessing as a way to reduce costs and improve manufacturing flexibility and product quality (Konstantinov & Cooney, 2015;Pollock et al., 2017;Zydney, 2016). The use of perfusion bioreactors for continuous production of biological products is well-established; Hernandez (2015) noted that approximately 19 marketed recombinant proteins/mAbs were produced using perfusion systems at the time of that assessment. However, the industry continues to rely predominantly on fed-batch processes (Bielser et al., 2018), and the integration with continuous downstream processing has been more challenging. \n\nThe large increase in mAb titers that has been achieved in upstream processes over the past decade (Shukla et al., 2017) has generated renewed interest in using targeted precipitation as a lowcost alternative for mAb purification (Hammerschmidt et al., 2014;Pons Royo et al., 2023). Several recent studies have demonstrated the robustness and stability of mAb precipitation from clarified cell culture fluids (CCF) in a tubular flow precipitation reactor (Burgstaller et al., 2019;Dutra et al., 2020;Hammerschmidt et al., 2014Hammerschmidt et al., , 2016;;Li et al., 2019;Pons Royo et al., 2023). Pons Royo et al. (2023) reported a 53% reduction in costs for mAb precipitation compared to initial capture using Protein A periodic countercurrent chromatography.",

            "text": "[19]. This reduces the predictive value, complicates procedures and increases the cost of therapeutic glycoprotein production, besides making it tougher to distinguish between wild-type and mutant reporters [20]. There are numerous approaches to generate stable expressing cell lines while eliminating clonal variance. They include the use of site-specific recombinases, which comprises of Cre and Flp, as well as homologous recombination, which for example comprises of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Although the latest technologies include combining a few of the prior mentioned systems to provide a system without any limitations that come with exploiting just a system. For instance, the novel \"Cas-Pi\" system, which means cascaded precise integration and the usage of hybrid enzymes such as Flp-TAL recombinases [21,22]. Furthermore, there are strategies to be adopted to increase antibody yield. The expression vector can be designed to increase expression with high expressing promoters such as pCMV or pCNA [23]. Cell culture temperature, which is slightly hypothermic was proven to cause a rise in transgene expression [15]. Furthermore, hyperosmolality which can be achieved with either continued supplementation of feeds and build-up of metabolic waste or salt supplementation can increase gene expression levels [24]. There is an increase in specific volumetric productivity when the cells are at their largest [25]. Lastly, downstream processing is the last step in antibody production and choice of purification system determines the quality of the final antibody product.\n\nAll in all, this review highlights the importance of antibodies and several strategies to increase mass production in a time efficient and cost-effective manner. However, there is still limited data to verify the effectiveness of the aforementioned strategies and more studies can be done to consolidate these systems for industrial production. It is undeniable that there will be more strategies, systems, and pipelines expanded to further improve biopharmaceutical production.",

            "text": "biomanufacturing of these drugs and related ones (like bispecific antibodies and single-chain antibodies). Some factors include improving the accessibility of these medicines for global populations (Kelley, Renshaw, and Kamarck 2021), increasing requirements for sustainable bioprocessing (Lalor et al. 2019), reducing time to market as a key business advantage, and responding rapidly to global events like pandemics (Brady and Love 2021). For example, the high cost of goods manufactured (COGSm), which today can range from $30-100 per gram of antibody (Shukla and Th\u00f6mmes 2010), is one of two major constraints to access of these medicines in low-and middleincome countries (LMICs); indeed, 80% of all doses for registered products are administered only in North America and Europe (IAVI/Wellcome 2020). Corporate commitments to reduce carbon footprints and geopolitical interests for enabling a circular bioeconomy also underscore the importance for continued developments to intensify, consolidate and reduce energy, water, and raw materials used in bioprocessing (Bunnak et al. 2016;Pietrzykowski et al. 2013). Finally, accelerated development demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic showed the potential to reduce the time from discovery to firstin-human clinical trials to 4-6 months, albeit with significant corporate and regulatory cooperation (Kelley, 2020). These examples emphasize the possibility for more rapid development, clinical assessment, and commercialization of innovative new biopharmaceuticals. Together, these factors motivate the need for continued innovations in the approaches to manufacture mAbs (and other recombinant proteins) with shorter development timelines, lower production costs, and improved sustainability. \n\nThe existing infrastructure to manufacture therapeutic mAbs has evolved through the continuous improvement of now standardized \"platform\" processes using CHO cells (Kelley, Kiss, and Laird 2018). The space-time yields for state-of-the-art fed-batch processes can reach ~0.2-0.5 g/L/day with fully continuous processing achieving up to ~2-4 g/L/day (Kelley, Kiss, and Laird 2018;Mahal, Branton, and Farid 2021).",

In response, the industry is actively exploring integrated continuous biomanufacturing, which combines a continuous upstream process with some or all downstream process operations (Arnold et al., 2019;Coffman et al., 2021;Coolbaugh et al., 2021;Natarajan et al., 2024;Warikoo et al., 2012). This shift from fed-batch to perfusion cell culture processes is essential for enabling continuous biomanufacturing, leading to stable operation with extended production times and increased productivity, while also improving product quality and reducing product residence times (Bielser et al., 2018;Chotteau, 2015). Recent efforts have focused on developing, optimizing, and improving perfusion processes for production cell lines (Bielser et al., 2019;Clincke et al., 2013a;Clincke et al., 2013b;Romann et al., 2023;Wolf et al., 2018;Wolf et al., 2019). Still, little attention has been given to the critical step of cell clone screening and selection of the lead clone. The aim of screening during cell line development is to narrow down thousands of individual cell line candidates (referred to as \"cell clones\") to a single top clone that expresses the therapeutic protein with desired product quality attributes.",

            "text": "Recombinant adeno\u2010associated virus (rAAV) has emerged as an attractive gene delivery vector platform to treat both rare and pervasive diseases. With more and more rAAV\u2010based therapies entering late\u2010stage clinical trials and commercialization, there is an increasing pressure on the rAAV manufacturing process to accelerate drug development, account for larger trials, and commercially provide high doses. Still, many of the pre\u2010clinical and clinical manufacturing processes are tied to outdated technologies, which results in substantial production expenses. Those processes face challenges including low productivity and difficult scalability, which limits its ability to provide for required dosages which in turn influences the accessibility of the drug. And as upstream efforts are expected to increase productivities, the downstream part needs to adapt with more scalable and efficient technologies. In this review, both traditional and novel rAAV downstream technologies are presented and discussed. Traditional rAAV downstream processes are based on density gradient ultracentrifugation and have been shown to effectively purify rAAVs with high yields and purities. However, those processes lack scalability and efficiency, which is why novel rAAV downstream processes based on column\u2010chromatography have emerged as an attractive alternative and show potential for integration in continuous processes, following the principle of next\u2010generation manufacturing.",

            "text": "As the production of therapeutic proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), are being produced at increasingly larger scales, the industry is moving towards continuous processing to achieve increased efficiency [1]. The implementation of perfusion culture methods offers greater productivity, a smaller facility footprint and reduced cost of goods [2] but widespread uptake of the technology has been hindered by high risk of batch failure and by the complexity of set-up. Recent technological advancements have led to reduced failure rates, increased the productivity of perfusion cultures and reduced batch to batch variability when compared to fed-batch [3,4]. Additionally, the long-term steady-state perfusion culture operation ensures consistent product quality [5], which has led to regulatory bodies to drive initiatives to promote the implementation of continuous biomanufacturing [6]. \n\nIt has been suggested that the success of perfusion culture methodologies relies on the ability to reduce perfusion rate, ideally to rates below 1 vessel volume per day (VVD) [7]. This ensures the achievement of high titers using minimal liquid throughput, thus reducing the operating costs. In order to achieve a reduction in perfusion rate, cell lines must be carefully selected, and media optimized to ensure appropriate nutritional depth and osmolality. The use of high-throughput mL-scale devices offer the possibility to select the best-performing cell lines and conduct media studies by running experiments in parallel, thus reducing timescales and costs associated with early phase development. While devices like microwell plates and micro-bioreactors have been widely used for fed-batch cultures, equivalent platforms for perfusion culture are still in development. As perfusion operation requires optimisation of multiple process parameters, this can be a resource-intensive and low-throughput when performed in L-scale benchtop bioreactors. As an alternative, pseudo perfusion in shake flasks, spin tubes or microwell plates is often used. \n\nA few examples of these pseudo-perfusion systems have previously been described, with discrete media exchange and cell retention incorporated into pre-existing fed-batch processes for CHO cell culture.",

            "text": "An antibody is a protein used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects called antigens. Using the ability to bind various target molecules, many antibody drugs have been developed and put on the market (Lu et al., 2020). Antibodies consist of two polypeptide chains, a heavy (H) and a light (L) chain, each of which is composed of two regions, a constant region (C) and a variable region (V). The complementaritydetermining region (CDR) of the variable region is essential to the ability of the antibody to bind to its intended target. Most antibody drugs are humanized antibodies that are constructed by transplanting the CDR from mouse monoclonal antibodies into human antibodies, indicating that antibody drugs share almost the same physical and chemical properties. Therefore, it is possible to standardize the manufacturing process of antibody drugs. The general flow of antibody drug manufacturing platforms is composed of upstream and downstream processes. The upstream process is comprised of processes of producing a cell line and culturing the cell line in a bioreactor, and the downstream process is comprised of processes of purifying the produced antibody component from culture media, inactivating the virus, and filling it as a pharmaceutical substance (Gronemeyer et al., 2014). Most of the processes are batch-type and are controlled by good manufacturing practice (GMP) production processes at pharmaceutical manufacturing sites. Because the antibody manufacturing process is standardized, it results in the standardization of manufacturing equipment, peripheral auxiliary materials, and raw material systems. The standardization of antibody manufacture has made it easier for biopharmaceutical companies to outsource their manufacturing to biopharmaceutical CDMOs (Lakhdar et al., 2007). \n\nAs mentioned in the previous chapter, the foundries of the semiconductor industry have established the position in which semiconductor manufacturing technology is equal to or better than the IDM by acquiring novel technology and accumulating proven track records of the manufacture of semiconductor devices. We believe that biopharmaceutical CDMOs can provide manufacturing technology of the same quality as pharmaceutical companies. To establish a similar position to the foundry in the semiconductor industry, it will be important for biopharmaceutical CDMOs to acquire and develop distinctive manufacturing technologies.",

            "text": "Integrated continuous biomanufacturing of therapeutic proteins has gained a lot of interest over the past decade in the biopharmaceutical industry. In an integrated continuous bioprocess (ICB), a perfusion bioreactor with a mammalian cell line is coupled to a continuous downstream process (DSP). With increasing volumetric productivities from high cell density perfusion cultures and improved resin utilization in continuous chromatography, it offers potential economic benefits over conventional batch processing strategies (Pollock et al., 2017). Uncertainties in future market demands of biotherapeutic products have further led to questioning the lack of flexibility of large-scale stainless-steel plants (Walther et al., 2015). For example, the outbreak of a pandemic, such as recently the coronavirus disease , can lead to capacity limitations of antibody production in fed-batch processes (Coffman et al., 2021). \n\nThe much faster implementation of an ICB in comparison to the construction of a new large-scale stainless-steel plant, allows for a rapid response in manufacturing to such public health threats. Scaleout of several ICB units run in parallel as well as increase in total run time of the process, can rapidly be achieved if the demand for a biotherapeutic product changes (FDA, 2019), thus offering greater flexibility than traditional batch processes. This paradigm shift to integrated and continuous processing has been further expanded by including the design principles of using only single-use equipment, closed processing and a \"ballroom arrangement\" in the new \"biofacility of the future\" (Klutz et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Since biopharmaceuticals are highly prone to denaturation and degradation events, as well as to modifications in their amino acid and sugar patterns, the manufacturing conditions must be strictly controlled (Kesik-Brodacka, 2018;Lin et al., 2021). As such, welldesigned stabilization systems/excipients for these biomolecules are required to guarantee their long-term stability and preservation. Notwithstanding their outstanding properties, the IP protection and the regulatory approval pathways for biopharmaceuticals are more complex due to their manufacturing processes, since the characterization of the target drug and the evaluation of the reproducibility and safety of the production approach are mandatory (Tavares et al., 2019). Moreover, biopharmaceuticals are more expensive to produce (average production cost per pack was ca. U.S. $60 for biopharmaceuticals, in contrast with U.S. $5 per pack of small-molecule drugs) (Makurvet, 2021). A representative overview of the biomanufacturing of mAbs, including all steps required in the upstream and downstream stages, is provided in Figure 3. The upstream processing starts with the cell culture in optimal conditions designed to assure the proper cell growth in the culture media (Jozala et al., 2016;Hong et al., 2018). This process is then scaled up through a sequence of various bioreactor stages; the obtained cell mass is then transferred to the final bioreactor to allow the expression and production of the target biomolecule (Shukla and Th\u00f6mmes, 2010;Hong et al., 2018). Afterwards, cells and cell debris are separated from the culture broth by a sequence of cell harvesting steps, involving centrifugation and/or filtration approaches, to obtain a clarified broth (Shukla and Th\u00f6mmes, 2010;Jozala et al., 2016;Hong et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Furthermore, a lack of downstream processing technologies appropriate for the largest production scales was clearly identified, indicating that further improvement of the existing technologies was required, coupled with better process logistics, such as staggered upstream processing. \n\nWeil and coworkers established a BEM for simulating the manufacture of autologous hiPSC-derived progenitor photoreceptors [47]. Its main concern was the technoeconomic optimization of the affinity purification technology employed at the end of this bioprocess. Three technologies were compared, namely fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS), magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) and SpheriTech beads, for several production scales. Purification was shown to account for only roughly 10% of the total CoG, while differentiation accounted for approximately 50%. Despite this, the technical performance of the selected purification technologies had a significant retroactive impact on differentiation costs, since the number of cells required at the end of differentiation depends directly on the purification yield. FACS was found to be economically favorable for the smaller production scales, whereas MACS clearly outperformed the other technologies for larger SpheriTech beads were incapable of competing with the better established FACS and MACS mostly because of their relatively poor yield. This notwithstanding, it was determined that if their yield were to be at least mildly improved, SpheriTech beads could readily present themselves as the superior alternative. \n\nMisener et al. developed a BEM which accurately predicted erythropoietic maturation of RBCs derived from HSCs in a dual hollow-fiber bioreactor [48]. The model was geared towards the optimization of bioreactor design and operation, combining several complex mathematical tools, such as stem cell fate modeling, computational fluid dynamics and superstructure optimization, for this purpose. It was determined that an optimal bioreactor design would lead to a cost of $277 per unit of RBCs, reducing the production cost by a factor of 4 comparatively to the bioreactor design before optimization. A more robust solution, inoculated against uncertainty, would lead to a cost of $383 per unit of RBCs. Even so, the results obtained with the bioreactor compared very favorably with traditional 2D static culture from an economic perspective.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are proteins that specifically recognize antigenic epitopes [1] and thus have great potential for targeted therapeutic uses [2]. For instance, mAbs are used to alleviate autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis [3,4] and rheumatoid arthritis [5][6][7] or for the treatment of cancer [8,9]. mAbs are preferably produced in mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, since these cells generate the most human-like glycosylation patterns and thereby support immunogenic safety and efficacy [10]. While the upstream process for mAb production in CHO cells has been intensively studied and well-optimized (e.g., product titer, process costs, quality, etc.) [11][12][13], much less optimization has been achieved in the downstream process (e.g., mAb recovery and purification). This is in large part because the downstream procedure is much more complex in nature. Currently, several different chromatography steps in batch mode are recommended in order to obtain a high-quality mAb product. These steps typically include Protein A-based affinity chromatography, which is applied to the clarified supernatant and captures antibodies by binding the Fc-fragment of immunoglobulin [14,15]. In contrast, other components-such as cell debris or host cell proteins (HCP)-flow through the chromatographic unit (CU) unimpeded [16]. Additional chromatographic steps (e.g., ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction) are typically applied to remove remaining impurities like HCPs, residual nucleic acid, and aggregates [17,18]. \n\nBatch chromatography can, however, only keep up with the increasing titers of the upstream process to a limited extent [19]. The primary reason for this inefficiency is that the columns are often loaded only up to 10% product breakthrough (due to the risk of product loss). To alleviate this issue, multi-column approaches within a continuous chromatography system are usually deployed, and the columns are loaded via a continuous or semi-continuous feed stream.",

            "text": "The objective of vaccine manufacturing process development is to identify an optimum design that can consistently achieve production and purity targets with limited costs and time, while adhering to regulatory standards. \n\nIn line with the PAT framework and QbD principles, process development begins with heuristic risk analysis and qualitative assessment to screen parameters. This is succeeded by scale-down multivariate experiments, utilizing statistical methods to define the design space. Subsequent scale-up studies, encompassing monitoring and control, ensure replicable and consistent process performance at commercial scales. \n\nThe upstream process involves fermentation of starting material, which, in most cases, is generated based on cell bank derivation and characterization guidelines (ICH Q5D [19]). The objective of upstream process development is to increase product yield and expression rate while maintaining quality by evaluating and optimizing cell metabolism and fermentation process conditions [20]. This is typically done using a scale-down approach, where the impact of commercial-scale dynamic conditions on cell metabolism is studied in laboratory setups and the information is used for scale-up optimization and validation [21]. Downstream process development, with chromatography as the main step, aims to achieve a target purification level and involves evaluation of optimal resin type, buffer conditions that allow optimal binding of proteins to resins, optimal elution conditions, and process robustness [22]. The design space is typically explored using empirical approaches involving laboratory experiments [23]. \n\nThe scale-down experimentation approach (for both upstream and downstream processes) enables the use of advanced high-throughput experimentation (HTE) methods to screen a larger number of process parameters using design of experiments (DoE) and response surface model [24,25]. However, this approach requires significant experimental efforts, offers limited process understanding during the development phase, and might even lead to a suboptimal process design as the scaledown setups might lack accurate representation of conditions in the large-scale. Moreover, while the complexity of the purification process is greatly influenced by cell cultivation conditions, it is common practice to optimize upstream and downstream processes separately [23], which further contributes to a suboptimal design.",

The analysis addresses critical challenges in current manufacturing processes while evaluating innovative solutions to improve production efficiency and economic viability. Methods We conducted a comprehensive analysis of recent literature on mAb manufacturing, examining traditional batch processing, continuous processing, and hybrid systems. The review evaluates cost optimization strategies, including media development and process integration, while assessing the impact of emerging technologies, such as machine learning and advanced analytics, on manufacturing efficiency. Results Recent studies demonstrate that continuous processing can achieve up to 35% cost savings compared to traditional batch processing to meet an annual production demand of 100\u2013500 kg, though this gain diminishes at larger scales. Hybrid facilities show accelerated break-even points, reaching profitability 2\u20132.5 years earlier than traditional facilities. Advanced media optimization strategies, incorporating novel tripeptide delivery methods, have demonstrated up to 35% improvement in mAb titers. Integration of machine learning and advanced analytics has significantly enhanced process control and optimization capabilities. Conclusion The evolution of mAb manufacturing technologies offers promising pathways for improving production efficiency and reducing costs. Scale-dependent considerations remain crucial in selecting optimal manufacturing strategies, while emerging technologies present new opportunities for process optimization. Future developments in continuous processing, advanced analytics, and cell line engineering will be essential in meeting growing global demand while ensuring economic viability and accessibility of mAb therapeutics.",

            "text": "The use of exosomes is a new approach for efficient intracellular delivery of bioactive molecules to target cells. Currently, scientific research on exosomes is mainly conducted in academia, where only a small quantity of exosomes is sufficient for accomplishing research purposes. However, several challenges remain in large-scale exosome production to support preclinical and clinical studies or commercial marketing beyond the laboratory scale used in academia. In this mini-review, we address exosome manufacturing challenges, including cell line development, upstream cell culture, and downstream purification processes in pre-clinical and clinical activities. First, a cell culture process in three-dimensional stirred-tank bioreactors should be developed to produce sufficient materials for therapeutic use and support clinical trials through market support via commercial-scale manufacturing. Second, traditional purification methods used in academia contain high process-and product-related impurities, limiting their application in commercial processes. More precise and scalable purification methods should be developed to produce high-purity exosomes for human use in clinical trials during drug development. We also addressed issues and solutions related to exosome characterization and quality control, since defining product properties of exosomes is complex challenging compared to that of traditional biologics, such as antibodies. \n\nAlthough the following issues are not discussed in this mini-review, they should be considered from the perspective of drug development. \n\nFormulation of exosome products in the early development stage may significantly improve their stability and establish prolonged shelf life. Additionally, an appropriate analytical matrix should be established to support the streamlined development of scalable manufacturing processes to produce exosome products. Recently, cell-derived nanovesicles (CDNs), also known as exosome-mimetic nanovesicles, have gained attention as nanovesicles that can be produced in a cost-effective and large-scale manner. CDNs are generated by subjecting cells to physical processes, such as extrusion, to produce nano-sized vesicles (Goh et al., 2017;Ilahibaks et al., 2019).",

            "text": "Lentiviral vector and virus-like particle (VLP) manufacturing have been published in fed-batch upstream and batch downstream modes before. Batch downstream and continuous upstream in perfusion mode were reported as well. This study exemplifies development and validation steps for a digital twin combining a physical-chemical-based mechanistic model for all unit operations with a process analytical technology strategy in order to show the efforts and benefits of autonomous operation approaches for manufacturing scale. As the general models are available from various other biologic manufacturing studies, the main step is model calibration for the human embryo kidney cell-based VLPs with experimental quantitative validation within the Quality-by-Design (QbD) approach, including risk assessment to define design and control space. For continuous operation in perfusion mode, the main challenge is the efficient separation of large particle manifolds for VLPs and cells, including cell debris, which is of similar size. Here, innovative tangential flow filtration operations are needed to avoid fast blocking with low mechanical stress pumps. A twofold increase of productivity was achieved using simulation case studies. This increase is similar to improvements previously described for other entities like plasmid DNAs, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and single-chain fragments of variability (scFv) fragments. The advantages of applying a digital twin for an advanced process control strategy have proven additional productivity gains of 20% at 99.9% reliability.",

The consideration of membrane-based chromatographic devices as a debottlenecking option is gaining increasing attention with the recent introduction of high-capacity bind and elute membranes. We have evaluated the performance and scalability of the Sartobind\u00ae Rapid A affinity membrane (1 mL) for high-productivity mAb capture. For scalability assessment, a 75 mL prototype device was used to process 100 L of clarified cell culture harvest (CH) on a novel multi-use rapid cycling chromatography system (MU-RCC). MabSelect\u2122 PrismA (4.7 mL) was used as a benchmark comparator for Protein A (ProtA) resin studies. Results show that in addition to a productivity gain of >10\u00d7, process and product quality attributes were either improved or comparable to the benchmark. Concentrations of eluate pools were 7.5\u00d7 less than that of the benchmark, with the comparatively higher bulk volume likely to cause handling challenges at process scale. The MU-RCC system is capable of membrane operation at pilot scale with comparable product quality profile to the 1 mL device. The Sartobind\u00ae Rapid A membrane is a scalable alternative to conventional ProtA resin chromatography for the isolation and purification of mAbs from harvested cell culture media.",

In a continuous approach, 14,15 mAbs are produced in a perfusion bioreactor, captured directly on Protein A columns a\ue09der passing a cell removal device, and subsequently processed in other downstream process steps without any hold times or interruptions in between the different unit operations. In a traditional scenario using fed-batch reactors, loaded mass can generally be estimated by taking into account column capacity and predetermined product titers. In the continuous production approach, titers in the cell-free harvest vary during the loading phase and in different puri\ue103cation cycles. Real-time titer measurements must therefore be carried out. 7][18] Both methods are time-consuming and typically carried out in an off-line setting.",

A variety of downstream processing technological advances have led to a paradigm shift in how therapeutic antibodies are developed and manufactured. A key driver of change has been the increased adoption of single-use technologies for process development and manufacturing. An early-stage developability assessment of potential lead antibodies, using both in silico and high-throughput experimental approaches, is critical to de-risk development and identify molecules amenable to manufacturing. Both statistical and mechanistic modelling approaches are being increasingly applied to downstream process development, allowing for deeper process understanding of chromatographic unit operations. Given the greater adoption of perfusion processes for antibody production, continuous and semi-continuous downstream processes are being increasingly explored as alternatives to batch processes. As part of the Quality by Design (QbD) paradigm, ever more sophisticated process analytical technologies play a key role in understanding antibody product quality in real-time. We should expect that computational prediction and modelling approaches will continue to be advanced and exploited, given the increasing sophistication and robustness of predictive methods compared to the costs, time, and resources required for experimental studies.",

However, ex vivo, large-scale cell manufacturing requires production platforms enabling costeffective expansion to generate clinically relevant numbers. 1 This prerequisite presents significant challenges that are constrained by current manual, open, small-scale production methodologies/systems. Another impediment to broad clinical use includes the numerous early-stage ATMP candidates which require human operators to undertake critical functions and are driven by academic sites, clinical centers and SMEs which lack resources and expertise to automate and scale manufacturing processes. 2 e use of cell-based manufacturing systems for human medicines has led to successful outcomes in recent decades. Recombinant protein drugs (cytokines/monoclonal antibodies) are produced using various expression systems inserted into immortalized CHO cells, capable of unlimited expansion at scale. A new challenge arises when the therapeutic product is the cell itself rather than its protein product. Cell therapies use expanded nonimmortalized, primary cells with complex biological characteristics, whether autologous or allogeneic. Despite these obstacles, the field has made enormous strides in recent years with many outstanding examples, for example, the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for immune disorders or degenerative conditions such as Crohn's disease and osteoarthritis. More recently, MSCs were tested in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with SARs-CoV-2 infection. 3 e emergence of efficient production systems for clinical grade MSCs using scalable bioreactors has been slow. Current production systems mainly involve laboratory-scale manual processing using flasks or cell factories and the dispersed nature of such manufacturing is associated with exceptionally poor process standardization. 4 Critical process parameters including cell source, media composition, seeding density, passage number, and final dose formulation are highly variable. Additionally, process checkpoints and quality control are not uniformly applied and industry standards for release criteria and potency testing have not yet emerged. Current methods generally require full grade A containment levels for qualification, sterility control and maintenance contributing to the very high costs associated with approval and market entry. \n\nThere is an urgent need for highly efficient automated manufacturing platforms for the production of ATMPs for patient benefit.",

            "text": "The current modus operandi for biopharmaceutical production using mammalian cell lines is to build biomanufacturing facilities with fixed capacity and a focus on fed-batch bioreactor production with independent, batch downstream unit operations. 1 Recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) produced by Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines continue to dominate biopharmaceutical approvals. 2 The established low risk profile of mAbs generated by CHO cell lines provides a foundation for a rapid development approach that relies on platform development, manufacturing technology, and infrastructure. 3 9][10] There is also a drive to reduce cost-of-goods 11 and the environmental impact 12 to manufacture biologic drugs. Cost-of-goods is directly related to manufacturing and product demand, necessitating modular plug-and-play manufacturing solutions that can respond quickly to market and product processing requirements. 6 Designing of next generation manufacturing facilities has therefore focused on incorporation of single-use, flexible and modular concepts into facility design that gives advantages of faster speed to market, capital investment deferment and better cost predictability. 6,13,14 key enabler is the move from fed-batch bioreactor production with independent, batch downstream unit operations toward singleuse integrated and continuous bioprocessing (ICB), utilizing continuous perfusion bioreactors with a linked and continuous downstream. 15,16 ICB has well documented advantages for clinical and in some cases commercial manufacturing. These include: reduced capital and operating costs 6,15,[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] ; increased productivity and reduced facility size through process intensification 6,15,17,18,20 ; facilitation of multiproduct \"ballroom\" facilities 25,26 ; improved flexibility to respond to changing demand 6,18,26 ; increased process sustainability through a reduction in process mass intensity (PMI) 15,22,24 ; and improved product quality consistency. 10,27 common framework is emerging within the industry for companies implementing ICB. 15,16",

The risk of process or analytical inconsistency during scale up is traditionally mitigated by using the same lead clone from small-scale to pilot scale to clinical manufacturing scale production. In the \"pool for Tox\" approach, the growth rates among the clones in the pool can be different, which may shift the clone composition during scale up and pose a higher risk of process and analytical inconsistency. One way to mitigate this population drift is by pooling the clones just before bioreactor inoculation. However, our data suggested pooling the clones early in the seed train or late pooling just before inoculation had minimal growth, productivity, or product quality differences, possibly due to the growth rate of the top clones being very similar (data not shown). \n\nIt is also important to distinguish between the product quality of the molecule in cell culture harvest and in the purified drug substance. Some quality attributes such as N-glycan species may not be significantly modified by the downstream process. However, the levels of product impurities such as homodimers of multi-specific antibodies in cell culture harvest can be significantly reduced through the purification process. Thus, the differences in the product impurity levels in cell culture harvest between the pool and the lead clone may be mitigated by the downstream process to yield comparable impurity levels between the preclinical and clinical batches in the final drug substance. Recent developments in predictive process modeling may further improve the outcome in this situation. The performance of the lead clone in clinical manufacturing can potentially be predicted using a model built from the small-scale process development data of the same program and other programs' historical data. This can significantly increase our confidence of applying the \"pool for Tox\" approach especially for complex molecules. \n\nThe method employed for developing production cell lines plays a critical role in the \"pool for Tox\" strategy.",

            "text": "However, it is economically difficult to produce multiple drugs using multiple parallel manufacturing platforms. To tackle the problem, Cao et al. used the above-mentioned double-inducible P. pastoris to further construct a variety of strains that could coexpress two biologics with dynamical control over the ratio, and separated the biologics through the downstream processing [58]. For example, they produced a cocktail of two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD1) and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (anti-CTLA4) in a single batch fermentation. To simplify the purification process, they eluted multiple proteins sequentially using the buffer with different salt concentration from the same columns. To further increase the throughput, an IPTG (isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiohomolactopyranoside)-induced expression system was further introduced to achieve the orthogonal control of three biologics production (methanol-induced expression of rHGH, \u03b2-estradiol-induced expression of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and IPTG-induced expression of IFN\u03b1-2b) in a single strain. \n\nUsing the P. pastoris as the chassis cell, Crowell et al. developed an automated desktop multi-product manufacturing system named InSCyT (Integrated Scalable Cyto-Technology) to integrate fermentation, sensing, input and output, purification and analysis automatically (Fig. 3d) [52]. InSCyT used fluidically connected modules for the upstream fermentation and downstream processing. They performed continuous fermentation through in-tank perfusion in a sub-liter benchtop bioreactor to reduce the volume of the bioreactor and enable high space-time yield. The bioreactor was equipped with sensors to control fermentation parameters such as pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen. The purification module was designed to enable either two or three stages of chromatographic separation by straight-through processing with no intermediate holding tanks or adjustments between purification steps. The final module in the system was a tangential flow-filtration system for buffer exchange and formulation to a final liquid dosage form of the product.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for therapeutic applications are of paramount importance for the biopharmaceutical industry as mAbs and their variants represent approximately half of all newly approved products (O'Flaherty et al., 2020). Manufacturers of mAbs are, however, challenged with the production to meet the increasing market demand. Recent advances in cell line and process development have led to substantial improvements in the productivity of cell culture processes (Shukla et al., 2017;Tihanyi & Nyitray, 2020).\n\nIntensification realized thanks to high cell density perfusion processes and continuous downstream processing are recognized as promising avenues. A prominent role is attributed to the development of culture medium as it has a great impact on the cell and process performance. Due to the high complexity of media for mammalian cell culture, one-factor-at-a-time optimization strategy has been found to be ineffective and instead the statistical approach of design of experiments (DoE) is most often adopted to reduce the number of experiments (Ritacco et al., 2018). DoE has been applied to improve the production of mAbs in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines by analyzing the effect of components with a response surface methodology and identifying their optimum levels (Liu et al., 2015;Torkashvand et al., 2015). Another experimental approach, namely metabolic profiling, has demonstrated its effectiveness in optimizing mAb production through the design of feed regimes relieving metabolic bottlenecks from nutrient limitations (Kishishita et al., 2015;Sellick et al., 2011).\n\nThe majority of proposed medium development strategies were established for cells grown in batch and fed-batch culture, until now the most dominant cultivation mode for mammalian cells. The realization of process intensification, generally by increasing the cell density and cultivation time in a continuous system, has sparked great interest by the industry to apply perfusion processes for mAb manufacturing (Chen et al., 2018). In a steady-state perfusion bioreactor, the cell concentration is maintained at a constant level through cell removal at a rate corresponding to the growth rate, that is, operating a cell bleed, while the culture medium is continuously renewed, potentially generating cell densities multiple times higher compared to fed-batch cultures (Clincke et al.,",

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines are commonly prepared for biomanufacturing by single cell cloning post-transfection and recovery, followed by lead clone screening, generation of a research cell bank (RCB), cell culture process development, and manufacturing of a master cell bank (MCB) to be used in early phase clinical manufacturing. In this study, it was found that an additional round of cloning and clone selection from an established monoclonal RCB or MCB (i.e., re-cloning) significantly improved titer for multiple late phase monoclonal antibody upstream processes. Quality attributes remained comparable between the processes using the parental clones and the re-clones. For two CHO cells expressing different antibodies, the re-clone performance was successfully scaled up at 500-L or at 2000-L bioreactor scales, demonstrating for the first time that the re-clone is suitable for late phase and commercial manufacturing processes for improvement of titer while maintaining comparable product quality to the early phase process.",

The GIGA-2050 upstream process specifies a 15-day seed train for any scale production to control for cell age and a 14-day fed-batch process in a standard single-use bioreactor, with supplementation of feeds and glucose, to achieve consistent diversity and potency of the recombinant hyperimmune globulin. \n\nThe downstream recovery process employs a series of standard mAb chromatography purification steps and viral reduction steps. Protein A capture chromatography in bind and elute mode is followed by low pH viral inactivation. Several polishing steps are used including cation exchange chromatography (CEX) in bind and elute mode for reducing residual host cell proteins (HCPs) and other product-related impurities and anion exchange (AEX) in flow-through mode to further remove residual HCPs, residual host-cell DNA, and putative viruses.

            "text": "However, the available literature on suitable upstream and downstream processing methods for ORFV remains sparse. \n\nThe production of ORFV D1701-VrV was initially based on adherent Vero cell culture [20]. The harvest protocols include centrifugation steps, cell lysis by several freeze-thaw cycles and sonication, followed by depth filtration. The purification was traditionally performed by ultracentrifugation and polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation [21]. Although effective in a small scale, these purification methods lack scalability. Efforts to overcome this limitation focused on identifying suitable clarification and chromatography methods [22][23][24]. However, these process optimizations were still based on the adherent Vero cell production process. To enable industrial-scale production of ORFV, we replaced the adherent Vero cell process by a HEK suspension process. This transition, however, introduced complications, particularly in the clarification step. These challenges were anticipated, as the clarification strategy depends on the upstream process, such as expression system, cell density and viability, and media composition. These factors determine the type and amount of impurity load. Moreover, the large macromolecular size and complex structure of the target virus pose challenges for the clarification. Despite its critical importance in influencing the efficiency of subsequent DSP steps, clarification has often been overlooked during process development, with a notable lack of detailed studies in the literature. Clarification typically involves a series of operations, namely primary and secondary clarification, aiming to remove cells, cell debris and large aggregates [25]. Given the large size of enveloped vectors, the final pore size in the secondary clarification step often uses membranes with pore sizes usually not smaller than 0.45 or 0.65 \u00b5m [26,27]. \n\nRecognizing the gap in detailed investigations into effective clarification methods for ORFV or analogous vectors, our goal was to devise a scalable clarification strategy that maximizes yield for ORFV generated in HEK cells grown in suspension.",

            "text": "One of the leading classes of biopharmaceutical therapeutics in today's market is that of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), with the mAb market size valued at USD 144 billion in 2020 and is expected to almost double by 2027 [1]. The establishment of robust manufacturing platform technologies is therefore important to ensure a smooth and rapid transition from the discovery of product candidates to clinical trials and commercial production. In recent years, remarkable developments in upstream processing have led to a steady and significant increase in mAb titers [2][3][4][5]. However, the high product titers, along with the concomitant increase in host cell proteins (HCP) and other impurities [6,7] often challenge the efficiency of traditional purification methods, resulting in a shift in the manufacturing costs from upstream processing towards downstream processing [2][3][4]. As such, it is critical for further developments in downstream processing to occur so as to ensure that products of high purity can be obtained in a productive manner. \n\nOne of the promising developments in this aspect is multi-column counter current chromatography. In single column batch chromatography, there is typically an under utilization of the resin, as the loading phase is stopped before the product starts to breakthrough, so as to prevent product loss. An increase in resin utilization can be achieved in multi-column chromatography systems by having a 2 nd column to capture the target compound that breaks through from the 1 st column. Another limitation in batch chromatography is that there is often a tradeoff between purity and recovery, where impure fractions containing products may be collected or discarded accordingly in order to achieve high recovery or high purity (Fig 1A). This can however be at least partially circumvented by collecting high-purity fractions and recycling the portions where peaks overlap for another cycle of separation. An example of such a system is the simulated moving bed (SMB) system, where a two-component separation between the weakly bound species (raffinate) and the target component (extract) can typically be achieved in a classical operation [8].",

In particular, it has implications on the half\u2010life, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and must be closely monitored throughout drug development and manufacturing. To address this, advances have been made primarily in upstream processing, including mammalian cell line engineering, to yield more predictably glycosylated mAbs and the addition of media supplements during fermentation to manipulate the metabolic pathways involved in glycosylation. A more robust approach would be a conjoined upstream\u2013downstream processing strategy. This could include implementing novel downstream technologies, such as the use of Fc \u03b3\u2010based affinity ligands for the separation of mAb glycovariants. This review highlights the importance of controlling therapeutic antibody glycosylation patterns, the challenges faced in terms of glycosylation during mAb biosimilar development, current efforts both upstream and downstream to control glycosylation and their limitations, and the need for research in the downstream space to establish holistic and consistent manufacturing processes for the production of antibody therapies.",

            "text": "The monoclonal antibody (mAb) market has grown exponentially since the first mAb was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 1986. 1 Since then, monoclonal antibodies have become a dominant presence in the biopharmaceutical market, making up 53% of the 122 new product approvals from 2014 to 2018, a nearly 100% increase over the previous 4 year period. 2 Additionally, the global monoclonal antibody market valuation is ballooning rapidly, with an increase from $115.2 billion in 2018 to an expected $300 billion by 2025. 1 As the commercial pipeline of these proteins expands, a large challenge manufacturers face is dramatically reducing the cost of goods (CoGs) to remain competitive in the growing manufacturing space while also promoting democratization of therapies through reduction of cost to the customer. One effective method to reduce CoGs for biotherapeutics manufacturing is increasing the productivity in the production bioreactor, which increases total product yield without an increase in bioreactor resources. \n\nAdvances in antibody production technologies have made giant strides over the last few decades. In 1985, average fed-batch titers were approximately 0.20 g/L, which since then have grown over 1600%, achieving projected average fed-batch titers of 3.20 g/L. 3 However, some literature sources have reported fed-batch titers as high as 10 g/L in 14-18 day processes, indicating that the pace of fed-batch productivity advancements is picking up speed. 4,5 These rising yields can be attributed to incremental advances in cell line engineering, 6 improved process control, 4 and advanced media development within the biopharmaceutical industry. 7 Although reported yields are steadily growing, with the mAb market greatly expanding, the appetite for further bioreactor productivity advancements is higher than ever. To meet this demand, a paradigm shift toward intensified processing is required to make these substantial productivity gains rather than relying on the incremental technological step changes of the past. \n\nOne appealing and highly productive platform process that has gained momentum in recent years is the intensified or high inoculation density (HID) fed-batch bioreactor.",

            "text": "The development and manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals including monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have gained major importance due to their growing demand in treatments of cancerous, immunological and infectious diseases (Johnson, 2018). MAbs offer higher target specificities and elongated half-lives compared to pharmaceuticals of low molecular weight, such as small molecule drugs, resulting in a high interest in these molecules as demonstrated by increasing numbers of antibodies entering clinical trials, and getting regulatory approval (Hansel et al., 2010). Additionally, their mode of action can be modified and optimized in various ways by molecular engineering (Presta, 2008). However, to achieve the desired bioactivity and avoid immunogenicity, host-specific posttranslational modifications (PTM) of the expressed mAb, like glycosylation, are essential (Jayapal et al., 2007). Therefore, mAbs are commonly expressed in mammalian cells capable of PTM, especially in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells due to their status as secure production host and their proven high volumetric productivity (Kim et al., 2012). Thereby, different process modes are utilized within the upstream manufacturing of mAb based therapeutics comprising distinct sets of advantages and disadvantages. \n\nA commonly used upstream process operation in mAb production is the fed-batch (FB) mode, comprising feed additions throughout a batch cultivation to supply fresh nutrients to the cells. This process comprises an exponential growth phase in which cell numbers increase and cell viability is high, followed by a stationaryand death phase with stable or decreasing viable cell counts and decreasing viability. Commonly, the accumulation of metabolic byproducts or nutrient limitation triggers the transition from the growth phase to the stationary phase and hence, limits the achievable cell density, cultivation time and volumetric productivity (Abu-Absi et al., 2014). The advantages of the FB operation are efficient utilization of growth media in comparison continuous processes, resulting in lower operational costs which increases the economic potential (Pollock et al., 2013). \n\nTo overcome the FB specific limitations, like decreased cell densities and cultivation durations, continuous processes like perfusion are applied (Hiller et al., 2017).",

In addition, an effective cell culture platform should define a starting set of cell culture conditions that work reasonably well for most products in that family and include a development workflow with which a process can be efficiently optimized for improved performance or robustness through process development. \n\nIn previous reports, we described the evolution of our manufacturing platform from conventional to intensified processes [5] and demonstrated that increasing inoculation density, coupled with media optimization, led to titer improvement at the production bioreactor stage [6]. This report builds on the previous two with a focus on the N-1 stage optimization that enabled the increased inoculation density implemented at the production stage. Specifically, we have incorporated capacitance-controlled N-1 perfusion into our cell culture platform process, and in this report, we detail considerations that went into that decision. Specifically, we demonstrate that the capacitance probe provides a good estimation of VCD for many (6) different mAb molecules and enables a starting point for process development with decreased media usage when compared with volumetricbased strategies. We demonstrate that the capacitance-controlled perfusion can be rapidly optimized within the span of a few experiments to arrive at an effective N-1 perfusion process and successful scalability of the perfusion processes developed with this strategy. Finally, we demonstrate that if required for manufacturing facility fit, the capacitance probe can be engineered out of the process by converting back to a volumetric-based perfusion strategy, enabling flexibility for use of these processes in multiple manufacturing facilities.",

            "text": "Biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes can be divided into two main processing trains: upstream cell culture operations and downstream purification processes. Various bioreactor configurations are used to produce the cells that express the product of interest (mAbs, enzymes, Fc-fusion proteins, or hormones). Removing particulate matter such as cells and cell debris occurs at the interface between upstream and downstream unit operations. These bioreactor clarification operations are sometimes referred to as midstream processes [13,14]. \n\nFigure 1 is a typical 'platform' process for the downstream purification of monoclonal antibodies. The first unit operation is typically an affinity chromatography capture step using protein A (resin-based chromatography) [15]. Affinity interaction is a specific interaction based on both the topological fit and a combination of electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen-bonding interactions [16]. Antibody elution from the protein A column is performed at low pH, making it very convenient to include a low pH hold for virus inactivation. \n\nfor the product. \n\nIn order to remove impurities and foulants, virus filtration membranes are sometimes designed with a reverse asymmetric structure [10]. In this case, the barrier layer faces away (downstream) while the more open support layer faces towards the feed stream [11]. The support layer can act as an inline prefilter that traps larger foulants and protects the tight barrier layer [12]. However, essentially symmetric membranes are also used industrially. The unique requirements of virus filtration are very different from typical pressure-driven membrane separation processes such as ultrafiltration. Identifying and sizing an appropriate virus filter is often particularly challenging. \n\nThis review describes a typical 'platform process' for the downstream purification of biopharmaceutical products. First, the location of the virus filtration step in the downstream processing workflow is identified. Next, the major commercially available virus filters are summarized. The remaining sections of this review highlight various impurities and foulants that could lead to fouling and compromised performance during virus filtration of mammalian cell-derived biologics. Inline virus prefilters that are frequently used to remove product-related aggregates are also discussed. The review ends with a discussion of future trends in the development of virus filters.",

            "text": "Interestingly, while cancer remains a universal concern, the staggering high production cost of recombinant blocking antibodies is expected to impact in lowand middle-income countries. \n\nThe use of plant expression systems to produce pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceuticals is constantly expanding and gaining recognition in the research (Bulaon et al., 2020;Shanmugaraj et al., 2020a;Rattanapisit et al., 2021;Shanmugaraj et al., 2021) and manufacturing industries (Nosaki et al., 2021). Some of its key advantages include rapid and ease of cultivation, scalability, lack or low risk of pathogen contamination, ability to carry out posttranslational modifications and cost-effectiveness (Nandi et al., 2016;Shanmugaraj et al., 2020a;Nosaki et al., 2021). For several years, mammalian cell cultures (i.e., CHO cells) have been the dominant expression system for mAbs. Nonetheless, the plantbased facility is projected to lower operating expenses and cost of goods sold compared to the CHO facility (Kelley, 2009;Petrides et al., 2014;Nandi et al., 2016). The downstream processing costs for a mAb produced using a conventional CHO cell platform at a high production capacity (1,000 kg/year) were estimated to be $232/ g. Even at a much lower production capacity (600 kg/year), the plant-derived platform has a cost of goods sold of \u223c$99/g, which includes both upstream and downstream process operations, corresponding to decrease of over 50% in manufacturing costs. According to the presented techno-economic model (Nandi et al., 2016), plant-based expression technology is a promising platform for the production of mAbs. Our team (Rattanapisit et al., 2019;Phakham et al., 2021;Yiemchavee et al., 2021;Phetphoung et al., 2022) have previously expressed recombinant immunotherapeutic antigens and antibodies in plants, providing proof of principle for its viability.",

            "text": "Biopharmaceutical industry trends over the past few years have shifted toward diversification of the portfolio with around 1600 drug candidates in different phases (pre-clinical to commercial) of the pipeline. Around 60% of these pipeline molecules are monoclonal antibody (mAb) and mAb-related products, of which 60% candidates are projected to have an annual production demand of less than 100 kg for clinical trials and upon commercial launch. 1 Hence, flexible manufacturing facilities have gained attention due to the capability of processing diverse mAb products with quick changeover between smaller production campaigns (<2000 L) and reduced initial capital investments. 2 From the downstream processing perspective, alternate technologies such as continuous chromatography, integrated processing and membrane chromatography have gained traction as a replacement and/or enhancement to conventional platform mAb purification processes, complementing upstream advances and changing industry trends. 3 mbrane chromatography was launched two decades ago to improve bioprocessing, offering advantages such as high volumetric throughput, low-pressure drops due to a reduced aspect ratio, improved ligand accessibility, elimination of cleaning and validation requirements, and availability as single-use modules. 4 Currently, anion exchange (AEX) membrane chromatography has gained acceptance in manufacturing-scale (>2000 L) mAb purification processes for flowthrough applications, where process impurities such as host cell protein (HCP) bind to the membrane and the product flows through. 2,5,6 r bind-elute applications, manufacturing scale implementation of membrane chromatography is still at its nascent stage and targeted for specific applications, such as purification of unstable molecules 7 and for the capture of adenovirus-related products. 8 However, for mAb purification, which often follows a platform approach, it is critical to implement a well-defined strategy to assess suitability of membrane chromatography earlier during process development. \n\nProcess development that combines high throughput screening (HTS) tools with scale-down membranes is an effective strategy for the assessment of various process parameters such as pH, salt concentration and protein concentration. 9",

The common framework for most ICB, potentially enables a global biomanufacturing ecosystem utilizing modular and multi\u2010function manufacturing equipment. Integrating unit operation hardware and software from multiple suppliers, complex supply chains enabled by multiple customized single\u2010use flow paths, and large volume buffer production/storage make this ICB vision difficult to achieve with commercially available manufacturing equipment. Thus, we developed SymphonX\u2122, a downstream processing skid with advanced buffer management capabilities, a single disposable generic flow path design that provides plug\u2010and\u2010play flexibility across all downstream unit operations and a single interface to reduce operational risk. Designed for multi\u2010product and multi\u2010process cGMP facilities, SymphonX\u2122 can perform stand\u2010alone batch processing or ICB. This study utilized an Apollo\u2122 X CHO\u2010DG44 mAb\u2010expressing cell line in a steady\u2010state perfusion bioreactor, harvesting product continuously with a cell retention device and connected SymphonX\u2122 purification skids. The downstream process used the same chemistry (resins, buffer composition, membrane composition) as our historical batch processing platform, with SymphonX\u2122 in\u2010line conditioning and buffer concentrates. We used surge vessels between unit operations, single\u2010column chromatography (protein A, cation and anion exchange) and two\u2010tank batch virus inactivation. After the first polishing step (cation exchange), we continuously pooled product for 6\u2009days. These 6\u2009day pools were processed in batch\u2010mode from anion exchange to bulk drug substance. This manufacturing scale proof\u2010of\u2010concept ICB produced 0.54\u2009kg/day of drug substance with consistent product quality attributes and demonstrated successful bioburden control for unit\u2010operations undergoing continuous operation.",

            "text": "production and purification processes (Effio & Hubbuch, 2015;Hume et al., 2019;Qendri et al., 2019). Downstream processing is often based on size exclusion chromatography and ultra-centrifugation that might face challenges in large-scale set-ups (Effio & Hubbuch, 2015;Tayyab et al., 1991). Another challenge is low binding capacities during chromatography in bind-and-elute mode (Effio & Hubbuch, 2015). \n\nTo overcome some of the production challenges and to intensify the production of VLP vaccines, platform technologies have been developed that allow the production of a variety of VLPs while only requiring minimal adjustments of the underlying production process (Middelberg et al., 2011). One possible pathway is to produce VLPs and antigens separately and subsequently attach them either by conjugation or by tag coupling approaches (Brune et al., 2016). \n\nAnother pathway is genetic fusion in which the antigen is genetically inserted into the viral structural protein with subsequent protein expression as one construct (Clarke et al., 1987;Sapsford et al., 2013). \n\nAn advanced platform technology for VLP vaccines involves the use of murine poliomavirus major capsid protein VP1 with inserted antigen (Middelberg et al., 2011). VLP vaccines based on this platform showed promising results in animal studies for pathogens such as Influenza, Group A Streptococcus, and Rotavirus (Anggraeni et al., 2013;Seth et al., 2016;Tekewe et al., 2017). The capsomeres can be expressed unassembled in gram-per-liter concentration in Escherichia coli and a highly efficient, scalable, and integrated purification and production pathways have been developed (Gerstweiler et al., 2021c;Liew et al., 2010). \n\nContinuous bio-processing promises process intensification due to higher automation, increased equipment utilization and a reduced facility footprint, and furthermore leads to constant product quality and less batch-to-batch variation. A review on current developments of continuous bio-manufacturing has been recently published (Gerstweiler et al., 2021a).",

            "text": "A wide range of immunotherapeutic products have found extensive use in modern science and medicine. From various cell products to antibodies and cytokines, they are produced worldwide on an industrial scale. Therefore, scaling up of the biotechnological processes to meet the growing needs represents a serious challenge. Multiple optimization approaches exist for scaling up the production of immunotherapeutic products. The main principles are based on closed systems and automation. The more autonomous the process becomes, the cheaper and more efficient it gets for large-scale manufacturing. The use of closed systems can significantly reduce the risk of contamination, thereby increasing the quality of the product and lowering the infrastructural requirements. \n\nThe production of most immunological products is based on the patient's own immune cells. Therefore, any biotechnological process related to cell cultivation, when scaled up and automated, will have to end up with bioreactor systems of some kind. In this regard, given the wide range of practical issues to be addressed, the development of modern bioreactors for industrial production of immunotherapeutics is extremely important. Industrial use of cell culture bioreactors is carried out after careful development and optimization of the protocol, since methodology and used materials can have a significant impact on the efficiency of the whole process [1]. \n\nPrimary parameters to consider for biotechnology processes include pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen levels that can be controlled by medium oxygenation and replenishment Bioengineering 2022, 9, 808 2 of 11 (e.g., by perfusion), mixing of cell suspension to achieve uniform distribution of cells inside the bioreactor, etc. Bioreactor systems may use different basic principles and therefore may vary in performance and specific application. In addition, certain mechanical features may be advantageous for the efficient cultivation of one cell type while leading to low proliferation or even cell death in other cases. Thus, there is no universal solution to enhance throughput and achieve the required product quality, however, with careful selection of the appropriate system, high yields of quality cell products can be achieved.",

            "text": "There is growing interest in revolutionizing the bioprocessing industry, such as by advancing continuous processing over traditional batch manufacturing; however, currently there is a lack of detail on key inline parameters [125,126]. Schofield (2018) intimated that there remain technical and regulatory hurdles to be met in order to implement continuous bioprocessing. These can be met by addressing knowledge gaps in (a) molecule stability; (b) cost competition; (c) breakthrough biopharma companies that want to make their own clinical material; and (d) large pipeline/low current facility capacity. As continuous downstream manufacturing has yet to be elucidated, the transition from batch to continuous includes a number of elements that would reduce cost, including reduction in the size of and number of hold vessels, reduction in equipment, reduced footprint, reduced volume of chromatography sorbents, reduced buffer requirement, reduced consumables and reduction in time to process (ability to process more). In traditional processing, biopharmaceuticals are made in discrete batches where production begins, runs for a finite period and then stops [127]. In contrast, continuous bioprocesses run all the time, or at least for extended periods [126,127]. In terms of new single-use technological solutions to make continuous bioprocessing feasibility for many drug targets and scales, Schofield (2018) noted that \"Pall Biotech has launched Cadence\u2122 BioSMB 80 and 350 systems for scalable continuous chromatography, Cadence virus inactivation for the automated semi-continuous operation of the low pH virus inactivation step and in line diafiltration, for continuous buffer exchange and formulation\". Thus, Pall was seen as the first provider to bring a complete end-to-end continuous platform that is scalable; but challenges remain in converting such a platform into a turn-key fully automated solution [125,128]. \n\nThere are many drivers of continuous bioprocessing, including process intensification, cost and better, more reproducible quality [129,130]. Although upstream processing is advanced in its transition, where chemostat and perfusion reactors are frequently used at the manufacturing scale [131], downstream processing has only recently commenced this transition.",

            "text": "For the case of monoclonal antibody products, our simulations revealed higher Profitability Index for recombinant DNA technology compared to IVT mRNA manufacturing. Although recombinant DNA monoclonal antibodies, due to their inferior potency profile, require higher dose i.e. approximately 10 times that of the IVT mRNA, we find that these elevated mass flow quantities are not reflected analogously on the final production cost. It is furthermore exhibited that IVT mRNA manufacturing demonstrates higher dependencies on raw materials leading to higher end product MSPD values. \n\nFor the study case of antigenic vaccines, recombinant DNA technology demonstrates higher economic performance requiring reduced capital resources, hence the utilisation of bacterial cell factories and the nature of the related downstream processes, ameliorate the use of costly raw material. Moreover, recombinant vaccine manufacturing encompasses proven, well-grounded protocols for both the upstream and downstream process development. Regarding the clinical field, this intervention does not rely on the human body to translate a pro drug to peptides or proteins, unlike the treatments based on IVT mRNA vaccines that stimulate the anticipated immune response only after translation is performed in vivo with all the related risks and pharmacokinetic variations. Whereas demand of supply is stable allowing for planned production, recombinant manufacturing appears advantageous hence it fulfills all the technical and financial expectations delivering proven track records of safety and efficacy, minimizing the risk of clinical ambiguity. \n\nWhether large production capacities are required immediately such as in cases of global pandemic outbreaks, IVT mRNA significantly shortens the time required from development to clinical application and from benchtop to scale manufacturing, fostering rapid market penetration. In addition, when product flexibility is required to follow up viral mutations, IVT mRNA manufacturing, due to its synthetic processes and the reduced requirements for installation of large scale production equipment, offers unparalleled advantages. Clinical trials and actual field practice in the future will demonstrate whether mRNA technologies will manage to offer non-inferior therapeutic results compaired to their DNA recombinant established alternatives.",

Subsequently, emphasis is placed on achieving high-level reproduction based on antibody sequences (high yield, low batch-to-batch variation, high stability, etc.), and the design of single/multiple-site mutations and conformation based on existing sequences. This article will provide insight into the challenges in the field of diagnostic antibody development, focusing on the discovery of diagnostic antibody sequences, upstream immunizing technology, downstream antibody utilization, and modification. Approaching the topic from both technical and application perspectives, this work proposes alternative ideas and approaches for the next generation of diagnostic antibody development, sharing recent achievements and relevant classic cases. Ultimately, the goal is to break through the complexities of the diagnostic antibody development industry, further enhancing the core competitiveness of related diagnostic products.",

            "text": "Since the advent of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in 1975, packed-bed chromatography remains the predominant technology of choice for the isolation and purification of these life-saving proteins [1,2]. The robustness of this technology is utilised as a standardised purification scheme to many mAbs derived from cell culture production systems. The pressure to accelerate drug development has challenged process scientists and vendors to continuously improve approaches to shorten product development timelines, ideally at reduced cost with little or no impact on product quality. This is observed in the upstream process, where improvement efforts resulting in approximately five-fold increases in mAb titres have been realised [3][4][5]. This increase in product yield has shifted the bottleneck of the production process from upstream to downstream, principally the mAb capture step [4,6]. \n\nProtein A (ProtA) resins are the mainstay for mAb capture and can constitute more than 50% of the downstream cost of mAb production [7][8][9]. The focus on this step for efficiency gains in the downstream process can have a significant impact. Attributes including dynamic binding capacity, resin lifetime, and resin capacity utilisation are key determinants of the cost of mAb production and the measure of the efficiency and value of the process step. As with many resin-based chromatography media, the narrow pore size range 60-120 nm of the ProtA resin can be impacted by diffusional mass transfer for mAb capture [8]. Hence, operation at residence times in the order of minutes is required to attain the desired pressure drop and load density, resulting in extended cycle times. \n\nThe emergence of membrane-based and fibre-based capture chromatography, where mass transfer is governed primarily by convection, can be a rapid process due to the micronsize pores and consequent binding site accessibility of these devices [10][11][12]. However, mAb binding capacity is negatively impacted by convection mass transfer. This limitation appears to have been overcome via recent improvements in ProtA chromatographic membrane and fibre devices [13][14][15].",

            "text": "In this article, we show the development of a large-area microfluidic bioreactor that allows the culture of mammalian cells to scale up the production of mAbs compared to earlier microfluidic devices [25]. The device design with 32 cisterns ensures a homogeneous environment regarding flow velocity and pressure, as predicted from the CFD simulations. The fabrication process used here is low-cost and allows the obtaining of large-size microfluidic devices. The LM bioreactor provided highly controlled cell culture conditions in a confined microenvironment with reduced levels of glucose, which may improve the quality of mAbs produced, with potential applications for the production of recombinant proteins for drug screening or early stages of drug discovery. \n\nThe anti-hIFN-\u03b12b produced by the CHO-ahIFN-\u03b12b cell line in the LM bioreactor presented K A values 2 times higher than the anti-hIFN-\u03b12b produced by the same cell line in the T-flask. Moreover, the biological function of cytokine neutralizing capacity in terms of antiproliferative activity, signaling, and antiviral activity by the anti-hIFN-\u03b12b produced in the LM bioreactor were significantly higher compared to the mAb produced with the standard T-flask adherent cell culture method. The results obtained here validate the functionality of the novel technology proposed and confirm that the LM bioreactor could be a valuable alternative tool to develop new bioprocess strategies to produce high-quality biologics. Additionally, the microsystem we developed allows the detailed evaluation of multiple factors influencing cell culture (biochemical factors, flow rate, and inoculum concentration), suggesting that it might be useful in novel biotherapeutics discovery and process development. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the largest area PDMS microfluidic device ever made for mammalian cell culture. We show that it is possible to culture mammalian cell lines in these devices and that they can be used to produce recombinant proteins with potential for therapeutic use. Moreover, this is the first time that the recombinant monoclonal antibody produced in a microfluidic device exhibits better functional activity than the antibody produced under standard culture conditions.",

            "text": "For further information, various publications are available that examine this topic in detail [25][26][27].When scaling up traditional mammalian-based production processes, the bioreactor geometry usually remains the same and a constant specific power input is most frequently used as the scale-up criterion [25].This makes sense, since the same geometry and uniform power input deliver an identical flow profile and power input distribution, resulting in no change to the smallest eddies, regardless of the bioreactor volume [26].These factors are often vitally important in chemical engineering processes.However, in a system where the success of the process is not determined by the perfectly identical chemical composition and distribution of the reactants, but by living cells which express a product of interest, all physical and chemical parameters can be varied to a certain extent.For example, Maschke et al. 2022 defined design spaces for growing a CHO cell line in orbitally shaken systems, taking into account the specific power input or eddy size, mixing time and necessary oxygen supply [28].Variations usually occur in cell culture processes due to the fact that the flow is not fully turbulent under typical cultivation conditions, especially at the laboratory scale.Thus, the energy dissipation distribution varies with scale, even when the specific power input remains the constant scaling criterion [29][30][31].Consequently, due to the requirement to address fluctuating flow conditions, the importance of geometric similarity becomes negligible in cell culture processes, provided all critical parameters are maintained within ranges that do not negatively impact the cell line.\n\nIn this study, antibody production processes were conducted at the laboratory scale in 250 mL shake flasks (Corning \u00ae , Corning, NY, USA; fed-batch), Ambr 250 modular vessels (Sartorius; fed-batch) and the 3 L HyPerforma Glass vessel (Thermo Scientific; fed-batch and perfusion).Both processes, fed batch and perfusion, were additionally performed in the 50 L HyPerforma DynaDrive (Thermo Scientific).Before the tests were carried out in the cylindrical stirred lab-scale bioreactors and the HyPerforma DynaDrive with a rectangular footprint, considerations were made regarding suitable scaling criteria.",

To validate this, we produced a plastome-engineered tobacco bioreactor line expressing a recombinant variant of the protein A from Staphylococcus aureus, an affinity ligand widely useful in antibody purification processes, reaching accumulation levels up to\u2009~\u2009250 mg per 1 kg of fresh leaf biomass. Chromatography resin manufactured from photosynthetically-sourced recombinant protein A ligand conjugated to agarose beads demonstrated the innate pH-driven ability to bind and elute IgG-type antibodies and allowed one-step efficient purification of functional monoclonal antibodies from the supernatants of the producing hybridomas.

            "text": "In this case study, two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), X 1 and Y 1 , targeting two different antigens, were utilized to construct IgG1 bsAbs in multiple formats. The molecule X 1 Y 1 in scFv-mAb format (Fig. 1A), comprising X 1 -scFv linked to the N-terminus of the Y 1 -mAb heavy chain with a (G 4 S) 2 linker, was chosen as the lead candidate based on its superior functionality (data not shown). Initial assessments were conducted to evaluate the developability of X 1 Y 1 , encompassing transient expression and purification in 40 ml scale, purity and thermostability. After 1-step of purification, the sample achieved final yield to >200 mg/L and purity to > 97% in SEC characterization. DSF showed that the Tm1 of this bsAb is 63.8 \u2022 C. The lead candidate, X 1 Y 1 , was chosen for advancement to a 15 L scale production in the CMC stage. This scale-up production was initiated with the purpose of generating materials for in-vivo study. The 15 L production involved a 14-day upstream cell culture using CHO-K1 cell line, clarification via depth filtration, and a platform downstream process. Unexpectedly, f locculent precipitation was observed in the Protein A affinity chromatography (AC) elution pool, as shown in Fig. 1B. Filtration attempts were made to remove the precipitation but shaking or stirring the solution still led to formation of significant amounts of severe precipitates. Different pH/buffer, excipients and surfactant were evaluated, but shown no effect on the formation of f locculent precipitation. The precipitation can be dissolved in 4 M Urea, suggesting that the precipitation could be proteins. The f locculent precipitation poses significant challenges in downstream processing, including filter clogging, reduced performance, product loss, and stability issues.",

            "text": "The manufacturing processes of biologics are complex and involve living systems (e.g., mammalian cell lines, microbial agents, plants, and fungi) and multiple critical processes (e.g., gene isolation, recombinant DNA engineering, and protein purification) which further require high technological expertise to ensure consistency and quality of the final product [21]. The manufacturing process of biopharmaceuticals can be broadly categorized into up and downstream processes. The upstream process is defined as the microbial growth required to produce biopharmaceutical molecules through the transformation of substrates into the desired metabolic products [82]. This involves a series of events such as cell line selection and development, screening and selection of clones, optimization of media, optimization of feed, and process optimization. The number of factors should be considered in these steps such as the selection of host cells and expression vectors, type of process (batch, fed-batch, continuous, etc.) temperature, pH, oxygen supply control, sterilization of materials and equipment, environmental monitoring for microbial contamination, etc. which adds complexity to the overall manufacturing process [83]. Downstream processing includes all steps necessary to purify a biological product from cell culture broth to the final purified product of desired purity and yield [84]. It involves critical stages to capture the target biomolecule and to eliminate host cell-related impurities (e.g., host cell proteins, DNA, etc.), manufacturing-related impurities (e.g. buffers, leached ligands, antifoam, etc.), and product specific impurities (e.g., aggregates, fragments, clipped species, etc.). Each purification step would remove one or more classes of impurities [85,86]. Since the manufacturing performance of cell-based therapies is highly dependent on the quality of the extracted cells, therefore leads to highly variable critical process parameters -critical quality attributes (CPP-CQA) which adds more criticality to designing and implementation of quality by design (QbD) [87]. Bioreactor complexity and interplay between process conditions and cellular metabolism have made mechanistic modeling of bioreactors difficult [88].",

            "text": "Therapeutic antibodies are complex molecules. Many aspects of their protein chemistry and structure must be considered as part of their design, optimization, development, and manufacturing. An ever-increasing array of antibody formats, fragments, and conjugates are produced in mammalian, insect, or bacterial cells. Isolation of these molecules from product-and process-related impurities such that they possess the correct attributes for their intended therapeutic purpose is the task of downstream processing (DSP). The success of DSP process development and manufacturing is heavily interdependent on the quality of the therapeutic antibody design, including its chemical and structural properties, as well as the upstream process (USP) and associated USP and DSP analytical technologies available to measure product attributes and process parameters. \n\nDSP of therapeutic antibodies continues to undergo revolutionary change. Over the years, DSP has often been described as the rate-limiting bottleneck in therapeutic antibody production. New technologies and paradigms of working have emerged in recent years that are helping to relieve this situation. Pressure continues to increase productivity while decreasing the cost of goods (CoGs). There is also the need for rapid process development of downstream processes for lead therapeutic antibodies to enable a faster path to regulatory submission and commercialization. \n\nThe aim of this article has not been to provide a comprehensive review of recent advances in DSP but rather to provide a summary of recent trends and technologies in selected areas, including those that seem of particular importance for therapeutic antibody DSP process development and manufacturing. It is hoped that this review also provides the interested reader a glimpse of where some active subject matter areas within DSP are advancing in the near future.",

            "text": "For the monoclonal antibody recombinant DNA platform, in the best-case study scenario for every kilogram that is produced in the upstream line, only 600-700 g are obtained in the required by the regulatory agencies' purity. This means that raw and side materials must be purchased at high quantities and handled by expert personnel to reach the required production capacity, whilst in any case valuable cellular product will still remain underutilized and ultimately discarded. On the other hand, IVT mRNA manufacturing protocols hold strong competitive advantages related to certain manufacturing characteristics. Even though the mRNA vaccine itself is highly sensitive to environmental conditions, the production process is easier to standardize, automate, adapt and operate in continuous mode due to the synthetic chemical nature of its sub-processes. Regarding the biochemical section of the related processes, i.e., the utilization of prokaryotic cultures as cell factories, offers a less complex, more effective alternative that poses minimal requirements of retaining sterility compared to eukaryotics, thus reducing significantly the risks of cross contamination and the respective quality-related batch rejections, leading to overall higher yields and less product losses. This, in turn, lowers raw material processing resources and reduces product development time contributing to the delivery of products readily distributed to broad markets. \n\nThe studied production cases emancipate different levels of investment risk. The utilization of our Pareto norm enabled the quantification of this risk by recruiting the discount rate of the investment as the lead decision parameter. The optimal value of the discount rate for the IVT mRNA production, according to the Pareto norm, equals to 0.110, while for the rest equals to 0.103. \n\nAccording to the simulation results, recombinant DNA manufacturing demonstrates superior profitability indeces in comparison to IVT mRNA manufacturing for equal number of produced doses. The IVT mRNA vaccine manufacturing approach poses increased raw material requirements due to its intricate processes, i.e. linearization and in vitro transcription. \n\nIn the case of monoclonal antibodies produced by recombinant DNA technology, superior economic performance is showcased, with a MSPD of 130 \u20ac, lower compared to the IVT-mRNA vaccine bearing a price value of 365 \u20ac per dose.",

            "text": "However, for fusogenic OVs that cause formation of large multinucleated syncytia that die rapidly after induction only relatively low virus yields were achieved in several tested adherent cell lines (Abdullahi et al., 2018). This property presents unique challenges for large-scale clinical-grade manufacturing, further compounded as scaling-up of processes for adherent cells is mainly achieved by scaling-out (e.g., increasing the surface area by multiplying the number of culture vessels) or the use of microcarrier systems. In static culture systems, there are also only limited options for monitoring and control of cultivation parameters such as pH values, dissolved oxygen concentration, feeding rates (Gallo-Ram\u00edrez et al., 2015;Pelz et al., 2022). Moreover, media for most adherent cells are supplemented with animal-derived components such as fetal calf serum, which can lead to batch-to-batch variations, increased production and purification costs, and elevated contamination risks. \n\nTo overcome such limitations, manufacturing can be shifted toward suspension cells using chemically defined media. Suspension cells allow for easy scale-up and passaging while maintaining rapid cell growth. Cultivation in stirred tank bioreactors (STR) can achieve high cell concentration in a small footprint, decreasing labor expenditures (Pelz et al., 2022). Moreover, suspension cultures allow the use of advanced process monitoring methods, enable process automation, and tight control of culture conditions. \n\nAs a first step, suitable suspension cell substrates were identified for the development of an efficient and scalable OV production process using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing variant of rVSV-NDV (rVSV-NDV-GFP). Infection at cell concentrations of about 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL yielded titers in the order of 10 8 TCID 50 /mL in BHK-21, HEK293SF, and AGE1.CR suspension cells (G\u00f6bel, Kortum et al., 2022). However, clinical treatment with OVs will require manufacturing processes that consistently achieve even higher virus titers.",

            "text": "The production of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and other biologics is performed primarily in batch mode. This results in larger equipment, cleaning/sterilization volumes, and dead times compared to any continuous approach. Consequently, production throughput is lower and capital costs are relatively high. Switching to continuous production thus reduces the production footprint and also lowers the cost of goods (COG). During process development, from the provision of clinical trial samples to the production plant, different plant sizes are usually required, operating at different operating parameters. To speed up this step, it would be optimal if only one plant with the same equipment and piping could be used for all sizes. In this study, an efficient solution to this old challenge in biologics manufacturing is demonstrated, namely the qualification and validation of a plant setup for clinical trial doses of about 1000 doses and a production scale-up of about 10 million doses. Using the current example of the Comirnaty BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, the cost-intensive in vitro transcription was first optimized in batch so that a yield of 12 g/L mRNA was achieved, and then successfully transferred to continuous production in the segmented plug flow reactor with subsequent purification using ultra- and diafiltration, which enables the recycling of costly reactants. To realize automated process control as well as real-time product release, the use of appropriate process analytical technology is essential. This will also be used to efficiently capture the product slug so that no product loss occurs and contamination from the fill-up phase is <1%. Further work will focus on real-time release testing during a continuous operating campaign under autonomous operational control. Such efforts will enable direct industrialization in collaboration with appropriate industry partners, their regulatory affairs, and quality assurance. A production scale-operation could be directly supported and managed by data-driven decisions.",

            "text": "Since this strategy enables an end-to-end medium (i.e., no medium base powder change) from single cell cloning up to production bioreactor at scale, there are minimal regulatory hurdles to be expected with regards to clonality, and as a result, this strategy could also be employed if late-stage cell culture media changes are anticipated. Importantly, mAb1 and mAb3 re-clone performance was scaled up to 500-L and 2000-L scale, respectively, while scale-up for mAb2 is anticipated in the future assuming positive clinical readouts. When resources allow, this re-cloning approach provides a practical and effective option to late-stage process development to improve the productivity while maintaining comparable product quality attributes in the late phase manufacturing process.",

            "text": "Due to great demand, this bioprocess should reach industrial scale under three development stages (laboratory or bench scale, pilot scale and full-scale manufacturing) [15,16]. In the case of PRP production for vaccine manufacturing, it requires a bioprocess developed to achieve a desirable productivity into a bioreactor of high operation volume. However, the bioprocesses are difficult to standardize and commonly limited by the scaling process because they did not reach the required efficacy [14]. Moreover, the large-scale process faces technical challenges correlated with the cell source, culture media, use of pure reagents as precursors, sterilization step, type of product and unit operations [14,17,18]. In this sense, H. influenzae requires a complex culture medium containing Hemin and NAD used as growth factors for aerobic conditions, which impact the process costs and product recovery [12,19]. For this reason, improving processes of PRP production (up-stream) as well as effective scale-up and purification (down-stream) could contribute to achieving a cheaper and more competitive formulation of conjugate vaccines in a large-scale process [20]. \n\nThere are several scale-up strategies; one efficient strategy is applying the scale-up criterion as the volumetric power input (P/VL), mixing time, impeller tip speed or constant volumetric mass transfer coefficient (k L a) in different size fermenters [21][22][23]. In the case of aerobic fermentation, maintaining constant oxygen transfer or k L a is a good choice [16]. k L a is a standard parameter for the characterization of mass transport by correlating the mass transfer rate with the concentration change [24]; this is the most important parameter for the design and operation of mixing/sparging [25]. As supplying adequate oxygen (gas-liquid mass transport) is a significant factor in aerobic cultures, maintaining a similar k L a has been frequently employed as the basis in the scaling-up process; besides that, the scale-up basis with the k L a criterion is commonly used in around of 30% of the fermentation industry [23,26,27].",

            "text": "Sanofi with a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell perfusion culture linked to a four-column periodic counter-current chromatography (PCC) for continuous capture (Warikoo et al., 2012). This study paved the way for the development of end-to-end lab-scale processes with integrated capture, virus inactivation (VI), and polishing steps, utilizing fully automated process control (Feidl et al., 2020;Godawat et al., 2015;Gomis-Fons, Andersson, et al., 2020;Gomis-Fons, Schwarz, et al., 2020;Steinebach et al., 2017). However, only a very limited number of studies have shown a successful demonstration of an end-to-end ICB on pilot scale. Arnold et al. described the integration of a 30 L perfusion culture with a multi-column capture step, low-pH VI and a filter train for product concentration, DNA removal and virus filtration (Arnold et al., 2019). In a pilot-scale study by Coolbaugh et al. (2021) multi-column chromatography was utilized in capture and polishing steps. Further downstream, continuous virus filtration, ultrafiltration and diafiltration (UF/DF) and product formulation were integrated into the process. \n\nTangential flow filtration (TFF) or alternating tangential flow filtration (ATF) perfusion bioreactors integrated to multi-column capture chromatography have been widely applied as first units in an ICB. Process intensification through high cell density perfusion in TFF or ATF bioreactors with cell densities up to 130 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml has been demonstrated to boost the volumetric productivity of the upstream system (Chotteau, 2015;Clincke, M\u00f6lleryd, Samani, et al., 2013;Clincke, M\u00f6lleryd, Zhang, et al., 2013). The operation of a steady-state culture with constant cell density can sustain the process with high productivity over a period of several weeks to months and simultaneously ensure a consistent quality of the product.",

Within the context of our second comparative framework, the recombinant protein antigenic vaccine showcased superiority in both economic performance indices and MSDP (0.07 \u20ac/dose). This is attributed to a combination of factors, primarily the lower capital investment, and the notably reduced raw material requirements. These advantages offset concerns related to potential batch failures or variations in downstream yields. In addition, this case incorporates a combination of the most cost-effective strategies for both the upstream and downstream processes. This approach leverages the use of bacterial cell factories, avoiding the use of costly raw materials such as those required for the linearization and the related in vitro transcription processes.",

This may require monitoring and restricting a subset of \"high-risk\" HCPs. 15 ny biopharmaceutical manufacturers are exploring new unit operations, and process intensification with high cell density cultures linked with downstream unit operations in series to operate as a continuous process. Although these are often discussed in terms of the advantages of higher productivity and lower cost of goods, managing HCPs is a key quality attribute for patient safety. Upstream developments to increase mAb titers by prolonging production time results in changed cell density and viability, which may lead to a higher HCP level and modified composition. This poses a higher removal challenge to downstream purification 1 and HCP detection. This review covers the current biopharmaceutical industry trends relating to HCPs as a CQA, as well as innovative technologies for analytical assays and manufacturing processes. Data on in-process HCP levels and clearance were analyzed by way of a comprehensive assessment of the literature on upstream generation, control, and downstream removal of HCPs.",

Expanding the set of purification options available gave insights into the optimal combination to satisfy both cost and purity targets.

This study builds upon previous work on the inoculum's expansion as well as the production step and marks the final step toward a complete upstream process characterization following the FDA guidelines. Critical process parameters were determined during the risk assessment and combined in a DoE approach. In order to adjust the cell viability during the process without elongation of the culture duration, a directed cell death protocol using cytotoxic camptothecin was established. Thereby, it was possible to controllably vary the viability between 60%-99 %. The process was conducted using the ambr250 bioreactor platform, ensuring optimal process control for the desired scale. A mathematical model was calculated to fit the compiled response data using multivariate data analysis. By that, parameter significance was assessed and specific parameter effects and interactions were identified. Bioactivity of the produced antibody was confirmed to stay intact over the varied experimental runs, ruling out parameter effects on the mAb quality. The purity of the supernatant was assessed by measurement of HCPs and residual DNA amounts and used as critical quality attribute because of its crucial effect on the following downstream process. The comparison between centrifugation and filtration as separation methods did not result in significant changes in the amount of impurities in the supernatant. Cell viability and cell density during the separation were determined as non-linear key process parameters with interaction effects.\n\nThese responses were used to establish a design space for optimal mAb proportion and low amounts of residual DNA after the primary recovery. As expected, maintenance of high cell viabilities was determined to be crucial to reduce undesired impurities. The cell density showed a contrary effect on the amounts of HCPs and DNA, with higher cell densities increasing the DNA content while lowering the concentration of HCPs. Therefore, the design space was calculated to combine optimal mAb proportion while maintaining DNA amounts under the defined limit. In conclusion, the viability should be maintained above 85% and the cell density should be controlled around 15 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml during the cell removal.\n\nThe described case study highlights the importance of cell maintenance during the entire upstream process. It confirms the previous findings that changes during the production part of the established mAb production process have no significant influence on the bioact",

            "text": "Bioreactor-based up-scaling of antibody, vaccines, recombinant proteins, and biologics has demonstrated that bioreactors are effective in maintaining cell viability and functionality under controlled physiological conditions, and thus, similar concepts could be applied to up-scaling of cultured meat products using bioengineered scaffolds (Specht et al. 2018). Bioreactors are necessary for 3D dynamic culturing, which allows cells to expand, differentiate, and self-assemble (Seah et al. 2022). It has been suggested that scaffold design, form and their sources are the key factors of the bioprocess design as it exert direct impact on bioreactor seeding efficiency, passaging requirements of the system, downstream processing, bioreactor fluid dynamics and mass transfer, and cost (Allan et al. 2019). \n\nBioreactors for in vitro production should be designed with a significantly larger throughput capability than those now employed for biomedical purposes, which are low volume and high value (Zhang et al. 2020). Various bioreactors including tissue perfusion, continuous stirred tank, rocking platform, and vertical wheel bioreactors are commonly used for growing and providing the nutrient support to the cells in order to from the 3D tissue. Rocking platform bioreactors and vertical wheel bioreactors produce comparable cell growth but at a smaller scale, while continuous stirred tanks provide long-term sterility by mechanical stirring, maintain a high level of oxygen transmission, and prevent bubbling over air-lift reactors, making them ideal for up-scaling animal cell culture (Allan et al. 2019). Van Eelen's team previously filed a patent for industrial-scale meat production using in vitro cell cultures, claiming that adult satellite cells may be cultured on collagen meshwork or microcarrier beads in a stationary or rotating bioreactor (Van Eelen et al. 1999). Furthermore, recent advancements in tissue perfusion bioreactors for bone tissue engineering have sparked the concept of adapting them for large-scale in vitro meat production (Seah et al. 2022).",

Using a panel of model anti-IL-8 IgG1 mutants, we investigate upstream and downstream processability, phase behavior, and process-related impurities. We correlate trends in the biophysical properties of mAbs with their cell growth, expression, filtration flux, solubility, and post-translational modifications. We find significant trends in increased relative free light chain expression with heavy chain mutants and detect a requirement for adjusted operation pH for cation exchange polishing steps with charge-altering variants. Moreover, trends between phase stability and high-concentration viscosity were observed. We also investigated unique correlations between increased glycosylation and biophysical behavior. Further in-depth analysis and modeling are required to elucidate the impact of the mAb sequence on the metabolism of the expression system, solubility limits, and alternative gelation models as future directions.",

            "text": "Recombinant production methods result to highly stable and therefore advantageous products, encompassing a proven track record of clinical safety and efficacy, minimizing the risk of unknown side effects, carrier-related allergic reactions and withdrawals. These vaccines require minimal maintenance to preserve their stability and functionality hence they can be stored at temperature between 2 to 8 \u00b0C for long periods, and can be maintained before use at room temperature with no decomposition. Consequently, this feature ameliorates any respective logistical challenges and minimizes the risks related to post-production regulatory withdrawals. From Chinese Ovary Cell and bacterial cell factories to the necessary chromatographic resins, all the components required for production are accessible for the pharmaceutical industry, with negligible chances of future shortages and extreme price fluctuations, even in case when industrial scale quantities are required. However, it is uncertain whether relying on this production scenario could be successful under the capacities required in case of pandemic outbreaks i.e. whether the economies of scale required should be reached in short time. One of the major drawbacks of the recombinant DNA vaccine production platform is its complicated and therefore difficult-toautomate sub-processes, which constitute any standardization efforts a challenge. As a result, this technology requires additional personnel for process supervision and control purposes. Consequently, the above-mentioned intrinsic barriers constitute the platform less appropriate for encountering pandemic bursts or even following up their mutations, whereas in such cases delay of response can cause devastating results to global health systems and to patients. Furthermore, cellular protein production carries high risk of material contamination, particularly in the upstream processing. The cells used are complex and require strict sanitization measures, which increases the likelihood of contamination and costs. In the event of contamination, the cell line and its products must be discarded, resulting in additional delays and hard to predict financial losses. In addition to contamination risks, recombinant DNA and protein production methods feature low production yield due to the nature of the related live processes. For the monoclonal antibody recombinant DNA platform, in the best-case study scenario for every kilogram that is produced in the upstream line, only 600-700 g are obtained in the required by the regulatory agencies' purity.",

            "text": "lead selection to initiation of clinical trials in 56 days. To accommodate potential demand (need), the platform process was simultaneously transferred to both the typical intermediate-scale singleuse bioreactor platform (2000 L) and, for casirivimab and imdevimab, the larger stainless-steel manufacturing scale (10 000 L) available at Regeneron. These transfers were the first instance in which the current version of the production platform was used at 10 000 L scale. After successful process performance qualification (PPQ) of the batches at the two scales at Regeneron, the process was rapidly transferred to an even larger stainless-steel manufacturing scale (25 000 L) at Genentech's Vacaville manufacturing facility as part of the Genentech collaboration. The process transfer for these antibodies was the first between the two companies. This transfer required building process transfer teams and understanding different manufacturing systems while working virtually as pandemic travel restrictions prevented inperson support. Use of key raw materials, during a period of supply chain disruptions, from Regeneron inventories for the initial batches at Genentech was a further demonstration of the collaborative effort. Collaborations and process transfers between biopharmaceutical companies do not routinely occur at this level of speed and need.\n\nGenentech continued the focus on accelerated timelines by executing multiple steps of the typical transfer process in parallel ( Figure 2). Site functional teams instilled the Regeneron platform process requirements by developing aligned process descriptions, batch records, and facility modifications concurrent with the project strategy deliverables such as transfer gap and risk analysis and master transfer plans.\n\nMultiple entry points existed for optimizing the speed and need during development and transfer, and this paper describes a subset of the process development aspects for the first time. Downstream examples illustrate the speed obtained through minimizing the development timelines at Regeneron and performing atscale resin carryover studies at Genentech in parallel with the manufacturing operations. Upstream examples address the need through successful production scale-up that focuses on appropriate production bioreactor gassing strategies at both companies.",

            "text": "The recombinant monoclonal antibody capture step represents the current bottleneck in downstream processing. Protein A resins are diffusion-limited chromatography materials which require low flow rates to achieve a binding capacity above 30 g L\u22121 with the result of low productivity. Here, we present a novel chromatography membrane combining superior binding capacities with high flow rates for high productivity while achieving comparable product quality as state-of-the-art protein A resins. Further, we demonstrate full scalability of this convecdiff technology with experimental data demonstrating suitability for bioprocessing at different scales. This technology results in more than 10-fold higher productivity compared to Protein A resins, which is maintained during scale up. We demonstrate the influence of residence times, feed titers and the cleaning regime on productivity and indicate optimal utilization of the convecdiff membrane based on feed titer availability. The underlying high productivity and short cycle times of this material enable the purification of monoclonal antibodies with 10-times less chromatography material used per batch and utilization of the membrane within one batch. Provided in disposable consumables, this novel technology will remove column handling in bioprocesses and resin re-use over multiple batches.",

            "text": "The bioindustry requires continuous improvement of its bioprocesses. Continuous improvement is especially important with the implementation of quality-by-design. Recent advances in upstream bioprocessing allow to produce higher cell density cultures, which result in an overload downstream processing. One of the most crucial challenges in primary recovery is the isolation of intracellular products after cell disruption. As well as releasing the product of interest, this step also releases the impurity content, such as DNA and host cell proteins. This generates a rise in the viscosity along with the generation of fine cell debris, which affects subsequent unit operations such as filtration and chromatography (Balasundaram et al., 2009;Singh et al., 2016;Kang et al., 2013). The introduction of flocculation after homogenisation and before centrifugation can enhance the efficiency of primary recovery. The main objective of flocculation is the aggregation of cell debris to create larger particles. Depending on the flocculating agent, it can also reduce the amount of nucleic acids, colloids, and lipids. As a result, this can improve the centrifugation performance and simplify purification steps (Balasundaram et al., 2009;Le Merdy, 2015;Salt et al., 1995;Singh and Chollangi, 2017;Van Alstine et al., 2018). \n\nUltra scale-down (USD) models are powerful tools to increase knowledge about the products and optimise their processes. These allow the use of small quantities of material to better understand the impact on the sample during biomanufacturing in a time-effective manner. These techniques aim to mimic full-scale process behaviour by using lab-scale devices and methodologies (Rayat ACME et al., 2016;Masri, 2016). Therefore, establishing a scale-down methodology for flocculation and centrifugation will benefit the development and optimisation of a robust large-scale primary recovery. \n\nTo this end, the kompAs (R) ultra scale-down centrifugation device was previously created at University College London (UCL) to understand and extrapolate laboratory results into a large-scale process.",

            "text": "Biopharmaceuticals play an important role in today's medical treatments and healthcare. The market share of biopharmaceuticals, mainly monoclonal antibodies, increased vastly over the last decade, and is also forecasted to increase further in the future (Walsh and Walsh 2022;Farid et al. 2020;Lu et al. 2020), although mRNA technologies (Urquhart 2022) as well as bispecific antibodies (Ma et al. 2021;Lu et al. 2020) are gaining momentum. Coinciding with the rising market volumes, productivities should equally rise to meet the demand. In the past, this was achieved predominately by improving volumetric productivities, i.e., improvements of cultivation conditions for increasing viable cell density and consequently volumetric product formation rates. Nowadays, antibody titers of 5 g/L up to well over 10 g/L can be reached (Liang et al. 2023;Mah\u00e9 et al. 2022;Handlogten et al. 2018;Shukla et al. 2017), especially using perfusion processes (McDonnell et al. 2022;Liang et al. 2023;Ding et al. 2022). However, such approaches may reach technical limits of bioreactors (Ozturk 1996) leading to an increased focus on cellspecific productivity (Farid et al. 2020;Ozturk 1996;Becker et al. 2019a, b;Wijaya et al. 2021;Verhagen et al. 2020a, b;Torres and Dickson 2022). Previous research indicated a correlation between cell-specific productivity and the cell cycle. Mainly, the G1 phase was associated with an increase of cell-specific productivity (Hendrick et al. 2001;Dutton et al. 2006;Park et al. 2016;Fussenegger et al. 1997).",

Protein A chromatography (capture) is typically the first step in monoclonal antibody (mAb) downstream purification, used to process the harvest cell culture fluid obtained from the upstream bioreactor, containing the product and impurities. This step is used to capture the product removing most of the bulk protein impurities and reducing the sample volume, while its performance is assessed based on the resulting process yield.\n\nA challenge often encountered in the design of biopharmaceutical downstream separation processes is the variability in the input mixture composition. This is associated with the cell-based upstream production system [5] and cannot be controlled. Therefore, there is an eminent need to design separation units that can handle feed variability. In this work, we follow the abovepresented framework to identify the process DSp and quantify the capability of the process to handle feedstock disturbances.",

(2021b) presented a decisional tool for the evaluation of the most cost-effective lentiviral vector processes, particularly with a comparative focus on the upstream processing (USP) portion of the bioprocess. This tool highlighted the importance of moving to more scalable upstream options from a cost perspective, as suspension was shown to achieve a significant COG reduction over more traditional technologies. This work was later extended to include a comparison between transient transfection and stable producer cell lines to generate viral vector products (Comisel et al., 2021a). Specifically pertaining to AAVs, an upstream cost evaluation was conducted, comparing multiple cell culture technologies, including both adherent and suspension platforms, to identify which technology gave the minimum COG per dose (Cameau et al., 2020). To date, there has not been an in-depth analysis of whole flowsheets with both upstream and downstream manufacturing strategies for AAV from both economic and purity perspectives. \n\nThis paper investigates the cost-effectiveness of AAV manufacturing strategies, evaluating both USP and downstream processing (DSP). Section 4.1 provides the deterministic analysis, focusing upon adherent cell factories (CF10) versus suspension stirred tank bioreactors for cell culture, and batch ultracentrifugation against anionexchange chromatography (AEX) for polishing purification comparison. Section 4.2 outlines how the dose size affects this base case COG/ dose ranking. Furthermore, an uncertainty analysis was carried out to compare the robustness of the different manufacturing strategies in Section 4.3. Finally, an optimization of AAV purification platform was implemented in Sections 4.4 and 4.5 to find the optimal capture and polishing options from an economic and purity perspective.",

We compared the overall performance of scale-down cultivations, using a two-compartment setup consisting of a stirred tank reactor (STR) combined with a plugflow reactor (PFR), with lab-scale cultivations in a classical STR as reference. The two setups had the same size of 20 L and the only difference of the used processes were the connection of the plug-flow compartment at feed start. By generation of heterogeneities in the PFR of the scale-down setup, conditions similar to the ones in large-scale (m 3 range) bioreactors were generated. Therefore, the results of the scale-down setup should different scales, simplifies process implementation at production scale, and helps to meet regulatory quality guidelines defined for biopharmaceutical manufacturing.\n\nKeywords: Scale-down, Recombinant protein production, Fab, Norleucine misincorporation, Escherichia coli mimic the outcome of a large-scale production process. The E. coli host strains BL21(DE3) and HMS174(DE3) producing the antibody fragment FTN2, named B < oFTN2 > and H < oFTN2 > , were grown in high cell density cultivations.\n\nOnline data for pH and DO from scale-down and reference cultivations (Fig. 1) already revealed differences between the strains. One measurement point (MP) was located in the STR and four MPs were analyzed along the PFR. The MPs in the PFR correspond to residence times (RT) of 5 s (sec), 13 s, 20 s and 33 s, respectively. For B < oFTN2 >, acidification along the PFR occurred faster at the beginning, but slowed down after longer RT in the PFR. The pH during H < oFTN2 > cultivations reached a plateau between MP1 to MP3 and then dropped from MP3 to MP4. Therefore, acidification during H < oFTN2 > cultivations was slower at smaller RT, but higher at the end of the PFR, compared to cultivations with B < oFTN2 > . Oxygen consumption rate was also different along the P",

            "text": "However, this method can result in cells experiencing inconsistent gas transfer rates and hydrodynamic forces, resulting in unwanted aggregate heterogeneity. AggreWell TM plates (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, USA), which use centrifugal force to distribute single cells into microwells shaped like inverted pyramids, could be used as an alternative option to promote the formation of more homogeneous aggregates. However, using any kind of well-plate for large-scale manufacturing, either by scale up or scale out, can quickly become cost-prohibitive in regard to consumables, labor, and time. Shaker flasks or roller bottles provide a suspension-based mixing environment. However, their lack of process controls and scalability compared to bioreactors can also result in heterogeneous aggregates and make them cost-prohibitive for large-scale manufacturing. \n\nA robust and scalable manufacturing process is crucial for the consistent production of PSC aggregates that will become allogeneic cell therapy products for patients. For a typical process, initial donor cells, often of limited quantity, first go through a seed train expansion process before being transferred into larger-scale platforms such as bioreactors for various cell culture processes. Progressively larger bioreactors can be used sequentially to generate the vast cell quantities necessary for allogeneic applications. A single dose of therapeutic cell therapy for one patient could require billions of cells [7]. For example, if approximately one million cells per milliliter of medium is the target concentration for PSCs in a bioreactor, then one dose will typically require one liter of medium at the time of bioreactor harvest. Therefore, for an allogeneic cell manufacturing process, hundred or thousand liters of culture working volume should be required to generate hundred or thousand of doses per batch. Furthermore, a certain percentage of cells will invariably be lost during various downstream processes such as harvest, wash, concentration, formulation, and fill/finish steps. The target number of cells produced per lot will need to account for these expected losses. \n\nThis communication will highlight specific manufacturing processes that may be particularly challenging, especially at larger volumetric scales, and provide examples of how optimal technology can provide solutions to enable scalable production of allogeneic cell therapies.",

Since 2016, about 70% of all rBPs and mAbs were produced from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, which are attributed to their robust growth and potential to produce non-immunogenic antibodies with similar glycosylation patterns to those of human antibodies (Lalonde and Durocher 2017;Dahodwala and Lee 2019;MacDonald et al., 2021). Meanwhile, at the current approval rate of four new products a year, more than 70 mAbs were on the market by 2020, and the world-wide sales will reach $125 billion (Ecker et al., 2015;Bhatti and Salama 2018). Compared with most of the small molecular drugs, mAbs feature with some advantages such as reduced off-target effects, greater surface area for binding, etc. (Shepard et al., 2017;Ha et al., 2022). In order to improve the competitiveness of one mAb product, the mAb titer needs to be improved to elevate the economic effectiveness (Ha et al., 2022). Therefore, it is essential to develop advanced technology by process engineering, optimization, and control strategies. \n\nNowadays, fed-batch and perfusion cell cultures are the two current processes of the large-scale industrial production of mAbs and rBPs (Zhuang et al., 2017;Zheng et al., 2018;Schulze et al., 2022). Generally, scaling of the fed-batch process needs larger and more rigid layouts which limits its application (Karst et al., 2016;MacDonald et al., 2021). The membrane-based alternating tangential flow filtration (ATF) technology is the most commonly used cell retention method in perfusion cultures to increase cells density and mAbs productivity (Genzel et al., 2014;Gr\u00e4nicher et al., 2020).",

            "text": "After protein extraction and purification, the yield was 280 ug of scFV per liter of bacterial culture. The drawbacks of these systems are due to the absence of post-translational modifications and a poor excretion system, as the stability of the proteins depends on the oxidative environment where it is secreted. In addition, inclusion bodies can be formed, hindering antibody purification [229][230][231] . Strategies to optimize antibody production in E. coli are listed in Table 3. \n\nThe most commonly used yeasts for these purposes are Pichia pastoris [240][241][242] and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 243,244 . Both are easy to grow, perform post-translational modifications such us disulfide-bonded and protein glycosylation, have a high growth rate and protein secretion levels are very high. Contrary to bacterial expression systems, protein secretion in yeasts constitutes a great productive advantage since the secreted proteins are harvested relatively quickly from the culture medium, so downstream processes are cheaper 242,245 . Pichia pastoris is also the most widely used yeast strain due to its ease of industrial scaling. It reduces costs and minimizes equipment used for implementing pilot or industrial bioreactors 246 . Yeast expression systems are used to produce recombinant antibodies and proteins with inhibitory action against venom toxins (Figure 2). The antimyotoxic protein DM64, which acts against phospholipases A2 of Bothrops asper venom 247 , was successfully produced by a recombinant Pichia pastoris. \n\nMammalian cells are commonly used to produce biopharmaceuticals, antibodies and active protein 248 . Antibody production in mammalian cell systems is mainly selected by its ability to carry out post-translational modifications that maintain antibody stability so a correct protein function. However, expensive culture media due to nutrient requirements and high contamination rates limit this technology. In addition, yields are low and the slow production time increases costs 236,249 . \n\nLaustsen et al. 251 and Jenkins and Laustsen 250 estimated the cost of large-scale production of antibodies in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell expression systems using a fed-batch fermentation strategy.",

            "text": "Well-characterized and scalable downstream process for purification of biologics is extremely demanding for delivering quality therapeutics to patients at a reasonable price. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a blockbuster biologic with diverse clinical applications but its application is limited to financially well-off societies due to high price. The high price of EPO is associated with the technical difficulties related to the purification challenge to obtain qualified product with a cost-effective defined process. Though there are reports for purification of EPO but there is no report of well-characterized downstream process with critical process parameters (CPPs) that can deliver EPO consistently satisfying the quality target product profile (QTPP), which is a critical regulatory requirement. To advance the field, we applied quality by design (QbD) principle and design of experiment (DoE) protocol to establish an effective process, which is scalable up to 100\u00d7 batch size satisfying QTPP. We have successfully transformed the process from static mode to dynamic mode and validated. Insignificant variation (p> 0.05) within and between 1\u00d7, 10\u00d7 and 100\u00d7 batches showed that the process is reproducible and seamlessly scalable. The biochemical analysis along with the biofunctionality data ensures that the products from different-scale batches were indifferent and comparable to a reference product. Our study thereby established a robust and scalable downstream process of EPO biosimilar satisfying QTPP. The technological scheme presented here can speed-up the production of not only EPO but many other life-saving biologics and make them available to mass population at a reduced cost.",

            "text": "The production of recombinant therapeutic proteins has become increasingly popular for the large-scale manufacturing of medical-grade biotherapeutics [1][2][3]. Although Escherichia coli (E. coli) and yeast are the most established organisms for biomanufacturing of recombinant proteins, production in mammalian cells has considerable advantages, particularly for complex protein products [3,4]. When produced in mammalian cells, recombinant human proteins undergo more accurate post-translational processing, which is crucial for proteins that require complicated tertiary structures to exhibit biological activity [3,[5][6][7]. Compared to the simpler expression systems of E. coli and yeast, one of the biggest drawbacks of using mammalian cells can be the more stringent culture conditions, which can also involve anchorage-dependent growth with less efficient two-dimensional (2D) cultures. The 2D culture systems are reliable and well defined, but the limited growth surface area places them at a disadvantage with respect to large-scale production. Over the past two decades, much effort has been directed at adapting mammalian cell expression systems for more efficient three-dimensional (3D) culture in suspension. This has been Gels 2023, 9, 243 2 of 24 achieved by either adapting the mammalian cells to continuous cell lines (CCLs), such as with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that can grow directly in suspension, or growing the mammalian cells with microcarriers [8][9][10]. Whereas certain mammalian cell types that are anchorage-dependent may not be able to conform to suspension culture, most anchorage-dependent cells can grow in or on microcarriers. \n\nThe manufacturing capacity of systems using anchorage-dependent mammalian cells has become a critical issue in the development of protein-based therapeutics. As new therapeutic proteins produced in these cells are introduced, 2D systems are initially used for making high-quality products with sufficient production yields for achieving the research and development goals. As the biotherapeutic reaches the clinical phases of development, efficient bioprocessing using large-scale, state-of-the-art manufacturing paradigms becomes essential.",

            "text": "There is a lot of effort directed at the use of plants as model host species during recombinant protein production. Depending on the type of protein being produced and the production scale, the choice of a host plant is one of the most important considerations during the development of recombinant proteins in transgenic plants. The choice of a host is governed by factors such as the size of the product as well as post-translational modifications. Similarly, the transformation method chosen plays an equally central role during the recombinant protein production process. While attention has been placed on the upstream processing of plants during the early stages of recombinant protein production, more attention and research need to be directed at downstream processing. Different recombinant proteins require different extraction and purification processes, emphasizing the need for more extensive research in the recovery and purification of the proteins. The use of recombinant protein extraction and purification strategies such as blanching [92], sucrose density gradient centrifugation [86], and one-step Ni 2+ affinity chromatography [93] has been used successfully during the downstream processing of plant-produced vaccine candidates. Despite current challenges and obstacles, the production of vaccine candidates in transgenic plants appears to be getting more pervasive. \n\nExisting plant expression platforms afford a lot of benefits beyond the conventional advantages of high scalability, low cost, eukaryotic protein modification, and enhanced safety. Inimitable transient expression vectors have been generated to enable the expression of therapeutics and vaccines at an unprecedented pace to combat probable pandemics and bioterrorism threats. Plant-derived biologics comprise the fastest and largest growing category of pharmaceutical products. Presently, a majority of human biopharmaceuticals are generated in microbial and mammalian cell cultures. These require facilities that are capital-intensive in addition to the necessity of fermenters, costly downstream processing, cold temperature requirements for storage, and transport as well as sterile delivery schemes [108]. On the other hand, plant-based production platforms dispense with the need for bioreactors, expensive cell culture media, and capital-restrictive facilities while being easily scaled up in comparatively inexpensive greenhouses with facile mineral solutions. Therefore, plant-derived expression systems afford the innate advantage of reduced manufacturing costs.",

MAb downstream unit operations require significant investment in development, scale-up and validation. Therefore, an increase in efficiency, and a decrease in time and costs is a priority. 1 To address this need, high throughput process development (HTPD) has established itself as a powerful technology to accelerate development and optimization, and has shown particular promise when employed in mAb downstream processes. Current HTPD tools provide a platform approach for time-and resource-efficient chromatographic process development, through implementation of miniaturization, automation, and parallelization. 2 High throughput chromatographic techniques are not defined by a single format nor scale. 3][4] However, these tools are suitable for different applications; for example, microtiter filter plates were used for investigating semi-equilibrium conditions through the assessment of adsorption conditions on an objective, such as improving binding capacity or impurity removal. 5 Several other screening studies which use these 96-well filter plates have also been reported, for example operating condition screening 6 in cation exchange chromatography (CEX) 7 and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) 8 processes, as well as estimation of dynamic binding capacities. 9 The pre-packed micropipette chromatography was successfully employed in protein adsorption studies, and even in the development of a chromatography step for the purification of virus like particles. 4 [12] However, the purification sequence does not only comprise the chromatographic operations in isolation, but instead is formed of several unit operations in sequence, each of which targets specific impurities and contaminants. Therapeutic mAbs are expressed in mammalian cells, which involves transfection of the genomic DNA of interest into the chosen cell, for example Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO). 13 The transfection method occurs through viral means, which therefore poses the risk of viral contamination of the mAb product. 14 nsequently, viral inactivation must be performed in the mAb manufacturing process.",

            "text": "The production costs for PVNPs may be more favorable than those of other nanoparticle manufacturing methods. While downstream purification is a key cost driver contributing significantly to the total cost of production due to stringent clinical grade purity requirements in all production systems [140], plant-based systems eliminate the need for costly bioreactors, thereby reducing the overall production costs compared to, for instance, mammalian cell expression systems [146]. Monoclonal antibodies and their derivatives are currently the dominant class of biologics on the market for human therapeutics [147]. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are utilized in research, diagnostics and therapeutics for various infections and cancer. According to Novaoneadvisor 2024 report #8686 [148], the global market size for mAbs therapeutics is currently USD 233.19 billion in 2024 and is expected to increase to USD 919.06 billion by 2033, with a CAGR of 14.7%. It is not surprising that technoeconomic analysis to assess production costs in plants has focused mainly on this biologics class [149]. A direct comparison of antibody production costs in plants and mammalian cells was conducted by [150]. Whereas a Chinese Hamster ovary (CHO) facility annually producing 250 kg mAb at a 1 g/L yield and a 70% downstream recovery rate had a cost of goods sold (COGS) of $260/g and operational expenses of $65 million/year [151], a transient expression Nicotiana benthamiana plant facility of a similar production scale was predicted to have a COGS of $131/g and OPEX of 33 million/year [150]. This represented an approximate reduction of 50% in COGS and OPEX when utilizing a plant production facility. In a mammalian production facility producing 1000 kg of monoclonal antibody annually at a 1 g/L yield, the downstream processing costs were $232/g [152], whereas a Nicotiana benthamiana plant production facility with a 600 kg/year capacity was predicted to have a COGS of approximately $99/kg, inclusive of upstream and downstream processing costs [150]. This is a more than 50% reduction in manufacturing costs and indicates the cost advantage of plant-based expression systems compared with mammalian cell-based protein production systems.",

Continuous manufacturing is a technological solution to improve biotherapeutic yields, reducing costs, and encouraged by regulatory agencies [159][160][161]. OMVs have been studied for production through continuous manufacturing [162] where spontaneous OMVs from N. meningitidis were first made to grow in a batch and later diluted to reach steady state after 100h, producing 4 \u00d7 10 14 OMVs/mL/day, equivalent to the maximum production obtained in batch production evaluated by the same group [163,164]. Steady state of OMV production was maintained for at least 600h and the group showed reproducibility [162]. Upstream continuous production of OMVs can be coupled with continuous purification using techniques such as TFF, with the addition of appropriate inline analysis to create a fully continuous operation. With such techniques being implemented for more mature biologics such as antibodies, such studies on OMVs show how these can be adopted to produce OMV based therapeutics.",

            "text": "The previous sections have provided an in-depth elucidation of the prevailing traditional pathway in the proactive development of diagnostic antibodies. This conventional trajectory involves distinct stages such as animal immunization, meticulous screening for viable genetic material, and the antibody replication process guided by the central method. Simultaneously, a meticulous analysis has been conducted to scrutinize the intricate challenges embedded in three critical phases at the current research stage. These phases encompass the immunization stage, where the acquisition of specific immunogens, notably membrane proteins, poses considerable challenges, 46 compounded by the extended duration of the immunization cycle. The effective screening of the genetic material stage encounters the formidable challenge posed by the most advanced single B cell high-throughput screening technology, demanding extensive efforts in recombinant expression and subsequent validation. Lastly, the antibody replication stage contends with the existing foreign monopoly on high-expression cell lines, resulting in homogeneous antibody replication that lacks diverse core competencies beyond the realm of production capacity. \n\nIn response to the aforementioned technical challenges, we propose a groundbreaking approach for the next-generation development of diagnostic monoclonal antibodies and implement it comprehensively. From an immunological perspective, an examination of the vaccine development history reveals that conventional vaccine research entails prolonged cycles, rendering it inadequate for the rapid response demands of emerging infectious diseases. The advent of RNA vaccines, utilizing the genetic code of viruses to 'trick' human cells into producing proteins identical to those on the pathogen's surface, presents an unparalleled advantage in swiftly addressing novel infectious disease outbreaks. 47 Employing the RNA vaccine model not only effectively resolves the issue of acquiring challenging immunogens but also enhances the original conformation of immunogens by bypassing traditional steps of immunogen replication or purification, theoretically elevating the effectiveness of the immune response. From a cost perspective, this approach significantly reduces both the development cycle and the expenses associated with immunogen acquisition (Figure 3). Examining antibody sequence discovery, despite prevalent views that single B cell high-throughput platforms accelerate antibody development, [9][10][11][12][13] these platforms undeniably pose significant challenges in terms of downstream replication and validation.",

            "text": "The preparation process of monoclonal antibodies differs from polyclonal antibodies. After immunizing animals such as mice with the immunogen, spleen cells are isolated, fused with myeloma cells, and then subjected to cell culture. Positive clone cells are selected, expanded in culture, and purified to obtain stable mouse monoclonal antibodies. This method requires the establishment of a large-scale animal facility, incurs high operating costs, and lacks effective control over antibody batch-to-batch variation. Additionally, ethical concerns related to animals may arise in the future. In light of these challenges, researchers have developed genetic engineering antibody technology, wherein DNA recombinant technology and protein engineering are employed to recombine antibody genes. Using efficient cell secretion, genetically engineered antibodies 32 are obtained. This technology is well-established in the industry and involves acquiring the antibody's gene sequence, constructing plasmid expression vectors, and transferring them into expression hosts (such as yeast, mammalian cells, or bacteria) to express and purify specific types of recombinant antibodies. It not only enables the production of full-length antibodies but also various antibody fragments such as scFv, Fab, and others. \n\nIn summary, the development of monoclonal antibodies revolves around the discovery of antibody sequences, which is carried out by the upstream animal immunization and the downstream antibody recombination, resulting F I G U R E 1 Three critical phases of antibody discovery: i) superficial cognition: manually (Elisa) discovers effective cells from a pile of cells; ii) deep cognition: identification of functional genetic material within a pool of genetic substances; iii) comprehensive cognition: epigenetic screening combined with genetic material mining. \n\nin the physical presentation of monoclonal antibody raw materials (Figure 1).",

            "text": "Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) have gained significant attention in the biopharmaceutical field due to their capability to target two different targets or two epitopes on one antigen, potentially enabling the design of novel therapeutic mechanisms of action (MoA) and enhancing efficacy [1]. BsAbs achieve their specific functions due to their unique molecular structure. However, this necessitates meticulous design and development to guarantee both their efficacy and manufacturability [2,3]. \n\nManufacturability refers to the characteristics and considerations related to large-scale production and storage. It includes optimizing expression systems, cell line development, upstream and downstream processing, formulation, stability, quality control, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. By addressing these factors, efficient and cost-effective manufacturing processes can be developed to produce high-quality BsAbs products. As an important part of developability, [4] which refers to the likelihood that an antibody candidate will evolve into a manufacturable, stable, safe and effective drug, manufacturability should be evaluated and assessed early in the discovery phase. Ideally, potential liabilities should be identified and mitigated as early as possible [5,6]. Antibodies with poor manufacturability will bring enormous challenges to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) development, manufacturing, formulation, storage, transportation and administration, and may even lead to the failure in clinical trial [7,8]. \n\nAs one of the most common manufacturability issues, antibody aggregation is highly undesirable. It may complicate the production process, impair biological activity, and increase the risk of immunogenicity [9][10][11][12]. Antibody aggregation could be mitigated through diverse approaches, including the development of purification process [13,14], and formulation optimization [15][16][17]. However, significant antibody aggregation that leads to product precipitation during downstream production will likely require sequence engineering [10,18,19]. The effectiveness of sequence engineering heavily relies on the fundamental understanding of aggregation mechanism at molecular level, mainly involving colloidal stability and conformational stability [20,21].",

            "text": "It is impossible to predict future variants of SARS-CoV-2, so drugs that are robust over the long term should have extremely broad epitope coverage. \n\nPreviously, we generated the world's first highly diverse, recombinant hyperimmune globulins; using a high-throughput single B cell capture microfluidic technology, diverse antibody repertoires from COVID-19 convalescent donors were captured and antibody sequences were cloned and expressed in a targeted integration Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line [12]. Upstream and downstream processes were developed based on standard mAb manufacturing, to allow for use of existing manufacturing infrastructure (Figure 1). The recombinant hyperimmune globulin drug product, GIGA-2050, is currently in clinical trials in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States (US). We previously demonstrated that GIGA-2050 comprises 12,500 unique antibodies and binds to a wide variety of SARS-CoV-2 variants [12], like plasma hyperimmune globulins for COVID-19; a detailed study of the ability of GIGA-2050 to neutralize all major variants of concern is underway (manuscript in preparation). \n\nIn this current study, we describe the manufacturing controls, pharmacological assessments, and in vivo studies used to support an investigational new drug (IND) application. To assess consistency across batches and upstream process scalability, the CHO cells were monitored for cell viability, antibody production titers, and sequence diversity. Additionally, each GIGA-2050 lot was tested for purity and product quality, including potency using a SARS-CoV-2 Spike ELISA and a cell-based pseudovirus neutralization assay. This work demonstrates that a recombinant hyperimmune globulin can be manufactured under GMP at up to 250 L scale, leveraging equipment and methods used in conventional mAb manufacturing, and that such a process was comparable across multiple lots.",

            "text": "Traditional batch or fed-batch production processes yield a specific volumetric and mass quantity of product upon harvest and clarification. The product is isolated during the downstream process, which normally consists of a Protein-A chromatography capture step, low pH viral inactivation, one or more polishing chromatography steps, virus nanofiltration, and a UF/DF step to properly formulate the drug substance prior to sterile filtration and bulk filling. Each unit operation is discrete while, at the same time, integrated continuously together into a holistic process workflow (reviewed in [24,25]). \n\nThe advent of perfusion-based upstream processes has contributed to developing continuous DSP processes for antibody purification. In a continuous process, the product is constantly removed from the perfusion bioreactor and processed in a series of steps analogous to those used for batch or fed-batch DSP. In a fully continuous DSP process, each step would lead directly into the next in a seamless and automated manner. Facility and technological limitations might prevent the design of a fully continuous DSP process, necessitating some steps to be performed semi-continuously. The case for operating DSP processes in continuous versus batch mode needs to be carefully evaluated with an appropriate risk assessment to make the appropriate decision based on the operational scale, stage of product development, regulatory strategy, and availability of facilities and equipment. Cost of goods modelling for DSP processing using stainless steel, SU, and continuous processes for mAbs produced at various scales has revealed clear cost advantages for continuous processing, in most scenarios, but especially at higher production volume, higher final product mass, and antibody titer [17,26]. A summary of the status of continuous mAb manufacturing adoption for several biotech companies has recently been published [24]. \n\nFor harvesting from perfusion bioreactors, TFF and ATF (alternating tangential flow) filtration are possible. In ATF, alternating pressure and vacuum are applied to the permeate flow using a diaphragm pump. As a result, the reverse flow is used to reduce the fouling of the hollow fiber membrane [27]. Cells and higher molecular weight materials are recirculated back to the bioreactor while the product permeate can be directed towards capture chromatography.",

            "text": "Specific molecule design strategies, e.g. knobs-into-holes technology combined with CrossMab technology greatly enhances correct chain association (8,9). Additional progress was achieved by excluding position-specific effects by using targeted integration (TI) host(s), allowing for homogeneous gene expression via integrating predefined expression vectors in the TI landing pad (10,11). Regardless, the manufacturing yields of complex antibody formats are lower than monoclonal antibodies, making them 'difficult-to-express' (DTE). \n\nCHO cells serve as the preferred expression system for the commercial production of therapeutic proteins (12). During the development of stable recombinant CHO cell lines, high-producing clones are generated and tested extensively to identify lead clone(s) for commercial manufacturing use. Notably, clone performance early during the cell line development process and at small scales (shake flask, multiwells) is not necessarily predictive of industrial scale performance (13). Constant changes in CHO genome via rearrangements and DNA methylation patterns result in large diversity of genotypes spontaneously arising in CHO cell populations (14). This instability is a constant and unpredictable feature with no population being stable or uniform over an extended period of time (15,16). However, the success of CHO cells in biomanufacturing is at least partly based on this flexibility to adapt to any given environment quickly (17). Importantly, once cells have physiologically adapted to their new environment, i.e. the bioreactor set-up, their phenotype remains stable, as long as this environment is kept (17). The field is, therefore, relying on miniaturized microbioreactor (MBR) systems as downscale models to closely mimic the production process of current good manufacturing practice in large-scale bioreactors (18). The MBR systems have been shown to reproduce the performance of CHO clones under conventional bioreactor production conditions (with regulated pH, dissolved oxygen, CO 2 and nutrition levels) (19). \n\nThe increasing demand of high-value DTE molecules is illustrated by more than 100 bsAbs currently in clinical trials, which underlines the need for developing high-yield expression systems.",

High T cell dose per patient and increasing patient numbers result in clinical demand for a large number of allogeneic T cells. This necessitates a manufacturing platform that can be scaled up while retaining cell quality. Here we present a closed and scalable platform for T cell manufacturing to meet clinical demand. Upstream manufacturing steps of T cell activation and expansion are done in-vessel, in a stirred-tank bioreactor. T cell selection, which is necessary for CAR-T-based therapy, is done in the bioreactor itself, thus maintaining optimal culture conditions through the selection step. Platform's attributes of automation and performing the steps of T cell activation, expansion, and selection in-vessel, greatly contribute to enhancing process control, cell quality, and to the reduction of manual labor and contamination risk. In addition, the viability of integrating a closed, automated, downstream process of cell concentration, is demonstrated. The presented T cell manufacturing platform has scale-up capabilities while preserving key factors of cell quality and process control.",

Vaccination is crucial to mitigate its impact, but requires rapid and efficient manufacturing strategies to handle timing and supply. Traditionally relying on egg-based production, the field has witnessed a paradigm shift toward cell culture-based methods offering enhanced flexibility, scalability, and process safety. This review provides a concise overview of available cell substrates and technological advancements. We summarize crucial steps toward process intensification \u2013 from roller bottle production to dynamic cultures on carriers and from suspension cultures in batch mode to high cell density perfusion using various cell retention devices. Moreover, we compare single-use and conventional systems and address challenges including defective interfering particles.

            "text": "The approval of gene therapies such as Luxturna (Spark Therapeutics) and Zolgensma (Novartis) has pushed adenoassociated viruses (AAV) to the clinic (Merten et al., 2014;Mendell et al., 2021). However, the quantity of AAV required for such applications varies from 1 \u00d7 10 13 (e.g., Leber's congenital amaurosis) to 5 \u00d7 10 20 viral genomes (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy), placing substantial pressure on manufacturing processes (Koilkonda et al., 2014;Crudele and Chamberlain, 2019). Despite the several technologies available, the upstream processing of AAV is still one of the main bottlenecks of clinical-grade AAV manufacturing (Smith et al., 2018) with specific production titers and vector quality (i.e., % full particles) being two of the most challenging parameters to control and/or optimize (Merten, 2016). The implementation of process intensification strategies has already been demonstrated to overcome these challenges with successful case studies for monoclonal antibodies (Chen et al., 2018;Xu et al., 2020). These methodologies enable high cell density (HCD) cultures, increased productivity, and the reduction of processing times required to achieve higher target quantities (Chahal et al., 2014;Yang et al., 2014;Cook et al., 2020). \n\nFed-batch cultures have been extensively demonstrated to improve cell growth and viability while enabling higher yields for protein and virus-like particle production (Chan et al., 2002;Meghrous et al., 2009;Cao et al., 2019). Additionally, perfusion has been successfully implemented for increasing cell densities and productivities. This is, accomplished using devices that enable cell retention and simultaneous medium exchange thus preventing nutrient depletion while removing growth-inhibiting compounds (Cameau et al., 2019). Amongst the different cell retention devices available, ATF (alternating tangential flow) has been widely used for bioprocess intensification (Hadpe et al., 2017;Kamga et al., 2018;Fernandes et al., 2021).",

            "text": "They are time consuming, labor intensive, and often involve open processes, which limit their applications in large-scale expansion at the industrial scale [23]. As a result, they are prone to human error and largely experience-dependent, and they can result in batch-to-batch variability, lack of reproducibility, increased production costs, and an increased risk of culture contamination. To address the current challenges of manual cell culture, the introduction of multilayered cell culture flasks to enhance the scale-up process from single-layered T-flasks provides an alternative approach for the cellular manufacturing industry [24]. Recent advances in culture vessel design allow researchers to not only upscale the process but also reduce medium consumption, make the process less labor intensive and increase cell numbers. In terms of automated platforms, bioreactor systems are the most widely used methods for culturing cells to harvest proteins, as they are scalable, amenable to the integration of environmental control and real-time monitoring of the cell culture, and capable of an automated response to changes in culture conditions to maintain a high protein yield [25]. However, these systems are designed and optimized to obtain the highest yield of the protein of interest but do not prioritize the quality of the cells themselves. Thus, the use of bioreactors needs to be carefully considered to allow cells of the best quality to be produced and harvested. However, there has been no direct comparison of the quality of MSCs produced via either multilayered flasks or automated culture platforms to date. \n\nA direct comparison between a manual manufacturing process and its automated counterpart allows researchers and investigators Manufacturing process of an allogeneic MSC-based product under manual and automated culture conditions. MSC-based products can be derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue, or umbilical cord tissue, followed by culture under xeno-and serum-free conditions to establish a Token cell bank, master cell bank, and working cell bank for the manufacturing process. Conventional manufacturing processes (manual vs. automated) have both advantages and limitations, but there is a need for an interchangeable system that allows investors to easily switch from one to another depending on the scale of downstream applications of the product.",

            "text": "The recovery and purification of biosynthetic is critical in assuring its quality. After the proteins are produced and harvested, the next step is purification. The principal concern for purification is purity, followed by speed, overall yield, cost, and process throughput [52]. However, although purification will remove most unwanted molecules, heterogeneities will still occur [39]. Various modifications such as incomplete disulphide bond formation, glycosylation, N-terminal pyroglutamine cyclisation, C-terminal lysine processing, deamidation, isomerization, and oxidation, over the protein lifespan amass to heterogeneity [109]. Furthermore, heterogeneity may be caused by subsequent exposure to culture media, stress from pH and temperature as well as post-translational modifications, degradation, and other chemical modifications during preparation and storing [39].\n\nA purification system is chosen on the basis of its robustness, reliability, and scalability. Affinity purification are often the choice method for antibodies although its effectiveness is reliant on the antibody's ability to bind to an affinity adsorbent [110]. For process scale purification, Protein A affinity chromatography derived by the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus is the benchmark as it utilises specific ligand interactions between mAb Fc region and immobilised Protein A to achieve high selectivity at over 95% [52]. For pharmaceutically accepted purity levels, Protein A affinity chromatography is followed up by cation-exchange chromatography and then anion-exchange chromatography [52]. It is then proceeded with virus inactivation and ultrafiltration/ diafiltration. Other purification systems include histidineligand-affinity chromatography, metal-affinity chromatography, thiophilic interaction, lectin-affinity chromatography, and purification of recombinant antibodies using affinity tags [110].",

            "text": "The production of clinical-grade EV faces significant challenges, including the development of standardized and scalable upstream and downstream processes, and precise characterization of both the producing cells and the EV, in compliance with regulatory guidelines. In this study, we aimed to investigate the scalability of a serum-free EV production process from anchorage-dependent cells cultured as spheroids. Using the 1.4E7 human \u03b2 cell line, we compared the attributes of spheroid-derived sEV produced in stirred systems to those produced in a ML reference process. Additionally, we explored the impact of hydrodynamics on cell and spheroid fate and investigated scale-up strategies to standardize spheroid generation. \n\nRegardless of FBS supplementation, 3D culture promoted the self-aggregation of 1.4E7 cells into compact, well-defined, and highly viable spheroids, without substrate limitations or too high accumulation of toxic metabolic wastes. Culturing 1.4E7 cells as spheroids induced a shift towards oxidative pathway respiration, indicating a more efficient use of glucose for energy production (Vander Heiden et al., 2009). 1.4E7 cells exhibited significant growth rate reduction when cultured as spheroids, regardless of FBS supplementation. Therefore, the process we developed included an initial expansion phase using ML cultures with FBS, while sEV production was carried out in STBr using spheroid cultures in a serum-free, chemically defined medium. The largest spheroids were obtained after 72 h of culture in SpF at a P/V of 2.6 W/m 3 , with an average diameter of 248 \u00b5m \u00b1 20. Gas, nutrient, and metabolic waste diffusion with the extracellular environment appeared to be sufficient at these sizes (Debruyne et al., 2024). \n\nStirred systems have been proposed as effective methods for producing large quantities of size-adjusted spheroids compared to static culture approaches (Liu et al., 2021). Additionally, STBr are the preferred culture systems for closely monitoring cell culture parameters and scaling up processes. They are extensively used for producing biological medicines, including recombinant proteins, vaccines, and viral vectors.",

            "text": "The production and use of engineered microbial species for pharmaceutical applications are inherently susceptible to various forms of contamination. Contamination risks can manifest during the genetic engineering phase, in laboratory-scale culture, throughout large-scale bioprocessing, and even during the final product formulation. Both microbial and genetic contaminations present serious challenges that can compromise product quality, efficacy, and patient safety. Figure 3 shows the various sources of microbial contamination in the production of engineered microbial products, highlighting potential pathways of contamination and mitigation strategies to ensure product safety and regulatory compliance. Microbial contamination is one of the most persistent challenges in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Even under strictly controlled aseptic conditions and rigorous adherence to good manufacturing practices (GMPs), the introduction of adventitious agents-bacteria, fungi, or viruses-can occur through raw materials, process water, or human contact [146]. In large-scale fermentations, nutrient-rich environments can facilitate the rapid growth of contaminants, leading not only to product loss but also to safety risks if these contaminants survive downstream purification processes. The high cost and complexity of implementing comprehensive environmental monitoring systems further exacerbate these risks, especially for smaller enterprises or academic laboratories. \n\nTo counteract these challenges, advanced analytical methods have been developed to detect contamination early in the production process. Techniques such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and mass spectrometry are increasingly integrated into manufacturing workflows, allowing for real-time monitoring and rapid intervention when contamination is detected [135]. Despite these advances, the need for such sophisticated systems increases both the capital and operational costs associated with manufacturing engineered microbial therapeutics.",

            "text": "The commercial growth factors (GFs) and serum proteins (SPs) contribute to the high cost associated with the serum-free media for cultivated meat production. Producing recombinant GFs and SPs in scale from microbial cell factories can reduce the cost of culture media. Escherichia coli is a frequently employed host in the expression recombinant GFs and SPs. This review explores critical strategies for cost reduction in GFs and SPs production, focusing on yield enhancement, product improvement, purification innovation, and process innovation. Firstly, the review discusses the use of fusion tags to increase the solubility and yield of GFs & SPs, highlighting various studies that have successfully employed these tags for yield enhancement. We then explore how tagging strategies can streamline and economize the purification process, further reducing production costs. Additionally, we address the challenge of low half-life in GFs and SPs and propose potential strategies that can enhance their stability. Furthermore, improvements in the E. coli chassis and cell engineering strategies are also described, with an emphasis on the key areas that can improve yield and identify areas for cost minimization. Finally, we discuss key bioprocessing areas which can facilitate easier scale-up, enhance yield, titer, and productivity, and ultimately lower long-term production costs. It is crucial to recognize that not all suggested approaches can be applied simultaneously, as their relevance varies with different GFs and SPs. However, integrating of multiple strategies is anticipated to yield a cumulative effect, significantly reducing production costs. This collective effort is expected to substantially decrease the price of cultivated meat, contributing to the broader goal of developing sustainable and affordable meat.",

            "text": "Open infrastructures such as UNLOCK bioreactor platform 115 may offer promising avenues toward scale-up production of the NPs using CO 2 and optogenetic inducer. The flexible arrangement of different types of bioreactors of UNLOCK platform allows for high-throughput cultivation of mixed cultures in MSBC and further optimization of the upstream and downstream bioprocessing protocols. Notably, safely storing the multilayer metadata produced according to the FAIR guiding principles 108 is of particular relevance for simultaneously ingesting, exploring, and analyzing using DL approaches. \n\nBefore transitioning NP production technology to the commercial production level, an essential consideration is developing effective regulatory compliance, besides establishing the scale-up protocol. One of the highest commercial potentials is to focus on carbonnegative biomanufacturing strategies, as they may offer promising global warming solutions while concurrently providing further economic benefits from cheap C 1 feedstocks by producing high-value NPs 116 . Recent progresses, like establishing anaerobic biofoundries, leads to the fast growth of this path 117 . Nevertheless, analytic studies on the quality, stability, and safety of C 1 -derived NPs, and the potential effect of by-products on the efficiency of processing during fermentation 118 should be seriously considered. Furthermore, to develop cost-effective, large-scale biomanufacturing, deliberating on the process cost and technical and economic performances of the entire supply chain is necessary. For example, 30-50% of the manufacturing costs of supplies are typically allocated to downstream processing 118 . In addition, to successfully establish the discussed platform, communication issues between the disciplines must be addressed. Therefore, organizing annual interdisciplinary conferences focusing on sustainable NP production and workshops teaching various aspects of the involved disciplines are of critical importance. Providing more funding opportunities to support interdisciplinary projects can be an impetus for collaboration between different disciplines. For example, the willingness of biopharmaceutical companies to potentially commercialize C 1 -derived products opens new doors to defray some of the research costs to continue the investigation on improving the potential of the C 1 technology. As a breakthrough step toward facilitating the funding of interdisciplinary fields, 'Executive Order 14081' on advancing biotechnology and biomanufacturing was recently approved in the USA, which aims to encourage federal investment in biotechnology and biomanufacturing.",

To this end, we performed simulation-based techno-economic analysis to predict the final cost of AMPs when produced on a large-scale. For the analysis, we have used the previously published base case scenario 75 , including the cost and installation of equipment, working capital, and the start-up cost, except for the cost of electricity, steam water, and labor charges which were estimated as per the local standard value (Supplementary Table 3). The base case scenario assumes to produce 91 batches a year with each upstream processing batch yielding 9,520 kg N. benthamiana plant FW containing 9.52 kg AMP, assuming an expression level of 1 g AMP per kg plant FW. The upstream processing steps (37% of total cost, Supplementary Fig. 7) include growing the plants, large-scale preparation of agrobacteria, vacuum-based infiltration, and post-infiltration incubation. The downstream processing steps (67% of total cost, Supplementary Fig. 8) involve harvesting leaves, homogenizing whole tissues, and extraction, retrieval, and chromatography-based purification of bulk AMPs. The SuperPro Designer\u00ae 13.0 software computed the cost of goods sold (COGS) at $74/g for amidated AMP (Supplementary Table 5). The final cost encompasses all materials (both raw and consumables), as well as the production costs for the additional chromatography step and protease purification from the E. coli strain that can secrete the target enzyme in the base case scenario. Additionally, the cost of each reagent used has been added in Supplementary Table 4, and the general COGS using different host chassis (E. coli 18,76 , mammalian cells 77 ) is summarized in Supplementary Table 6.",

            "text": "Improving the productivity phenotype of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells is a major challenge in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Whilst significant advances in cell line development and bioprocess optimisation have catapulted product yields to above 5 g/L [1,2], these improvements are often restricted to a relatively narrow subset of recombinant molecules, particularly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Meanwhile, a large number of therapeutic proteins remain (very) difficult to produce, with product yields of about mg/L level [3][4][5]. Limited production yields affect the manufacturability of these biopharmaceuticals and restrict access to these life-changing medicines for patients. \n\nOver the past three decades, industrialists and academics have developed a vast repertoire of strategies (both at genetic and process levels) for increasing CHO cell productivities. One of the most successful approaches has been the control of cell proliferation, in which a decrease in cell proliferation (referred to as the cell-specific growth rate) can result in enhanced cellproductivities [6]. On a genetic level, the control of cell proliferation has been achieved by the overexpression of critical regulatory proteins of the cell cycle, a strategy that has been successful in enhancing CHO cell productivity phenotype [7][8][9]. However, the profound arrest of the cell cycle and cessation of cell proliferation resulted in restrictive conditions from an industrial manufacturing perspective, where cells need to achieve high cell densities in large-scale volumes. \n\nOn a process level, the modification of environmental parameters or media supplements has also led to increased cell-productivities by stopping cell growth at different degrees [10,11]. In this case, the change in culture conditions is usually performed in a biphasic operation, where initial cultivation under 'standard' physiological conditions is followed by a growthinhibited phase. Two of the most used process engineering approaches to enhance the CHO cell performance are a decrease in temperature (from 37\u02daC to 33-31\u02daC) and supplementation with sodium butyrate (NaBu, from 0.5 to 3 mM) [1,6,10].",

As such, mAb require to exhibit human\u2010like glycolization patterns. Therefore, recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the favored production organisms; many relevant biopharmaceuticals are already produced by this cell type. To optimize the mAb yield in CHO DG44 cells a corelation between stress\u2010induced cell size expansion and increased specific productivity was investigated. CO2 and macronutrient supply of the cells during a 12\u2010day fed\u2010batch cultivation process were tested as stress factors. Shake flasks (500 mL) and a small\u2010scale bioreactor system (15 mL) were used for the cultivation experiments and compared in terms of their effect on cell diameter, integral viable cell concentration (IVCC), and cell\u2010specific productivity. The achieved stress\u2010induced increase in cell\u2010specific productivity of up to 94.94.9%\u2013134.4% correlates to a cell diameter shift of up to 7.34 \u03bcm.

SymphonX\u2122 supports flow rates ranging from 0.1 to 12.3 L/min, potentially enabling a common ICB framework manufacturing facility to flexibly produce batches based on commercial demand. 15,16 This facility's mass output could be as low as 0.5 kg/batch or as high as 8 tonnes/year. 15,16 In this study, we conducted a 500 L manufacturing scale ICB, which produced 0.54 kg/ day of drug substance. The upstream process was operated between 22 and 40 days, the downstream process was operated for 12 days, consisting of 2 \u00c2 6 day lots of continuous processing from the bioreactor to CIEX pooling. The second lot was processed in a batch from CIEX pool to BDS. This demonstration aligns with an established industry framework for ICB 15,16 and identifies the critical measures to facilitate future commercial production and optimize mass production in a next-generation ICB enabled facility. Such a facility has the potential to accommodate a wide range of biopharmaceutical ICB and traditional batch bioprocesses. The exemplar manufacturing ICB documented in this study therefore represents a notable advancement toward the commercialization of ICB processes and the subsequent realization of substantial benefits stemming from this transition.",

The capability of IFSB-5 and its associated consumables in the production of the antibody-based biotherapeutic is assessed, providing key technical data for scaling up cell culture. Rather than opting for a direct scale-up from the 5-L scale to the 500-L scale, we chose a more conservative approach. This involved an intermediate step utilizing a 50-L bioreactor, followed by the eventual transition to the 500-L bioreactor. This stepwise approach serves to minimize the risk of failure by enabling early problem diagnosis on a smaller scale, allowing us to refine our strategy for the subsequent steps. Additionally, it helps to limit material and labor loss in case of any unforeseen challenges. All 5-L-500-L bioreactors were operated in fed-batch mode.",

            "text": "The downstream processing of recombinant proteins expressed in transgenic plants is disrupted by the presence of high levels of secondary metabolites such as alkaloids in phenolics, which are present in crude extracts of some plants such as tobacco [100]. However, some plants, such as lettuce, are known to produce very little of these secondary metabolites [16]. While a lot of attention has been placed on the upstream processing of recombinant proteins, such as employing specific vectors, promoters and expression cassettes, and other elements [101][102][103][104], more needs to be performed to address downstream processing, which relates to protein extraction and purification. \n\nMost of the plant-based recombinant protein expression systems are faced with challenges of downstream processing because they are based on the intracellular expression of proteins in whole plants, which requires the disruption of the plant tissue to extract the product [105]. Downstream processing is a costly exercise since plant extracts possess a large portion of proteins from the host cell, which has to be removed [92]. \n\nDownstream processing activities such as the aqueous two-phase system, centrifugation, filtration (to remove debris), and flocculation have been shown to improve recombinant protein recovery and purification. Even though protein tagging can also facilitate the downstream processing of recombinant proteins, it is difficult to apply at a commercial scale and this has led to the preference of large-scale applicable strategies such as heat/pH precipitation and membrane technologies for the separation of host and target proteins in the cell [106]. Currently, efforts are being made toward the development of plant cell suspension cultures because they would allow the secretion of recombinant products directly into the culture media. This will circumvent the need for plant tissue disruption that is necessary to extract recombinant proteins from the plant cell. It is very difficult to limit whole plant-based protein expression systems within a clean room environment, something that is incompatible with good manufacturing practice (GMP) [107]. However, the use of contained systems in plant culturing has alleviated regulatory and safety reservations regarding the open-field production systems.",

However, the use of high-titer-producing strains has highlighted limitations in chromatographic steps, including mass transfer limitations, low capacity, and scalability issues. These challenges, combined with the growing interest in fully continuous manufacturing processes, have led to a widespread interest in alternative to affinity chromatography systems. Polyethylene glycol precipitation has been demonstrated to be a powerful, flexible, easily scalable, and titer-independent methodology for purifying therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies, achieving yields and purities comparable to chromatography systems. Furthermore, it also holds great potential for simplifying the current purification processes of new modalities and overcome current bottlenecks in downstream processing.

            "text": "Furthermore, large-scale production is necessary for the industrial and clinical application of P-EVs and requires meeting several key considerations. First, since large quantities of P-EVs need to be separated, the process must be cost-efficient and capable of high-throughput. 49 As many studies have focused on small-scale isolation and purification at the laboratory level, there are limitations to applying existing methods to large-scale production. Therefore, investigating and optimizing separation methods suitable for large-scale production are necessary. Second, for clinical applications, it is crucial to comply with good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards during separation. The optimization of the separation process should focus on the regulation of both upstream and downstream processing stages. During upstream processing, smart farming can be used to harvest plants under uniform conditions, ensuring consistent plant production and P-EV quality. 50,51  hird, during downstream processing, standardizing purification steps is necessary to enhance the removal of protein contaminants while preserving EV identification components and maintaining bioactive functions. 3][54] Scalable methods, including TFF and anion-exchange chromatography (AEX), can be employed to effectively address these critical factors. 55,56  hese methods allow for large-scale EV production through automated industrial-scale devices under current GMP-compliant conditions. However, few studies have examined the large-scale production of P-EVs, the development of standardized protocols combining these techniques for their mass production is essential. \n\nRecent advancements in the separation of P-EVs have emphasized significant progress in scalability but highlighted challenges in achieving high purity and reproducibility. Current techniques such as UC, SEC, and PEG-based precipitation, while accessible, have limitations in terms of achieving high purity and scalability. Future research should focus on optimizing these methods to enable large-scale production without compromising quality. Additionally, developing standardized protocols and employing scalable techniques, such as TFF and AEX, can be essential for expanding P-EVs into industrial and clinical applications.",

The production's upstream process includes one perfusion bioreactor block which is half the size of the bioreactor used for the monoclonal antibody recombinant DNA vaccine production i.e. study Case A.1. Moreover, while one preculture step with one bioreactor is considered for IVT mRNA production, for monoclonal antibody recombinant DNA vaccine production two preculture steps are assumed to be operated by two bioreactors accordingly. Prokaryotic cultures do not require demanding preculture steps, as they offer  www.nature.com/scientificreports/ regarding the procurement of the costly linearization and clean cup enzymes. The minimal raw material costs in the upstream process are primarily due to the recycling of the broth inside the perfusion reactor chamber as well as the use of a less costly culture's carbon source. Dextran production's requirements for raw material are also restricted, as its production does not require expensive resources or high capacity. Figure 9a,b demonstrate the respective contribution of each stage to the overall capital investment and raw material consumption of the recombinant protein antigenic vaccine production i.e. study Case B.1. Results demonstrate that Stage 3 purification steps account for the majority of capital and raw material costs. \n\nThe discounted cash flow analysis pinpoints the estimation of the required MSPD of each production scenario, projecting meaningful insights regarding their investment value. The optimized discount rate for each production case is decided upon the weight of prioritization attributed to each conflicting objective (i) and (ii) (see Risk Analysis and MSPD section).

            "text": "Upstream processing is the first part of the biopharmaceutical production process involving the growth of the transgenic plant or plant cell cultures or plants transiently expressing a given biopharmaceutical and concerns the preparation of growth media, plant transformation protocols under controlled conditions to express and manufacture a specific biopharmaceutical product, and extraction of the raw material required for the production of the candidate product. Downstream processing refers to the purification, recovery, and concentration of a given biopharmaceutical from the complex bulk plant material. This may include formulation steps signifying the transformation from the drug molecule to the drug product. This could be performed at the scale of the laboratory, pilot, or bulk manufacturing, focusing on process optimization, manufacture scale-up, and troubleshooting. Furthermore, this may involve the management of the plant's resources and biohazards. Available systems for biopharmaceutical manufacturing vary based on the plant type and the site of localization of the protein product (chloroplast, apoplast, cytoplasm, or vacuole). Which option to choose depends on the essential characteristics necessary for the final product. For instance, mAbs are typically secreted into the apoplastic space via the endoplasmic reticulum/golgi secretory system and subsequently recovered from extracts of plant material through standard filtration as well as chromatographic approaches. In other instances, the product biopharmaceutical could be retained within the plant tissue, such as encapsulation in the chloroplasts with the requirement of minimal processing of the plant biomass yielding a feed additive to be formulated for oral delivery. Plant molecular pharming has provided a platform for the cost-effective and large-scale production of recombinant proteins in transgenic plants. However, for plant-based recombinant protein production systems to be fully utilized, the challenges encountered during downstream processing must be addressed. The downstream processing of recombinant proteins expressed in transgenic plants is disrupted by the presence of high levels of secondary metabolites such as alkaloids in phenolics, which are present in crude extracts of some plants such as tobacco [100].",

After primary recovery by centrifugation and/or microfiltration, the product is usually further purified in a series of chromatography steps interconnected with ultrafiltration/ diafiltration and other conditioning steps. In traditional processing, all of these steps are mostly performed in a batch-wise manner, most often in a fixed time mode, with little or no digitization or automation.. For licensed products using this production process, control is minimal and, in most cases, samples are taken at each step and analyzed offline [14]. Real-time in-process control is limited to checking pressure, flow rate, or buffer composition, but product quality or quantity/titer is not analyzed. Over the past decade, the regulatory framework has been very clear that process characterization is ultimately driven by the principle of \"Quality by Design\" (QbD). This requires improved process understanding, scale-down tools, Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tools, multivariate data analysis, machine learning algorithms and control strategies to enable a shift from fixed processes to adjustable processes within a design space based on desired product quality and performance [15][16][17][18][19]. \n\nThe current trend in the industry is to gradually move from batch processes (Fig. 1A) to integrated, continuous downstream processing strategies to minimize the risks of process failures (Fig. 1D). Thus, the next step for the bioindustry is to adopt straight-through or seamless downstream processing. In this mode of operation, the product from one unit can be processed directly by the following unit without the need for conditioning or intermediate storage. The process is simplified, but still occurs in batch (Fig. 1B).",

            "text": "In recent years, the demand for the production of biopharmaceuticals, such as therapeutic antibodies for cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, has rapidly expanded due to their high therapeutic efficacy [1]. More than 70% of therapeutic antibodies are currently produced in cell culture using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as host production cells [2]. CHO cells can produce bioactive, non-immunogenic recombinant antibodies with glycosylation patterns similar to those of human antibodies [3]. However, the slow growth of cells compared with that of microorganisms and the consumption of large amounts of medium lead to increased production costs [4]. To reduce manufacturing costs, cell line development [5], medium development [6], and culture environment and process optimization [7], among others, have been performed to improve production titers by increasing specific productivity or viable cell density. Several studies have achieved high-titer antibody production at concentrations on the order of grams per liter by improving culture processes such as high-cell-density fed-batch culture and continuous culture [8,9]. Cell line development, which is the most upstream process of antibody manufacturing, is very important because the cell line determines the performance of the entire manufacturing process. Improving the system for expressing the target gene is effective to further elevate the antibody production level. \n\nVarious studies have been conducted on the constituent elements of gene expression cassettes to achieve high expression of the target gene, including insulators that are less Cells 2023, 12, 2638 2 of 20 susceptible to gene silencing [10,11], improved transcription termination at gene insertion sites in the genome [12], stabilization of target transcripts [13], and codon optimization [14]. Because gene expression is triggered by transcription from promoters, the ability to induce strong gene expression has been developed from both natural and synthetic promoters [15]. The tetracycline-dependent transcription activation system is a synthetic promoter that works in animal cells [16].",

            "text": "In a time where the efficacy of conventional drugs is declining and population is aging, the biopharmaceuticals market is currently-one of the fastest growing segments of the pharmaceutical industry [1]. In recent decades, biopharmaceuticals have proven their high specificity, low risk and low adverse effects to the patients [2]. In this context, therapies based on polyclonal (pAbs) and monoclonal (mAbs) antibodies have emerged. Plasma-derived human IgGs are increasingly used for the treatment of genetic and acquired immunodeficiencies and for several inflammatory and autoimmune disorders [3,4]. Regarding mAbs, they present a high potential for different applications, such as immunotherapy and for the treatment of cancer, transplant rejection, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [5]. In order to be used in these applications, antibodies must meet standards of safety, efficacy, potency and purity [5]. \n\nSeveral advances were achieved in the past years regarding the upstream processing of antibodies increasing its productivity; however, improvements in the downstream processing have been ignored since the biopharmaceuticals industries are unwilling to replace wellestablished processes [6]. The downstream processing is now considered the bottleneck in antibodies production, accounting for up to 80 % of the total production costs [7]. The traditional downstream scheme used by the biopharmaceutical industry usually includes multiple steps for the recovery, isolation, purification and polishing, including several chromatographic operations for the selective capture and purification steps [8]. The affinity chromatography using protein A (proA) that is an affinity biological ligand, is the \"gold standard\" of the pharmaceutical industry for the capture and purification of antibodies, representing the largest fraction of the costs of the chromatographic steps.",

            "text": "Laboratory-scale experiments were performed using 3 L microcarrier bioreactors, small-scale clarification filters, and 20 mL GSH chromatography columns. To accommodate clinical manufacturing requirements, CVA21 purification was scaled-up and demonstrated at 100 L and 250 L process scales across seven batches (Table 2). Cell culture was performed in 50 L or 250 L single-use bioreactors (SUBs). Agitation scaling was performed to match power input per diameter of the impeller cubed, reflective of the shear sensitivity of microcarrier-bound cells and higher shear in the area immediately surrounding the impeller. To minimize the high-energy, high-shear regime, power was distributed through an upsized impeller diameter designed for larger working volumes. This reduced agitation and power input maintained compared to a standard size impeller. Air overlay gassing was constant and scaled to approach the gas volume per unit of working liquid volume per minute (VVM). The oxygen and carbon dioxide sparging strategy was controllerdriven and applied to both 50 and 250 L working volumes to maintain dissolved oxygen and pH setpoints. The temperature during infection was controlled at 37 \u00b0C for batches 1-3 and changed to 34 \u00b0C for batches 4-7. Clarification was performed using 0.5-1 m 2 scale depth filters to remove microcarriers and large host cell debris. Endonuclease treatment was performed to digest HC-DNA in batches 1-2 and was removed from the process in batches 3-7. The optimized GSH affinity chromatography process was scaled-up to 0.8-1.5 L single-use, prepacked OPUS columns controlled by using an AKTA ready single-use flow path system. Relative to the 20 mL scale, key variables including column path length, residence time, and step CVs were maintained using optimized buffer conditions including a 400 mM NaCl, pH 8 wash and a 1 mM GSH, 75 mM NaCl, pH 8 elution. To demonstrate scalability, the CBs from large-scale batches 6 and 7 were also run on 20 mL GSH columns, and similar column performance and consistent infectivity yield were achieved at both process scales (Supplementary Figures S8A-C).",

            "text": "Biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes can be divided into two main processing trains: upstream cell culture operations and downstream purification processes. Various bioreactor configurations are used to produce the cells that express the product of interest (mAbs, enzymes, Fc-fusion proteins, or hormones). Removing particulate matter such as cells and cell debris occurs at the interface between upstream and downstream unit operations. These bioreactor clarification operations are sometimes referred to as midstream processes [13,14]. \n\nFigure 1 is a typical 'platform' process for the downstream purification of monoclonal antibodies. The first unit operation is typically an affinity chromatography capture step using protein A (resin-based chromatography) [15]. Affinity interaction is a specific interaction based on both the topological fit and a combination of electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen-bonding interactions [16]. Antibody elution from the protein A column is performed at low pH, making it very convenient to include a low pH hold for virus inactivation. Frequently, two polishing steps are used to remove the remaining impurities and product variants/aggregates [17]. Resin-or membrane-based chromatography (ion exchange or hydrophobic interaction chromatography) is frequently used. The polishing steps remove impurities such as DNA, host cell proteins (HCP), and product aggregates [2]. Typically, all streams and buffers which enter the purification process are passed through sterilizing grade (0.22 \u00b5m pore size) filters to reduce bioburden. \n\nAs shown in Figure 1, the virus filtration step is typically located near the end of the purification train. The product is relatively concentrated and highly purified. High product concentrations can lead to compromised performance due to product aggregation and increased adsorption to the virus filter membrane. A final ultrafiltration/diafiltration step is used to concentrate the product and place it in the formulation buffer needed for stability during shipping/storage and delivery to the patient. The final 0.22 \u00b5m pore size filter is used to ensure sterility of the product and is often part of the final fill-finish operation.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies are being used widely to treat diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases etc. One such monoclonal antibody named Omalizumab was developed to treat Asthma, allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria which are almost invariably accompanied by elevated levels of IgE [1]. Omalizumab is an anti-IgE drug that binds with the IgE and thereby inhibits the binding of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) to its high affinity receptors present on the surface of the mast cells [2]. With rapid increase in the demand of the biologics and drugs has led to significant growth in the upstream processes for the production leading to increase the production of drugs from milligram per litre to grams per litre [3,4]. The substantial increase in the upstream productivity, creates pressure to deliver drug product, resulting in the improvement of the downstream processes to enhance the efficiency and the quality of the drug [5]. It was realised in 1970 that monoclonal antibodies have high therapeutic potential and can be used to treat diseases as unlike polyclonal antibodies they are homogeneous and mono-specific, due to which are they commonly used in the development of therapeutics and drugs [6]. In past decade, the need to produce purified monoclonal antibodies has advanced exponentially, to meet the need for the drugs and to meet the increased commercial demand the upstream processes are improved such that in large scale these upstream processes can yield up to multi-kilogram of monoclonal antibodies [3,4]. The challenge is therefore to develop the purification processes which efficiently purifies these monoclonal antibodies at low price [4]. There are many purification processes that separate protein of interest from the impurities. Some of the well-known downstream purifications techniques, ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), Ceramic hydroxyapatite chromatography (CHT), affinity chromatography, Size-exclusion chromatography, gel filtration, etc. that removes the impurities and reduces the turbidity during viral inactivation, to attain efficiency [7].",

Peak cell densities of up to 49 \u00d7 106 cells mL\u22121 and antibody titers of up to 5.2 g L\u22121 were achieved in 15- to 16-day fed-batch experiments. In 50-day perfusion cultivations, a viable cell volume of >100 mm3 mL\u22121 was maintained and more than 1 g L\u22121 d\u22121 of antibodies were harvested. The perfusion processes were automated with both cell bleed control and glucose concentration control. Cell retention was performed using Repligen\u2019s (Waltham, MA, USA) XCell\u00ae ATF perfusion systems and single-use devices. In summary, approaches for successfully scaling highly productive fed-batch and perfusion processes between geometrically dissimilar lab and pilot scale bioreactors were demonstrated. The advantages of perfusion in comparison to fed-batch processes were also observed.",

            "text": "The operation of a steady-state culture with constant cell density can sustain the process with high productivity over a period of several weeks to months and simultaneously ensure a consistent quality of the product. Development of high cell density process from knowledge of an established fed-batch process has shown a comparable glycoprotein quality profile between both operation modes (S\u00e4rnlund et al., 2021). \n\nThe standard method used for the initial capture of antibodies from harvest is Protein A chromatography, a highly selective and efficient technique (Gagnon, 2012), but with detrimental effects on certain antibodies through the low-pH elution step. At the typically used acidic elution pH of around 3.0-3.5, unwanted antibody aggregates can arise in the capture eluate, leading to compromised product yield and safety, with the required removal of these highmolecular-weight species further downstream in the manufacturing process (Liu et al., 2016;Paul et al., 2014;Shukla et al., 2007;V\u00e1zquez-Rey & Lang, 2011). This especially affects up-and-coming therapeutics like IgG2 and IgG4 antibodies, which have a higher aggregation propensity (Hari et al., 2010;Ito & Tsumoto, 2013;Liu et al., 2016). Bispecific antibodies are also highly affected by the low pH since they suffer from aggregation of both active and inactive variants and often require several purification steps to remove these unwanted impurities (H. Li et al., 2020). This major drawback of Protein A chromatography can, however, be prevented by the use of a novel engineered Protein A ligand, called Z Ca , which is dependent on calcium ions for its binding to antibodies (Kanje et al., 2018). \n\nDepletion of calcium with a sodium chloride-containing buffer results in the efficient release of the bound antibodies from the Protein A resin at close to neutral pH (6-7), differing slightly between the different subclasses of antibodies (Scheffel & Hober, 2021). These mild conditions prevented the formation of antibody aggregates during purification of an aggregation-prone antibody. Customary washing with sodium chloride is still fully feasible by including a low concentration of calcium in the buffer, and high antibody recovery is obtained.",

            "text": "Living cells have long been used as workhorse for conventional manufacturing of protein biopharmaceuticals in centralized, large-scale and single-product facilities [2,[46][47][48]. With the fast development in synthetic biology, new methods using rewired cells are emerging for portable and on-demand production of drugs for small patient populations or individuals. E. coli are commonly used microorganisms to produce heterologous proteins for therapeutic use, accounting for ~30% of biopharmaceuticals (particularly non-glycosylated proteins), due to their rapid growth, high yield of the product, cost effectiveness and simple scale-up process. The availability of various expression vectors and strains, relatively easy protein folding mechanisms and bioprocess technologies, make them very attractive for industrial applications. However, synthesis of recombinant proteins using bacterial hosts entails multiple steps including culturing, disruption of bacteria by physical or chemical means, and subsequent isolation and purification of the desired product. For industrial operations, these steps are usually carried out on a large scale; consequently, each step requires a sophisticated and delicate infrastructure to ensure efficiency and product quality. While critical for producing molecules in large amounts, this format is not flexible or economically suited for producing or characterizing diverse biologics when only a small amount is needed for each. In 2019, Dai et al. took advantage of recent developments in synthetic biology and stimulus-responsive biomaterials to integrate multiple steps of production, disruption and separation into a concise format to build a microbial swarmbot (MSB) platform (Fig. 3a) [49]. They first programmed the density-dependent autolysis of engineered bacteria by a genetic circuit, and encapsulated these bacteria into a micro-sized hydrogel capsules. When the local cell density inside the capsule was sufficiently high, autonomous partial lysis would occur and allow the cells to release their contents, including the protein product of interest. The bacterial growth changed the local environmental conditions (pH and ionic strength), driving the volume phase transition of the encapsulating material. Consequently, the released protein was transported from the interior to exterior with the shrinking of growth-sensitive capsules, while cells and large debris were trapped inside the capsules.",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent the largest class of biopharmaceuticals and are used for the treatment of a wide range of diseases including autoimmune and respiratory diseases, infections, and various types of cancer. 1,2 They have a number of advantages over small-molecule drugs, including their capacity to bind to their targets with high affinity and high specificity. 3 However, a major disadvantage of mAbs is that they require extensive bioprocessing. A typical bioprocess for the production of mAbs starts with mammalian cell culture, where the expressed mAbs are secreted into the growth medium containing various components, including cellular components, salts, nutrients, and host-cell proteins. At the harvest step, the cell culture supernatant is separated from waste material and purified through several unit operations, termed the downstream process. Generally, this includes affinity chromatography, i.e., Protein A chromatography, followed by polishing steps such as cation and/or anion exchange chromatography. Lastly, the mAb is formulated through ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) and bulk frozen before fill and finish. 4,5 hroughout the bioprocess, mAbs are exposed to a range of different conditions, which may pose challenges to their physical and chemical stability. For example, changes in the pH and salt concentration during the chromatography, viral inactivation, and buffer exchange steps may destabilize the protein structure and/or cause chemical modifications to the protein. 6,7 Furthermore, interactions with a range of matrices and surfaces, such as filters, columns, and membranes, as well as physical stress and shear forces caused by sparging, pumping, mixing, and shaking, may lead to loss of the native protein structure and potentially protein function. 7,8 During bioprocessing, aggregate levels may reach up to 30% at the cell culture stage and may be as high as 25% when eluting from the Protein A column due to the low pH conditions. 9 \u221213 The stress conditions described above may lead to partial protein unfolding and mAb aggregation. Depending on the stress conditions to which the mAb is exposed, the extent of aggregation and the type of aggregates formed may differ considerably.",

Use of the autotransporter platform could reduce the number of downstream processing operations required, thus accelerating the development time and reducing costs for recombinant protein production. ABSTRACT The autotransporter protein secretion system has been used previously to target the secretion of heterologous proteins to the bacterial cell surface and the extracellular milieu at the laboratory scale. The platform is of particular interest for the production of \u201cdifficult\u201d recombinant proteins that might cause toxic effects when produced intracellularly. One such protein is IrmA. IrmA is a vaccine candidate that is produced in inclusion bodies requiring refolding. Here, we describe the use and scale-up of the autotransporter system for the secretion of an industrially relevant protein (IrmA). A plasmid expressing IrmA was constructed such that the autotransporter platform could secrete IrmA into the culture supernatant fraction. The autotransporter platform was suitable for the production and purification of IrmA with comparable physical properties to the protein produced in the cytoplasm. The production of IrmA was translated to scale-up protein production conditions resulting in a yield of 29.3\u2009mg/L of IrmA from the culture supernatant, which is consistent with yields of current industrial processes. IMPORTANCE Recombinant protein production is an essential component of the biotechnology sector. Here, we show that the autotransporter platform is a viable method for the recombinant production, secretion, and purification of a \u201cdifficult\u201d to produce protein on an industrially relevant scale.

            "text": "Adeno-associated viruses have gained attention as a gene delivery vector thanks to their safety profile, long term expression, ability to transduce differentiated cells, and the vast repertoire of available serotypes [1,2]. Depending on the medical condition being treated, vector requirements for therapies under a clinical development scenario can reach 10 \n\n14 VG/kg [3], requiring substantial manufacturing operation improvements for the successful development of these therapies. Downstream purification of viral vectors, in particular recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV), has been extensively discussed in the literature [4][5][6]. Density gradient ultracentrifugation with cesium chloride (CsCl) or iodixanol is one of the most recurrent methods for laboratorial AAV purification. However, as the product moves through the different clinical stages the need for scalable purification technologies compatible with good manufacturing practices (GMP) increases. Chromatography-based purification can be easily adapted for large-scale production. The use of different chromatography modes for AAV purification using different strategies, is well described in the literature [7][8][9], including such methods as size-exclusion, ion exchange, and affinity chromatography (AC). More recently, the development of AC media with ligands against several AAV serotypes has paved the way for more efficient purification strategies. This follows mAb purification practices, where the early use of Protein A chromatography in the manufacturing process was able to reduces the overall number of purification steps, thus leading to increased downstream processing production rates. \n\nOver the last two decades, several research groups have reported on improvements to the chromatographic process realized by replacing batch operation with continuous processing alternatives. This has been demonstrated for the purification of recombinant proteins [10,11], mAbs [12,13], mAb fragments [14], viruses [15][16][17][18][19], and exosomes [20], for which different multi-column chromatography processes have been utilized.",

As the industry matures, there is a strong prospect of expanding into other matrices and ingredients for those large bio-therapeutic particles. Simultaneously, the diversity and scope of single-use alternative implementation is becoming obvious and prevalent. Because the requirement to clean, sterilize, and validate the equipment/materials is reduced, the usage of such compounds in all production and purification procedures is gaining support [61]. \n\nScientists argue that the extremely concentrated state of global vaccine manufacturing capacity limits large-scale vaccine production.

Cell culture upstream process development includes two different stages: 1) the early-stage process development for investigational new drug (IND) application to the start of first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1 clinical trials, and 2) the late-stage development toward BLA submission for commercial use. \n\nEarly-stage process development consists of cell-line generation, lead clone selection, initial cell culture process development with the lead clone research cell bank (RCB), master cell bank (MCB) creation from the lead clone RCB and MCB release, and the early-stage process definition or lock for the good manufacturing practice (GMP) FIH campaign. 9][20] To address COVID-19 pandemic needs, multiple reports have demonstrated that the early-stage process development can be shortened further from 12-16 to approximately 4-6 months for the development of neutralizing mAbs. 15,21,22 ate-stage upstream process development consists of commercial process development, process characterization (PC), and in-process control strategy development. In comparison to the early-stage upstream process, the major goals of commercial process development, usually using MCB, working cell bank (WCB), or their cell age equivalent development cell banks (DCBs), are to improve upstream titer for cost reduction, process robustness, and scale-up manufacturing for a much larger quantity of commercial drug substance generation, while maintaining comparable product quality profile. 23,24 Then, the commercial process is locked for pivotal GMP campaign to generate drug substance for Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, long-term stability study (LTSS), PC, and defining an in-process control strategy (IPC) for process performance qualification (PPQ), which are regulatory requirements for BLA submission. 24 Quality by design (QbD) principles have been used throughout all stages of process development in the industry. ][27][28] Late-stage process development is usually not on the critical path for standard mAb product development, since late-stage clinical trials take much more time than process development.",

            "text": "Despite much interest from the biopharmaceutical industry in continuous upstream manufacturing processes, fed-batch processes remain the standard mode of production for stable proteins such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). A conventional fed-batch process is usually inoculated with an initial viable cell density (VCD) of <1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL. The volumetric productivity and manufacturing throughput of a fed-batch process can be improved by inoculating the production bioreactor at a higher initial VCD (e.g., 2-8 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL), thus shortening the initial growth phase and total culture duration [1][2][3][4]. Furthermore, an even higher initial VCD (e.g., 10-20 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL) can double fed-batch cell culture titers [5,6], which are comparable to the high end of the best titers reported in the current literature [7]. \n\nInoculation of the production bioreactor at a higher initial VCD requires the N-1 to achieve a higher final VCD (e.g., 14-30 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL), which can be achieved through intensification of the N-1 with non-perfusion [8] or perfusion strategies [1,2]. However, only perfusion N-1 has demonstrated the feasibility of achieving final VCDs of greater than 60 to 100 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL [9], enabling inoculation VCDs in the production bioreactor of greater than 10 \u00d7 10 6 viable cells/mL [5,6]. Because the fed-batch process intensification can achieve a great titer improvement or shortened culture duration by N-1 perfusion while remaining cost effective compared to traditional fed batch (overall media USD/g mAb) [10], the N-1 perfusion strategy has been widely used for mAb production in the cell culture industry [11,12]. \n\nOne common method of controlling perfusion rate is to perfuse a fixed volume that changes at a pre-defined rate with time, typically normalized to the working volume of the bioreactor and reported in vessel volumes per day (VVD).",

            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies are the workhorse of the pharmaceutical industry due to their potential to treat a variety of different diseases while providing high specificity and efficiency. As a consequence, a variety of production processes have been established within the biomanufacturing industry. However, the rapidly increasing demand for therapeutic molecules amid the recent COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that there still is a clear need to establish novel, highly productive, and flexible production processes. Within this work, we designed a novel discontinuous process by combining two intensification strategies, thus increasing inoculation density and media exchange via a fluidized bed centrifuge, to fulfill the need for a flexible and highly productive production process for therapeutic molecules. To establish this new process, firstly, a small-scale experiment was conducted to verify synergies between both intensification strategies, followed by a process transfer towards the proof-of-concept scale. The combination of these two-process intensification measures revealed overall synergies resulting in decreased process duration (\u221237%) and strongly enhanced product formation (+116%) in comparison to the not-intensified standard operation. This led to an impressive threefold increase in space-time yield, while only negligible differences in product quality could be observed. Overall, this novel process not only increases the ways to react to emergency situations thanks to its flexibility and possible short development times, but also represents a possible alternative to the current established processes due to high increases in productivity, in comparison to standard fed-batch operations.",

            "text": "The development of engineered microbial species for pharmaceutical applications faces substantial regulatory challenges (Table 3). Regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have issued guidance documents addressing live biotherapeutic products [147,148]. However, the rapid evolution of synthetic biology and microbial engineering has outpaced many traditional regulatory frameworks. Engineered microbes-designed to deliver drugs, modulate metabolic pathways, or even sense and respond to disease signals-do not fit neatly into the existing categories established for small-molecule drugs or conventional biologics [149,150]. Microbial contamination is one of the most persistent challenges in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Even under strictly controlled aseptic conditions and rigorous adherence to good manufacturing practices (GMPs), the introduction of adventitious agents-bacteria, fungi, or viruses-can occur through raw materials, process water, or human contact [146]. In large-scale fermentations, nutrient-rich environments can facilitate the rapid growth of contaminants, leading not only to product loss but also to safety risks if these contaminants survive downstream purification processes. The high cost and complexity of implementing comprehensive environmental monitoring systems further exacerbate these risks, especially for smaller enterprises or academic laboratories. \n\nTo counteract these challenges, advanced analytical methods have been developed to detect contamination early in the production process. Techniques such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and mass spectrometry are increasingly integrated into manufacturing workflows, allowing for real-time monitoring and rapid intervention when contamination is detected [135]. Despite these advances, the need for such sophisticated systems increases both the capital and operational costs associated with manufacturing engineered microbial therapeutics.",

Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) are particularly suitable because they are easy to genetically manipulate, can grow in suspension cultures and can reach high cell densities [13]. In addition, these 293F suspension cells are already established for the production of many virus-based products such as viral vaccines and most viral vectors in the industry [14][15][16][17]. Furthermore, 293 cells are rapidly being accepted in the industry because they have been approved by the FDA and EMA for the production of the first adenovirusbased gene therapy product (Gendicine \u00ae ) in China and a therapeutic recombinant protein (Xigris \u00ae ) [13]. \n\nDespite the many advantages of mammalian cells as an expression system for HIVderived VLPs, few production methods have been described in the literature [2,18], especially for suspension cultures [13]. \n\nAs enveloped nanoparticles, HIV-based VLPs require special requirements for the downstream process conditions due to their sensibility regarding shear stress, pH and osmotic pressure when compared to nonenveloped nanoparticles [5]. Harvest at lab-scale is usually performed by low-speed centrifugation, which comes with the risk of product loss [19]. As an alternative, depth filtration has often been applied, as it offers the advantage of established scale-up methodologies and poses low risk to product retention if cut-offs are chosen appropriately [20]. \n\nIsolation and first purification during early cell line optimization at lab-scale is often achieved by ultracentrifugation. This difficult-to-scale-up technique often requires several up to dozens of hours of process time, and product sampling is challenging if yield loss is to be avoided.",

            "title": "Cancer Gene Therapy Goes Viral: Viral Vector Platforms Come of Age",
            "text": "Reliable production platforms are key to successful translation of viral vector therapies into clinics. Indeed, the development of robust manufacturing capabilities enabled the widespread adoption of recombinant biotherapeutics like monoclonal antibodies. Compared to proteins, viral vectors are orders of magnitude more complex, where minute changes between serotypes can affect production and purification strategies. What is more, conventional protein purification methods are often not appropriate for shear-sensitive viral particle isolation. Enveloped vectors are easily ruptured during the purification process, which decreases the ratio of functional infectious particles in the final product. Consequently, it is no surprise that viral vector production platforms are continuously being optimized and are yet to reach their full potential on the industrial scale. 6,97 Moreover, viral vectors for gene delivery and oncolysis span several viral families and are further genetically engineered to ensure safety and anti-tumoral potencies, adding to the diversity. This offers exciting opportunities for tailored therapies, but also raises challenges in manufacturing and regulation. Thus, paths to viral vector platform success and adoption are specific for each therapeutic. \n\nIn order to support consistent production and reliable scale-up to clinical-grade drug manufacture, an extra care has to be taken in initial selection of viral vector production platforms. Established mammalian cell cultures are most widely used for vector propagation. This makes sense since therapeutic viral vectors originate from natural viruses that co-evolved with vertebrate hosts. The producer cell lines include African green monkey Vero cells, human HEK 293 and HeLa cells and baby hamster kidney (BHK) line. 98 They are handled under BSL-2 regulations to limit vector dissemination and contamination with adventitious agents. 99 Mammalian cell lines are primarily adherent -growing attached to a solid support. For production, adherent cells are grown on microcarriers in bioreactors, on multilayer tissue plates and roller bottles. However, suspension cell cultures are preferred for easier scale-up. Luckily, many adherent cell lines were successfully adapted for suspension growth in stirred-tank and rocking Wave bioreactors. 97,98,100 For example, the adenovirustransformed HEK 293 cells are easily adapted for suspension culture and are the most widely used cell line for adenoviral and AAV vector production.",

            "text": "In this work, we proved the feasibility of precipitation for the continuous capture of monoclonal antibodies. The integration of upstream and downstream in a pool-less fashion reduces plant footprint and capital investments, while narrowing the RTD of the entire process train. Process robustness was confirmed by comparison of the downstream process performance as a stand-alone device and integrated with a perfusion process. The scale-up is simplified, as the whole downstream train is completely membrane-based. centrifugation [13,15]. TFF is implemented in continuous either in single-pass or feed-and-bleed configuration. For the latter, part of the retentate is drawn off (also called \"bleed\") to the next stage and the remaining part is recirculated. In this way, higher conversions and higher shear rates (s \u22121 ) are obtained across the module, with enhanced impurities removal and lower and slower membrane fouling [18]. \n\nCompared to continuous chromatography, continuous precipitation coupled with continuous TFF has the advantage that the mass flow of product is never interrupted and remains fully continuous. Moreover, the absence of bind-and-elute steps facilitates the direct integration of unit operations in a pool-less fashion. The removal of surge tanks reduces plant footprint and capital investments while narrowing the RTD. A narrow RTD enables process fast start-up and shut-down, partly simplifying the dilemma of batch definition in continuous manufacturing. \n\nIn this work, we developed continuous precipitation utilizing combined precipitation methods, CaCl 2 for the precipitation of hcDNA (and partly HCPs) and PEG 6000 for the capture of the recombinant antibody. We screened depth filters for the removal of the precipitated hcDNA after the first precipitation stage and evaluated the critical flux for different hollow fiber (HF) modules geometries, to select the best for our purpose. We ultimately connected all unit operations in a pool-less fashion. The flow at the outlet of one unit was directly fed at the inlet of the following one with no surge tanks. Furthermore, we explored the use of membrane adsorbers for the first polishing step. Finally, we determined the RTD of our capture skid as suggested from the FDA and EMA guidelines for continuous manufacturing [29].",

            "text": "The market demand of biopharmaceutical products is constantly increasing every year and there is an increasing pressure on price reduction for global access to biological drugs. In order to meet the market demand, significant improvement has been carried out in upstream processes, however the productivity in downstream has not increased accordingly (\u00d6tes et al., 2017). The most challenging phase of therapeutic protein production in industries is the downstream processing (DSP) and DSP is accounting for a large portion of the total production costs. The growing demand and developments in upstream processing of therapeutics have burdened the downstream purification processes, due to high cost and insufficient processing capacity (Li et al., 2019). DSP of recombinant therapeutic proteins involves a series of operation such as filtration, followed by capture, purification, and polishing steps mainly done by chromatography (Gaughan, 2016). Chromatography is considered as the workhorse of DSP because it can selectively enrich the target proteins while eliminating impurities and this is achieved by exploiting differences in molecular properties, such as size, charge and hydrophobicity (Bernau et al., 2022). The development of product specific chromatography-based purification techniques is time consuming and expensive because target proteins make up a small portion of the total protein in the initial plant extract. To address this issue, Buyel and Fischer (2014) created a general downstream procedure for the purification of recombinant proteins produced in plants with diverse features. This was done by concentrating on the resin's ability to bind tobacco host cell proteins (HCPs) under various conditions such as pH and conductivity. Recent developments in ML and DL based programs can be utilized to overcome the challenges in downstream processing (Bernau et al., 2022). ML has been applied to chromatography system to monitor real time processing, process optimization, retention time prediction and peak monitoring.",

To express the recombinant E Protein at a large scale, the recombinant strain pET28a + E-ZIKVre was inoculated into E. coli SHuffle cells grown in a 2 L bioreactor (New Brunswick, St Albans, UK). Biomass growth was induced at an OD 600nm of 0.8 with 1 mM IPTG at 37 \u2022 C for 4 h. Cell culture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min and the pellet resuspended in wash buffer I [20 mM Tris-HCl + 1 mM EDTA + 0.5% triton x-100 + 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), pH 8.0] in the proportion of 10 mL for each 1 g of pellet. The cell suspension was sonicated for two cycles for 15 s with an interval of 30 s on ice and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in washing buffer II (20 mM Tris-HCl + 1 mM EDTA + 0.5% triton x-100 + 1 M Urea + 1 mM PMSF, pH 8.0) and the processes of sonication and centrifugation were repeated. At the end, the soluble fraction was filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter and the recombinant protein was purified by IMAC, using the Ni 2+ loaded affinity columns of the His Trap HP model (GE Healthcare) in the AKTA P\u00fcre equipment (GE Healthcare). Purification took place in steps of increasing imidazole concentration. The purification fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel and those with the highest concentration were pooled and dialyzed in a step of desalination and refolding of the recombinant protein. The concentration of E-ZIKVre protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method, using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific).",

            "text": "Currently approved vaccines include inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), and recombinant vaccines (RV), the latter being composed of either subunits or VLPs [13]. IIVs correspond to almost 90% of influenza vaccines produced, and their production relies on an egg-based process developed in the 1940s [14]. Though well-established and cost-effective, egg-based vaccine production is a long process and responsiveness to a potential pandemic scenario heavily relies on egg supply that might be limited. Additionally, some influenza strains such as the H5Nx have shown lower yields when produced in eggs [15][16][17]. The development of cell culture processes for the production of IIVs has gained ground in the last decades, mainly driven by advances in large-scale cell culture techniques. Cell culture-based processes correspond to 20% of the worldwide capacity for pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturing [18]. In short, cells are grown adherent to substrates or in suspension and infected with the desired virus strain, followed by virus harvest, purification, and inactivation. Advantages of this type of process over traditional egg-based production include shorter production cycles, the higher similarity between the vaccine produced and the original strain, and a faster response in the case of a pandemic [15]. Importantly, cell culture-produced influenza vaccines have demonstrated higher efficacy due to better control of the production timelines, hence limiting mismatches in the yearly dominant strain selected [19]. Significant contributions to the acceleration and intensification of the upstream processing of cell-derived influenza candidate vaccines have been completed, however, comparatively limited work has been dedicated to the downstream processing aspects [20][21][22]. \n\nIn addition to a rapid and robust upstream processing, a rapid and robust purification that can be adapted to the emergence of new strains is particularly important. In recent years, new purification methods based on membrane-based technologies have gained interest in the virus manufacturing industry. Downstream processing starts with the clarification of the harvested material. This step is typically performed by centrifugation at a small scale. However, centrifugation at large-scale often implies a high investment and scale-up limitations, and alternative methods such as filtration are preferred [23].",

            "text": "This points out the need of meeting the demand for large-scale good manufacturing practise (GMP)-practises that can facilitate the production and purification of a wide range of AAV serotypes that are growing in number and complexity in terms of capsid variants. \n\nHowever, many of the approved commercial AAV products are tied to outdated manufacturing processes which results in substantial manufacturing costs that contributes to the high drug prices with, for example, Hemgenix ($3.5M/dose) or Upstaza ($3.7M/dose) (Choudhury et al. 2016;Grimm, Lee et al. 2008;Lyle et al. 2024;Naddaf 2022;Nass et al. 2018;D. Wang, Tai, and Gao 2019). The manufacturing costs are mainly elevated because of low product yield and high required doses (Robert et al. 2017). Typical doses for systematically delivered AAV therapies range from 1e14 to 1e16 vg/patient and productivities reported in upstream are approx. 1e14 vg/L (Au, Isalan, and Mielcarek 2022;Cl\u00e9ment 2019;Grieger, Soltys, and Samulski 2016;Gu et al. 2018). Hence, with a 200-L pilot-scale batch, two patients could be supplied whereas manufacturing scales of 2000-5000 L could support 20-50 patients (Q. Fu, Polanco, et al. 2023). Therefore, the increasing demands for high doses and the limited manufacturing capacity are core challenges which demands for the development of efficient, scalable, and serotype-independent manufacturing processes to accommodate larger trials, accelerate drug development, and eventually drive down the cost per dose of the commercial drug (Cl\u00e9ment 2019;Ladd et al. 2022). And since upstream efforts are expected to increase productivities, the downstream process (DSP) needs to adapt with scalable and efficient technologies (Cameau et al. 2023). Therefore, this review deals with the purification of rAAVs, focusing on both traditional and innovative technologies within the context of the industry's transition towards continuous biomanufacturing.",

Usually, a higher transgene copy number results in a higher final protein titer, but it can also lead to genomic instability. After a selection period, individual colonies are picked and characterized by their protein production, stability, and growth properties. The secretion of recombinant protein into the culture medium during industrial-scale protein expression has many advantages for downstream processing.

The team believes that this manufacturing method can also be applied to exosomes from other cell sources (e.g., MSC, muscle cells, fibroblasts, nervous system cells, dendritic cells, etc.) for different clinical applications [115]. \n\nAnother study reported a clinical trial of large-scale production of GMP-grade engineered exosomes (iExosomes) from BMSC for pancreatic cancer patients. The authors developed a bioreactor-based system for large-scale production of MSC-EXO as well as a procedure to electroporate siRNA into exosomes using clinical-grade diluents to target genes of interest. In addition, they further tested the stability of iExosomes and found negligible loss of antitumor efficacy when stored at -80 o C for up to 5 months. Notably, the exosome production used in the study was based on ultracentrifugation, which may include non-exosomal contaminants, but the results showed that their iExosomes did not produce any measurable side effects and showed consistent in vitro and in vivo efficacy [116].",

            "text": "While vast quantities of therapeutic cells will need to be produced for allogeneic applications, the proprietary, original donor cells are usually limited in supply and frozen in vials for storage. A reliable seed train process to generate high-quality seed cells from finite donor cells is an important first step for scalable manufacturing in bioreactors. \n\nTypically, 2D planar vessels such as multi-well plates or T-flasks are used to expand cells from a working cell bank (WCB) vial of donor cells. The cell expansion process may scale up and continue in a larger planar vessel such as a T-flask, roller bottles, or a multilayer plate, e.g., Cell Factory \u00ae (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) or CellSTACK \u00ae (Corning, Corning, NY, USA), before cells enter a terminal bioreactor (at the production stage). However, the limited scalability of 2D platforms restricts manufacturing to a scaleout approach (as opposed to scale-up) to generate enough cells to inoculate larger volume bioreactors. The limitations of 2D platforms for generating a large number of cells, based on various aspects such as labor and material costs as well as difficulties with operational efficiency, have been well-documented [8]. Specifically, unit operations involving numerous 2D planar vessels require prolonged handling and processing times with many operators, which can negatively impact cell quality, process reliability, and cost-effectiveness. \n\nA cell culture procedure that works at a small scale often requires engineering-based development work for successful scale-up to larger volumes. The scale-up development process can be greatly facilitated through the use of the same or similar manufacturing platforms instead of having to create different procedures due to different mixing technolo-gies at different scales (e.g., 2D wells at small scale and 3D bioreactors at large scale, or wave-motion bioreactors at small scale and stirred-impeller mixing at large scale). \n\nIdeally, a single type of scalable manufacturing platform such as a suspension bioreactor could be used for the entire manufacturing process, starting even from a WCB vial.",

            "text": "There have been considerable efforts on improving the lentiviral vector (LV) system and their production. However, there remains the persisting challenge of producing a sufficient quantity of LVs at manufacturing scale to support treatments beyond early clinical trials. Furthermore, their innately labile nature poses an equally important obstacle in LV production. As LVs lose function over time and they are sensitive to environmental factors in each unit operation in the bioprocess workflow, integrated continuous manufacturing is an attractive strategy for process intensification. This manuscript describes the implementation of nuclease treatment, clarification, and capture step in a semi-continuous mode. Combining the clarification and loading of the capture step as well as operating those steps in parallel to the purification of the capture step expedite the processing time, reducing it by 4-fold as compared to processing the same volume in batch mode using the same membrane size. This semi-continuous operation also improves the recoveries of functional vector particles and total vector particles by 26% and 18%, respectively, showing an added benefit in loading the capture membranes in series in continuous flow chromatography. Building on previously published upstream work using a scalable cell retention device in perfusion mode, this manuscript demonstrates the integration of upstream and downstream in a semi-continuous manner, reducing processing and hold times as well as showing improvements in LV product quality and recovery.",

            "text": "serum factors (Whitford and Guterstam 2019). Integra CELLine systems are new flask 'bioreactors' that are able to concentrate exosomes within a membrane compartment and allow transfer of culture medium for a long period of time (Whitford et al. 2015). Increasing the concentration of exosomes effectively reduces the downstream processing steps, and thus the resulting costs (Whitford et al. 2015).\n\nAnother limiting issue associated with the production of exosomes in a large-scale cell cultivation system is the dependence of optimal cell growth on animal serum (Whitford and Guterstam 2019). This is problematic in two ways. The first issue has to do with the increased risk of viral contamination while the second deals with the high presence of large numbers of exosomes in animal serums that if not removed before cell culture may enter the final product and render it unacceptable before being injected. An alternative suggestion is serum-free and xeno-free culture media components but provided that it maintains comparable therapeutics properties of the exosomes product (Phelps et al. 2018).\n\nA significant advantage of exosomes compared to adherent producer cells such as stem cells is their simple isolation from the conditioned medium (Colao et al. 2018). However, adherent cell products are enzymatically detached, which increases downstream processing operations costs and purification times while reducing efficiency that results in loss of product (Whitford et al. 2015).\n\nIn downstream processing, four separation methods are generally used to purify exosomes, including sedimentation force, affinity isolation, filtration, and polymeric precipitation (Gardiner et al. 2016). Each of these methods for different reasons may not be appropriate for larger-scale production of exosomes.\n\nFor example, the limitations of ultracentrifugation such as the lengthy process, repeated steps, and disruption of exosomes during separation are inconsiderable. However, as for nanospecific precipitation, it not only requires downstream processing to remove PEG from the final product, but also reduces the purity of the final product due to the co-isolation of various types of EVs and proteins .\n\nAffinity purification through antibodies against exosomes surface markers could be the best method for exosomes purification that leads to a purer and more homogeneous product",

For the proposed generic 6month accelerated DNA-to-IND timeline, transient expression can be performed at different production scales based on estimated material need and production yield. Materials generated from transient production are intended to be used for (1) platform formulation evaluation, (2) formulation development and (3) assay development. It should be noted that a liquid or frozen liquid formulation, but not lyophilized product, is assumed. In parallel with transient production, accelerated cell line development with a timeline of 2.5 months from DNA to final clone identification is initiated. A detailed description of the accelerated cell line development can be found in our previous publications [7,8]. \n\nInitial cell culture (upstream) process development overlaps cell line development, for example, by applying highthroughput Ambr \u00ae 250 bioreactor system for top clone screening and selection [7,8]. After the final clonal candidate has been selected, MCB creation can be initiated. Of note, the use of NGS-based adventitious viral testing renders the MCB release off the critical path to allows the accelerated GMP drug substance (DS) manufacturing using MCB (Fig. 2). One further round of intensive and accelerated upstream development and optimization can be performed for the final clonal cell line, typically using 3-L bioreactors. For the purification process, a platform process evaluation is firstly performed, which is followed by one round of intensive and accelerated process development, typically assuming one clarification step, an intermediatedepth filtration step, up to three column steps, a virus inactivation step, a viral filtration step and a final ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) step. Again, accumulated process knowledge with a variety of molecules is key to the success of process development acceleration, especially for complex recombinant proteins. Finally, a process confirmation run is performed using the RCB of the final clonal cell line with the purpose of verifying the upstream, downstream and formulation processes, as well as providing material for assay qualification.",

Consequently, pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms are heavily investing in antibody research and development.\n\nNonetheless, this field faces challenges regarding manufacturing, purification, formulation, delivery, and storage of mAbs.The purification process, in particular, is a major bottleneck in mAb production, constituting up to 80% of the manufacturing costs. 22,23rystallization is a potential solution to reduce these costs.Although successfully applied to small-molecule drugs and peptides, crystallization processes applied to larger proteins like mAbs have primarily focused on structural determination through X-ray crys-tallography, with limited consideration for large-scale manufacturing and downstream processing.\n\nAt present, mAb preparations have a limited shelf life and require refrigerated storage conditions.They are stored as drug substances in large, impractical bags until formulation into small dosage forms which also necessitate refrigerated storage.The development of high-concentrated, non-viscous mAb formulations that are stable at room temperature would be highly beneficial.Such innovation would allow these biologics to be transported in smaller containers to production sites globally, thereby addressing the existing storage and transport challenges in many parts of the developing world.",

            "text": "Well-characterized and scalable downstream processes for the purification of biologics are extremely demanding for delivering quality therapeutics to patients at a reasonable price. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a blockbuster biologic with diverse clinical applications, but its application is limited to financially well-off societies due to its high price. The high price of EPO is associated with the technical difficulties related to the purification challenge to obtain qualified products with a cost-effective defined process. Though there are reports for the purification of EPO there is no report of a well-characterized downstream process with critical process parameters (CPPs) that can deliver EPO consistently satisfying the quality target product profile (QTPP), which is a critical regulatory requirement. To advance the field, we applied the quality by design (QbD) principle and design of experiment (DoE) protocol to establish an effective process, which is scalable up to 100\u00d7 batch size satisfying QTPP. We have successfully transformed the process from static mode to dynamic mode and validated it. Insignificant variation (p > 0.05) within and between 1\u00d7, 10\u00d7, and 100\u00d7 batches showed that the process is reproducible and seamlessly scalable. The biochemical analysis along with the biofunctionality data ensures that the products from different scale batches were indifferent and comparable to a reference product. Our study thereby established a robust and scalable downstream process of EPO biosimilar satisfying QTPP. The technological scheme presented here can speed up the production of not only EPO but also many other life-saving biologics and make them available to the mass population at a reduced cost.",

            "text": "The schematic diagram of the downstream process is shown in Figure 7. Three main steps are considered in the scheme: capture, virus inactivation, and polish. It is worth mentioning that the ultrafiltration preparing the final product is not considered in this work, and hence is not included in the diagram. The capture step serves as the main component in the downstream and the majority of mAb is recovered in this step. Protein A chromatography columns are usually utilized to achieve this goal. The purpose of VI is to disable the virus and prevent further mAb degradation. At last, the polish step further removes the undesired components caused by VI and cation-exchange chromatography (CEX) and anion-exchange chromatography (AEX) are generally used. In order to obtain a continuous manufacturing process, the perfusion cell culture, a continuous mAb culturing process is used in the upstream, however, the nature of chromatography is discontinuous. Therefore, a twin-column configuration is implemented in the capture step. According to the diagram, column A is connected to the stream from the upstream and loaded with the solutions. Simultaneously, column B is connected to the remaining components of the downstream and conducts further mAb purification. \n\nAccording to Gomis-Fons, et al. [57], the time needed for loading is designed as the same as the time required for the remaining purification steps. Hence, when column A is fully loaded, column B is empty and the resin inside is regenerated. Then, the roles of these two columns will be switched in the new configuration, meaning column B will be connected to the upstream and column A will be connected to the remaining components in downstream. In conclusion, a continuous scheme of downstream is achieved by implementing the twin-column configuration in the capture step. Papathanasiou and coworkers described a simplified metabolic network of GN-NS0 cells using a Monod kinetic model [58]. In the study by Villiger et al. [59], while the specific productivity of mAb was observed to be constant with respect to viable cell density, it varied with respect to the extracellular pH. By considering these two models, we proposed one simplified model to describe the continuous upstream process.",

Monoclonal antibodies, Fc-fusion proteins, and other mammalian cell-derived biotherapeutics are heterogeneous molecules that are validated based on the production process and not on molecular homogeneity. Validation of clearance of potential contamination by viruses is a major challenge during the downstream purification of these therapeutics. Virus filtration is a single-use, size-based separation process in which the contaminating virus particles are retained while the therapeutic molecules pass through the membrane pores. Virus filtration is routinely used as part of the overall virus clearance strategy. Compromised performance of virus filters due to membrane fouling, low throughput and reduced viral clearance, is of considerable industrial significance and is frequently a major challenge. This review shows how components generated during cell culture, contaminants, and product variants can affect virus filtration of mammalian cell-derived biologics. Cell culture-derived foulants include host cell proteins, proteases, and endotoxins. We also provide mitigation measures for each potential foulant.",

Moreover, we discuss the advancements in technologies for large\u2010scale manufacturing of cell\u2010based meat covering aspects including optimized culture media formulations, edible scaffold designs, and bioreactors for high\u2010density cell culture to reduce production costs.",

Downstream processing accounts for a major portion of the total costs for operation and product manufacturing. Hence, to be economically feasible, selective and efficient processes for product extraction and purification are increasingly called for (Basaran and Rodriguez-Cerezo, 2008). The efficiency of downstream processing is dependent on the concentration of the recombinant protein, complexities of cell-free culture media and plant extracts as well as the required level of purity of the final product. This review has sought to define the phases required to express and develop vaccines and other pharmaceutical proteins from plants. These steps will only become further refined as the search for cost-effective and environmentally friendly expression platforms for vaccines increase in demand.",

            "text": "Achieving this requires advanced equipment with significant digitalization and rapid analytics (Thakur et al. 2023). For a complete continuous process, continuous upstream production is essential and presents its own challenges such as that the rAAV product dominantly remains intracellular which necessitates a cell lysis step (Vandenberghe et al. 2010). Therefore, the focus lies on providing a constant outflow of material from the bioreactor prior to lysis, as opposed to continuously removing the product as it is done in perfusion cell cultures (Bielser et al. 2018). Still, the feasibility of rAAV perfusion has been shown at small scale (Park et al. 2024). Further points for improving continuity in upstream is increasing productivity and titers in the bioreactor by, for example, improving transfection efficiency or optimizing bioreactor parameters for providing more rAAV material to DSP per unit time (Achieving RAAV Bioreactor Titer of 1E15 VgL With Novel Plasmid Transient Transfection Platform;Zhao et al. 2020). \n\nSince many AAV-based therapies target rare diseases with lower product demand which questions the need for fully continuous manufacturing processes in future applications. In that case, semicontinuous processes may be a sufficient choice. Such processes utilize a hybrid approach, where continuous processing steps are combined with batch operations (Manser and Glenz 2021). A large variety of examples for semi-continuous processes have been shown for mAbs and include combining fed-batch upstream production with continuous DSP, or integrating continuous capture chromatography with other unit operations that are run in batch-mode such as low pH-virus inactivation, polishing chromatography, or virus inactivation (R. Chen et al. 2022;Klutz et al. 2016;\u00d6tes et al. 2017).",

            "text": "The increased elution volume is likely a combination of mAb desorption kinetics on the device, dead volume in the capsule, and system hold-up volume. Such challenges could be addressed on the vendor side via ligand selection and the design of units with smaller hold-up volumes, or the application of single-pass tangential flow filtration systems by process scientists to reduce product bulk volumes. \n\nThe purification of 100 L of CH on a 75 mL Sartobind \u00ae Rapid A device using the MU-RCC system is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind for mAb purification at pilot scale. The pilot-scale device was exposed to a total of 57 purification cycles with an aggregate duration of circa 19 h. By comparison, a 900 mL PrismA column would be required to process the same amount of material over four purification cycles for a duration of approximately 14 h, not accounting for column qualification and pre-and post-sanitization activities. The adsorbent volume requirements coupled with capacity utilisation would present cost advantages in the case of the membrane format. The 45 g/L load density used for benchscale studies appeared to be at the limits of the dynamic binding capacity of the membrane device, which was more apparent for the first lot of pilot-scale runs. On adjustment of the load density to 35 g/L, the process and product attributes were comparable between the 1 mL and 75 mL membrane devices, demonstrating scalability. \n\nWe considered a process-scale scenario for the capture of a 2000 L mAb batch with similar titres to CH1-CH5. Table 6 shows parameter estimates for selected chromatography media volumes for the Sartobind \u00ae Rapid A membrane and the high-capacity MabSelect\u2122 PrismA resin. Values for the PrismA resin are based on our validated 2000 L scale manufacture of this mAb. Rapid A MVs of 0.8 L, 1.6 L, and 3.2 L were considered and compared to a 32 L MabSelect\u2122 PrismA column. It is noteworthy that the scale-up of a Rapid A device can be achieved using either large-volume capsule formats or stacks of modular cassette formats [17]. The load densities were adjusted to accommodate processing of the entire batch, which is reflected in the corresponding cycle numbers.",

The increasing demand of monoclonal antibodies has led pharmaceutical companies to adopt efficient production processes. Transferring monoclonal antibody production to the industrial manufacturing requires adequate effort in process development. The strategy to reduce development time and cost comprises high-throughput process development which is especially central for the rapid optimization of the purification process. Chromatography process is the backbone of the purification process that can deliver high purity but it requires significant resources. Combined with high-throughput process development approach, the chromatography process is easy to develop and scale-up from laboratory to manufacturing scale. Design of experiments helps high-throughput process development workflow to provide decision-support techniques. This approach ensures significantly decreased time and material needs while improving the chromatography process. Protein A affinity chromatography is one of the most important chromatographic steps because of its great performance and capabilities. Most of the working parameters can be predefined and are identical for several monoclonal antibodies. However, some parameters like elution pH, loading capacity, resin type need further optimization for each monoclonal antibody. In this study, the loading and elution parameters were screened for Protein A chromatography to identify the best purification conditions using the combination of Design of Experiments and high-throughput process development approach in micro-volume columns. Developed working parameters were used for scale-up and tested under robust process conditions. Specific chromatography conditions were applied in pilot-scale and data comparison was done with micro-volume columns, lab-column scale to validate high-throughput strategy approach",

            "text": "Recombinantly expressed biotherapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAb), hormones, cytokines, and vaccines, have gained attention in the pharmaceutical industry during recent years (Walsh, 2018). Especially, novel therapies based on mAbs have become a key interest for clinical application and biomanufacturing since the first clinical approval in approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by today, and many more are in clinical development, proving the still increasing interest in these biopharmaceuticals (Gillespie, 2021). \n\nTherapeutic antibodies are characterized by complex posttranslational modifications to ensure bioactivity and low toxicity of the proteins. Therefore, mammalian cell lines like Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are utilized for the expression of these complex biomolecules instead of microbial hosts (Jayapal et al., 2007;Kim et al., 2012). In contrast to small-molecule therapies, production costs are rather high and antibody-based immunotherapies are still very costly (Hernandez et al., 2018;Donini and Marusic, 2019). To lower costs, novel innovative intensification strategies are necessary. \n\nDiscontinuous process formats like fed-batch (FB) are state of the art for large-scale production of mAbs due to their robustness, simplicity, and reproducibility (Birch and Racher, 2006;Huang et al., 2010). The process can be divided into three consecutives culture stages: the logarithmic phase with exponential cell growth, the stationary phase without cell growth, and the death phase with decreasing cell viability usually due to an increasing number of apoptotic cells. During an FB process, where nutrient limitation is prevented, the transition between these different stages is commonly triggered by the accumulation of inhibitory molecules such as growth inhibitors, by-products, and fragments of lysed cells, which ultimately limit the overall productivity and time span of the process (Ahn and Antoniewicz, 2011;Carinhas et al., 2013;Mulukutla et al., 2019).",

            "text": "Vaccination is a fundamental strategy for the prevention of endemic or emerging infectious diseases. Therefore, the implementation and development of vaccine technologies that allow for timely and scalable manufacture are highly desired [26]. Despite several advancements, the inherent biological complexity and resulting variability in the manufacturing process, coupled with strict regulatory specifications, add to the lengthy and costly nature of traditional vaccine production [32]. Novel platform solutions entailing multiple alternative approaches for antigen and vector design, production, and formulation [33,34] are required to match both the speed and productivity of emerging technologies such as mRNA as well as the need to adapt processes to yield drug products of highest desirable safety and immunogenicity [35,36]. Overall, it thus becomes evident that universally applicable manufacturing solutions do not exist. Here, we describe a workflow for upstream process development for the high-yield production of live recombinant YF17D-vectored vaccines using YF-ZIK as an example [12]. Our stepwise approach guides efficient process optimization by screening multiple parameters in a targeted high-throughput manner, providing a blueprint that might be applicable to other live-attenuated and vectored viral vaccines both established and currently in development.",

The advent of recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology enables the utilization of different microbes as surrogate hosts to facilitate the production of these proteins. This microbial technology continues to evolve and integrate with modern innovations to develop more effective approaches for increasing the production of recombinant biopharmaceuticals. These strategies encompass fermentation technology, metabolic engineering, the deployment of strong promoters, novel vector elements such as inducers and enhancers, protein tags, secretion signals, synthetic biology, high-throughput devices for cloning, and process screening. This appraisal commences with a general overview regarding the manufacture of recombinant proteins by microbes and the production of biopharmaceuticals, their trends towards the development of biopharmaceuticals, and then discusses the approaches adopted for accomplishing this. The design of the upstream process, which also involves host selection, vector design, and promoter design, is a crucial component of production strategies. On the other hand, the downstream process focuses on extraction and purification techniques. Additionally, the review covers the most modern tools and resources, methods for overcoming low expression, the cost of producing biopharmaceuticals in microbes, and readily available recombinant protein products.",

            "text": "The recombinant CHO K1 cells expressing the antibody-based therapeutic (an anti-TNF\u03b1 IgG1 antibody) were obtained from Shanghai Zhanjiang Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China. The cell line culture process comprised cell recovery, cell expansion, and a final fed-batch culture. The culture was grown in a serum free medium (CHOM-B03) and equilibrated with a 5% CO 2 /air mixture overnight before seeding. It was maintained in a CO 2 incubator with a 5% CO 2 /air mixture at 37 \u00b0C. For the 5 L scale culture, primary seeds were shake flask amplified and after expansion to 0.9 L, seeds were transferred to a 5 L bioreactor at a 1:4.4 inoculation ratio to initiate the culture. For the 50 L scale culture, primary seeds were first expanded in shake flasks, followed by a secondary expansion in 5 L bioreactors. Once the culture volume reached 5 L, it was transferred to a 50 L bioreactor at a 1: 4 inoculation ratio. The culture was maintained until day 2, at which point a second feed expanded the volume to 40 L, continuing thereafter with fed-batch cultivation. For the 500 L scale culture, the seeding process mirrored that of the 50 L scale for the initial two stages, with the third stage of seed expansion occurring in a 50 L bioreactor. After the culture volume increased to 50 L, it was transferred to a 500 L bioreactor, also at a 1:4 inoculation ratio. On the second day, the culture was fed twice, reaching a total volume of 400 L, and was then maintained using the fed-batch cultivation method. The batch inoculation density should be approximately 1.0-1.2\u00d710 6 cells/mL, and the cell viability should not be less than 90%. Cell density, viability, cell status, and glucose levels were measured daily during the culture period. Product expression was measured on days 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16, and product quality attributes were measured after purification by affinity chromatography.",

            "text": "evolve into an attractive industrial technology able to facilitate the large-scale manufacture of biopharmaceutical products, including viral vectors (Gutierrez-Granados et al., 2018;Pham et al., 2006). TGE-based bioprocesses are currently the predominant method for viral vector manufacture, for both clinical and commercial applications (Van Der Loo & Wright, 2016). \n\nThe growing demand for viral vector products, as more therapies reach late-stage clinical trials and are commercialized, coupled with a global shortage in contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) with experienced production capabilities, requires further technical innovation to maximize process efficiency and productivity. With the Milken Institute predicting the approval of 50-75 cell and gene therapies in the United States by 2030 (Choe et al., 2022), it is becoming increasingly clear that new developments and improved viral vector bioprocessing are required to ensure that the industry can meet the growing demand for these products, and that it is achieved at an acceptable cost. While there are many examples of TGE-based manufacturing processes being successfully scaled up to the hundred-and thousand-litre scale (Almo & Love, 2014;Backer, 2022;Girard et al., 2002;Van Lieshout et al., 2023;Tuvesson et al., 2008), several process inefficiencies and challenges remain. One such challenge arises from the widespread use of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein (VSV-G) in LVV production. \n\nThe tropism of LVVs is frequently expanded though the utilization of surface glycoproteins derived from other enveloped viruses, a process known as pseudotyping (Joglekar & Sandoval, 2017). VSV-G is extensively used as a pseudotype for LVVs as it confers broad tropism to the vector, can achieve high transduction efficiencies and has been extensively characterized (Perry & Rayat, 2021).",

            "text": "The need for innovation in biopharmaceutical manufacturing has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic [1] as well as, more generally, by the long-term increase in the use and cost of biologic drugs [2]. This has been recognized through regulatory initiatives such as the Advanced Technology Team within FDA [3] and the formation of government-academic-industrial partnerships such as the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL) [4]. At the level of process design, the key trends are intensification and flexibility, where intensification refers to increasing efficiency on the basis of cost, space, and/or time [5], and flexibility refers to processes that are modular, portable from facility to facility, and amenable to changes in production rates [4]. At the level of technology, some approaches are especially interesting because of their potential to deliver both flexibility and intensification simultaneously. These include single-use systems [4,6]; alternatives to conventional chromatography that are less equipment-and buffer-intensive [7][8][9][10]; and the integration of multiple unit operations into more streamlined procedures with smaller footprints, e.g., by combining primary recovery and initial purification using expanded bed adsorption of cell lysates [11] or host cells engineered for selective product release [12]. \n\nThese trends and challenges in biopharmaceutical manufacturing have a direct impact on the global response to COVID-19. Though there is a recognized need for globally-available therapeutics and preventives to complement vaccines, effective disease-specific drugs have not been widely available worldwide [13], in part because of the cost of manufacturing and the difficulty of building new manufacturing capacity for unpredictable demand (i.e., process inflexibility). Even in well-resourced countries such as the United States, options remain limited.",

Production of mAbs is expensive compared to conventional drug production, primarily due to the complex processes involved. The affinity purification step is dominating the cost of goods in mAb manufacturing. Process intensification and automation could reduce costs, but the lack of real-time process analytical technologies (PAT) complicates this development. We show a specific and robust fiber optical localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensor technology that is optimized for in-line product detection in the effluent in affinity capture steps. The sensor system comprises a flow cell and a replaceable sensor chip functionalized with biorecognition elements for specific analyte detection. The high selectivity of the sensor enable detection of mAbs in complex sample matrices at concentrations below 2.5 \u03bcg mL-1. In place regeneration of the sensor chips allowed for continuous monitoring of multiple consecutive chromatographic separation cycles. Excellent performance was obtained at different purification scales with flow rates up to 200 mL min-1. This sensor technology facilitates efficient column loading, optimization, and control of chromatography systems, which can pave the way for continuous operation and automation of protein purification steps.",

Well-controlled cultivation microsystems, as a rule, have high costs, and for the following procedures, it is difficult to scale the best operating parameters. As insect cells are robust in terms of pH and dissolved oxygen tension, the implementation of the QbD tool in Schott flasks offers a cheap and scalable system with which to optimize VLP production by B/IC.

            "text": "In addition to the time investment, the re-clones in this study used seed medium with a higher concentration of MSX than the parental clones. Based on our experience conducting a thorough cost-of-goods analysis for a separate project [35], the increase in cost from the increased MSX concentration in the seed train is negligible and expected to be compensated for by the increase in titer observed with these re-clones. \n\nTo evaluate the long-term stability of the re-clone banks, we assessed upstream performance for mAb2 and mAb3 after approximately 48 to 49 additional generations from WCB-aged cells and observed a small, but not practically significant titer decrease of <20% for mAb2 and mAb3 re-clone (Supplemental Figures S4 and S5). Importantly, there were no significant changes in HC and LC gene copy numbers or antibody product quality profiles after 48 to 49 additional generations from the WCB (data not shown). Based on our experience, a productivity decrease of <20% after nearly 50 generations beyond manufacturing age would not be a significant impediment in a commercial upstream process; thus, re-clones generated by the strategy applied in this report were considered sufficiently stable and suitable for late phase process development. In particular, scaling the process up to a 15,000-L bioreactor would require one to two additional passages beyond the scale-up train used for the 500-L or 2000-L processes. This would contribute approximately 3-7 additional generations to the seed train, well within the limits of what was tested here. \n\nA review of the literature suggests two likely explanations for the increased titer produced in the processes with the re-clones. First, clonal CHO cell populations exhibit natural heterogeneity, which could enable the isolation of a re-clone with desired features (i.e., higher productivity) [20,23,29,30,36]. This heterogeneity is generally accepted in the field and, importantly, is not indicative of instability in upstream process performance or product quality [6,23,37,38]. More recently, it has been suggested that the process of single cell cloning itself can impact CHO cell epigenetics in a heritable manner, leading to altered (and possibly improved) performance [39].",

            "text": "The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell is an industry-leading cell line for the production of therapeutic proteins [1,2]. This is largely due to its advantageous manufacturing characteristics and the wealth of experience that the industry has accumulated over the past several decades. The manufacturing process starts with the development of a single cell clone with favorable manufacturing phenotypes, most notably the ability to secrete large quantities of a therapeutic protein. Historically, obtaining a high-expressing, stable clone would require numerous rounds of screening, which could take upwards of 9-12 months [1]. As molecular biology techniques have improved, several approaches, including plasmid optimization, the use of ubiquitous chromatin opening elements (UCOEs), incorporation of transposase technologies, and the use of site-specific integration have been used to reduce development timelines, increase productivity, and enhance the probability of obtaining a high-expressing, stable clone [3][4][5][6]. Despite these advances, further improvements must be made to increase production levels and reduce the cost of developing and screening suitable cell lines for drug manufacturing [7]. Several studies indicate that the supplementation of small molecules into cell culture media can increase recombinant protein production, including a 3\u00d7 increase in monoclonal antibody production, and a nearly 100\u00d7 increase in the production of fluorescent and luminescent proteins [3,8,9]. Despite these benefits, small molecules are rarely incorporated into industrial-scale processes for several reasons. Doing so may require additional time and equipment to remove the small molecule during manufacturing processes and require the development of an assay to demonstrate sufficient clearance from the final drug substance. Additionally, significant testing would be required to ensure that expensive purification resins remain unchanged and available for cleaning and reuse in future production batches. Finally, the stability, availability, and quality of the new raw material would need to be carefully assessed, leading to substantial time and costs in the production of a therapeutic protein. Although these factors present significant hurdles for the incorporation of small molecules into manufacturing processes, valuable information can still be gained about the underlying biology of CHO cells through treatment with small molecules.",

            "text": "The production of ADCs presents multifaceted challenges in pharmaceutical manufacturing sine ADCs are heterogeneous mixture of compounds with varying number of drugs and multiple conjugation sites. Therefore, a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach is typically used to determine the impact of single variables as well as interactions of multiple variables in early development stages. Initial stages involve the optimization of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for robustness in the ADC manufacturing environment, with a focus on physicochemical properties ensuring suitability for the process (Ducry, 2012). \n\nAS for the ADC process development, achieving the desired drugantibody-ratio (DAR) is paramount for efficacy and regulatory compliance. It is necessary to take consideration of potential challenges such as mAb aggregation and drug/linker adverse effects. The manufacturing environment demands adherence to Current Good Manufacturing Process (cGMP) standards, emphasizing aseptic conditions to protect operators and products. The challenges escalate when handling powdered cytotoxic reagents, requiring specialized containment measures and advanced personal protection equipment. Current manufacturing plants is designed for reducing microbial contamination such as endotoxin, but not able to eliminate highly potent cytotoxic compound with occupational exposure levels (OELs) in the nanogram range (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2007). Moreover, the purification process introduces additional complexities, including variations in DAR, unincorporated drug, spacer derivatives, and organic solvents. Tangential flow filtration (TFF) and chromatography modalities are employed, necessitating optimization to account for potential stability and solubility issues. Throughout, operator and environmental protection remain paramount, leading to the adoption of closed systems and single-use components which cause production cost increasing. \n\nIn summary, ADC manufacturing presents complex challenges requiring innovations in mAb processing, conjugation chemistry, purification techniques, and facility design. Success in overcoming these challenges is essential for the development and production of safe, effective, and marketable ADC therapies.",

            "text": "Although upstream processing is advanced in its transition, where chemostat and perfusion reactors are frequently used at the manufacturing scale [131], downstream processing has only recently commenced this transition. Viral clearance strategies are important for the manufacture of safe biologic drug substances and drug products. Moreover, McDonald (2019) noted that \"if the biopharma sector want the most out of continuous manufacturing, they must rethink their viral safety strategies\". The biopharma industry has yet to define preferred comprehensive technologies, approaches and protocols for viral safety in continuous processing [127]. While it is appreciated that current strategies work well for batch-mode production; protocols for continuous-model production and equipment preference are yet to be fully defined. The biopharma industry has been challenged by viral contamination since the dawn of the growth of medicine-making cells in bioreactors [127]; this includes potential viral contamination of raw materials, culture media and cell lines used in biopharmaceuticals. Moreover, if finished drugs are virally contaminated, they could infect patients [127]. Ensuring the production of virus-free biopharmaceuticals is more challenging in continuous bioprocessing [99], but continuous production presents benefits including increasing output, reducing cost and reducing waste [127]. Viral safety, testing and clearance/inactivation methods are very important for large-scale production and are seen as expensive regulatory requirements for a new biological products [126,127]. \n\nMartins and co-workers (2020) highlighted that continuous inactivation (VI) has received little attention in efforts to realize fully continuous bioprocessing. Implementation of continuous VI must address a specific minimum incubation time (typically 60 min), where the latter reported on the implementation of a packed bed continuous viral inactivation reactor (CVIR) with narrow residence time distribution (RTD) for low pH incubation using two industry-standard model viruses (i.e., xenotrophic murine leukaemia virus and pseudorabies virus). Martins et al. (2020) reported that their combined CVIR with RTD approach achieved low-pH inactivation kinetics where bioprocessing was equivalent to traditional batch operation.",

            "text": "The translation of EV-based therapies has grown rapidly over the past two decades and has shown early potential for applications in TERM. However, there remain important challenges that must be addressed to facilitate the translation of these technologies into the clinic. These challenges primarily concern issues of large-scale production, understanding the biodistribution of EVs, and the absence of a thorough characterization of EVs to ensure safe and efficacious clinical translation. \n\nWhile the production of EVs shares similarities with the manufacturing of traditional biologic products (i.e., industrial production of antibodies and recombinant proteins), the optimal cell source and culture conditions for the large-scale production of EVs have not yet been established. MBVs are a potential solution to this limitation since they are isolated from readily available tissue. However, the preparation of MBVs also requires additional tissue decellularization and ECM solubilization steps that may affect their properties [74]. With regard to the collection, isolation, and purification of EV-based therapies, several studies have established a consensus that standardized protocols and outcome measurements are necessary for large-scale translation [155][156][157][158]. To address concerns in EV isolation and purity, the manufacturing trends are shifting from techniques including ultracentrifugation (which is time consuming and can produce contaminants) towards isolation techniques potentially capable of large-scale manufacturing such as tangential flow filtration (TFF) or size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) [74,[157][158][159]. However, these techniques still have their limitations and further studies are necessary to determine the optimal technique for the isolation and purification of EVs at the large-scale, commercial level. In addition to concerns regarding the manufacturing of EV therapeutics, the long-term storage and stability of EV therapies pose a significant hurdle to clinical translation. The effects of various preservation techniques on EV stability and bioactivity are not well understood [157,160]. Initial studies suggested that cryopreservation at \u221280 \u2022 C was superior to storage at 4 \u2022 C and would preserve EV structure and composition. However, storage at \u221280 \u2022 C comes with increased costs and technical challenges.",

Using the whole range of recombinant DNA technologies allows not only new-tonature products to be made, but also at new-to-nature rates and with new-to-nature stabilities under the required industrial conditions. There is therefore much scope to open up the biotechnology field to new applications on wider scale, as will be highlighted in this article. \n\nThis review paper first introduces the concept of bioprocess intensification, making a clear distinction between the \"intensification\" and \"optimisation\" terminologies and emphasising the key approaches of novel equipment, process and material design that define bioprocess intensification. This is followed by a state-of-the-art review of the recent advances made in the intensification of upstream, biotransformation and downstream separation/purification stages of bioprocesses as well as in the integration or hybridisation of reaction-separation steps. Advances made in bioprocess modelling as supporting tools for bioprocess intensification are also highlighted. Finally, the future prospects for bioprocess intensification developments particularly in the context of the grand challenges currently facing humanity are presented, with a view to stimulating further research in these important areas.",

            "text": "Downstream processing is the bottleneck in the continuous manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). To overcome throughput limitations, two different continuous processes with a novel convective diffusive protein A membrane adsorber (MA) were investigated: the rapid cycling parallel multi\u2010column chromatography (RC\u2010PMCC) process and the rapid cycling simulated moving bed (RC\u2010BioSMB) process. First, breakthrough curve experiments were performed to investigate the influence of the flow rate on the mAb dynamic binding capacity and to calculate the duration of the loading steps. In addition, customized control software was developed for an automated MA exchange in case of pressure increase due to membrane fouling to enable robust, uninterrupted, and continuous processing. Both processes were performed for 4 days with 0.61\u2009g\u2009L\u22121 mAb\u2010containing filtrate and process performance, product purity, productivity, and buffer consumption were compared. The mAb was recovered with a yield of approximately 90% and productivities of 1010\u2009g\u2009L\u22121\u2009d\u22121 (RC\u2010PMCC) and 574\u2009g\u2009L\u22121\u2009d\u22121 (RC\u2010BioSMB). At the same time, high removal of process\u2010related impurities was achieved with both processes, whereas the buffer consumption was lower for the RC\u2010BioSMB process. Finally, the attainable productivity for perfusion bioreactors of different sizes with suitable MA sizes was calculated to demonstrate the potential to operate both processes on a manufacturing scale with bioreactor volumes of up to 2000\u2009L.",

            "text": "Advances of molecular biology have improved cloning and culture methods, which has diversi ed applications of recombinant proteins, ranging from enzymes used in laundry detergents to antibodies employed in cancer therapy [1]. Extensive studies have been carried out to nd suitable production systems for high-level expression of recombinant proteins [30,31]. However, downstream processing often contributes more to production cost than upstream and fermentation process [8]. Most efforts were previously focused on extracellular expression or production to reduce the downstream processing cost, but in general, the yields of extracellular protein were much lower than those produced intracellularly [32]. \n\nThe downstream processing of intracellular products needs multiple steps, including host cell harvest, cell disruption, and target protein isolation and puri cation. Though there are several reports on controllable cell lysis [33], no complete genetic engineering platform for downstream processing was available. \n\nThe methods for the productions of recombinant proteins are quite diverse. The recombinant proteins are often produced in high yields with maturity technology, while the production capacities of newly constructed recombinant proteins are usually low [32]. Developing a system for the isolation of low-level product, in a sense, is a more di cult task, because it must remove much larger proportion of impurities. In this work, we developed a complete set of genetic engineering downstream processing platform for low expression level proteins, from cell harvest to target protein isolation. Since the magnetotactic bacteria strain MSR-1 was employed as the host strain, the cells with target proteins could be harvested by magnetic separation, instead of traditional centrifugations. Magnetic separation makes the collection of host cells much easier for continuous pipeline transportation, which is a progressive and economically advantageous mode of industrial transportation [34]. Cell disruption is also a key downstream processing step. This is a costly step for industrial production, in which high pressure homogenization was often employed. Autolysis or controllable lysis of host cell is the most convenient way to release intracellular products [35]. However, after cell lysis, the release of long chain nucleic acids led to a very high viscosity, which makes di cult for the next downstream processing steps [36].",

            "text": "In 1986, Muromumab became the first FDA-approved mAb for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection. Since 1990, and especially since the approval of the first fully human antibody in 2004, the number of mAbs available in the pharmacopeia has increased. Biotherapeutics have been used for the treatment of a variety of medical conditions including cancers, organ transplants and autoimmune, cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological diseases, which is witnessed by the steady increase in the number of FDA-approved treatments [1]. The pharmaceutical industry has made great progress in developing reliable and efficient bioproduction processes that meet the demand for new biotherapeutics including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Sixty-eight new mAbs were approved between 2014 and 2018, thus representing more than 50% of all new biopharmaceutical products on the market, and mAbs represented the most lucrative product class, with a revenue of $123 billion registered in 2017 [2]. mAbs are complex structures and require proper folding, assembly and post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, to ensure their functionality and efficacy. Unlike microbial systems that are limited in post-translational modifications, mammalian cell lines are apt to generate diverse functional recombinant glycoproteins, with Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells being used for the production of 84% of FDA-approved biotherapeutics in 2018 [2]. \n\nThe culture of CHO cells in bioreactors is a tightly regulated process that has seen significant advances since the 90s [3]. The steps involved in the development of a cell culture production process include the design and the selection of a stable protein-secreting cell line, the optimization of media and culture operating conditions at a small scale using mediumto high-throughput screening methods and finally the upscaling of the process, which must comply with good manufacturing practices (GMPs) [4,5]. Despite major advances in cell culture processes and the optimization of cell culture media, the cellular response to changes in the culture environment and the subsequent impact on cell growth and productivity needs to be better understood in order to fully optimize the production of biologics.",

            "text": "Viral vectors for gene therapy are mainly produced using adherent cells for virus replication. However, adherent cells (e.g., HEK293) need a solid support for growth, and therefore, cell and subsequent virus culture scale-up is more challenging when compared with using suspension cells. Small-scale viral vector manufacturing has relied on different classical research laboratory methods using culture flask approaches, and traditional scale-up options have been stacked culture flasks [115,116]. However, such horizontal scale-out allowing for the required surface for adherent cells to proliferate is cumbersome, often requires manual handling, may need open connections, and lacks monitoring and control for pH and dissolved oxygen [115,117]. Therefore, the use of scalable fixedbed bioreactors in viral vector clinical lot and commercial manufacturing has recently been explored successfully [97,115,118]. Fixed-bed bioreactor vessels offer a solid or porous support to immobilise adherent cells, in which the cells can be grown to high cell densities by perfusion of nutrients and oxygen. Such fixed-bed bioreactor vessels can support the manufacturing of batch sizes sufficiently large for clinical studies and for market introduction and can be either reusable or disposable [118]. In addition, with the increasing demand for viral vectors, it is anticipated that the development of a mix of alternative or additional production technologies in large-scale viral vector manufacturing: (i) suspensionbased upstream processes in stirred-tank vessels, and (ii) a trend towards continuous bioprocessing approaches will be observed [117]. These various production technologies and modes of operation hold the promise of significantly increased batch sizes, therefore reducing manufacturing costs [117,118].",

            "text": "The majority of recombinant adeno\u2010associated viruses (rAAV) approved for clinical use or in clinical trials areproduced by transient transfection using the HEK293 cell line. However, this platform has several manufacturing bottlenecks at commercial scales namely, low product quality (full to empty capsid ratio <20% in most rAAV serotypes), lower productivities obtained after scale\u2010up and the high cost of raw materials, in particular of Good Manufacturing Practice grade plasmid DNA required for transfection. The HeLa\u2010based stable cell line rAAV production system provides a robust and scalable alternative to transient transfection systems. Nevertheless, the time required to generate the producer cell lines combined with the complexity of rAAV production and purification processes still pose several barriers to the use of this platform as a suitable alternative to the HEK293 transient transfection. In this work we streamlined the cell line development and bioprocessing for the HeLaS3\u2010based production of rAAV. By exploring this optimized approach, producer cell lines were generated in 3\u20104 months, and presented rAAV2 volumetric production (bulk) > 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091011\u2009vg/mL and full to empty capsids ratio (>70%) at 2\u2009L bioreactor scale. Moreover, the established downstream process, based on ion exchange and affinity\u2010based chromatography, efficiently eliminated process related impurities, including the Adenovirus 5 helper virus required for production with a log reduction value of 9. Overall, we developed a time\u2010efficient and robust rAAV bioprocess using a stable producer cell line achieving purified rAAV2 yields\u2009>\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091011\u2009vg/mL. This optimized platform may address manufacturing challenges for rAAV based medicines.",

However, one of the major bottlenecks restricting the development of antibody drugs is how to perform high-level expression and production of recombinant antibodies. The high-efficiency expression and quality of recombinant antibodies in CHO cells is determined by multiple factors. This review provides a comprehensive overview of several state-of-the-art approaches, such as optimization of gene sequence of antibody, construction and optimization of high-efficiency expression vector, using antibody expression system, transformation of host cell lines, and glycosylation modification.

            "text": "Different avenues of LV manufacturing platform are covered in our review (Perry & Rayat, 2021). A typical LV manufacturing route is described in Figure 1a: note the multiple membrane processes (i.e., clarification, concentration/diafiltration and sterile filtration) often utilized alongside chromatography as the main purification step. Due to their lipid enveloped structure, the stability of LVs is thought to be influenced by temperature, freeze-thaw, ionic strength, adsorption, pH and shear stress experienced during the manufacturing steps. The mechanism of LV loss through these stressors is yet to be fully investigated (Moreira et al., 2020). Although some stability studies have been performed in the past (e.g., Dautzenberg et al., 2021;Tijani et al., 2018), these have focused on chemical and thermal stability rather than on the individual unit operations and their interaction. In the field of recombinant protein production, including macromolecular therapies, understanding the interactions between the product and the unit operations has led to improvement of yields, reduction in cost and development of a robust purification strategy (Huisman et al., 2000;Zydney, 2021). The systematic study of LV manufacturing condition, the unit operations and their interactions (i.e., whole bioprocess analysis) is currently a gap in vector manufacturing. The low recovery and loss of vector functionality, as well as the differences in quality requirements (i.e., purity and potency) for in vivo and ex vivo applications are key challenges in LV production (McCarron et al., 2016). The latter requires product and process review on a case-by-case basis (McCarron et al., 2016) while the former (i.e., LV losses) can be addressed by rational bioprocess development for the fundamental study and understanding of LV bioprocessing (Perry & Rayat, 2021). Bioprocess investigations at the earliest opportunity during product development would enable the design and creation of robust LVs for manufacture. \n\nIn this regard, scale-down bioprocess models mimicking manufacturing operations and high throughput studies could prove beneficial.",

            "text": "One of the main challenges faced in the field of EVs is the low yield obtained during manufacturing [166]. This renders basic scientific research, pre-clinical studies, and clinical trials more challenging, leading to a significant delay in the progress of the field in order to harness the full potential of EVs in clinical settings [167]. The whole bioprocessing pipeline, from upstream to downstream processing, needs to be considered for EV manufacturing optimization. Upstream processing comprises cell culture leading to EV production, thus requiring the appropriate choice of both the cell culture medium used and the culture vessel, which can range from small vessels such as T-flasks up to 500 L bioreactors, depending on the chosen approach. This step influences the characteristics of the final product and therefore should be carefully selected, while having in mind a specific application. \n\nProgress is already being made towards optimizing the upstream conditions of EV production through the adaptation of already well-established technologies in other fields to produce functional and safe EVs in a cost-effective way. The scaling-up or scaling-out of such platforms is expected to decrease the costs associated with EV manufacturing [168]. The simplest scaling option is to adopt the use of multi-layer flasks (e.g., hyperflasks, Cellstacks, Cell Factories) instead of the use of conventional T-flasks [168]. These systems present several layers for cell growth, decreasing the manipulation time needed, in comparison to conventional T-flasks and reducing lab footprint. For example, hyperflasks were used for the cultivation of bone marrow-derived MSC and the EVs isolated from the conditioned medium (i.e., containing EVs) were shown to significantly suppress the symptoms of graft vs. host disease (GvHD) in a murine model [169]. However, culture monitoring is challenging when using these planar systems, which do not lead to cost savings in the whole process, namely in what concerns the quantity of cell culture medium used [170].",

A different approach to create a multi-compartment system at the lab scale was presented by Schilling et al. [12]. Artificial compartments were generated by installing cylindrical discs between the stirrers, prolonging the mixing times from 10 to 130 s. The authors outlined the application of this setup for investigating microorganisms exposed to largescale substrate gradients. \n\nThe current study builds on the previous findings of Schilling et al. by elucidating whether and how such settings may be applicable for the scale-up analysis of mammalian cells. A single multi-compartment bioreactor (SMCB) was designed to enable tailoring of mixing times, similar to large-scale conditions of biopharmaceutical production processes. Intrinsically, the approach differs from conventional multi-compartment settings as it prevents any additional stress impacts caused by external pumps. Conceptually, large-scale mixing times and (integral) volumetric power inputs guide the design of the laboratory scale-up simulator. Particular emphasis was placed on the design of proper separating discs mounted inside the stirred bioreactor. Thorough studies will converge in a design workflow that allows proper downscaling of large-scale mixing conditions into a 3.8 L lab bioreactor.",

Numerous modelling studies successfully characterizing the influence of measurable process conditions on culture dynamic exist in literature (Smiatek et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020;Tsopanoglou and Jim\u00e9nez del Val, 2021;Babi et al., 2022;Schwarz et al., 2022). Unfortunately, they often depend on numerous measurements not often available at manufacturing scale and/or complex modeling and optimization procedures requiring important computational expertise. Therefore, these model-based intensification strategies are difficult to transfer at industrial scale in spite of their most likely success (Papathanasiou et al., 2017;Papathanasiou and Kontoravdi, 2020). Here, we focused on the development of a modeling structure enabling the description of upstream bioprocess dynamics and the transfer between operations (specifically, from fed-batch to continuous culture) at different scales (from Ambr \u00ae 250 to Univessel \u00ae 2L) with a single set of kinetic parameters. We have demonstrated that the growth model identified using fed-batch cell cultures can be used to design intensified culture conditions in a one-step strategy. To our knowledge, this is the first experimentally validated methodology providing simulation capabilities appropriate for optimization and system configuration decisions within biopharmaceutical process development and advanced control activities.\n\n2 Materials and methods 2.1 Cell line, inoculum development, medium and analytical methods Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) DG44 cell line (Sartorius) expressing a monoclonal antibody (mAb, IgG1) was used.

For the fed-batch processes, these pre culture steps were performed in (unbaffled) shake",

Reductions in these partial genomes and empty capsids in combination with the increase in full intact genomes packaged represent significant improvements in the vector product quality profile, which is key to providing safe and effective therapies for patients. \n\nIncreased productivity with pOXB dual system scales to 50-L bioreactors, and extended product quality panel remains consistent with triple transfection Next, the pOXB dual-plasmid transfection was scaled up to a 50-L bioreactor to ensure this process yielded similar results at a larger scale more representative of cGMP manufacturing. Our transfection-based rAAV manufacturing platform has demonstrated linear scalability from 50-L to 500-L and to 2000-L bioreactors; therefore, the 50-L scale is utilized to confirm process changes as a representative large-scale model (Figure S6). Consistent with the trends at 2-L bioreactor scale, the results from the 50-L bioreactors demonstrated an almost 2-fold increase with genome D in VG productivity, comparable capsid production, and a doubling in the calculated full vectors in the crude lysate (Figures 7A-7C). These data support the pOXB dual-plasmid system as a scalable process, which yields consistent results across all tested production scales. \n\nWhen introducing process changes, it is crucial that the vector quality profile remains consistent or improved compared with historical data. We evaluated purified vectors produced using pOXB dual or triple transfection with an extended panel of analytics to characterize prod-uct quality. The overall downstream VG recoveries between pOXB dual plasmids and triple transfection were highly similar, specifically within a 4% difference. Purity, aggregation, and residual host cell protein all remained consistent regardless of transfection method, which is expected as these parameters should not be impacted by plasmidbased upstream changes (Figures 7D-7F).",

            "text": "Global market values involving biotechnology have been forecasted to reach US$2-4 trillion by 2030-2040. A substantial part of the field employs microbes for production of chemicals, enzymes, foods and pharmaceuticals [1]. However, as industry has grown to rely heavily on microbes, only one in 5000-10,000 biotechnology innovations survives the long route from initial findings, through academia to product commercialization at the industrial level [2]. This valley of death in industrial biotechnology is often encountered when strains and/or processes, once optimized at the laboratory scale, are directly transferred to large-scale bioreactors for actual industrial production. This so-called scale-up effect often leads to reduced production performance in terms of titer, rate and yield (T. R. Y.), and in some cases, even batch failures.\n\nThis loss of production performance is the result of interactions between cellular metabolism and the environment in industrial-scale bioreactors. However, these are not fully accounted for during laboratory-scale process development and optimization [3,4]. Typically, most industrial fermentations employ the fed-batch mode in large-scale bioreactors with volumes reaching tens to hundreds of cubic meters. Therefore, mixing times are in the tens to hundreds of seconds due to limitations on power input and relatively long transport distances at that large scale. In contrast, cellular reaction time, which generally does not vary with the volume of the reactor, occurs on the scale of tens of seconds or even seconds [5]. When the mixing time inside the reactor is greater than or equivalent to the intracellular biochemical reaction time, large-scale fermentation processes are featured with a variety of environmental gradients, such as substrate, pH, dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) and dissolved carbon dioxide concentration [6,7].\n\nThe presence of these gradients can often lead to decreases in production capacity and the accumulation of byproducts which may be extremely detrimental to large-scale fermentation processes. To our knowledge, there have been numerous scale-down studies on the substrate concentration gradient for a wide range of industrial cell factories. These studies have provided valuable insights into cellular metabolism and suggested methods for process intensification [8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. However, unlike",

            "text": "SXC has been applied for purification for a variety of biomolecules, as described in Section 4. To date, SXC has not been applied in large-scale productions of biopharmaceuticals. The transfer from a small-scale laboratory method to a large-scale purification method involves some hurdles. First, as mentioned in Section 3.1.2., there is a limited availability of commercially available stationary phases through all process scales, which is currently limited to monoliths. A scalable membrane module portfolio could further promote the development of downstream processes based on this method, as the customer could purchase modules for larger scales after successful implementation and testing at a small scale and once the target product receives market approval and is produced in large batches. Second, the skepticism towards new methods leads to the preferred application of established methods accepted by the regulatory authorities. The first scale-up approach of SXC was reported by Lothert for the purification of 200 L Orf with monoliths, but recoveries of SXC runs showed great variations with limited reproducibility [51]. The scale-up difficulties in this case likely stem from a rapid transfer of a small-scale optimized protocol to a very large scale without knowing the critical process parameters for scaling up and whether SXC scales just like other chromatography methods. \n\nA holistic study on SXC scaling up was recently published by our team [43] using membrane modules with regenerated stabilized cellulose membranes to purify lentiviral vectors. Two key aspects were demonstrated. First, it was observed that the stained target was mainly captured on the first membrane layer and likely formed multiple layers of captured target on the first layer (Figure 4). Hence, no capture in the depth of the stationary phase occurred, which is distinct from classical chromatography methods. \n\nTherefore, increasing the membrane volume without increasing the membrane surface area of the first layer would not result in increased capacity of the module. The second key aspect describes the need to scale the flow rate with respect to the incident flow area of the first membrane layer, which is in contrast to scaling the flow rate in relation to the membrane volume, as done for other membrane chromatography methods.",

            "text": "Society expects the pharmaceutical industry to provide an uninterrupted supply of medicines. However, it is often overlooked how complex the manufacture of these compounds is and what logistics are required, not to mention the time needed to develop new drugs. The overarching theme, therefore, is patient access and how we can help ensure access and extend it to low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Downstream processing plays an important role in the supply of pharmaceuticals and, in particular, biopharmaceuticals, where a large proportion of the production costs are attributable to the recovery and purification processes (Straathof, 2011) although this may have shifted to upstream processes in the case of cell and gene therapy manufacturing (Comisel et al., 2021) while DSP for these new modalities have very low yields, with some unit operations having yields as low as 20% while scale-up can cause a significant drop in yield (Perry & Rayat, 2021). \n\nAdvanced therapeutics including recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibody-based therapies, and cell and gene therapies have dominated recent progress in medicine. While these therapeutics offer unique benefits over the current standard of care, they often are out of reach for populations in LMICs (1). Reasons for this disparity include the costs of the medicines, licensing of intellectual property, and distribution. Most recently, this disparity was evident in the development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines. In the absence of similar infrastructure and purchasing power in LMICs, vaccination could not be achieved at the same levels as the developed world (Hoest et al., 2017;Thielmann et al., 2019;Yamey et al., 2020). Similarly, given the high cost of cell and gene therapies (Lyle et al., 2023) and the absence of a robust model for reimbursement, cell and gene therapies along with other advanced therapeutics pose a huge challenge even in high-income countries (HICs) (Faulkner et al., 2022;Kolata, 2017;Robbins & Nollen, 2023). These characteristics along with the lack of operational and health infrastructure make it almost impossible to provide extensive availability in LMICs.",

The first vaccine candidate (C1) used a VSV virus vector (also recently utilized to manufacture ERVEBO, our Ebola vaccine 21 , and used genetic engineering to replace VSV surface glycoprotein with the target protein (Fig. 1A). Strategy of the second vaccine candidate (C2) utilized an attenuated Measles virus as a vector to deliver the target protein sequence upon vaccination and prompt the host cells to make the target protein and subsequently generate an immune response against it (Fig. 1B). Both vaccine candidates (C1 and C2) were tested in pre-clinical studies and elicited robust immune response in primates, confirming that the delivery mechanism was successful (data not shown).\n\nTypical LVV manufacturing process highlights gaps in control strategy. The current typical manufacturing process for LVVs can be broadly divided into upstream and downstream workflows. The upstream process generally consists of a cell growth phase, followed by viral infection and replication phase followed by the harvest of viral fluids by the addition of endonuclease to degrade cellular DNA ( Fig. 2A). The harvested virus fluids (HVF) which consists of both virus particles as well as cellular debris, is then sent to the downstream process where it undergoes a series of clarification, purification, and concentration steps to remove cellular materials and enrich for virus particles (Fig. 2B). During the upstream and downstream processing, several parameters are monitored to ensure consistency of the quality and quantity of final drug substance. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Current in-process analytics embedded to exert control strategy and monitoring in manufacturing LVVs include initial cell counts and multiplicity of infection (MOI) calculations for virus seeding and subsequently bioreactor monitoring of cells for viability and metabolites (summarized in Fig. 2C). Direct measurement of virus particles is not yet a part of the routine manufacturing workflow and thus a read on virus potency is typically not obtained until generation of final drug substance upon conclusion of downstream processing. Harvest of upstream bioreactors is largely dependent on cell viability alone, leaving some significant process control gaps in confirming efficient infection of cells at the selected MOI and selecting the optimal harvest window at peak virus potency.\n\nBiocapacitance as a PAT for monitoring biomass and",

            "text": "Despite the advances in enzyme engineering, synthetic biology, gene editing, and recently cell-free systems, the limitation to scale-up production and manufacturing remains a significant challenge. Scale-up challenges in fermentation, be it submerged or solid-state, are not new. The technology has been in existence for a long time, but the knowledge base or expertise has been lacking. From a technical perspective, scale-up challenges include process development and optimization by judiciously selecting appropriate growth media, substrates, feedstocks, incubation temperature, and pH, and also considering the complexity of the fermentation process and downstream processing to obtain purified products [101,102]. Although precision fermentation allows for the specific molecule of interest to be produced efficiently, purification strategies can sometimes be still very complex. For many start-ups, feasibility and sustainability studies may not have been conducted a priori, and at the scale-up stage production costs become prohibitive [103]. Furthermore, scale-up facilities such as contract research organizations (CRO) or contract manufacturing organizations (CMO) are still not widely available or accessible. \n\nTo address scale-up challenges in fermentation, Ganeshan et al. [101] recently proposed adopting a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) approach. PHA is essentially taking an approach to fermentation production by applying manufacturing practices widely employed in industrial engineering manufacturing by systematically, comprehensively, and analytically reviewing a process to enable the identification of process and operational hazards and their impacts [104]. In the food industry risk mitigating strategies such as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP), Quality Management Systems (QMS), and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) are already being followed and have been proven to be robust. However, in terms of fermentation, a more holistic approach needs to be followed to mitigate risks at every step of the process.",

The transient viral transfection expression process typically involves constructing a recombinant vector, transforming it into E. coli for purification, introducing the purified vector into Agrobacterium, culturing in selective media, agro-infiltrating the resulting bacterial culture into targeted plant tissues, and finally, purifying and characterizing the recombinant proteins [69]. \n\nPlant expression systems offer advantages in production speed and flexibility for product and process optimization. Utilizing transient expression, plant-manufactured VHHs for medical applications can be produced within a few weeks [69]. However, plant-specific secondary modifications to proteins can increase immunogenicity. Strategies to address this include genetic engineering to promote mammaliantype glycosylation [126] and retaining glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum to block plant-specific glycan attachment [127]. Despite these challenges, plantexpressed Nbs can maintain biological activity even with differences in glycosylation [121]. Another obstacle is the high downstream purification cost [128]. Standard purification involves extraction, chromatographic techniques, and analysis using SDS-PAGE, Western blot, ELISA, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), accounting for approximately 80% of the total process cost [69]. Strategies such as antibody recycling and producing less processed oral therapeutics are being explored to reduce costs.",

            "text": "Furthermore, changing manufacturing platforms often involves new or different manufacturing capacities, technical process transfers, and the need for significant comparability work, all of which potentially come with a set of challenges not experienced when utilizing the same process from research grade through commercial supply of cGMP vector manufacture. Transient transfection-based AAV manufacturing is sometimes questioned as a viable approach for commercial supply; however our platform has resulted in consistent VG productivity across scale up at 50-L, 500-L, and 2000-L scale (Figure S6). The consistency demonstrated in up to 2000-L bioreactors provides evidence that transfection is in fact a viable approach for commercial supply and will allow for expansion into indications with larger patient populations. Therefore, spending resources on plasmid-based developments for improving productivity and product quality is a practical investment as outcomes like the pOXB dualplasmid system can be incorporated into all stages of vector development in the manufacturing process resulting in continuity throughout the product life cycle. \n\nPlasmids represent one of the most expensive raw materials of a transfection-based AAV manufacturing platform; therefore there is a clear advantage to a two-plasmid system in reduced cost of goods to produce two plasmids rather than three. While all dual-plasmid designs offer this benefit, only the pOXB dual-plasmid design provides the additional advantage of improved productivity and vector quality. The pOXB dual transfection resulted in as much as a 222% increase in productivity across seven unique genomes when compared with triple transfection under identical process conditions. In combination with other process improvements, the pOXB dual system has enabled bioreactor crude lysate titers >1 x 10 15 VG/L. 16 The pOXB dual-plasmid transfection also generated a higher proportion of full vectors directly out of the bioreactor than any other dual or triple transfection. This bioreactor increase is also translated downstream, resulting in fewer empty capsids present in the final vector formulation.",

            "text": "The rapidly expanding global market for all types of bioreactors for cell products makes it a highly lucrative field of science and technology that attracts major investments to accelerate the development of improved manufacturing practices. In recent years, the development of automated and semi-automated bioreactor systems has advanced rapidly to enhance the affordability, efficacy, and quality of various cell products. Expanding the scope of available technological solutions will allow for the manufacturing of a wide range of therapeutic cell products, including CAR-T cells, TILs, DCs, and NK cells (both autologous and allogeneic). \n\nThe fast-ever-growing field of immuno-oncology and customized cell therapies requires academic research and clinical facilities to accelerate the development to cover the unmet market needs [47]. However, the scaling up of the cell therapy industry is expected to result in a global manufacturing shortage that will mostly affect remote locations which are hard and costly to serve. We believe that the optimal solution to this problem is based on modular GMP-compliant bioprocessing units that will allow optimal allocation of resources and costs. The assembly of such units can be made fully automated to standardize and increase reproducibility of the whole process and reduce the user-associated risks. \n\nFurther advancements in both cell biology and hardware/software engineering will lead to more sophisticated closed automated POC platforms for rapid and cost-effective manufacturing of personalized cell immunotherapies. The POC systems are normally selfsustained and have lower infrastructural requirements which makes them more usable in various clinical settings. Such platforms are capable of regulating nutrient supply, medium exchange and waste removal. They also often include single-use disposable components and wireless sensors that monitor and record data in real-time. \n\nThe challenges that lie ahead of the scientific and biotech community, such as scaling up manufacturing of the cell products, automated monitoring, and sophisticated regulation of the whole process, will lead to the emergence of novel manufacturing platforms. Altogether, this eventually will transform the landscape from single institutions and small hospitals to an extensive and interconnected global network of manufacturing centers that will define the future of T cell therapeutics.",

            "text": "Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are widely used to produce recombinant proteins, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), through various process modes. While fed\u2010batch (FB) processes have been the standard, a shift toward high\u2010density perfusion processes is being driven by increased productivity, flexible facility footprints, and lower costs. Ensuring the clearance of process\u2010related impurities, such as host cell proteins (HCPs), is crucial in biologics manufacturing. Although purification processes remove most impurities, integrated strategies are being developed to enhance clearance of some high\u2010risk HCPs. Current understanding of HCP expression dynamics in cell culture is limited. This study utilized data\u2010independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics to compare the proteomic profiles of cell culture supernatants from 14 FB clones and three perfusion clones, all expressing the same mAb from the same host cell line. Results showed that perfusion processes enhance cell growth and productivity, exhibiting distinct proteomic profiles compared to FB processes. Perfusion processes also maintain a more comparable HCP abundance profile across clones, especially for 46 problematic HCPs monitored. Cluster analysis of FB proteomics revealed distinct abundance patterns and correlations with process parameters. Differential abundance analysis identified significant protein differences between the two processes. This is the first extensive study characterizing HCPs expressed by clones under different process modes. Further research could lead to strategies for preventing or managing problematic HCPs in biologics manufacturing.",

            "text": "simhan, 2020;Banner et al., 2021;Wasalathanthri et al., 2021).\n\nToday, the industry standard for proteins production, such as monoclonal antibodies, is a fed-batch process (Chen et al., 2018;Ha et al., 2022). However, the productivity of such a process can be significantly improved by implementing a continuous culture strategy to intensify the volumetric productivity. Such approach can lead to an increase up to 10-fold of space-time yields, therefore leading to a reduction of production time by 30% (M\u00fcller et al., 2022). These improvements enable opportunity for much smaller facilities with similar or larger productivity outputs, limiting the capital investment (for facilities and raw material costs) and providing manufacturing flexibility and sustainability (Bielser et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2018;M\u00fcller et al., 2022).\n\nSuch transition from traditional (fed)-batch to continuous manufacturing is facilitated by the emergence of various technological enablers (Rathore et al., 2022) and is encouraged by health authorities (i.e., US Food and Drug Administration). However, the adoption is relatively slow as many challenges remain. Indeed, scale-down models, decisional tools, equipment and procedures currently in place, in most companies, have been developed for fed-batch processes and cannot be transposed without significant changes (Chen et al., 2018). Therefore, this transition might be seeming a high cost and time demand investment to modify existing process development protocols (Papathanasiou et al., 2017;Bielser et al., 2018;M\u00fcller et al., 2022). In this context, advanced computational tools could be used to elucidate changes in process dynamics and assess the influence of varying operating scenarios. These in-silico tools provide testing platforms for early determination of process bottlenecks at minimum experimental costs and enable the design of advanced optimization strategies that will lead to optimal and stable operation (Papathanasiou et al., 2017;Rathore et al., 2022).\n\nWhile this burden for digital transition and technology transfer has been observed in the past (and successfully overcome) in other industry sector (e.g., petrochemical companies, aeronautics), biopharma faces the",

In this review we will thus mainly discuss the application of ML in bioprocess development, particularly in upstream processes. ML is also advancing in downstream processing, where corresponding techniques are developed for specific technologies such as chromatography [26][27][28][29][30][31], but also for complex purification pipelines of specific products such as antibodies [32] or inclusion bodies [33]. Since available literature is highly diverse and vast enough to be covered in a separate review, ML for downstream processing is not discussed in detail here. \n\nWhere possible, ML trends in commercial bioprocesses, e.g. for Process Analytical Technology (PAT), digital twins or model predictive control (MPC), are included. \n\nOverall, four main topics are addressed: \n\n1. strain selection and engineering 2. bioprocess optimization 3. scale-up of bioprocesses 4. process monitoring and control. \n\nFor each area, we shed light on methodological milestones of the past years that push ML forward. Furthermore, we discuss potentials and challenges for future usage and improvement of ML tools. This leads to an overall discussion about ML as an enabling technology for bioprocess development.",

            "text": "It was focused on the optimization of the differentiation, harvesting and purification portions of this bioprocess, which sought to produce between 10 14 and 10 15 cardiomyocytes per year for regenerative medicine applications. The model was developed by combining biomechatronic analysis with a computer-aided design approach. Four distinct bioreactor configurations, along with planar technologies, were evaluated for differentiation, while eight techniques were examined for harvesting and purification. When it comes to differentiating hiPSCs into cardiomyocytes, wave bioreactors were found to be the most ideal technology. In terms of harvesting and purifying the produced cardiomyocytes, a combination of density gradient centrifugation, filtration and aqueous two-phase system separation was determined to be optimal. The reduced capital investment and operating cost of the chosen technologies were the main reasons for them being perceived as advantageous in comparison to the other technologies which were evaluated. Based on these results, a detailed bioprocess was designed using a computer-aided design software and it was estimated that its payback period would be 4.7 years. \n\nHassan et al. further developed the BEM published by Simaria et al., once again simulating the large-scale expansion of allogeneic MSCs for the same range of production scales [44]. However, this time focus was not placed on cell expansion technologies but rather on downstream processing and fill finish technologies. Different sizes of tangential flow filtration (TFF) and fluidized bed centrifugation (FBC) systems were evaluated for downstream processing, along with vial filling technologies with distinct filling capacities for fill finish. The expanded model identified the optimal downstream processing and vial filling technology for each production scale. To accomplish this the cost of all of the potential technology configurations was calculated and the one which was capable of fulfilling the specified production target while minimizing the CoG was selected. It was found that TFF is more cost-effective for small to intermediate production scales while FBC becomes the only option for larger production scales. Furthermore, a lack of downstream processing technologies appropriate for the largest production scales was clearly identified, indicating that further improvement of the existing technologies was required, coupled with better process logistics, such as staggered upstream processing.",

The differences between the 15-mL Ambr and 2-L bioreactor transfection settings might be due to the differences in how NPs are mixed with the cell culture through liquid handling across scales, as well as differences in the modality used for medium exchange (materials and methods), which might have altered the cellular uptake efficiency. In assessment of impurities, the 5-L lot NPs did not generate a different level of host cell protein (Figure 5I), or genetic DNA (gDNA, Figure 5J) compared with the control. The gDNA concentration represents the amount of HEK293T genome DNA present in the cell culture after centrifugation and is a standard quality attribute as part of process control at each step to ensure that the final impurity level meets the process criteria. While an increase in residual pDNA (from the transfection particles) (Figure 5K) to 6.0 \u00c2 10 6 copies/mL from the control level of 1.2 \u00c2 10 6 copies/mL was observed in the 5-L lot NP group, this impurity level was within the typical range that other process changes such as transfection scale, timing, and modality could generate. During the LVV manufacturing process, the downstream purification steps to generate the final LVV product typically reduce such impurity by one to two magnitudes, and the elevated residual pDNA level in this study is still within the typical purification capability. However, further optimization in the cell culture and transfection processes are warranted to further decrease the amount of harvest impurities. These results in general validated the performances of scale-up produced 400-nm pDNA/PEIpro NPs in an industrial setting of LVV productions.",

But for CBM, tissue production needs to be This manuscript is submitted to ASTM 'Smart and Sustainable Manufacturing' journal inexpensive and manufactured at a much larger scale compared to the aforementioned approaches for its affordability as a consumer food product. For comparison, the cost of organs cultured with biomedical tissue engineering methods justifies the expensive cell lines and culture media but for CBM production, the cost needs to be comparable to conventional meat [20], and therefore, needs to be orders of magnitude lower. On the other hand, even large-scale tissue culturing methods for therapeutic purposes result in the final culture comprising of ~10 6 -10 9 cells [21] contained in ~5L bioreactor [22] for clinical scale but for CBM, the final culture needs to comprise of ~10 15 cells (with ~10 12 cells/kg) housed in a ~10000-liter bioreactor [23]. In addition to that, the resulting CBM should be similar or superior to conventional meat in sensorial and nutritional aspects [24]. Therefore, the manufacturing of CBM needs to overcome numerous serious scientific and manufacturing challenges. These challenges can be broadly classified [25] into four categories (see Figure 3  b. Culture Media: The growth and differentiation are also controlled by cell culture media used at various stages of manufacturing. The medium needs to be optimized with required nutrients and growth factors at each stage for the cell line used and its cost needs to be lowered with manufacturing processes for its components being suitably modified following economies of scale [26]. For this, and for reproducibility, the culture media also needs to be serum-free i.e., it should not contain Fetal Bovine Serum, Horse Serum, or any other living animal-derived component [27]. c. Bioreactors: For bioreactors, two key challenges for research and innovation are addressing nutrient transport and mixing limitations and sterilization. Addressing the first challenge involves the design of bioreactors such that no significant gradients in nutrient and oxygen concentrations exist throughout the volume at each stage and this homogeneity needs to be achieved without increasing the shear rates for agitation which may cause cell death.",

In this context, the use of novel membrane systems such as the TFDF from Repligen with large lumen sizes could be an interesting approach for future investigations. \n\nFinally, selective replication, OV spreading and lysis of cancer cells are attributes that need to be considered for production of OVs. \n\nThis was assessed through a potency assay (EMA, 2009). The scope of the potency measurement was to determine whether cultivation at HCD affected the ability of the virus to induce oncolysis. As crude harvests produced at HCD contain more contaminants (proteins, DNA etc.) than crude material produced in batch culture which are likely to interfere with infectivity and thus potency, increased potency values after purification can be expected. Therefore, a comparison between crude harvest and purified material harvested from the second perfusion cultivation in BHK-21 was carried out and included in the measurement. For a fair comparison, purified material should be used for all perfusion samples, however this was outside of the scope of this study. As demonstrated, for all cell lines, the rVSV-NDV material produced in perfusion mode and at HCD (with and without syncytia formation) was able to induce adequate oncolysis. \n\nCompared to material produced in batch mode, the oncolytic potency of material produced in AGE1.CR cells was slightly reduced. \n\nPurification via sucrose-gradient led to a greater increase in potency for material produced in perfusion mode compared to batch mode. \n\nIn conclusion, evaluation of a series of process conditions in semiperfusion shake flask and STR batch cultures led to successful implementation of a scalable perfusion HCD process for all three candidate cell lines. This enabled production of rVSV-NDV above 10 11 infectious virus particles. Using an acoustic settler, the direct harvesting of rVSV-NDV will allow for a seamless integration into downstream processing trains.",

Upstream processing of eukaryotic cultures is a demanding task, considering that it requires expensive culture broth and its recycling is unachievable. Chromatographic protein A resin, required to capture primarily the monoclonal antibodies from the culture broth, represents an unavoidable, costly resource process step, one that requires disposal and replacement protocols after 30 cycles of use. Chromatographic resins in the  8a and b demonstrate the respective contribution of each stage to the overall capital investment and raw material consumption of the IVT mRNA-based vaccine production processes.

            "text": "The biomanufacture of therapeutic proteins commonly begins with the development of a cell substrate that synthesizes a protein of interest, and a bioprocessing strategy that can consistently manufacture the recombinant protein at the desired quantity and quality. To establish a model laboratory scale biomanufacturing system for investigating manufacturing and product quality-related questions, the AChE-Fc fusion protein was selected as a model fusion protein to generate evidence that will support the development and advancement of new clinical countermeasures against OP toxicity (Figure 1a). 20 CHO cells are the most commonly used host cell line for the biomanufacture of therapeutic proteins. 21 Therefore, CHO S cells that stably express AChE-Fc (CHO AChE-Fc ) and AChE(W86A)-Fc (CHO AChE(W86A)-Fc ) were generated and subjected to single cell cloning to further support the commercial relevance of this model biotechnology system. 22 A single mammalian colony was selected and cultivated to generate the AChE-Fc (CHO AChE-Fc ) and AChE(W86A)-Fc (CHO AChE(W86A)-Fc ) master cell banks for biomanufacturing the AChE fusion proteins. \n\nAt least four bioprocessing campaigns per AChE fusion protein were monitored for variability in the cell viability, viable cell density, and productivity during the upstream process and the total protein recovery during the downstream process. The CHO AChE-Fc and CHO AChE(W86A)-Fc had a >94% cell viability throughout the duration of the campaigns with a maximum viable cell density greater than 10 million cells/mL on harvest day (Figure 1b and Table S1). Production of the AChE fusion proteins gradually increased throughout the campaigns until reaching 4.2 \u00b1 0.1 mg/L for the CHO AChE-Fc and 3.2 \u00b1 0.4 mg/L for the CHO AChE(W86A)-Fc (Figures 1b and S1a). The downstream process performed had two sequential chromatography steps that yielded $36.5% AChE fusion protein recovery from the harvest media (Table S2). \n\nPurity is a critical quality attribute for therapeutic proteins that is determined using a series of different analytical procedures that characterize different impurities due to their potential impact on drug product quality, safety, and efficacy. 23",

            "text": "In the present work, we present a method for improving antibody titer and manufacturability in the XpressCF+ \u00ae system. We have engineered a cell line with an oxidizing cytoplasm capable of LC expression at the 3-9-g/L scale. Prefabricated LC protein was then added as a protein reagent to CFPS reactions expressing the antibody HC, and a 50-100% increase in titer was observed relative to CFPS reactions co-expressing both the HC and LC antibody subunits. The primary mechanism for this titer increase is believed to be through the reallocation of the CFPS translation machinery to focus on HC production. This method was validated for five antibodies and demonstrated at scales from a 100-\u00b5L microplate to a 0.25-L stirred tank bioreactor. Antibodies produced in CFPS using PFLC were indistinguishable from those produced using HC/LC co-expression by both biophysical and functional assays. This approach combines the strength of in vivo E. coli expression (inexpensive manufacturing of recombinant proteins with high titer) with cell-free protein synthesis (an environment capable of incorporating multiple nnAAs in properly folded and assembled IgGs). The benefits of this system are numerous; the PFLC reagent increases titers, streamlines the CFPS workflow, and makes the CFPS reactions more robust when compared to the conventional HC/LC co-expression approach. Development of the hybrid PFLC cell-free platform described in this work improves the competitiveness of cell-free manufacturing for site-specific ADCs, allowing patients expanded access to these promising new molecules.",

            "text": "Process intensification efforts have renewed interest in the potential of end\u2010to\u2010end continuous manufacture with column\u2010free capture alternatives. This article describes a decisional tool that encompasses mass balance and design equations, process economics, stochastic simulation and multi\u2010criteria decision\u2010making and enables the evaluation of different batch, and continuous flowsheets for monoclonal antibody (mAb) manufacture. The traditional batch process was compared with end\u2010to\u2010end continuous bioprocesses with either protein A capture or column\u2010free capture employing aqueous two\u2010phase extraction or precipitation from economic, environmental, and robustness perspectives. The cost of goods analysis predicted that continuous flowsheets could offer substantial cost savings (~20%\u201340%) over the batch process at low and medium annual commercial demands (100\u2013500\u2009kg); however, at tonnage demands they resulted in either comparable or higher costs. Comparing the continuous options, the continuous flowsheets with protein A or precipitation yielded similar COG/g values, while aqueous two\u2010phase extraction presented higher costs. The analysis of overall process mass intensities accounting for water and consumables suggested that the continuous flowsheet with protein A would result in the lowest environmental burden. When the economic, environmental, and operational criteria were reconciled using multi\u2010criteria decision\u2010making analysis, the continuous protein A\u2010based flowsheet was found to be the most favorable. A target analysis highlighted the need for process improvements in the following parameters to reduce the manufacturing costs of the continuous column\u2010free capture options below that of protein A: the perfusion volumetric productivity, the harvested cell culture fluid percentage in column\u2010free operations, the column\u2010free step yields along with the implementation of buffer concentrates.",

            "text": "stringent purity requirements make the downstream processing more challenging. [8] e current benchmark for the purification of ONs is represented by liquid chromatography, due to its high resolution, versatility, and ease of scale up. [11] The main downside of \"center-cut\" batch chromatographic purifications is an intrinsic purity-yield trade-off. This trade-off exists for most single column operations in the downstream processing of biomolecules. One option to increase yield and purity simultaneously is to reduce the loading of the column to help resolve the product from impurities. However, this comes at the expense of higher eluent consumption, poorer resin utilization, and lower process throughput. \n\nOn the other side, Multicolumn Countercurrent Solvent Gradient Purification (MCSGP) is an effective and practical means to overcome the yield-purity trade-off for different biomolecules, including peptides [12,13] monoclonal antibodies [14][15][16] and PEGylated proteins [17][18][19] Over the past years, the twin-column embodiment of this continuous chromatography technology has become predominant. \n\nThe interested reader is referred to the literature [20][21][22] and to the Supporting Information for a detailed description of MCSGP, with Figure S1 showing the different steps of the process. \n\nWhile MCSGP has great potential to improve process efficiency, it also provides some new process development challenges because it runs in a semi-automated repetitive manner in a cyclic steady state. \n\nTherefore, process robustness is crucial to ensure consistent product quality. In addition, the disturbances that may be introduced over time by alterations in feed quality, column aging and fluctuations in the process parameters need to be promptly compensated.",

            "text": "Notably, other research supports these cost advantages, stating that when compared to Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell-based production, where operational costs were estimated at $65 M/year or $260/g of purified antibody, plant-based production was estimated at $33 M/year or $131/g of purified antibody, representing a potential 50% reduction, 51 which similarity to Nandi et al. findings. 46 Moreover, conventional mammalian cell culture incurred downstream processing costs of approximately $232/g of purified antibody, whereas the plant-based system's cost was approximately $99/g, demonstrating a > 50% reduction in manufacturing costs. 52 These findings further highlight the significant cost-effectiveness of plant-based expression systems for antibody production. \n\nPlant expression platforms have been used to successfully produce a wide variety of mAbs, including those targeting RSV. Palivizumab 53,54 has been produced in plants and showed promising results in preclinical studies. In vivo protection in RSV challenge studies conducted in the cotton rat model demonstrated similar protection of plant-produced compared to mammalian-produced palivizumab. 53 These findings highlight the potential of plant expression platforms for the efficient and effective production of therapeutic antibodies. In fact, studies have shown that plant-produced palivizumab has a serum pharmacokinetic profile similar to mammalian-derived palivizumab, suggesting that different expression systems have minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics. 53 Furthermore, to reduce plantspecific complex N-glycan modifications, we utilized an ER retention signal, which effectively reduces plant-specific N-glycans and promotes the formation of high-mannose type N-glycans (Figure 4). Notably, other studies also support the effectiveness of this approach. Loos et al. 55 found that a KDELtagged anti-HIV antibody (2G12) was deposited in protein storage vacuoles, bypassing the Golgi apparatus and carrying mainly high-mannose N-glycans. 55",

The next stage of the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals relies on downstream processing, during which, through a series of multiple steps, the biopharmaceutical is isolated and purified (Conner et al., 2014;Jozala et al., 2016;Hong et al., 2018;Tavares et al., 2019). The initial recovery of the target compound depends on the cellular localization of the biomolecule; for instance in the cases where the target compound is produced extracellularly, the clarified broth is concentrated by ultrafiltration and then purified, whereas when it is produced intracellularly, the cell is subjected to lysis after harvesting, and then clarified to remove the resultant cell debris (Jozala et al., 2016). The second step in the downstream processing corresponds to the purification of the target biomolecule, during which all impurities related to the cell (e.g., DNA and host cell proteins), the process (e.g., antifoam agents, leached ligands, and buffers), or the impurities associated to the product (fragments, clipped species, and aggregates) are removed (Azevedo et al., 2009;Conner et al., 2014;Rathore and Kapoor, 2015;Jozala et al., 2016). During this step, several techniques can be employed, such as chromatography, filtration, diafiltration, tangential flow filtration, as well as the use of aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) (Azevedo et al., 2009;Conner et al., 2014;Jozala et al., 2016;Hong et al., 2018;Tavares et al., 2019).",

The present report describes how the first kilograms of monoclonal antibody were produced with equipment originally designed for batch operations while using continuous manufacturing processes and principles. Project timelines for the delivery of clinical material have driven this ambition and helped the transition. Nevertheless, because of equipment availability, a tradeoff between the envisaged continuous downstream process (cDSP) operations and the ones described in this article had to be taken. A total of 2.1\u2009kg of monoclonal antibody were produced in two GMP runs for clinical trials. For USP, a 200\u2010L single\u2010use pilot scale bioreactor was upgraded to enable perfusion operation. DSP steps were designed to be easily transferable to cDSP for later clinical or commercial productions. An in\u2010line conditioning buffer preparation strategy was tested in a discontinuous way to prove its efficiency and the purification cascade was structured in parallel to the continuous collection of antibody\u2010containing cell culture supernatant. This strategy will avoid any process change when later moving to the continuous equipment that is currently under qualification. Alignment between small\u2010scale references runs and the GMP runs in terms of productivity and quality confirmed that the presented approach was valid. Thus, we demonstrate that existing fed\u2010batch infrastructure can be adapted to continuous manufacturing without significant additional investments. Such approach is useful to evaluate next\u2010generation manufacturing processes before making large investments.",

Nevertheless, because of equipment availability, a tradeoff between the envisaged continuous downstream process (cDSP) operations and the ones described in this article had to be taken. A total of 2.1\u2009kg of monoclonal antibody were produced in two GMP runs for clinical trials. For USP, a 200\u2010L single\u2010use pilot scale bioreactor was upgraded to enable perfusion operation. DSP steps were designed to be easily transferable to cDSP for later clinical or commercial productions. An in\u2010line conditioning buffer preparation strategy was tested in a discontinuous way to prove its efficiency and the purification cascade was structured in parallel to the continuous collection of antibody\u2010containing cell culture supernatant. This strategy will avoid any process change when later moving to the continuous equipment that is currently under qualification. Alignment between small\u2010scale references runs and the GMP runs in terms of productivity and quality confirmed that the presented approach was valid. Thus, we demonstrate that existing fed\u2010batch infrastructure can be adapted to continuous manufacturing without significant additional investments. Such approach is useful to evaluate next\u2010generation manufacturing processes before making large investments.",

Raab et al. developed a cell line through genetic engineering by a novel bottom-up microRNA (miRNA) screening approach for optimizing the production and secretion of therapeutic antibodies (Raab et al., 2021). At present, the expression level and quality control of recombinant antibodies has always been one of the important bottlenecks restricting the development of antibody drugs...Under different process conditions, the differences in the yield of recombinant antibodies by the production cell lines can be analyzed from the levels of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, laying a solid foundation for large-scale cell culture processes. In the future, the large-scale production of recombinant antibodies and development of culture processes will develop rapidly in the direction of stabilizing production capacity and improving quality. Furthermore, big data and multi-omics technologies are also beneficial to provide new research directions, more and more process analytical technologies are applied to cell culture processes, which will provide more ideas for improving the efficiency of recombinant antibodies.",

However, the high product titers, along with the concomitant increase in host cell proteins (HCP) and other impurities [6,7] often challenge the efficiency of traditional purification methods, resulting in a shift in the manufacturing costs from upstream processing towards downstream processing [2][3][4].

The production of therapeutic proteins for treating diseases at large scale for millions of individuals is one of the essential needs of mankind. Recent progress in the area of recombinant DNA technologies has paved the way to producing recombinant proteins that can be used as therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic reagents. Recombinant proteins for these applications are mainly produced using prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression host systems such as mammalian cells, bacteria, yeast, insect cells, and transgenic plants at laboratory scale as well as in large-scale settings. The development of efficient bioprocessing strategies is crucial for industrial production of recombinant proteins of therapeutic and prophylactic importance. Recently, advances have been made in the various areas of bioprocessing and are being utilized to develop effective processes for producing recombinant proteins. These include the use of high-throughput devices for effective bioprocess optimization and of disposable systems, continuous upstream processing, continuous chromatography, integrated continuous bioprocessing, Quality by Design, and process analytical technologies to achieve quality product with higher yield. This review summarizes recent developments in the bioprocessing of recombinant proteins, including in various expression systems, bioprocess development, and the upstream and downstream processing of recombinant proteins.",

A \u201cplug\u2010and\u2010play\u201d approach is applied to both platforms at bench scale, using commercially available basal and feed media, a standard feed strategy for fed\u2010batch and ATF filtration for perfusion. Product concentration in fed\u2010batch is 2.5 times greater than perfusion, while average productivity in perfusion is 7.5 times greater than fed\u2010batch. PCA reveals more variability in the cell environment and metabolism during the fed\u2010batch run. LDH measurements show that exposure of product to cell lysate is 7\u201310 times greater in fed\u2010batch. Product analysis shows larger abundances of neutral species in perfusion, likely due to decreased bioreactor residence times and extracellular exposure. The IgG1 perfusion product also has higher purity and lower half\u2010antibody. Glycosylation is similar across both culture modes. The first perfusion harvest slice for both product types shows different glycosylation than subsequent harvests, suggesting that product quality lags behind metabolism. In conclusion, process and product data indicate that intra\u2010lot heterogeneity is decreased in perfusion cultures. Additional data and discussion is required to understand the developmental, clinical and commercial implications, and in what situations increased uniformity would be beneficial."

This paper presents a theoretical and practical approach for designing a periodic counter-current chromatography (PCC) operation as a continuous capture purification step that is integrated with a perfusion cell culture process. The constraints for continuous and optimal PCC operation govern the selection of residence time and number of columns. The flexibility available in PCC design for selection of these parameters is dictated by the binding characteristics of the target protein on the capture resin. Using an empirical model for the protein breakthrough curve, analytical solutions to determine these conditions were derived and verified with experimental results for three different proteins: two relatively unstable proteins (recombinant enzymes) and a relatively stable protein (monoclonal antibody). The advantages of a continuous downstream capture step are highlighted for the three case studies in comparison with the existing batch chromatography processes. The use of PCC leads to improvements in process economics due to higher resin capacity utilization and correspondingly lower buffer consumption. Furthermore, integrated and continuous bioprocessing results in a smaller facility footprint by elimination of harvest hold vessels and clarification, as well as by reducing the capture column size by one to two orders of magnitude."

While the first two have been thoroughly addressed for the scale\u2010up of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture knowing that a wide tolerable agitation range with non\u2010damaging energy dissipation exists and the use of shear protectants like Pluronic F68 guard against cell damage caused by bubble burst, GEV remains a potential scale\u2010up problem across scales for the drilled hole or open pipe sparger designs. GEV as high as 170\u2009m/s due to high gas flow rates and relatively small sparger hole diameters was observed to be significantly detrimental to cell culture performance in a 12,000\u2009L bioreactor when compared to a satellite 2\u2009L bioreactor run with GEV of <1\u2009m/s. Small scale study of GEV as high as 265\u2009m/s confirmed this. Based on the results of this study, a critical GEV of >60\u2009m/s for CHO cells is proposed, whereas previously 30\u2009m/s has been reported for NS0 cells by Zhu, Cuenca, Zhou, and Varma (2008. Biotechnol. Bioeng., 101, 751\u2013760). Implementation of new large scale spargers with larger diameter and more holes lowered GEV and helped improve the cell culture performance, closing the scale\u2010up gap. Design of such new spargers was even more critical when hole plugging was discovered during large scale cultivation hence exacerbating the GEV impact. Furthermore, development of a scale down model based on mimicry of the large scale GEV profile as a function of time was proven to be beneficial for reproducing large scale results."

This transition from batch to continuous is expected to offer several advantages which, taken together, could significantly improve access to biologics drugs for patients. Despite this recent momentum, there has not been a commercial implementation of a continuous bioprocess reported in the literature. In this study, we describe a successful pilot\u2010scale proof\u2010of\u2010concept demonstration of an end\u2010to\u2010end integrated and continuous bioprocess for the production of a monoclonal antibody (mAb). This process incorporated all of the key unit operations found in a typical mAb production process, including the final steps of virus removal filtration, ultrafiltration, diafiltration, and formulation. The end\u2010to\u2010end integrated process was operated for a total of 25\u2009days and produced a total of 4.9\u2009kg (200\u2009g/day or 2\u2009g/L BRX/day) of the drug substance from a 100\u2010L perfusion bioreactor (BRX) with acceptable product quality and minimal operator intervention.

                "tldr": "Recombinant antibody manufacturing is a complex bioprocess that produces therapeutic monoclonal antibodies through mammalian cell culture systems. The manufacturing process is divided into upstream (cell culture and production) and downstream (purification) operations, each with unique technical challenges that must be overcome for efficient large-scale production. (LLM Memory)",
                "text": "\nRecombinant antibody manufacturing involves the production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) using genetically engineered cell lines, predominantly mammalian cells like Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. These therapeutic proteins represent one of the fastest-growing segments of the biopharmaceutical industry, with applications ranging from cancer treatment to autoimmune diseases. The manufacturing process can be divided into two main phases: upstream processing and downstream processing.\n\nUpstream processing encompasses cell line development, cell culture expansion, and production phases where the engineered cells express the target antibody. This typically involves growing cells in bioreactors under carefully controlled conditions (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrient availability) to maximize antibody yield and quality. Traditional batch or fed-batch culture methods are common, though perfusion systems are gaining popularity for their increased productivity.\n\nDownstream processing involves the separation and purification of the antibody from the cell culture fluid through multiple steps including clarification (removal of cells and debris), capture chromatography (typically using Protein A affinity), viral inactivation/removal, polishing chromatography steps, and final formulation. This purification train aims to achieve high purity (>99%) while maintaining the structural integrity and biological activity of the antibody.\n\nAs the demand for therapeutic antibodies continues to grow, manufacturers face increasing pressure to develop more efficient, cost-effective, and scalable production methods while maintaining strict quality standards and regulatory compliance. The technical challenges in both upstream and downstream processes represent significant areas for innovation in bioprocessing technology. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                "text": "\nScaling up cell culture processes from laboratory to commercial production represents one of the most critical challenges in recombinant antibody manufacturing. The transition between scales is complicated by numerous engineering variables that cannot be simultaneously maintained across different bioreactor sizes. As Alavijeh et al. note, scale-up is complex due to interactions among \"engineering scale-dependent variables, scale-independent variables, and cell-related variables, along with unknown reaction kinetics and nonlinear and dynamic behaviors\" <Paper corpusId=\"268571307\" paperTitle=\"(Alavijeh et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. These scale-dependent factors significantly alter flow patterns and mixing regimes, creating different microenvironments within the bioreactor that affect cell performance.\n\nDespite extensive research, no universal solution exists to overcome process challenges in scaling up monoclonal antibody production. Approaches based on maintaining single parameters (such as equal power densities or tip speeds) between scales often fail because other critical parameters inevitably change <Paper corpusId=\"268571307\" paperTitle=\"(Alavijeh et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. One example is gas entrance velocity (GEV), which can reach damaging levels of >60 m/s for CHO cells in large-scale bioreactors, significantly impairing culture performance compared to small-scale operations <Paper corpusId=\"268571307\" paperTitle=\"(Alavijeh et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"211246655\" paperTitle=\"(Chaudhary et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMammalian cell culture presents inherent challenges for manufacturability and scalability due to \"medium complexity, serum requirement, low yield, and shear sensitivity\" <Paper corpusId=\"250600133\" paperTitle=\"(Bourguignon et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Commercial production in 5-20 m\u00b3 bioreactors faces additional challenges related to \"product and process quality, such as demands for higher productivity, glycosylation control, reproducibility, as well as other process controls\" <Paper corpusId=\"250600133\" paperTitle=\"(Bourguignon et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. These issues stem largely from temporal and spatial variability of conditions within large bioreactors.\n\nAs processes are intensified to increase productivity, oxygen transfer becomes a major limitation. Traditional fed-batch processes with lower cell densities had modest oxygen requirements, but the shift toward continuous perfusion modes with higher biomass concentrations creates significant oxygen transfer challenges <Paper corpusId=\"269221231\" paperTitle=\"(Ott et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This intensification requires bioreactor systems capable of delivering much higher volumetric mass transfer coefficients (kLa values).\n\nBeyond physical parameters, expression level and quality control of recombinant antibodies remain \"important bottlenecks restricting the development of antibody drugs\" <Paper corpusId=\"247223302\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Cell line variability and metabolic changes under different process conditions lead to inconsistent antibody yields and quality attributes, requiring sophisticated analytical approaches to understand and control the production process.",

                            "There are three main potential sources for cell shear damage existing in stirred tank bioreactors. One is the potential high energy dissipation in the immediate impeller zones; another from small gas bubble burst; and third is from high gas entrance velocity (GEV) emitting from the sparger. While the first two have been thoroughly addressed for the scale\u2010up of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture knowing that a wide tolerable agitation range with non\u2010damaging energy dissipation exists and the use of shear protectants like Pluronic F68 guard against cell damage caused by bubble burst, GEV remains a potential scale\u2010up problem across scales for the drilled hole or open pipe sparger designs. GEV as high as 170\u2009m/s due to high gas flow rates and relatively small sparger hole diameters was observed to be significantly detrimental to cell culture performance in a 12,000\u2009L bioreactor when compared to a satellite 2\u2009L bioreactor run with GEV of <1\u2009m/s. Small scale study of GEV as high as 265\u2009m/s confirmed this. Based on the results of this study, a critical GEV of >60\u2009m/s for CHO cells is proposed, whereas previously 30\u2009m/s has been reported for NS0 cells by Zhu, Cuenca, Zhou, and Varma (2008. Biotechnol. Bioeng., 101, 751\u2013760). Implementation of new large scale spargers with larger diameter and more holes lowered GEV and helped improve the cell culture performance, closing the scale\u2010up gap. Design of such new spargers was even more critical when hole plugging was discovered during large scale cultivation hence exacerbating the GEV impact. Furthermore, development of a scale down model based on mimicry of the large scale GEV profile as a function of time was proven to be beneficial for reproducing large scale results."

The commercial production of mAbs and other biotherapeutic products is currently based on synthesis in 5 to 20 m 3 bioreactor tanks with mammalian cells by shaking suspension culture operated in a fed-batch or perfusion mode (Gilbert et al., 2013)(Hilal-Alnaqbi et al., 2013)(Kshirsagar et al., 2012). The commercial production of mAbs in stirred tanks faces challenges related to product and process quality, such as demands for higher productivity, glycosylation control, reproducibility, as well as other process controls (Gilbert et al., 2013)(Kshirsagar et al., 2012)(Abu-Absi et al., 2010). Most of these challenges are related to the great temporal and spatial variability of the intrinsic conditions of the fermenters. One way to improve the understanding and control of mAb production in bioreactors is to downscale the system through miniaturization in the form of microfluidic devices (Abaci et al., 2011)."

The complex metabolic network of production cells and production mechanism of recombinant antibodies have gradually become clear. Raab et al. developed a cell line through genetic engineering by a novel bottom-up microRNA (miRNA) screening approach for optimizing the production and secretion of therapeutic antibodies (Raab et al., 2021). At present, the expression level and quality control of recombinant antibodies has always been one of the important bottlenecks restricting the development of antibody drugs",

In the future, the large-scale production of recombinant antibodies and development of culture processes will develop rapidly in the direction of stabilizing production capacity and improving quality. Furthermore, big data and multi-omics technologies are also beneficial to provide new research directions, more and more process analytical technologies are applied to cell culture processes, which will provide more ideas for improving the efficiency of recombinant antibodies."

A \"plug\u2010and\u2010play\" approach is applied to both platforms at bench scale, using commercially available basal and feed media, a standard feed strategy for fed\u2010batch and ATF filtration for perfusion. Product concentration in fed\u2010batch is 2.5 times greater than perfusion, while average productivity in perfusion is 7.5 times greater than fed\u2010batch. PCA reveals more variability in the cell environment and metabolism during the fed\u2010batch run. LDH measurements show that exposure of product to cell lysate is 7\u201310 times greater in fed\u2010batch. Product analysis shows larger abundances of neutral species in perfusion, likely due to decreased bioreactor residence times and extracellular exposure. The IgG1 perfusion product also has higher purity and lower half\u2010antibody. Glycosylation is similar across both culture modes. The first perfusion harvest slice for both product types shows different glycosylation than subsequent harvests, suggesting that product quality lags behind metabolism. In conclusion, process and product data indicate that intra\u2010lot heterogeneity is decreased in perfusion cultures. Additional data and discussion is required to understand the developmental, clinical and commercial implications, and in what situations increased uniformity would be beneficial."

                            "The upstream process involves fermentation of starting material, which, in most cases, is generated based on cell bank derivation and characterization guidelines (ICH Q5D [19]). The objective of upstream process development is to increase product yield and expression rate while maintaining quality by evaluating and optimizing cell metabolism and fermentation process conditions (Gernaey et al., 2010). This is typically done using a scale-down approach, where the impact of commercial-scale dynamic conditions on cell metabolism is studied in laboratory setups and the information is used for scale-up optimization and validation (Enfors et al., 2001). Downstream process development, with chromatography as the main step, aims to achieve a target purification level and involves evaluation of optimal resin type, buffer conditions that allow optimal binding of proteins to resins, optimal elution conditions, and process robustness (Nfor et al., 2008). The design space is typically explored using empirical approaches involving laboratory experiments (Baumann et al., 2015)",
                            "The scale-down experimentation approach (for both upstream and downstream processes) enables the use of advanced high-throughput experimentation (HTE) methods to screen a larger number of process parameters using design of experiments (DoE) and response surface model (Harms et al., 2008)(Long et al., 2014). However, this approach requires significant experimental efforts, offers limited process understanding during the development phase, and might even lead to a suboptimal process design as the scaledown setups might lack accurate representation of conditions in the large-scale. Moreover, while the complexity of the purification process is greatly influenced by cell cultivation conditions, it is common practice to optimize upstream and downstream processes separately [23], which further contributes to a suboptimal design."

The complex metabolic network of production cells and production mechanism of recombinant antibodies have gradually become clear. Raab et al. developed a cell line through genetic engineering by a novel bottom-up microRNA (miRNA) screening approach for optimizing the production and secretion of therapeutic antibodies (Raab et al., 2021). At present, the expression level and quality control of recombinant antibodies has always been one of the important bottlenecks restricting the development of antibody drugs",
                            "Under different process conditions, the differences in the yield of recombinant antibodies by the production cell lines can be analyzed from the levels of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, laying a solid foundation for large-scale cell culture processes. In the future, the large-scale production of recombinant antibodies and development of culture processes will develop rapidly in the direction of stabilizing production capacity and improving quality. Furthermore, big data and multi-omics technologies are also beneficial to provide new research directions, more and more process analytical technologies are applied to cell culture processes, which will provide more ideas for improving the efficiency of recombinant antibodies."

The narrow pore size range (60-120 nm) of Protein A resins restricts mass transfer, necessitating extended residence times and consequently longer cycle times <Paper corpusId=\"263249943\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nBeyond productivity limitations, the economic impact of Protein A chromatography is substantial, with this single step potentially constituting \"more than 50% of the downstream cost of mAb production\" <Paper corpusId=\"263249943\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"73473455\" paperTitle=\"(Ramos-de-la-Pena et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. This cost burden is compounded by the finite lifetime of these expensive resins compared to other chromatographic media, creating pressure to maximize resin utilization while maintaining product quality <Paper corpusId=\"263249943\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe challenges of downstream processing extend beyond the capture step to include the effective removal of process and product-related impurities. The increased upstream titers have brought a corresponding increase in host cell proteins (HCPs) and other contaminants that must be removed to ensure product safety and quality <Paper corpusId=\"256230774\" paperTitle=\"(Chen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This heightened impurity burden challenges traditional purification approaches and necessitates more robust and efficient separation methods.\n\nAnother significant challenge is managing variability in the feed stream. Downstream processes must contend with inherent variability in the composition of the harvested cell culture fluid, which stems from biological variations in the upstream production system. As Sachio et al. explain, \"A challenge often encountered in the design of biopharmaceutical downstream separation processes is the variability in the input mixture composition. This is associated with the cell-based upstream production system and cannot be controlled\" <Paper corpusId=\"259991252\" paperTitle=\"(Sachio et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This variability demands flexible and robust purification processes capable of consistently delivering high-quality product despite fluctuations in feed characteristics.\n\nAs manufacturing scales increase, additional limitations in chromatographic processes become apparent, including \"mass transfer limitations, low capacity, and scalability issues\" <Paper corpusId=\"276991665\" paperTitle=\"(Royo et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. Traditional batch manufacturing approaches, while well-established, result in \"suboptimal resource utilization and extended production cycles\" <Paper corpusId=\"277649345\" paperTitle=\"(Ranbhor, 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. These inefficiencies highlight the need for innovative approaches to downstream processing that can match the productivity gains achieved upstream while maintaining product quality and reducing overall manufacturing costs.",

The consideration of membrane-based chromatographic devices as a debottlenecking option is gaining increasing attention with the recent introduction of high-capacity bind and elute membranes",
                            "The pressure to accelerate drug development has challenged process scientists and vendors to continuously improve approaches to shorten product development timelines, ideally at reduced cost with little or no impact on product quality. This is observed in the upstream process, where improvement efforts resulting in approximately five-fold increases in mAb titres have been realised [3][4][5]. This increase in product yield has shifted the bottleneck of the production process from upstream to downstream, principally the mAb capture step [4,6]",
                            "Protein A (ProtA) resins are the mainstay for mAb capture and can constitute more than 50% of the downstream cost of mAb production [7](Pabst et al., 2018)(Ramos-de-la-Pe\u00f1a et al., 2019)",
                            "As with many resin-based chromatography media, the narrow pore size range 60-120 nm of the ProtA resin can be impacted by diffusional mass transfer for mAb capture [8]. Hence, operation at residence times in the order of minutes is required to attain the desired pressure drop and load density, resulting in extended cycle times. The emergence of membrane-based and fibre-based capture chromatography, where mass transfer is governed primarily by convection, can be a rapid process due to the micronsize pores and consequent binding site accessibility of these devices [10][11][12]. However, mAb binding capacity is negatively impacted by convection mass transfer. This limitation appears to have been overcome via recent improvements in ProtA chromatographic membrane and fibre devices [13][14][15]."

As known, the golden standard for monoclonal antibody (mAb) purification is Protein A affinity chromatography, a technology that has gained high interest because of its great performance and capabilities. The main concerns are the elevated resins costs and their limited lifetime compared to other resins (e.g. ion exchange chromatography). Great efforts have been carried out to improve purification conditions, such as resin characterization and designing alkali/acid stable resins with a longer lifetime. Modification of Protein A ligands and alternative formats such as monoliths membranes and microshperes have been tested to increase the purification performance. New technology has been proposed to improve the large-scale separation; in addition, alternative ligands have been suggested to capture mAbs instead of Protein A ligand; however, most of the information is locked by pharmaceutical companies.

This is observed in the upstream process, where improvement efforts resulting in approximately five-fold increases in mAb titres have been realised [3][4][5].

Hence, operation at residence times in the order of minutes is required to attain the desired pressure drop and load density, resulting in extended cycle times. The emergence of membrane-based and fibre-based capture chromatography, where mass transfer is governed primarily by convection, can be a rapid process due to the micronsize pores and consequent binding site accessibility of these devices [10][11][12]. However, mAb binding capacity is negatively impacted by convection mass transfer. This limitation appears to have been overcome via recent improvements in ProtA chromatographic membrane and fibre devices [13][14][15]."

This paper presents a theoretical and practical approach for designing a periodic counter-current chromatography (PCC) operation as a continuous capture purification step that is integrated with a perfusion cell culture process. The constraints for continuous and optimal PCC operation govern the selection of residence time and number of columns. The flexibility available in PCC design for selection of these parameters is dictated by the binding characteristics of the target protein on the capture resin. Using an empirical model for the protein breakthrough curve, analytical solutions to determine these conditions were derived and verified with experimental results for three different proteins: two relatively unstable proteins (recombinant enzymes) and a relatively stable protein (monoclonal antibody). The advantages of a continuous downstream capture step are highlighted for the three case studies in comparison with the existing batch chromatography processes. The use of PCC leads to improvements in process economics due to higher resin capacity utilization and correspondingly lower buffer consumption. Furthermore, integrated and continuous bioprocessing results in a smaller facility footprint by elimination of harvest hold vessels and clarification, as well as by reducing the capture column size by one to two orders of magnitude."

However, the high product titers, along with the concomitant increase in host cell proteins (HCP) and other impurities [6,7] often challenge the efficiency of traditional purification methods, resulting in a shift in the manufacturing costs from upstream processing towards downstream processing [2][3][4]. As such, it is critical for further developments in downstream processing to occur so as to ensure that products of high purity can be obtained in a productive manner."

                            "The upstream process involves fermentation of starting material, which, in most cases, is generated based on cell bank derivation and characterization guidelines (ICH Q5D [19]). The objective of upstream process development is to increase product yield and expression rate while maintaining quality by evaluating and optimizing cell metabolism and fermentation process conditions (Gernaey et al., 2010). This is typically done using a scale-down approach, where the impact of commercial-scale dynamic conditions on cell metabolism is studied in laboratory setups and the information is used for scale-up optimization and validation (Enfors et al., 2001). Downstream process development, with chromatography as the main step, aims to achieve a target purification level and involves evaluation of optimal resin type, buffer conditions that allow optimal binding of proteins to resins, optimal elution conditions, and process robustness (Nfor et al., 2008). The design space is typically explored using empirical approaches involving laboratory experiments (Baumann et al., 2015)",
                            "The scale-down experimentation approach (for both upstream and downstream processes) enables the use of advanced high-throughput experimentation (HTE) methods to screen a larger number of process parameters using design of experiments (DoE) and response surface model (Harms et al., 2008)(Long et al., 2014). However, this approach requires significant experimental efforts, offers limited process understanding during the development phase, and might even lead to a suboptimal process design as the scaledown setups might lack accurate representation of conditions in the large-scale. Moreover, while the complexity of the purification process is greatly influenced by cell cultivation conditions, it is common practice to optimize upstream and downstream processes separately [23], which further contributes to a suboptimal design."

The implementation of continuous processing offers \"greater productivity, a smaller facility footprint and reduced cost of goods\" compared to traditional batch manufacturing methods <Paper corpusId=\"257731337\" paperTitle=\"(Tregidgo et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"209415743\" paperTitle=\"(Tripathi et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAt the core of continuous manufacturing is perfusion culture technology, which achieves significantly higher cell densities (50-100\u00d710^6 cells/mL versus 15-25\u00d710^6 cells/mL for fed-batch) and superior volumetric productivity (0.5-2.0 g/L/day versus 0.2-0.5 g/L/day for fed-batch) <Paper corpusId=\"277649345\" paperTitle=\"(Ranbhor, 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. These systems typically utilize tangential flow filtration (TFF) or alternating tangential flow (ATF) filtration for cell retention. In ATF systems, \"alternating pressure and vacuum are applied to the permeate flow using a diaphragm pump\" which \"reduces the fouling of the hollow fiber membrane\" while recirculating cells back to the bioreactor and directing the product-containing permeate to capture chromatography <Paper corpusId=\"251421716\" paperTitle=\"(Matte, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe integration of continuous upstream and downstream processes creates a fully connected bioprocess that delivers substantial operational benefits. Studies have demonstrated that continuous manufacturing can \"drastically cut buffer consumption by 6-fold and chromatography resin use by 2.4-fold compared to fed-batch platforms\" without negatively affecting \"final drug substance properties like stability profiles, process-related contaminants, and product quality parameters\" <Paper corpusId=\"277649345\" paperTitle=\"(Ranbhor, 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "As the production of therapeutic proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), are being produced at increasingly larger scales, the industry is moving towards continuous processing to achieve increased efficiency [1]. The implementation of perfusion culture methods offers greater productivity, a smaller facility footprint and reduced cost of goods [2] but widespread uptake of the technology has been hindered by high risk of batch failure and by the complexity of set-up. Recent technological advancements have led to reduced failure rates, increased the productivity of perfusion cultures and reduced batch to batch variability when compared to fed-batch [3,4]. Additionally, the long-term steady-state perfusion culture operation ensures consistent product quality [5], which has led to regulatory bodies to drive initiatives to promote the implementation of continuous biomanufacturing [6].\n\nIt has been suggested that the success of perfusion culture methodologies relies on the ability to reduce perfusion rate, ideally to rates below 1 vessel volume per day (VVD) [7]. This ensures the achievement of high titers using minimal liquid throughput, thus reducing the operating costs. In order to achieve a reduction in perfusion rate, cell lines must be carefully selected, and media optimized to ensure appropriate nutritional depth and osmolality."

The production of therapeutic proteins for treating diseases at large scale for millions of individuals is one of the essential needs of mankind. Recent progress in the area of recombinant DNA technologies has paved the way to producing recombinant proteins that can be used as therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic reagents. Recombinant proteins for these applications are mainly produced using prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression host systems such as mammalian cells, bacteria, yeast, insect cells, and transgenic plants at laboratory scale as well as in large-scale settings. The development of efficient bioprocessing strategies is crucial for industrial production of recombinant proteins of therapeutic and prophylactic importance. Recently, advances have been made in the various areas of bioprocessing and are being utilized to develop effective processes for producing recombinant proteins. These include the use of high-throughput devices for effective bioprocess optimization and of disposable systems, continuous upstream processing, continuous chromatography, integrated continuous bioprocessing, Quality by Design, and process analytical technologies to achieve quality product with higher yield. This review summarizes recent developments in the bioprocessing of recombinant proteins, including in various expression systems, bioprocess development, and the upstream and downstream processing of recombinant proteins."

A \"plug\u2010and\u2010play\" approach is applied to both platforms at bench scale, using commercially available basal and feed media, a standard feed strategy for fed\u2010batch and ATF filtration for perfusion. Product concentration in fed\u2010batch is 2.5 times greater than perfusion, while average productivity in perfusion is 7.5 times greater than fed\u2010batch. PCA reveals more variability in the cell environment and metabolism during the fed\u2010batch run. LDH measurements show that exposure of product to cell lysate is 7\u201310 times greater in fed\u2010batch. Product analysis shows larger abundances of neutral species in perfusion, likely due to decreased bioreactor residence times and extracellular exposure. The IgG1 perfusion product also has higher purity and lower half\u2010antibody. Glycosylation is similar across both culture modes. The first perfusion harvest slice for both product types shows different glycosylation than subsequent harvests, suggesting that product quality lags behind metabolism. In conclusion, process and product data indicate that intra\u2010lot heterogeneity is decreased in perfusion cultures. Additional data and discussion is required to understand the developmental, clinical and commercial implications, and in what situations increased uniformity would be beneficial."

                            "There has been increasing momentum recently in the biopharmaceutical industry to transition from traditional batch processes to next\u2010generation integrated and continuous biomanufacturing. This transition from batch to continuous is expected to offer several advantages which, taken together, could significantly improve access to biologics drugs for patients. Despite this recent momentum, there has not been a commercial implementation of a continuous bioprocess reported in the literature. In this study, we describe a successful pilot\u2010scale proof\u2010of\u2010concept demonstration of an end\u2010to\u2010end integrated and continuous bioprocess for the production of a monoclonal antibody (mAb). This process incorporated all of the key unit operations found in a typical mAb production process, including the final steps of virus removal filtration, ultrafiltration, diafiltration, and formulation. The end\u2010to\u2010end integrated process was operated for a total of 25\u2009days and produced a total of 4.9\u2009kg (200\u2009g/day or 2\u2009g/L BRX/day) of the drug substance from a 100\u2010L perfusion bioreactor (BRX) with acceptable product quality and minimal operator intervention. This successful proof\u2010of\u2010concept demonstrates that end\u2010to\u2010end integrated continuous bioprocessing is achievable with current technologies and represents an important step toward the realization of a commercial integrated and continuous bioprocessing process."

A major trend is the application of multi-omics technologies (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics, and fluxomics) to better understand and optimize cell cultures. These approaches have begun to clarify \"the complex metabolic network of production cells and production mechanism of recombinant antibodies\" <Paper corpusId=\"247223302\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. The comprehensive analysis of production cell lines \"from the levels of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics\" provides insights that enable more rational optimization of large-scale processes <Paper corpusId=\"247223302\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nProcess intensification represents another critical direction for the biopharmaceutical industry as it strives to meet growing demand while maintaining stringent quality requirements. The implementation of more digitalized and automated bioprocessing systems aligns the industry with Industry 4.0 standards and enables more efficient production workflows <Paper corpusId=\"266932270\" paperTitle=\"(Eslami et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. These advancements are particularly important as manufacturers seek to \"debottleneck\" downstream processing and \"significantly reduce costs, which, for industrial scale manufacture of biopharmaceuticals, currently accounts for between 45 and 92% of the total cost\" <Paper corpusId=\"263570703\" paperTitle=\"(Boodhoo et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIntegrated continuous bioprocessing will continue to gain prominence as manufacturers recognize its economic and operational advantages. Continuous processing platforms offer \"improvements in process economics due to higher resin capacity utilization and correspondingly lower buffer consumption\" while enabling \"a smaller facility footprint by elimination of harvest hold vessels and clarification, as well as by reducing the capture column size by one to two orders of magnitude\" <Paper corpusId=\"263570703\" paperTitle=\"(Boodhoo et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"26109051\" paperTitle=\"(Godawat et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. These benefits address the fundamental challenges of scale and cost that have historically limited the accessibility of antibody therapeutics.\n\nLooking ahead, the integration of process analytical technologies (PAT) with emerging big data approaches will provide \"new research directions\" for improving recombinant antibody production <Paper corpusId=\"247223302\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. These technologies will enable more precise real-time monitoring and control of manufacturing processes, allowing for the detection and correction of deviations before they affect product quality. The ultimate goal of these advancements is \"stabilizing production capacity and improving quality\" across increasingly complex manufacturing operations <Paper corpusId=\"247223302\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe future of antibody manufacturing will also likely see greater emphasis on holistic process development that recognizes the interconnected nature of upstream and downstream operations. As manufacturers continue to optimize individual process steps, the integration of these improvements into comprehensive manufacturing platforms will be essential for realizing their full potential. Collaborations between industry, academia, and technology providers will accelerate this integration, creating more robust and flexible manufacturing systems capable of adapting to evolving product demands and regulatory requirements <Paper corpusId=\"266932270\" paperTitle=\"(Eslami et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

The complex metabolic network of production cells and production mechanism of recombinant antibodies have gradually become clear. Raab et al. developed a cell line through genetic engineering by a novel bottom-up microRNA (miRNA) screening approach for optimizing the production and secretion of therapeutic antibodies (Raab et al., 2021). At present, the expression level and quality control of recombinant antibodies has always been one of the important bottlenecks restricting the development of antibody drugs",

In the future, the large-scale production of recombinant antibodies and development of culture processes will develop rapidly in the direction of stabilizing production capacity and improving quality. Furthermore, big data and multi-omics technologies are also beneficial to provide new research directions, more and more process analytical technologies are applied to cell culture processes, which will provide more ideas for improving the efficiency of recombinant antibodies."

                            "Production of biological products is often divided into two main steps, the upstream processing in a bioreactor and the downstream processing for the recovery of the product by a combination of centrifugation, filtration, chromatography, and membrane filtration.\n\nAs the upstream processing is the initial step in biotechnology, thus product quality is of paramount importance, and optimizing this step leads to significant improvements in overall production.\n\nUpstream processing involves cell cultivation and harvesting biological material, such as proteins, enzymes, and antibodies, while maintaining its quality and purity.The outcome of this step is heavily dependent on controlling and maintaining process variables such as nutrition feeding, temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen at an optimal level.This step can be performed via batch, fed-batch, or perfusion modes, each with its advantages and limitations.Similarly, downstream processing poses challenges due to the complexity and variability of the starting material.Multi-component adsorption isotherms, variable impurities, and contaminants in the crude feedstock make it challenging to design and optimize downstream processing steps, such as purification and separation.\n\nIn discussing the challenges faced by the biopharmaceutical industry in meeting the growing demand for biologics while maintaining quality requirements, Narayanan et al. (Narayanan et al., 2022) highlight the need for advancements in bioprocessing, particularly in process intensification, to address these challenges.In addition, they stress the importance of collaborations between different parties to establish a more digitalized and automated biotherapeutic process development and manufacturing, aligning the industry with the standards of Industry 4.0."

                            "Integrated and continuous processing of recombinant proteins offers several advantages over batch or semi-batch processing used traditionally in the biotechnology industry. This paper presents a theoretical and practical approach for designing a periodic counter-current chromatography (PCC) operation as a continuous capture purification step that is integrated with a perfusion cell culture process. The constraints for continuous and optimal PCC operation govern the selection of residence time and number of columns. The flexibility available in PCC design for selection of these parameters is dictated by the binding characteristics of the target protein on the capture resin. Using an empirical model for the protein breakthrough curve, analytical solutions to determine these conditions were derived and verified with experimental results for three different proteins: two relatively unstable proteins (recombinant enzymes) and a relatively stable protein (monoclonal antibody). The advantages of a continuous downstream capture step are highlighted for the three case studies in comparison with the existing batch chromatography processes. The use of PCC leads to improvements in process economics due to higher resin capacity utilization and correspondingly lower buffer consumption. Furthermore, integrated and continuous bioprocessing results in a smaller facility footprint by elimination of harvest hold vessels and clarification, as well as by reducing the capture column size by one to two orders of magnitude."
