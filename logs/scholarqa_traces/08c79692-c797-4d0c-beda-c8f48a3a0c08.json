With a focus on the science, technological advances, precautions required along with the potential limitations in application, the ethics, guidance\u2019s, and legislative advances that are required to reach the safe and efficacious clinical application of xenotransplantation. Along with a view over the past several decades with the overall significant advancements in pre-clinical study outcomes particularly in islet, kidney, and heart xenotransplantation, to ultimately reach the pinnacle of successful clinical heart and kidney xenotransplants. It outlines the importance for the appropriate guidance\u2019s required to have been developed by experts, scientists, clinicians, and other players who helped develop the field over the past decades. It also touches upon patient advocacy along with perspectives and expectations of patients, along with public opinion and media influence on the understanding and perception of xenotransplantation. It discusses the legislative environment in different jurisdictions which are reviewed in line with current clinical practices. All of which are ultimately based upon the guidance\u2019s developed from a strong long-term collaboration between the International Xenotransplantation Association, the World Health Organisation and The Transplantation Society; each having constantly undertaken consultation and outreach to help develop best practice for clinical xenotransplantation application. These clearly helped forge the legislative frameworks required along with harmonization and standardization of regulations which are detailed here. Also, in relation to the significant advances in the context of initial xeno-kidney trials and the even greater potential for clinical xeno-islet trials to commence we discuss the significant advantages of xenotransplantation and the ultimate benefit to our patients.",

With this we must ensure that the same endemic issues do not occur with xenotransplantation that have occurred with human organ transplantation such as xenotransplant tourism (5) and unethical processes used to make profits at the expense of the animals used and the patients that may be misled into undertaking unapproved procedures (6). \n\nHistorically, xenotransplantation has faced significant challenges, including the perceived/potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans (xenozoonosis) (7), concerns over animal welfare (when breeding and producing the donor animals) (8), cultural and religious issues particularly the notion of crossing species boundaries in the use of their tissues for transplantation (6). These challenges led to the imposition of strict regulations along with embargos and a nuanced ethical debate that continues to shape the direction of the field. In recent years, ground-breaking advancements in genetic engineering has rapidly accelerated the field which offers new hope, massively advancing the creation of genetically modified pigs with organs engineered for compatibility with the human immune system (9). These developments have paved the way for the initiation of trials in humans involving xeno-hearts approved under \"compassionate use\" for live patients (10) along with xeno-hearts and kidneys being studied clinically in a new model using \"Brain Dead\" recipients (11,12) along with very successful preclinical trials using transgenic pig islet cells (13). \n\nIn this review, we explore the ethical and legislative advances that are underpinning xenotransplantation as it moves toward broadly accepted clinical translation. We delve into the ethical considerations surrounding xenotransplantation, examining questions related to the potential risks of xenozoonotic disease transmission, animal rights, their use, and the public's perception of this innovative medical approach. We also survey the changes in legislative frameworks governing xenotransplantation, charting their evolution over time, and highlighting the necessity of harmonization and standardisation in regulations worldwide.",

A number of the core areas of ethical concern that have been central to the discourse surrounding xenotransplantation are: the potential for xenozoonosis, public and regulatory issues, crossing of species boundaries and ensuring appropriate animal ethics. However, these must be balanced against the absolute positive gains for the overwhelming number of potential patients that can benefit from xenotransplantation when there are so many medical, financial and social issues for these patients. As can be seen in Figure 2, the balance between the negative aspects of their disease versus receiving a cure from the transplant is overwhelmingly weighted to the positive. This is because the benefits far outweigh the problems of ongoing and increasing ill health, secondary complications, invalidity and ultimately death. However, there are not enough human donor organs available for transplantation and using this single example, the case of patients suffering from type 1 diabetes, there are innumerable patients that could benefit from islet cell xenotransplantation with it being life changing and lifesaving. A concise timeline of some of the major developments that have occurred in the field of xenotransplantation.

                    "text": "One ethical concern intrinsic to xenotransplantation relates to the potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans, a phenomenon known as xenozoonosis. The concept of transmission although theoretical is not unfounded, as various pathogens, including retroviruses, have been identified in pigs could be potential threats in immunocompromised transplant recipients and then theoretically spread to direct close contacts and the broader community (24,25). \n\nAs such this raises potential ethical dilemmas. The duty to protect the broader community and prevent the spread of theoretically potential infectious diseases must be weighed against the need to explore novel medical solutions to help these patients suffering from end stage organ failure and other diseases (6). The possibility of creating animals free from such pathogens as porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) through genetic engineering (26) has already been shown to be possible along with raising donor animals in designated pathogen free (DPF) facilities. Along with pigs that have limited pathogens including restricted PERV (27) or where studies have shown no potential for transmission (28, 29). Despite best intensions and even following screening of donor animals we have seen that donor pig organs can still potentially have undetectable porcine viruses such as cytomegalovirus or porcine roseolovirus (PCMV/PRV) detected posttransplant in the donor tissue by plasma microbial cell-free DNA (30). This occurred despite pre-transplant screening and following transplantation into a patient (25). \n\nFrom a patient and community perspective it is therefore essential for the patients, their family and immediate direct contacts along with the community to understand that if there were in fact a positive case of transmission of a xenozoonosis into a xenotransplant patient that there may well be serious implications to all involved. These implications are potentially as severe as lifelong restriction and quarantine of the recipient and may extend to their direct close contacts (25).",

Hawthorne\n## Abstract\nIn this state-of-the-art review we detail the journey of xenotransplantation from its infancy, detailing one of the first published cases and the subsequent journey the field took in its inception and development. With a focus on the science, technological advances, precautions required along with the potential limitations in application, the ethics, guidance\u2019s, and legislative advances that are required to reach the safe and efficacious clinical application of xenotransplantation. Along with a view over the past several decades with the overall significant advancements in pre-clinical study outcomes particularly in islet, kidney, and heart xenotransplantation, to ultimately reach the pinnacle of successful clinical heart and kidney xenotransplants. It outlines the importance for the appropriate guidance\u2019s required to have been developed by experts, scientists, clinicians, and other players who helped develop the field over the past decades. It also touches upon patient advocacy along with perspectives and expectations of patients, along with public opinion and media influence on the understanding and perception of xenotransplantation. It discusses the legislative environment in different jurisdictions which are reviewed in line with current clinical practices. All of which are ultimately based upon the guidance\u2019s developed from a strong long-term collaboration between the International Xenotransplantation Association, the World Health Organisation and The Transplantation Society; each having constantly undertaken consultation and outreach to help develop best practice for clinical xenotransplantation application. These clearly helped forge the legislative frameworks required along with harmonization and standardization of regulations which are detailed here. Also, in relation to the significant advances in the context of initial xeno-kidney trials and the even greater potential for clinical xeno-islet trials to commence we discuss the significant advantages of xenotransplantation and the ultimate benefit to our patients.\n## Introduction\nHowever, with this promise comes a complex web of ethical considerations and legal frameworks that must be carefully navigated to ensure the responsible and ethical translation of xenotransplantation from the laboratory to the clinic. With this we must ensure that the same endemic issues do not occur with xenotransplantation that have occurred with human organ transplantation such as xenotransplant tourism (5) and unethical processes used to make profits at the expense of the animals used and the patients that may be misled into undertaking unapproved procedures (6). \n\nHistorically, xenotransplantation has faced significant challenges, including the perceived/potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans (xenozoonosis) (7), concerns over animal welfare (when breeding and producing the donor animals) (8), cultural and religious issues particularly the notion of crossing species boundaries in the use of their tissues for transplantation (6). These challenges led to the imposition of strict regulations along with embargos and a nuanced ethical debate that continues to shape the direction of the field. In recent years, ground-breaking advancements in genetic engineering has rapidly accelerated the field which offers new hope, massively advancing the creation of genetically modified pigs with organs engineered for compatibility with the human immune system (9). These developments have paved the way for the initiation of trials in humans involving xeno-hearts approved under \"compassionate use\" for live patients (10) along with xeno-hearts and kidneys being studied clinically in a new model using \"Brain Dead\" recipients (11,12) along with very successful preclinical trials using transgenic pig islet cells (13). \n\nIn this review, we explore the ethical and legislative advances that are underpinning xenotransplantation as it moves toward broadly accepted clinical translation. We delve into the ethical considerations surrounding xenotransplantation, examining questions related to the potential risks of xenozoonotic disease transmission, animal rights, their use, and the public's perception of this innovative medical approach. We also survey the changes in legislative frameworks governing xenotransplantation, charting their evolution over time, and highlighting the necessity of harmonization and standardisation in regulations worldwide.\n\n## Major ethical considerations\nThe remarkable potential of xenotransplantation to address the critical shortage of human organs has been met with considerable ethical scrutiny, raising profound questions and dilemmas that must be thoughtfully addressed. A number of the core areas of ethical concern that have been central to the discourse surrounding xenotransplantation are: the potential for xenozoonosis, public and regulatory issues, crossing of species boundaries and ensuring appropriate animal ethics. However, these must be balanced against the absolute positive gains for the overwhelming number of potential patients that can benefit from xenotransplantation when there are so many medical, financial and social issues for these patients. As can be seen in Figure 2, the balance between the negative aspects of their disease versus receiving a cure from the transplant is overwhelmingly weighted to the positive. This is because the benefits far outweigh the problems of ongoing and increasing ill health, secondary complications, invalidity and ultimately death. However, there are not enough human donor organs available for transplantation and using this single example, the case of patients suffering from type 1 diabetes, there are innumerable patients that could benefit from islet cell xenotransplantation with it being life changing and lifesaving. A concise timeline of some of the major developments that have occurred in the field of xenotransplantation. From the first recorded attempt of a xeno-blood transfusion to the current advent of successful clinical xenotransplants of transgenic pig organs to humans.\n\n## Potential xenozoonosis\nOne ethical concern intrinsic to xenotransplantation relates to the potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans, a phenomenon known as xenozoonosis. The concept of transmission although theoretical is not unfounded, as various pathogens, including retroviruses, have been identified in pigs could be potential threats in immunocompromised transplant recipients and then theoretically spread to direct close contacts and the broader community (24,25). \n\nAs such this raises potential ethical dilemmas. The duty to protect the broader community and prevent the spread of theoretically potential infectious diseases must be weighed against the need to explore novel medical solutions to help these patients suffering from end stage organ failure and other diseases (6). The possibility of creating animals free from such pathogens as porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) through genetic engineering (26) has already been shown to be possible along with raising donor animals in designated pathogen free (DPF) facilities. Along with pigs that have limited pathogens including restricted PERV (27) or where studies have shown no potential for transmission (28, 29). Despite best intensions and even following screening of donor animals we have seen that donor pig organs can still potentially have undetectable porcine viruses such as cytomegalovirus or porcine roseolovirus (PCMV/PRV) detected posttransplant in the donor tissue by plasma microbial cell-free DNA (30). This occurred despite pre-transplant screening and following transplantation into a patient (25). \n\nFrom a patient and community perspective it is therefore essential for the patients, their family and immediate direct contacts along with the community to understand that if there were in fact a positive case of transmission of a xenozoonosis into a xenotransplant patient that there may well be serious implications to all involved. These implications are potentially as severe as lifelong restriction and quarantine of the recipient and may extend to their direct close contacts (25).\n\n## Crossing species boundaries\nXenotransplantation challenges the traditional conceptual boundaries that separate humans from animals. It poses profound philosophical and ethical questions about the nature of different species and the moral obligation we owe to different species. As we engage in practices that involve genetic modification and the use of animals for human benefit, the ethical boundaries are changing with increasing pressure on ethics committees and legislators to keep track with the pace of change, and we have a moral imperative to ensure that we do keep pace and provide adequate oversight (6). \n\nSome ethicists argue that xenotransplantation exemplifies the Anthropocentric approach (38), emphasizing human interests over those of animals, while others advocate for a more inclusive biocentric perspective that values all forms of life equally (39). The challenge is to find a balance between medical innovation and ethical responsibility to both animal and man (6).\n\n## Conclusion\nThe journey of xenotransplantation, the transplantation of organs or tissues from one species to another, has witnessed significant advancements and encountered ethical, legislative, and scientific challenges. This review has delved into various facets of xenotransplantation, emphasizing its potential to address the critical organ shortage crisis while highlighting the essential elements required for its responsible and successful translation to clinical reality.\n\n## Continuing ethical and legislative advancements\nEthical and legislative advancements are indispensable as xenotransplantation moves closer to clinical translation. The responsible treatment of animals, transparent informed consent, and comprehensive regulatory frameworks are fundamental to ensuring ethical and safe practices.",

            "abstract": "Xenotransplantation is emerging as a vital solution to the critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, significantly propelled by advancements in genetic engineering and the development of sophisticated immunosuppressive treatments. Specifically, the transplantation of kidneys from genetically engineered pigs into human patients has made significant progress, offering a potential clinical solution to the shortage of human kidney supply. Recent trials involving the transplantation of these modified porcine kidneys into deceased human bodies have underscored the practicality of this approach, advancing the field towards potential clinical applications. However, numerous challenges remain, especially in the domains of identifying suitable donor-recipient matches and formulating effective immunosuppressive protocols crucial for transplant success. Critical to advancing xenotransplantation into clinical settings are the nuanced considerations of anesthesia and surgical practices required for these complex procedures. The precise genetic modification of porcine kidneys marks a significant leap in addressing the biological and immunological hurdles that have traditionally challenged xenotransplantation. Yet, the success of these transplants hinges on the process of meticulously matching these organs with human recipients, which demands thorough understanding of immunological compatibility, the risk of organ rejection, and the prevention of zoonotic disease transmission. In parallel, the development and optimization of immunosuppressive protocols are imperative to mitigate rejection risks while minimizing side effects, necessitating innovative approaches in both pharmacology and clinical practices. Furthermore, the post-operative care of recipients, encompassing vigilant monitoring for signs of organ rejection, infectious disease surveillance, and psychological support, is crucial for ensuring post-transplant life quality. This comprehensive care highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving transplant surgeons, anesthesiologists, immunologists, infectiologists and psychiatrists. The integration of anesthesia and surgical expertise is particularly vital, ensuring the best possible outcomes of those patients undergoing these novel transplants, through safe procedural practices. As xenotransplantation moving closer to clinical reality, establishing consensus guidelines on various aspects, including donor-recipient selection, immunosuppression, as well as surgical and anesthetic management of these transplants, is essential. Addressing these challenges through rigorous research and collective collaboration will be the key, not only to navigate the ethical, medical, and logistical complexities of introducing kidney xenotransplantation into mainstream clinical practice, but also itself marks a new era in organ transplantation.",

Nevertheless, both preclinical and clinical investigations conducted thorough pathogen screening to exclude prevalent viruses in pig donors, such as PERV-3 and PCMV. The posttransplantation virus detection in the decedents also remained negative (12,27) However, the limitations of these negative findings are underscored by the relatively short observation periods. Consequently, developing future strategies to detect and eliminate these viruses is imperative to uphold the safety of both the graft and the recipient (28). \n\nAdditionally, the ethical landscape of xenotransplantation, encompassing animal rights, public attitudes, and regulatory milestones such as the FDA's 2022 approval of a pig-to-human heart transplant, presents ongoing challenges (29). The pilot xenotransplantation trials have underscored various ethical and medicolegal considerations inherent in xenotransplantation research (12,18). In these studies, brain-dead decedents were precluded from organ donation, and obtaining proper informed consent from their families was deemed essential. Notably, the absence of specific legislation governing xenotransplantation necessitates evolution of the regulatory frameworks to enhance research protocols and future clinical applications. Consultation with ethics committees is imperative to ensure adherence to established guidelines such as the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA) and the dead-donor rule, while also acknowledging the cultural and religious nuances surrounding organ transplantation (30).

This meticulous genetic engineering aims to produce organs that are not only less likely to be rejected but also capable of performing their physiological functions without inducing harmful side effects in the recipient. \n\nThe continuous exploration and refinement of these genetic modifications underscore the complexity of making xenotransplantation a viable clinical option. As researchers dive deeper into the genetic underpinnings of immune rejection and organ compatibility, xenotransplantation alleviating the organ shortage crisis is coming true. Yet, it is essential to balance the enthusiasm for these technological advances with a careful assessment of their long-term implications for both organ recipients and the broader field of transplantation medicine. \n\nFuture research must also address the ethical considerations and regulatory challenges associated with xenotransplantation. As genetic engineering techniques become more sophisticated, consensus of the moral, ethical, and societal implications of using genetically modified animals for organ transplantation must be reached. Those topics warranting immediate attention includes animal welfare, the potential impact on natural ecosystems, and the long-term health outcomes for transplant recipients. Moreover, as the field progresses towards potential clinical applications, establishing clear and comprehensive regulatory frameworks will be crucial to ensuring the safety, efficacy, and ethical integrity of organ xenotransplantation. \n\nWhile the genetic engineering of pigs for kidney xenotransplantation represents a frontier of medical science with the potential to dramatically expand the organ donor pool, it also poses a myriad of scientific, ethical, and regulatory challenges.",

Specifically, the transplantation of kidneys from genetically engineered pigs into human patients has made significant progress, offering a potential clinical solution to the shortage of human kidney supply. Recent trials involving the transplantation of these modified porcine kidneys into deceased human bodies have underscored the practicality of this approach, advancing the field towards potential clinical applications. However, numerous challenges remain, especially in the domains of identifying suitable donor-recipient matches and formulating effective immunosuppressive protocols crucial for transplant success. Critical to advancing xenotransplantation into clinical settings are the nuanced considerations of anesthesia and surgical practices required for these complex procedures. The precise genetic modification of porcine kidneys marks a significant leap in addressing the biological and immunological hurdles that have traditionally challenged xenotransplantation. Yet, the success of these transplants hinges on the process of meticulously matching these organs with human recipients, which demands thorough understanding of immunological compatibility, the risk of organ rejection, and the prevention of zoonotic disease transmission. In parallel, the development and optimization of immunosuppressive protocols are imperative to mitigate rejection risks while minimizing side effects, necessitating innovative approaches in both pharmacology and clinical practices. Furthermore, the post-operative care of recipients, encompassing vigilant monitoring for signs of organ rejection, infectious disease surveillance, and psychological support, is crucial for ensuring post-transplant life quality. This comprehensive care highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving transplant surgeons, anesthesiologists, immunologists, infectiologists and psychiatrists. The integration of anesthesia and surgical expertise is particularly vital, ensuring the best possible outcomes of those patients undergoing these novel transplants, through safe procedural practices. As xenotransplantation moving closer to clinical reality, establishing consensus guidelines on various aspects, including donor-recipient selection, immunosuppression, as well as surgical and anesthetic management of these transplants, is essential. Addressing these challenges through rigorous research and collective collaboration will be the key, not only to navigate the ethical, medical, and logistical complexities of introducing kidney xenotransplantation into mainstream clinical practice, but also itself marks a new era in organ transplantation.\n## Introduction\nThe journey toward the clinical application of porcine-to-human kidney transplants is fraught with uncertainties, necessitating rigorous investigation and ethical deliberation. \n\nThe exploration of xenotransplantation, as a viable source of kidneys for transplantation, is gaining momentum, underpinned by the pressing need to address the organ shortage crisis. This approach not only promises to expand the donor pool but also to pioneer new frontiers in transplantation medicine (4). Advances in genetic modification techniques aim to enhance organ compatibility and reduce the likelihood of rejection and cross-species infection, marking a significant leap towards making xenotransplantation a reality for patients in need (4). \n\nMoreover, the field of xenotransplantation is evolving alongside considerations of ethical standards and regulatory frameworks, ensuring that the development and potential clinical implementation are conducted with the utmost care for safety and ethical integrity. As the scientific community continues to unravel the complexities of xenogeneic organ transplantation, the collective goal remains clear: to provide a sustainable, ethical solution to the organ shortage crisis, ultimately saving more lives through innovative medical breakthroughs (5). \n\nIn essence, the path forward in xenotransplantation research and its prospective clinical application is laden with challenges yet brimming with potential. Through continued interdisciplinary collaboration, rigorous ethical scrutiny, and innovative scientific inquiry, xenotransplantation holds the promise of significantly impacting the future of organ transplantation, offering hope to countless individuals awaiting life-saving transplants.\n\n## Donor selection in kidney transplantation\nThese include genes for human complement regulatory proteins (hCD46 and hCD55), which help protect the transplanted organ from the recipient's immune system, and genes like human thrombomodulin (hTBM) and human endothelial protein C receptor (hEPCR), which work to prevent clotting and improve graft survival (6-11) (Figure 1). \n\nResearch institutions, such as the University of Alabama, have made significant strides by utilizing pigs with a comprehensive suite of genetic modifications, including enhancements to immune regulation and coagulation profiles, as well as the removal of specific antigens known to trigger rejection (12). This meticulous genetic engineering aims to produce organs that are not only less likely to be rejected but also capable of performing their physiological functions without inducing harmful side effects in the recipient. \n\nThe continuous exploration and refinement of these genetic modifications underscore the complexity of making xenotransplantation a viable clinical option. As researchers dive deeper into the genetic underpinnings of immune rejection and organ compatibility, xenotransplantation alleviating the organ shortage crisis is coming true. Yet, it is essential to balance the enthusiasm for these technological advances with a careful assessment of their long-term implications for both organ recipients and the broader field of transplantation medicine. \n\nFuture research must also address the ethical considerations and regulatory challenges associated with xenotransplantation. As genetic engineering techniques become more sophisticated, consensus of the moral, ethical, and societal implications of using genetically modified animals for organ transplantation must be reached. Those topics warranting immediate attention includes animal welfare, the potential impact on natural ecosystems, and the long-term health outcomes for transplant recipients. Moreover, as the field progresses towards potential clinical applications, establishing clear and comprehensive regulatory frameworks will be crucial to ensuring the safety, efficacy, and ethical integrity of organ xenotransplantation. \n\nWhile the genetic engineering of pigs for kidney xenotransplantation represents a frontier of medical science with the potential to dramatically expand the organ donor pool, it also poses a myriad of scientific, ethical, and regulatory challenges.\n...\nWhile the genetic engineering of pigs for kidney xenotransplantation represents a frontier of medical science with the potential to dramatically expand the organ donor pool, it also poses a myriad of scientific, ethical, and regulatory challenges. Navigating these complexities will require concerted efforts from researchers, ethicists, and policymakers, with the ultimate goal of making xenotransplantation a safe, ethical, and effective solution for the millions worldwide in need of life-saving organ transplants.\n\n## Challenges in kidney xenotransplantation\nThe common complications include coagulopathy, stemming from endothelial damage and acute rejection, further complicate the post-transplant scenario, necessitating ongoing research and development of strategies to mitigate these effects. \n\nViral infections, particularly those associated with porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) and porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV/PRV), pose significant risks for xenotransplantation. Nevertheless, both preclinical and clinical investigations conducted thorough pathogen screening to exclude prevalent viruses in pig donors, such as PERV-3 and PCMV. The posttransplantation virus detection in the decedents also remained negative (12,27) However, the limitations of these negative findings are underscored by the relatively short observation periods. Consequently, developing future strategies to detect and eliminate these viruses is imperative to uphold the safety of both the graft and the recipient (28). \n\nAdditionally, the ethical landscape of xenotransplantation, encompassing animal rights, public attitudes, and regulatory milestones such as the FDA's 2022 approval of a pig-to-human heart transplant, presents ongoing challenges (29). The pilot xenotransplantation trials have underscored various ethical and medicolegal considerations inherent in xenotransplantation research (12,18). In these studies, brain-dead decedents were precluded from organ donation, and obtaining proper informed consent from their families was deemed essential. Notably, the absence of specific legislation governing xenotransplantation necessitates evolution of the regulatory frameworks to enhance research protocols and future clinical applications. Consultation with ethics committees is imperative to ensure adherence to established guidelines such as the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA) and the dead-donor rule, while also acknowledging the cultural and religious nuances surrounding organ transplantation (30). Public acceptance and ethical considerations remain integral to the advancement and clinical application of xenotransplantation, highlighting the need for continued research, dialogue, and education in this evolving field. \n\nIn summary, xenotransplantation's journey towards becoming a viable clinical option is fraught with complex immunological, physiological, virological, and ethical challenges.\n...\nIn summary, xenotransplantation's journey towards becoming a viable clinical option is fraught with complex immunological, physiological, virological, and ethical challenges. Each step forward requires a careful balance of innovation, safety, and ethical considerations, with the ultimate goal of expanding the organ donor pool and saving lives.",

However, given that the animal most suited for xenotransplantation is the pig, there are concerns that people in Muslim countries may be more hesitant to morally approve of these procedures. In this study, the moral approval of xenotransplantation was assessed in a group of 895 participants in Egypt. The results showed that religiosity itself does not predict moral approval of xenotransplantation, but religious identity does, as Muslims are less likely to approve of xenotransplantation than Christians. However, the strongest predictor of moral approval of xenotransplantation was gender, with women displaying less approval. A partial mediating factor in this association was concern for animal welfare. Based on these results, some implications for public policy are discussed.",

Ethical concerns center on the precautionary principle, which suggests that xenotransplantation should not be pursued until the risks of zoonotic diseases are better understood and minimized [7]. Likewise, the long-term health and safety of recipients of xenotransplants are still not fully known, which raises ethical issues regarding patient safety and the potential for unforeseen complications [8]. \n\nThe ethics of human-animal relations are also an issue. There are concerns about the conditions in which donor animals are raised and the potential for harm, suffering, and exploitation of these animals [9]. As with animal experimentation, there is the ethical difficulty of consent [10]. In human-to-human organ transplantation, informed consent is typically obtained from donors or their families. In xenotransplantation, there is no way to obtain informed consent from the donor animals, raising ethical questions about the use of animals for the benefit of humans without their consent [11,12]. \n\nWhile these are ethical issues that are likely to affect xenotransplantation globally, there are also specific geographic areas where xenotransplantation might pose additional ethical concerns. For example, in countries with greater percentage of vegans amongst the population, or with higher sensitivity towards animal suffering, there may be hesitations about killing animals in order to use their organs. \n\nBut even more so, moral qualms about xenotransplantation may be especially salient regions where there are cultural prohibitions on pigs. Pigs are considered the most suited species for xenotransplantation [13], due to various reasons: their organs have similar sizes and functions as for humans; pigs are widely available, and they have potential for large scale reproduction; they are anatomically comparable to human beings; they can be genetically modified more effectively than some other animals; and humans have a lower risk of immune rejection of pig tissue. \n\nTraditionally, Islamic societies have considered pigs impure animals [14].

Elsantil, AlaaEldin Ayoub, Dalia Bedewy\n## Abstract\nXenotransplantation has great potential as an alternative to alleviate the shortage of organs for donation. However, given that the animal most suited for xenotransplantation is the pig, there are concerns that people in Muslim countries may be more hesitant to morally approve of these procedures. In this study, the moral approval of xenotransplantation was assessed in a group of 895 participants in Egypt. The results showed that religiosity itself does not predict moral approval of xenotransplantation, but religious identity does, as Muslims are less likely to approve of xenotransplantation than Christians. However, the strongest predictor of moral approval of xenotransplantation was gender, with women displaying less approval. A partial mediating factor in this association was concern for animal welfare. Based on these results, some implications for public policy are discussed.\n## Introduction\nOther concerns are ethical. Xenotransplantation carries the potential risk of transmitting infectious diseases from animals to humans. Ethical concerns center on the precautionary principle, which suggests that xenotransplantation should not be pursued until the risks of zoonotic diseases are better understood and minimized [7]. Likewise, the long-term health and safety of recipients of xenotransplants are still not fully known, which raises ethical issues regarding patient safety and the potential for unforeseen complications [8]. \n\nThe ethics of human-animal relations are also an issue. There are concerns about the conditions in which donor animals are raised and the potential for harm, suffering, and exploitation of these animals [9]. As with animal experimentation, there is the ethical difficulty of consent [10]. In human-to-human organ transplantation, informed consent is typically obtained from donors or their families. In xenotransplantation, there is no way to obtain informed consent from the donor animals, raising ethical questions about the use of animals for the benefit of humans without their consent [11,12]. \n\nWhile these are ethical issues that are likely to affect xenotransplantation globally, there are also specific geographic areas where xenotransplantation might pose additional ethical concerns. For example, in countries with greater percentage of vegans amongst the population, or with higher sensitivity towards animal suffering, there may be hesitations about killing animals in order to use their organs. \n\nBut even more so, moral qualms about xenotransplantation may be especially salient regions where there are cultural prohibitions on pigs. Pigs are considered the most suited species for xenotransplantation [13], due to various reasons: their organs have similar sizes and functions as for humans; pigs are widely available, and they have potential for large scale reproduction; they are anatomically comparable to human beings; they can be genetically modified more effectively than some other animals; and humans have a lower risk of immune rejection of pig tissue. \n\nTraditionally, Islamic societies have considered pigs impure animals [14]. This is done on a scriptural basis.",

Genetic polymorphism determines immune responses to tissue/organ transplantation, and intricate humoral and cell-mediated mechanisms control these responses. In transplantation, the clinician's goal is to achieve a delicate equilibrium between the allogeneic immune response, undesired effects of the immunosuppressive drugs, and the existing morbidities that are potentially life-threatening. Transplant immunopathology involves sensitization, effector, and apoptosis phases which recruit and engages immunological cells like natural killer cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes. Similarly, these cells are involved in the transfer of normal or genetically engineered T cells. Advances in tissue transplantation would involve a profound knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that underpin the respective immunopathology involved and the design of precision medicines that are safe and effective.",

                    "text": "The word \"Xenos\" is a Greek word meaning foreign or strange. Xenografting is heterologous transplantation involving the grafting of viable cells, tissues, or organs between two species (e.g., a dog and a pig). It is a cross-species transplantation method. The continued demand for viable organs, tissues, and cells brought about by end-stage organ failure and chronic diseases has been the driving force in this medical/scientific research and practice [25]. However, it has been confronted with the significant challenges of immunological barriers and ethical issues. Organ rejection is widespread in xenotransplantation. In humans, for instance, natural antibodies circulate in the blood, and these cause instant transplant rejection when the organdonating species is, for example, a pig. Again, the complement systems are often activated each time organs from pigs are grafted into humans or primates and are highly prone to profound system toxicity due to the central role played by the complement system in body homeostasis and metabolism [26]. The porcine complementary proteins are foreign to primate complement regulatory systems. Studies have shown that genetic engineering may be a way out of this complementary system challenge if pigs are genetically modified to contain some human complement regulatory proteins in their cells [27]. \n\nAnother fundamental challenge facing xenograft is ethical issues. Three ethical issues quickly come to mind when we talk of xenotransplantation: animal rights (effects on the donor animal), human rights (the impact on the human population and the impact on the individual recipient), and interference with nature. An animal rights issue arises because animals, like humans, also have rights to existence and should not be sacrificed in favor of humans [28]. Human rights regarding the recipient can quickly be cleared by obtaining the necessary informed consent. Still, the populace also needs authorization because of the possibility of transferring new pathogens from animal to human populations -a public health risk [1]. The ethical issue of interference with nature may not be so applied. It may be understandable that by interfering with nature, man can free himself from the extinction effects of some natural phenomena [28].",

Adejumo, F. I. Anazodo, Rahnuma Ahmad, Susmita Sinha, Mainul Haque, Nihad Adnan\n## Abstract\nGraft tolerance is a pathophysiological condition heavily reliant on the dynamic interaction of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Genetic polymorphism determines immune responses to tissue/organ transplantation, and intricate humoral and cell-mediated mechanisms control these responses. In transplantation, the clinician's goal is to achieve a delicate equilibrium between the allogeneic immune response, undesired effects of the immunosuppressive drugs, and the existing morbidities that are potentially life-threatening. Transplant immunopathology involves sensitization, effector, and apoptosis phases which recruit and engages immunological cells like natural killer cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes. Similarly, these cells are involved in the transfer of normal or genetically engineered T cells. Advances in tissue transplantation would involve a profound knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that underpin the respective immunopathology involved and the design of precision medicines that are safe and effective.\n## Xenografting or Xenotransplantation\nThe word \"Xenos\" is a Greek word meaning foreign or strange. Xenografting is heterologous transplantation involving the grafting of viable cells, tissues, or organs between two species (e.g., a dog and a pig). It is a cross-species transplantation method. The continued demand for viable organs, tissues, and cells brought about by end-stage organ failure and chronic diseases has been the driving force in this medical/scientific research and practice [25]. However, it has been confronted with the significant challenges of immunological barriers and ethical issues. Organ rejection is widespread in xenotransplantation. In humans, for instance, natural antibodies circulate in the blood, and these cause instant transplant rejection when the organdonating species is, for example, a pig. Again, the complement systems are often activated each time organs from pigs are grafted into humans or primates and are highly prone to profound system toxicity due to the central role played by the complement system in body homeostasis and metabolism [26]. The porcine complementary proteins are foreign to primate complement regulatory systems. Studies have shown that genetic engineering may be a way out of this complementary system challenge if pigs are genetically modified to contain some human complement regulatory proteins in their cells [27]. \n\nAnother fundamental challenge facing xenograft is ethical issues. Three ethical issues quickly come to mind when we talk of xenotransplantation: animal rights (effects on the donor animal), human rights (the impact on the human population and the impact on the individual recipient), and interference with nature. An animal rights issue arises because animals, like humans, also have rights to existence and should not be sacrificed in favor of humans [28]. Human rights regarding the recipient can quickly be cleared by obtaining the necessary informed consent. Still, the populace also needs authorization because of the possibility of transferring new pathogens from animal to human populations -a public health risk [1]. The ethical issue of interference with nature may not be so applied. It may be understandable that by interfering with nature, man can free himself from the extinction effects of some natural phenomena [28].",

Indeed, some argue that xenotransplantation is the only potential way of addressing this shortage. As immunological barriers to xenotransplantation are better understood, those hurdles are being addressed through genetic engineering of donor animals and the development of new drug therapies. However, before xenotransplantation can be fully implemented, both the scientific/medical communities and the general public must seriously consider and attempt to resolve the many complex ethical, social and economic issues that it presents.\n## ETHICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC\nCONSIDERATIONS Xenotransplantation is potentially a reliable, long term solution to the current donor shortage for allotransplantation.At the same time, it presents a number of complex ethical, social and economic issues that must be resolved before it can be fully implemented.Unlike other areas of clinical medicine, xenotransplantation raises a variety of ethical issues that have not been formally discussed or agreed upon in the public arena.The general public must play a role in defining ethical policies regarding xenotransplantation, and it is the duty of the medical and scientific communities to provide as much information as possible to them, so that public policies can be formulated in an informed manner.\n\nThe clinical application of xenotransplantation is predicated on the assumption that the use of animals in medical research and therapy is morally acceptable.Even if this debatable principle is accepted, the use of animals in xenotransplantation, particularly nonhuman primates, raises additional issues.That these animals may need to be genetically altered to overcome certain immunological obstacles further complicates their use as experimental subjects.As a minimum requirement, the use of source animals for xenotransplantation have to comply with the Canadian Council on Animal Care's Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals (73,74).\n\nThe issue of informed consent in xenotransplantation, as in any other area of medicine, requires that the subject be made aware of its potential benefits and risks.In the case of xenotransplantation, there are additional considerations that may violate some of the principles of informed consent.Early recipients of xenografts typically have poor rates of survival, so treatment of these subjects in experimental protocols may raise serious ethical concerns.While the potential benefits and risks of rejection may be estimated, the risk of xenozoonoses cannot reliably be predicted, particularly when DNA from different species is mixed, and may result in new and unpredictable infectious agents.For example, it was only recently determined that porcine endogenous retroviruses can infect human cells (75).",

This has made the generation of genetically bespoke organisms a reality. This paper will analyze the regulatory and practical aspects of such an innovative approach to xenotransplantation on the basis of a hypothetical case study applied to Germany and highlight the gaps in the current regulation. This paper thus provides the basis for legal debate within a specific country. In addition, the identified gaps also pose a barrier toward the harmonization of international regulation. This publication therefore lays the groundwork for guiding the international debate regarding the regulatory framework for solid organ xenotransplantation toward specific issues.\n## Results and discussion\nA continued, systematic debate on common standards should therefore be a priority.\n\nIn addition, there are numerous ethical issues pertaining to xenotransplantation, which have been discussed for years (28)(29)(30)(31)(32)(33) and fall into three broad categories: the first argues that certain scientific experiments should simply not be undertaken; the second warns of unforeseen consequences of genetically altering organisms; and the third pertains to the suffering of involved animals.In addition, there is a continuous and heated debate about the permissibility of mixing animal and human material in the academic (34-36) as well as the public sector (37)(38)(39).\n\nThese ethical and legal questions need to be addressed before such an approach ever becomes routine.",

Rollin\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary The dream of transferring bodily organs from animals to humans goes back to antiquity, as articulated in the myth of Daedalus and Icarus. But the genuine possibility of xenotransplantation is largely a creature of the last half-century. That possibility raises a plethora of genuine ethical issues, as well as spurious ones occasioned by societal ignorance of science. Abstract There are three sorts of issues associated with genetic engineering and, by implication, with xenotransplantation. These are dangers associated with the technology, animal welfare issues, and the claim that genetic engineering represents a technology that humans should not embark upon. Using the hearts of pigs for humans in need of transplants has been a major issue in xenotransplantation. There are dangers associated with such use, such as immunological rejection of the organ, endogenous viruses infecting the recipients, and issues of privacy. In addition, the issue of fair distribution of organs arises. Animal welfare issues also arise, most notably the living conditions of the donor animals, issues notably present in confinement agriculture. A major issue emerges from animals\u2019 being kept under conditions that fail to meet the needs dictated by the animals\u2019 biological and psychological natures. Xenotransplantation animals will be kept under deprived laboratory conditions that similarly fail to meet the animals\u2019 natures. This is a significant concern for society in general. There are also issues of \u201cbad ethics\u201d arising from scientists\u2019 disavowal of ethical concerns in science. This in turn, coupled with societal ignorance of science, creates a climate for proliferation of religious and other non-rational concerns, such as the claim that xenotransplantation violates God\u2019s will. These spurious concerns can only be ameliorated when public understanding of science improves, and scientific understanding of ethics increases.\n## Dangers Associated with Xenotransplantation\nThus, there arises an ethical tension between the good of the recipient and the good of society. Correlatively, it is extremely unlikely that the identity of those receiving xenotransplants can be kept confidential, so it is quite possible that such people will be seen as significantly different, or even as \"freaks\", particularly if the recipient is a child and will likely be subject to taunting with locutions like \"pig heart\" regularly thrown at them, which in turn can cause significant psychological damage. Another ethical issue associated with xenotransplantation is the question of how such organs would be distributed. What is a fair way to assure equitable distribution of both risks and benefits [5]? \n\nIn sum, there are a variety of dangers associated with xenotransplantation, both for recipients and for the public at large. As yet, however, none of these projected dangers have come to pass, in part because there have been no successful xenotransplants. Governments have been extremely cautious about allowing unrestricted research into xenotransplantation to proceed, presumably because of societal hesitation regarding all aspects of biotechnology.",

George\n## Abstract\nEarly in 2022 the first pig to human cardiac xenotransplant was performed. The graft initially performed well, and rejection was well controlled. However, the graft failed, and the patient died 60 days after the procedure. The ethical issues relating to xenotransplantation include the risk/benefit to the individual, the risk of porcine-derived infectious agents crossing into humans, animal welfare and rights, issues of human and animal identity and concerns relating to fair allocation of organs and appropriate use of resources. These ethical issues are often addressed using emotional arguments, or through consequentialist or deontological lens. An alternative is to use approaches based on virtue ethics to understand the moral purpose (telos) of the research and the virtues (character traits) needed to be a good research clinician. In this review we will consider the virtues of justice, courage, temperance and practical wisdom, as well as the role of clinical curiosity, and their application to xenotransplantation. This provides an alternative approach for the clinical academic and others involved in the research to reflect on their practice.\n## Introduction\nIt is perhaps worth comparing this experience to the first cardiac allotransplants in the mid-1960s that typically lasted a few weeks. 29e ethics of xenotransplantation Xenotransplantation has raised considerable ethical discussion and has led to the production of guidelines and regulatory documents by a number of authoritative professional and governmental organisations. 30In general, the ethical debate has been informed by three ethical approaches; emotional, deontological and consequentialism.To a large extent the main lines of the ethical debate have been fixed for several decades.In this paper I will review some of the current debate, before looking at a different ethical framework, that of virtue ethics, to examine how that might inform the practice of scientists and doctors in the field of xenotransplantation.Some of the major ethical issues in xenotransplantation are shown in Table 1.These include the risk of porcine-derived infectious agents causing disease in humans; 31 awareness of the risk of zoonotic disease has been heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic. 32Other issues relate to the impact on the patient, the animal donors, identity and also issues relating to the allocation of organs and whether this is a resource effective solution to health challenges.In addition to these, ethical issues common to all clinical practice and research naturally apply equally to xenotransplantation. 33,34 Emotional Much of the response to xenotransplantation is an emotional response.People are either drawn to the concept or repulsed by the very idea of putting animal tissue in humans.These emotional responses have been of long standing.Many cultures have been fascinated in chimeras, fantastical mixtures of different animals. 44In equal measure, people have been long been horrified when medicine has been seen to cross certain boundaries; much of the antagonism to Jenner's cowpox vaccination stemmed from a belief it went against God and nature. 45enotransplantation excites an emotional response in many ways. 35,46Some people see interfering with the genetic makeup of pigs, especially if that involves the introduction of human genes, as crossing some form of moral boundary.For some this will be because scientists are disturbing the intrinsic nature of the species.",

Discussions are ongoing about the feasibility of addressing the organ shortage through measures like increasing organ donations, improving post\u2010transplant outcomes, and xenotransplantation. This paper examines the rationale, risks, and costs of xenotransplantation, such as xenozoonoses, creating a new form of industrialized animal farming, abandoning animal ethics principles, and the opportunity costs of investing finite research dollars in xenotransplantation instead of investing in more viable strategies. Alternative strategies that can ethically and effectively address the demand for heart, kidney, and other transplants are recommended: Improving disease prevention and management to reduce demand for transplant organs, improving transplantation methods, and systemic changes to donor policies and organ recovery methods to increase overall supply. Upon careful exploration of the full landscape of organ transplantation, it is considered whether these alternative strategies that do not impose the definite harms and significant risks of xenotransplantation are the most ethical and effective means to increase life\u2010saving options and improve clinical outcomes for patients in organ failure.",

Questions such as how to justly allocate organs among patients in need, which patients should be chosen as initial recipients of experimental xenotransplant, how to obtain informed consent from vulnerable populations, and how to ensure access to long-term novel immunosuppression are well considered in existing scholarship, while public health risks and the viability of alternative strategies to increase organ availability are given less coverage. In addition, there are myriad ethical issues related to nonhuman animals' use in xenotransplant research and practice, including their sentience, suffering, and moral status, but discussions fall short by making inappropriate comparisons to animal use for food or by focusing strictly on animal welfare. [12] ore comprehensive ethics considerations by all stakeholders, including the general public, are necessary to decide the societal acceptability and desirability of xenotransplantation research and commercialization. \n\nAs with animal agriculture, the large-scale farming of pigs for xenotransplantation requires animals to live truncated lives under unnatural conditions. Pathogen-free environments require excluding animals from their natural pasture habitat and raising them in sterile, indoor housing, which severely limits their natural range of animal behavior and social interactions. Captivity, isolation, handling, transport, and other standard conditions of modern pig farming cause significant stress responses in pigs, with a variety of biological and physiological consequences. [37] he number and type of animals at stake are not only the pigs used directly for each transplant, but also the pigs and primates used in research to refine xenotransplant methods and justify human recipient trials, as well as the animals used as feed. Furthermore, not every animal would be killed for their organs; some would be kept for breeding; and some would inevitably fail to meet the required criteria for organ viability, such as the absence of pathogens, and it is unlikely that these animals would be routed to environments in which they can flourish. Every pig and nonhuman primate used in these contexts is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering. [38]",

Krebs, Janine McCarthy, Kristie Sullivan, James Craner, Brendan Parent, Ann Lam\n## Abstract\nThe standard treatment for end\u2010stage organ failure is transplantation, but demand for organs has always vastly outstripped supply. Discussions are ongoing about the feasibility of addressing the organ shortage through measures like increasing organ donations, improving post\u2010transplant outcomes, and xenotransplantation. This paper examines the rationale, risks, and costs of xenotransplantation, such as xenozoonoses, creating a new form of industrialized animal farming, abandoning animal ethics principles, and the opportunity costs of investing finite research dollars in xenotransplantation instead of investing in more viable strategies. Alternative strategies that can ethically and effectively address the demand for heart, kidney, and other transplants are recommended: Improving disease prevention and management to reduce demand for transplant organs, improving transplantation methods, and systemic changes to donor policies and organ recovery methods to increase overall supply. Upon careful exploration of the full landscape of organ transplantation, it is considered whether these alternative strategies that do not impose the definite harms and significant risks of xenotransplantation are the most ethical and effective means to increase life\u2010saving options and improve clinical outcomes for patients in organ failure.\n## Introduction\nignificant immunological and technical limitations, ethical and moral implications, and clinical, public health, and environmental risks restrict xenotransplantation as a viable, mainstream treatment for organ failure. A more careful, balanced, and holistic consideration of these limitations is needed to critically reevaluate and inform the direction and sensibility of pursuing xenotransplantation. Such analyses have been carried out previously, [14,15] but the state of xenotransplant science has the practice closer to clinical trials than ever before and urgent action is needed to mitigate risks and costs. Although xenotransplant kidneys, hearts, pancreatic islet cells, and livers are currently being developed, we use heart failure as an example to explore the immunological, ethical, and economic limitations of xenotransplantation and examine alternative solutions to the transplant shortage that should take precedence. \n\nWe explore how xenotransplantation poses risks for individual human recipients and for public health due to the risks of xenozoonoses-infectious disease transmission from one species to another via xenotransplant; how it requires harm to nonhuman animals both in research and throughout its clinical implementation, and as it scales, how it will necessitate environmental impact; and how the significant investment in xenotransplantation will impose opportunity costs of diverting finite public and private funds away from the development and implementation of more viable strategies. Transplantation and xenotransplantation are both intended to treat end-stage organ failure caused by chronic diseases like coronary artery disease, adultonset diabetes, emphysema, and cirrhosis, many of which are preventable. Instead of concentrating attempts to make xenotransplantation more viable, we consider whether investments in proven public health measures that more effectively prevent and manage chronic diseases leading to organ failure would substantively reduce the need for transplantation in the first place. Finally, we propose more immediate strategies that should continue to be prioritized to improve outcomes and access for patients waiting for organ transplants, as well as specific policy changes that can dramatically improve the availability of human donor organs.\n\n## Ethical Concerns\n[35][36] These ethical issues are predominantly discussed under the assumption that xenotransplantation should proceed and focus on mitigating human-related concerns with further technical refinement and testing. Questions such as how to justly allocate organs among patients in need, which patients should be chosen as initial recipients of experimental xenotransplant, how to obtain informed consent from vulnerable populations, and how to ensure access to long-term novel immunosuppression are well considered in existing scholarship, while public health risks and the viability of alternative strategies to increase organ availability are given less coverage. In addition, there are myriad ethical issues related to nonhuman animals' use in xenotransplant research and practice, including their sentience, suffering, and moral status, but discussions fall short by making inappropriate comparisons to animal use for food or by focusing strictly on animal welfare. [12] ore comprehensive ethics considerations by all stakeholders, including the general public, are necessary to decide the societal acceptability and desirability of xenotransplantation research and commercialization. \n\nAs with animal agriculture, the large-scale farming of pigs for xenotransplantation requires animals to live truncated lives under unnatural conditions. Pathogen-free environments require excluding animals from their natural pasture habitat and raising them in sterile, indoor housing, which severely limits their natural range of animal behavior and social interactions. Captivity, isolation, handling, transport, and other standard conditions of modern pig farming cause significant stress responses in pigs, with a variety of biological and physiological consequences. [37] he number and type of animals at stake are not only the pigs used directly for each transplant, but also the pigs and primates used in research to refine xenotransplant methods and justify human recipient trials, as well as the animals used as feed. Furthermore, not every animal would be killed for their organs; some would be kept for breeding; and some would inevitably fail to meet the required criteria for organ viability, such as the absence of pathogens, and it is unlikely that these animals would be routed to environments in which they can flourish. Every pig and nonhuman primate used in these contexts is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering. [38]",

However, the different eligibility criteria, different gene-edited pigs used, and patients' grave conditions mean that their outcomes are unlikely to be commensurate with clinical trial outcomes. Accordingly, the information disclosed to prospective trial participants about such xenotransplants must be qualified. \n\nMagnifying these challenges is that few, if any, treatment alternatives for patients with end-stage kidney disease exist, which can render patients vulnerable and undermine voluntary decision-making [12,13]. Such vulnerability commonly occurs among patients undergoing innovative surgical procedures for which alternative standard treatments are either ineffective or nonexistent [21]. In regard to first-inhuman xenotransplant trials, waitlisted candidates may have exhausted all life-saving options, as in the Expanded Access xenotransplants. \n\nThe ethical challenges to informed consent comprise a component of translational research that requires resolution. Current federal regulations (i.e., the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984) lack guidance on informed consent for xenotransplant clinical trials [22]. Organ Procurement and Transplant Network policies only pertain to human organs. Thus, policies on information disclosure may not translate to the xenotransplant context. \n\nFew scholars have made headway in addressing this problem. Padilla and colleagues reviewed The US Department of Health and Human Services nine minimum elements that consent forms must include to protect human subjects, highlighting how these elements should be conveyed in the consent process and in the informed consent form for xenotransplantation [23]. Drawing upon this work, Cooper prepared an informed consent form template tailored to the xenotransplant trial context [24].",

Gordon, Mickael K. Gusmano, Jessica Gacki-Smith, Hannah L Brooks, Margaret M Matthews, Dahlya Manning, Joseph Leventhal, K. Maschke\n## Abstract\nTransplant programs preparing to initiate first\u2010in\u2010human pig kidney xenotransplant clinical trials must be especially careful when obtaining participants\u2019 informed consent. Little is known about the kind of information patients want for making an informed decision about trial participation.\n## Introduction\nThe unknown potential to transmit known and unknown diseases from the pig organ to human recipient [16,17] elevates the risk profile of first-in-human pig kidney xenotransplant trials. \n\nThe five xenotransplants (2 heart, 3 kidney) performed under the FDA's Expanded Access program [14,[18][19][20] provide some information about how xenotransplants functioned in those recipients (e.g., the fact that grafts survived 2 months). However, the different eligibility criteria, different gene-edited pigs used, and patients' grave conditions mean that their outcomes are unlikely to be commensurate with clinical trial outcomes. Accordingly, the information disclosed to prospective trial participants about such xenotransplants must be qualified. \n\nMagnifying these challenges is that few, if any, treatment alternatives for patients with end-stage kidney disease exist, which can render patients vulnerable and undermine voluntary decision-making [12,13]. Such vulnerability commonly occurs among patients undergoing innovative surgical procedures for which alternative standard treatments are either ineffective or nonexistent [21]. In regard to first-inhuman xenotransplant trials, waitlisted candidates may have exhausted all life-saving options, as in the Expanded Access xenotransplants. \n\nThe ethical challenges to informed consent comprise a component of translational research that requires resolution. Current federal regulations (i.e., the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984) lack guidance on informed consent for xenotransplant clinical trials [22]. Organ Procurement and Transplant Network policies only pertain to human organs. Thus, policies on information disclosure may not translate to the xenotransplant context. \n\nFew scholars have made headway in addressing this problem. Padilla and colleagues reviewed The US Department of Health and Human Services nine minimum elements that consent forms must include to protect human subjects, highlighting how these elements should be conveyed in the consent process and in the informed consent form for xenotransplantation [23]. Drawing upon this work, Cooper prepared an informed consent form template tailored to the xenotransplant trial context [24].",

While it provides hope for patients with irreversible organ failure, it also raises ethical, psychosocial, and regulatory issues. These issues challenge us both as human beings and in our relationship to animals and should be discussed among broader society. In order to elicit well-informed public opinion on the benefits and risks of xenotransplantation, we organized a citizens' conference. After deliberating over three weekends, the participants drafted an evaluative statement on xenotransplantation and made recommendations to scientists and policy makers. Overall, the citizen group considers the benefits of xenotransplantation to outweigh the risks, but calls for strict regulatory measures to ensure the development of a sustainable and ethically justifiable biotechnology. One hundred and ninety-five days. This is the period of time denoted for a scientific breakthrough in the field of xenotransplantation (XT) (La \u00a8ngin et al, 2018). Baboons survived for 6 months with a genetically modified pig heart. Bringing xenotransplantation to patients with the prospect of reducing the current shortage of donor organs has thus become more realistic. This success owes to significant progress regarding the immunological challenges of XT on the molecular level and by better genome editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 (Sykes & Sachs, 2019). The time has come to align the necessary infrastructure of policy making, legal, and medical regulation, political administration, market interests, and public opinion. \n\nWhile these advances in XT provide hope for patients with irreversible organ failure, they also raise ethical and philosophical issues: Is it ethically acceptable to breed animals and use them as an organic spare parts stock? What does it mean anthropologically for patients to live with an animal organ or animal tissue? How shall we balance the potential benefits and risks of XT therapies, given that everyone could potentially benefit as an organ recipient, but at the same time may risk acquiring a xenogeneic infectious disease?",

Baboons survived for 6 months with a genetically modified pig heart. Bringing xenotransplantation to patients with the prospect of reducing the current shortage of donor organs has thus become more realistic. This success owes to significant progress regarding the immunological challenges of XT on the molecular level and by better genome editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 (Sykes & Sachs, 2019). The time has come to align the necessary infrastructure of policy making, legal, and medical regulation, political administration, market interests, and public opinion. \n\nWhile these advances in XT provide hope for patients with irreversible organ failure, they also raise ethical and philosophical issues: Is it ethically acceptable to breed animals and use them as an organic spare parts stock? What does it mean anthropologically for patients to live with an animal organ or animal tissue? How shall we balance the potential benefits and risks of XT therapies, given that everyone could potentially benefit as an organ recipient, but at the same time may risk acquiring a xenogeneic infectious disease?",

The transplantation of non-human organs into human beings exposes the recipient and society to the risks of virus transmission (Sykes et. al., 2003).

                    "text": "Discussion about the ethics of xenotransplantation from the 1990s and early 2000s evolved as the science advanced. Initial concerns centered on whether animal-to-human transplants violate the laws of nature and whether it is wrong to sacrifice animals as organ donors to humans. Some feared social injustice by lopsided distribution of scarce resources to a few at the expense of broader basic medical care for all. Critics wondered whether xenotransplantation would endanger public health [7]. Other pressing questions touched on prerequisites for clinical trials: identifying acceptable risk-benefit thresholds and clinically defining success (extra days versus extra weeks or months of life, for example). Some questioned whether informed consent should be obtained from close contacts of the patient and medical personnel involved in the recipient's care, given concerns about zoonotic infection. It was argued that informed consent from recipients should include a broader set of risks including public attention, risk of transmitting disease and isolation. A final set of questions touched on who is responsible for oversight of clinical trials in xenotransplantation (local hospital review boards, national committees, or some combination)? \n\nEthicists and researchers considered the role of local institutional review boards (IRB) in approving xenotransplant clinical trials [8]. They argued that IRB members, particularly community members who may not have scientific or medical knowledge, would need ongoing education about xenotransplantation. They cited the model of the National Institutes of Health's Re-combinant DNA Advisory Committee, which focused initially on public fears about gene transfer but ultimately provided a public forum to discuss broader issues of gene transfer. IRBs would have to confront the inability of a subject to withdraw from a study once the xenotransplant had been made. In addition to ongoing training, the authors recommend that IRBs bring in nonvoting consultants to help them reach a decision, as well as involve hospital ethics committees in an advisory role, particularly for the ethical concerns of the post-transplant period. \n\nScholars have looked at societal and religious attitudes toward xenotransplantation, convening focus groups of local religious leaders, organ procurement organizations' staff, patients who need or have already received a transplant and local members of the business community [9].",

Bayliss\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT The fundamental ethical question of whether pig organs should be transplanted into humans has been settled, as recent surgeries demonstrating proof of concept demonstrate. Other issues need to be considered and reconciled before xenotransplantation of pig kidneys becomes a solution to the organ shortage for people waiting for a kidney transplant or as a viable alternative to the deceased donor or living donor human kidneys. Human trials will be needed beyond brain-dead individuals to show that xenotransplantation is safe from immunologic and infectious standpoints. Transplant centers will need to show that xenotransplantation provides a long-term benefit to recipients and is financially viable. If trials are successful and receive regulatory approval, pig xenotransplants may become another option for people waiting for a kidney. Before patients are discharged with a functioning xenograft, practical issues with ethical implications remain.\n## SOCIETAL CONSIDERATIONS\nDiscussion about the ethics of xenotransplantation from the 1990s and early 2000s evolved as the science advanced. Initial concerns centered on whether animal-to-human transplants violate the laws of nature and whether it is wrong to sacrifice animals as organ donors to humans. Some feared social injustice by lopsided distribution of scarce resources to a few at the expense of broader basic medical care for all. Critics wondered whether xenotransplantation would endanger public health [7]. Other pressing questions touched on prerequisites for clinical trials: identifying acceptable risk-benefit thresholds and clinically defining success (extra days versus extra weeks or months of life, for example). Some questioned whether informed consent should be obtained from close contacts of the patient and medical personnel involved in the recipient's care, given concerns about zoonotic infection. It was argued that informed consent from recipients should include a broader set of risks including public attention, risk of transmitting disease and isolation. A final set of questions touched on who is responsible for oversight of clinical trials in xenotransplantation (local hospital review boards, national committees, or some combination)? \n\nEthicists and researchers considered the role of local institutional review boards (IRB) in approving xenotransplant clinical trials [8]. They argued that IRB members, particularly community members who may not have scientific or medical knowledge, would need ongoing education about xenotransplantation. They cited the model of the National Institutes of Health's Re-combinant DNA Advisory Committee, which focused initially on public fears about gene transfer but ultimately provided a public forum to discuss broader issues of gene transfer. IRBs would have to confront the inability of a subject to withdraw from a study once the xenotransplant had been made. In addition to ongoing training, the authors recommend that IRBs bring in nonvoting consultants to help them reach a decision, as well as involve hospital ethics committees in an advisory role, particularly for the ethical concerns of the post-transplant period. \n\nScholars have looked at societal and religious attitudes toward xenotransplantation, convening focus groups of local religious leaders, organ procurement organizations' staff, patients who need or have already received a transplant and local members of the business community [9].",

Transfusion of human coagulation factors and complex immunosuppressive regimens have resulted in substantial improvements in recipient survival. The fundamental biological mechanisms of thrombocytopenia and coagulation dysregulation remain incompletely understood. Current studies demonstrate that porcine von Willebrand Factor binds more tightly to human platelet GPIb receptors due to increased O-linked glycosylation, resulting in increased human platelet activation. Porcine liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells phagocytose human platelets in an asialoglycoprotein receptor 1-dependent and CD40/CD154-dependent manner, respectively. Porcine Kupffer cells phagocytose human platelets via a species-incompatible SIRP\u03b1/CD47 axis. Key drivers of coagulation dysregulation include constitutive activation of the extrinsic clotting cascade due to failure of porcine tissue factor pathway inhibitor to repress recipient tissue factor. Additionally, porcine thrombomodulin fails to activate human protein C when bound by human thrombin, leading to a hypercoagulable state. Combined genetic modification of these key genes may mitigate liver xenotransplantation-induced thrombocytopenia and coagulation dysregulation, leading to greater recipient survival in pig-to-nonhuman primate liver xenotransplantation and, potentially, the first pig-to-human clinical trial.",

There will be unlimited access to undamaged organs and cells for transplantation and, eventually, donation from deceased or live human beings will become obsolete. Furthermore, it will be possible to alleviate graft rejection, at least in part, by genetic modification of the source animal. Currently, there are three major obstacles to performing transplantations from pig to man: 1) a powerful immune barrier, 2) a potential risk of transmitting microorganisms, particularly endogenous retrovirus and 3) ethical issues related to the future recipients and to society at large. This article will first discuss ongoing work with regards to overcoming the current obstacles. Then, the many potential advantages of using pig organs will be listed. Next, the criteria for selecting the first patients for transplantation with pig organs, will be briefly discussed. Finally, some promising observations made in the context of early attempts at transplanting porcine cells to patients, will be mentioned.",

One such issue concerns defining the harm/benefit ratio in the context of the initial clinical attempts. It might also be difficult to institute an appropriate informed-consent procedure. The fact that the patients will have to be monitored for possible infectious diseases for an extended time, possibly for life, is another ethical concern. \n\nMoreover, there are a number of ethical issues with regards to society at large. The public health hazard posed by the possible transmission and activation of PERV created considerable public concern a few years ago. The public debate that took place also generated some emotionally colored skepticism towards xenotransplantation, in which it was argued that \"transplantation from animal to man will violate the order of nature\". Other objections were with regard to the safety of the future recipients: \"xenotransplantation will constitute experimentation on sick human beings\". It is interesting to note that similar skepticism prevailed in the 1960s and 1970s when human organ transplantation was in its infancy. When it became apparent that transplantation could save a dying patient and bring him back to a normal life, the skepticism and the criticism abated. \n\nThe existence of national guidelines and of an official, institutional surveillance system are prerequisites for clinical trials with xenotransplantation. A number of countries, including the USA and the UK, already have guidelines in place, while others are lagging behind. This raises concerns that some such countries might initiate xenotransplantation programs and attract desperate patients in need of a transplant. The WHO has recently issued a statement against such \"xenotourism\".",

Groth\n## Abstract\nOnce pig organs can be transplanted into humans, transplantation will move into a new era. There will be unlimited access to undamaged organs and cells for transplantation and, eventually, donation from deceased or live human beings will become obsolete. Furthermore, it will be possible to alleviate graft rejection, at least in part, by genetic modification of the source animal. Currently, there are three major obstacles to performing transplantations from pig to man: 1) a powerful immune barrier, 2) a potential risk of transmitting microorganisms, particularly endogenous retrovirus and 3) ethical issues related to the future recipients and to society at large. This article will first discuss ongoing work with regards to overcoming the current obstacles. Then, the many potential advantages of using pig organs will be listed. Next, the criteria for selecting the first patients for transplantation with pig organs, will be briefly discussed. Finally, some promising observations made in the context of early attempts at transplanting porcine cells to patients, will be mentioned.\n## eThiCAl iSSueS\nThere are several ethical issues pertaining to clinical xenotransplantation. One such issue concerns defining the harm/benefit ratio in the context of the initial clinical attempts. It might also be difficult to institute an appropriate informed-consent procedure. The fact that the patients will have to be monitored for possible infectious diseases for an extended time, possibly for life, is another ethical concern. \n\nMoreover, there are a number of ethical issues with regards to society at large. The public health hazard posed by the possible transmission and activation of PERV created considerable public concern a few years ago. The public debate that took place also generated some emotionally colored skepticism towards xenotransplantation, in which it was argued that \"transplantation from animal to man will violate the order of nature\". Other objections were with regard to the safety of the future recipients: \"xenotransplantation will constitute experimentation on sick human beings\". It is interesting to note that similar skepticism prevailed in the 1960s and 1970s when human organ transplantation was in its infancy. When it became apparent that transplantation could save a dying patient and bring him back to a normal life, the skepticism and the criticism abated. \n\nThe existence of national guidelines and of an official, institutional surveillance system are prerequisites for clinical trials with xenotransplantation. A number of countries, including the USA and the UK, already have guidelines in place, while others are lagging behind. This raises concerns that some such countries might initiate xenotransplantation programs and attract desperate patients in need of a transplant. The WHO has recently issued a statement against such \"xenotourism\".",

However, the development of new technologies without proper legislative preparation raises significant moral and ethical considerations. This paper provides an overview of the current state of xenotransplantology, highlighting its revolutionary potential alongside the moral dilemmas it entails.\nAim of the study: The aim of this study is to assess current social, ethical, religious, and legal trends regarding the issue of xenotransplantation.\nMaterials and methods: To obtain up-to-date information concerning trends in xenotransplantation, a review of the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, along with the latest legislative reports in both Europe and Poland, was performed.\nConclusions: Firstly, the authors briefly report on the current situation concerning transplantology and the widely spread organ donor crisis. Next, the issue of species boundaries and the moral status of non-human animals is addressed. The assessment of ethical implications of utilizing animals as organ donors is examined, along with the legal acts regulating this issue. Moreover, the authors attempt to evaluate the cultural and religious differences related to this concern. Furthermore, this study discusses the allocation and distribution of xenotransplants, considering issues of justice, fairness, and access to this innovative medical technology. Lastly, the paper delves into the risks and uncertainties associated with xenotransplantation, including the possibility of cross-species disease transmission and intensified course of organ rejection disease.\n",

Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) now are the most common indications for LT, reflecting the impact of the obesity epidemic and increased alcohol consumption. Advances in pharmacotherapy for MAFLD and tailored protocols for ALD management are reducing disease progression and improving outcomes. The inclusion of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) as transplant indications highlights progress in chemotherapy and patient selection. Technologies like normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) are expanding the donor pool, while xenotransplantation and organ rehabilitation offer transformative solutions to organ shortages. As the population ages, LT programs must address challenges in older patients and explore minimally invasive approaches for donors and recipients. By integrating innovation and multidisciplinary expertise, LT will continue to provide life-saving care while adapting to the needs of diverse patient populations.",

Advances in gene editing, including CRISPR technology, have reduced the risk of hyperacute rejection, bringing xenotransplantation closer to clinical application [49]. If successful, xenotransplantation could dramatically expand the organ pool, reducing the need for both deceased and live donors. \n\nHowever, several challenges remain before xenotransplantation can become a routine clinical practice. Concerns about zoonotic disease transmission, long-term immunological compatibility, and ethical questions surrounding the use of animal organs in humans must be addressed. Regulatory frameworks are still developing, and more data are needed to assess the long-term viability and safety of xenotransplanted organs. Despite these hurdles, xenotransplantation has the potential to fundamentally alter LT, providing organs to patients who might otherwise be excluded due to organ shortages.",

Dharmayan, Jason Mial-Anthony, Abiha Abdullah, Charbel Elias, Godwin Packiaraj, Sabin Subedi, Michele Molinari\n## Abstract\nLiver transplantation (LT) in the United States is evolving in response to shifting disease patterns, innovative therapies, and technological advancements. Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) now are the most common indications for LT, reflecting the impact of the obesity epidemic and increased alcohol consumption. Advances in pharmacotherapy for MAFLD and tailored protocols for ALD management are reducing disease progression and improving outcomes. The inclusion of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) as transplant indications highlights progress in chemotherapy and patient selection. Technologies like normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) are expanding the donor pool, while xenotransplantation and organ rehabilitation offer transformative solutions to organ shortages. As the population ages, LT programs must address challenges in older patients and explore minimally invasive approaches for donors and recipients. By integrating innovation and multidisciplinary expertise, LT will continue to provide life-saving care while adapting to the needs of diverse patient populations.\n## The Future of Xenotransplantation\nXenotransplantation, particularly the use of genetically modified pig livers, holds promise as a long-term solution to the organ shortage crisis. Advances in gene editing, including CRISPR technology, have reduced the risk of hyperacute rejection, bringing xenotransplantation closer to clinical application [49]. If successful, xenotransplantation could dramatically expand the organ pool, reducing the need for both deceased and live donors. \n\nHowever, several challenges remain before xenotransplantation can become a routine clinical practice. Concerns about zoonotic disease transmission, long-term immunological compatibility, and ethical questions surrounding the use of animal organs in humans must be addressed. Regulatory frameworks are still developing, and more data are needed to assess the long-term viability and safety of xenotransplanted organs. Despite these hurdles, xenotransplantation has the potential to fundamentally alter LT, providing organs to patients who might otherwise be excluded due to organ shortages.",

            "text": "However, with this promise comes a complex web of ethical considerations and legal frameworks that must be carefully navigated to ensure the responsible and ethical translation of xenotransplantation from the laboratory to the clinic. With this we must ensure that the same endemic issues do not occur with xenotransplantation that have occurred with human organ transplantation such as xenotransplant tourism (5) and unethical processes used to make profits at the expense of the animals used and the patients that may be misled into undertaking unapproved procedures (6). \n\nHistorically, xenotransplantation has faced significant challenges, including the perceived/potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans (xenozoonosis) (7), concerns over animal welfare (when breeding and producing the donor animals) (8), cultural and religious issues particularly the notion of crossing species boundaries in the use of their tissues for transplantation (6). These challenges led to the imposition of strict regulations along with embargos and a nuanced ethical debate that continues to shape the direction of the field. In recent years, ground-breaking advancements in genetic engineering has rapidly accelerated the field which offers new hope, massively advancing the creation of genetically modified pigs with organs engineered for compatibility with the human immune system (9). These developments have paved the way for the initiation of trials in humans involving xeno-hearts approved under \"compassionate use\" for live patients (10) along with xeno-hearts and kidneys being studied clinically in a new model using \"Brain Dead\" recipients (11,12) along with very successful preclinical trials using transgenic pig islet cells (13). \n\nIn this review, we explore the ethical and legislative advances that are underpinning xenotransplantation as it moves toward broadly accepted clinical translation. We delve into the ethical considerations surrounding xenotransplantation, examining questions related to the potential risks of xenozoonotic disease transmission, animal rights, their use, and the public's perception of this innovative medical approach. We also survey the changes in legislative frameworks governing xenotransplantation, charting their evolution over time, and highlighting the necessity of harmonization and standardisation in regulations worldwide.",

This paper summarises the content of the expert lectures showcasing the progress which has been made in xenotransplantation including\u2014the history of xenotransplantation, advances in gene edited animals and progress towards clinical xenotransplantation. We then set out the ethical and legal issues still to be resolved. Finally, we report the themes of the roundtable discussion highlighting areas of consensus and controversy. While the detail of the legal discussion was directed towards the UK, the principles and summary reported here are intended to be applicable to any jurisdiction seeking to implement clinical xenotransplantation.",

As such there has been significant engagement with both societal and religious organizations to ensure robust understanding of the key concepts and garner opinion and support (6,35,36). \n\nThe IXA has endeavored to undertake public engagement with ongoing dialogue which are essential to fostering trust with transparency and acceptance. It is incumbent on the broader scientific community and policymakers to communicate the steps taken to mitigate ethical concerns and to provide evidence of the rigorous ethical oversight and animal welfare standards applied in xenotransplantation research. Furthermore the governing organization of xenotransplantation the IXA is maintaining its mission to promote xenotransplantation as a safe, ethical, and effective therapeutic modality by; fostering the science of xenotransplantation through promotion of ethical clinical and pre-clinical research, productive discourse, and collaboration; along with further educating health care providers and lay persons through broad, representative participation interactive public debate; and also guiding the development of scientifically sound, internationally consistent public policy that is responsive to new developments in the field and acknowledges varying social, ethical and legal frameworks (37). Along with ongoing engagement with regulatory bodies and other agencies to ensure they balance the advancement of science but safeguarding the ethical principles. This is actively being undertaken with a strong push from the IXA to engage numerous agencies globally to ensure this continues to occur and keep pace with the rapidly developing technologies (8).",

To facilitate that deliberation and ensure that the wide range of ethical issues are given due consideration, we have proposed a framework that incorporates both substantive and procedural ethical values and can be used to address pa-tient selection criteria for xenotransplant clinical trials.\n\nThe assessment of benefits and risks should ensure that a trial has significant social benefit to justify excess risks that are not justified by a compensatory potential benefit to patients. The transplant team should have a heightened sensitivity to the distributive and procedural justice concerns of psychosocial criteria used in transplant listing decisions. Efforts should be made to enhance the social support available to a patient, rather than using psychosocial criteria solely to determine the listing of potential candidates. Procuring informed and voluntary consent should represent a deliberative process that occurs over several days, with participation by a representative of the hospital's clinical ethics committee. Discussions of these ethical issues among ethicists and transplant investigators in combination with further technological advances in xenotransplantation can move the status of xenotransplantation forward to a reality.",

These ethical issues are often addressed using emotional arguments, or through consequentialist or deontological lens. An alternative is to use approaches based on virtue ethics to understand the moral purpose (telos) of the research and the virtues (character traits) needed to be a good research clinician.

            "text": "One of the most pressing ethical dilemmas in xenotransplantation is the selection of patients for clinical trials. Current recommendations prioritize critically ill patients who have exhausted all other therapeutic options. However, this approach has been criticized for its potential to produce unfavorable risk-benefit ratios, particularly for patients with complex medical conditions. Furthermore, concerns about justice and beneficence arise when considering acutely ill patients who may struggle to provide fully informed consent [19]. \n\nCardiac xenotransplantation is also actively being explored for pediatric patients-a population in which few therapeutic options exist at all. Successful xenotransplantation could represent a bridge to allotransplantation or a potential long-term solution for this vulnerable population. Genetically modified pig hearts offer considerable promise in alleviating growing waitlists and reducing high mortality rates among pediatric patients [20]. However, the ethical challenges surrounding pediatric xenotransplantation are complex. Issues such as informed consent-particularly for minors-and the psychosocial impacts on patients and their families further complicate the discourse. Public perception adds another layer of difficulty, especially when determining whether adults or children should be prioritized in early clinical trials. Efforts to address these challenges include developing transparent patient selection frameworks prioritizing medical need, equitable access, and rigorous informed consent processes, particularly for vulnerable groups such as pediatric patients [21]. By integrating these considerations, the field can progress in a way that balances innovation with justice and beneficence",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation marks a qualitatively new challenge in medical technology assessment. The reasons for this claim are twofold: (i) in contrast to more traditional medical interventions, xenotransplantation involves risks not only to the patient, but also to larger segments of society, thus to public health in general. (ii) while most medical technologies demand assessment and risk-management at the time when the technology is sufficiently developed to be put into practice, xenotransplantation demands pro-active action at a very early stage of development. A particular challenge for any assessment of xenotransplantation is the inclusion of a satisfactory approach to the ethical issues involved. In itself this is, of course, not particular/unique to xenotransplantation, as most medical interventions need a good consideration of ethics. But seen in connection with the two characteristics mentioned above, this amounts to a truly formidable task. Given that discussions about xenotransplantation are rather recent, and given that a real scientific development is \u2013 luckily I am inclined to say \u2013 still pending and assumedly not to be expected for several years to come, it is not surprising that the debate about the ethics involved is still very tentative. Several academic papers and several government reports from a variety of countries do indeed deal with the ethical issues of xenotransplantation. But it is, as far as I can see, still too early to say that a general consensus has been reached about what precisely the ethical issues are, and, more importantly, how best to deal with them. What is important, though, is that the discussion about ethics in xenotransplantation has started, and that it follows the medical-scientific advances very closely. This is in itself a consoling reminder that ethical awareness in modern societies is coming more and more to the fore front of public debate, and that ethics is put on the agenda, including the political agenda, like never before. In this paper I shall leave out a number of ethical issues that need to be dealt with if the ethical assessment is to be comprehensive. These are e.g. issues concerning animal welfare and ethics, issues concerning standard medical ethics about how to prepare patients for serious medical interventions, or issues concerning what could be considered a equitable distribution of scarce",

This concern has some regulatory agencies, such as the Council of Europe Recommendations Rec (2003) 10 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on xenotransplantation, Article 21, stating that patients may have to waiver some of their human rights for close follow-up and monitoring.\n\nRegulatory and legal aspects will require worldwide cooperation for the initiation and growth of xenotransplant. Owing to the pervasive effects of globalization and unequal availability of healthcare and regulatory policies across regions, individuals seeking xenotransplantation may resort to traveling to countries with looser policies for the life-saving procedure, imposing increased risks for zoonosis upon their return home where animal husbandry and organ screening regulations are more stringent [71].\n\nMoreover, there are questions if a collective consent should be required prior to initiation of xenotransplant trials since this procedure may carry risks for a broader population beyond the patients participating in the study [71].",

Cardiac xenotransplantation has been proposed as one therapeutic alternative for neonates and infants, either in lieu of allotransplantation or as a bridge until an allograft becomes available. Scientific and clinical developments in xenotransplantation appear likely to permit cardiac xenotransplantation clinical trials in adults in the coming years. The ethical issues around xenotransplantation of the heart and other organs and tissues have recently been examined, but to date, only limited literature is available on the ethical issues that are attendant with pediatric heart xenotransplantation. Here, we summarize the ethical issues, focusing on (1) whether cardiac xenotransplantation should proceed in adults or children first, (2) pediatric recipient selection for initial xenotransplantation trials, (3) special problems regarding informed consent in this context, and (4) related psychosocial and public perception considerations. We conclude with specific recommendations regarding ethically informed design of pediatric heart xenotransplantation trials.",

In this sense, it is intended to assist in the ethical analysis of the potential benefits of the technique, in light of the questions inherent to its research and possible implementation. On the one hand, xenotransplantation has the potential to solve the chronic shortage of human organs for transplantation, reducing deaths resulting from the lack of organs and the waiting lists. On the other hand, it raises several issues that must be widely analyzed and democratically debated by society, such as: the risk of xenozoonosis, the use of non-human animals, the limitation of the privacy of recipients of organs of animal origin, collection protocols of free and informed consent and the use of brain-dead patients in experiments. Thus, it is concluded that, even if clinical obstacles are overcome in the future and it is possible to successfully perform xenotransplantation of organs, it is essential to carefully evaluate the pros and cons before deciding on its continuity.",

            "text": "The history of xenotransplantation is peppered with optimistic predictions about its imminence and feasibility. In 1969, the Nobel winning transplant immunologist Peter Medawar hypothesised that We should solve the problem [of organ transplantation] by using heterografts [xenografts]  one day if we try hard enough, and maybe in less than 15 years. 1 More than 20 years later, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics predicted that the first pig to human xenotransplants would be performed in 1996. 2 What followed was almost 30 more years of intense research focused on the remaining immunological and infectious challenges. However, in 2022, xenotransplantation was thrust back into mainstream transplant discourse following two significant developments. First were the reports of two genetically engineered (GE) pig kidneys transplanted into deceased human recipients, mechanically maintained after death by neurological criteria (decedents). 3 4 6][7] This resurgence of activity, in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic, comes at a time when public and professional anxieties about zoonoses, public health and experimental treatments are all running high. \n\nIt was on this background that in late 2022 King's College London, with endorsement from the British Transplant Society, and the European Society of Organ Transplantation, brought together a group of experts in xenotransplantation science, ethics and law. This symposium, the first of its kind in the UK for 20 years, aimed to discuss the ethical, regulatory, and technical challenges surrounding translating xenotransplantation into the clinical setting. First, a series of three lectures showcased the progress which has been made in xenotransplantation including-the history of xenotransplantation, advances in gene edited animals and preclinical research activities. Following these were sessions introducing ethical and legal concerns. Finally, a roundtable discussion was held. This paper follows this structure first summarising the content of the expert lectures. Then, we report on the broad themes identified in the ethical and legal sessions and the third and final section reflects on the roundtable discussion, highlighting areas of consensus and controversy.",

            "text": "[35][36] These ethical issues are predominantly discussed under the assumption that xenotransplantation should proceed and focus on mitigating human-related concerns with further technical refinement and testing. Questions such as how to justly allocate organs among patients in need, which patients should be chosen as initial recipients of experimental xenotransplant, how to obtain informed consent from vulnerable populations, and how to ensure access to long-term novel immunosuppression are well considered in existing scholarship, while public health risks and the viability of alternative strategies to increase organ availability are given less coverage. In addition, there are myriad ethical issues related to nonhuman animals' use in xenotransplant research and practice, including their sentience, suffering, and moral status, but discussions fall short by making inappropriate comparisons to animal use for food or by focusing strictly on animal welfare. [12] ore comprehensive ethics considerations by all stakeholders, including the general public, are necessary to decide the societal acceptability and desirability of xenotransplantation research and commercialization. \n\nAs with animal agriculture, the large-scale farming of pigs for xenotransplantation requires animals to live truncated lives under unnatural conditions. Pathogen-free environments require excluding animals from their natural pasture habitat and raising them in sterile, indoor housing, which severely limits their natural range of animal behavior and social interactions. Captivity, isolation, handling, transport, and other standard conditions of modern pig farming cause significant stress responses in pigs, with a variety of biological and physiological consequences. [37] he number and type of animals at stake are not only the pigs used directly for each transplant, but also the pigs and primates used in research to refine xenotransplant methods and justify human recipient trials, as well as the animals used as feed. Furthermore, not every animal would be killed for their organs; some would be kept for breeding; and some would inevitably fail to meet the required criteria for organ viability, such as the absence of pathogens, and it is unlikely that these animals would be routed to environments in which they can flourish. Every pig and nonhuman primate used in these contexts is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering. [38]",

            "text": "The word \"Xenos\" is a Greek word meaning foreign or strange. Xenografting is heterologous transplantation involving the grafting of viable cells, tissues, or organs between two species (e.g., a dog and a pig). It is a cross-species transplantation method. The continued demand for viable organs, tissues, and cells brought about by end-stage organ failure and chronic diseases has been the driving force in this medical/scientific research and practice [25]. However, it has been confronted with the significant challenges of immunological barriers and ethical issues. Organ rejection is widespread in xenotransplantation. In humans, for instance, natural antibodies circulate in the blood, and these cause instant transplant rejection when the organdonating species is, for example, a pig. Again, the complement systems are often activated each time organs from pigs are grafted into humans or primates and are highly prone to profound system toxicity due to the central role played by the complement system in body homeostasis and metabolism [26]. The porcine complementary proteins are foreign to primate complement regulatory systems. Studies have shown that genetic engineering may be a way out of this complementary system challenge if pigs are genetically modified to contain some human complement regulatory proteins in their cells [27]. \n\nAnother fundamental challenge facing xenograft is ethical issues. Three ethical issues quickly come to mind when we talk of xenotransplantation: animal rights (effects on the donor animal), human rights (the impact on the human population and the impact on the individual recipient), and interference with nature. An animal rights issue arises because animals, like humans, also have rights to existence and should not be sacrificed in favor of humans [28]. Human rights regarding the recipient can quickly be cleared by obtaining the necessary informed consent. Still, the populace also needs authorization because of the possibility of transferring new pathogens from animal to human populations -a public health risk [1]. The ethical issue of interference with nature may not be so applied. It may be understandable that by interfering with nature, man can free himself from the extinction effects of some natural phenomena [28].",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation is fraught with numerous ethical and social dilemmas, encompassing substantial costs and resource allocations essential for the research endeavor. Questions abound regarding the potential benefits of this scientific pursuit, along with lingering concerns regarding animal rights, animal welfare, and the genetic manipulation of animals designed for human consumption. Additionally, there is a pervasive apprehension surrounding the prospect of xenozoonosis, adding a layer of complexity to the ethical discourse surrounding this innovative field [6,43,61]. \n\nThe advantages of cXT are evident, particularly in light of the extensive waiting list for donors coupled with the scarcity of donor organs [9,62]. However, its true efficacy emerges when the long-term outcomes approach those of allotransplantation [6]. The application of GM techniques has been instrumental in bridging the gap between species, as demonstrated by the extension of survival time without rejection in humans with genetically modified pig hearts, reaching an impressive additional two months [35,36]. These successes underscore the potential for cXT to evolve into a pivotal solution for the organ transplant shortage. Looking ahead, the remarkable progress in genetic technology, coupled with the support of artificial intelligence (AI), holds the promise of further elevating cardiac transplantation [63][64][65]. This trajectory suggests a future where the shortage of organs for transplant may be effectively addressed through the continued refinement of genetic techniques and the integration of advanced technologies. \n\nAnimal rights activists contend that animals possess emotions and resist being utilized as donors for heart transplants. Despite being a source of food for millennia, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of animals for living organs [66,67]. Some religious traditions, such as Judaism and Islam, prohibit pork consumption, yet some leaders consider pig organ transplants acceptable to preserve human life. For vegetarians, an ethical dilemma arises regarding sacrificing the lives of animals to save others, since animals and humans are also sentient beings [68]. Despite these ethical considerations, pigs remain a suitable donor source for heart transplantation [42]. \n\nThe interaction between a genetically modified pig heart and the human body, particularly concerning mental health, poses uncertainties. Recipient patients must be informed about this matter, considering its acceptance and addressing potential social issues [38,69].",

            "text": "Organ transplantation raises numerous ethical issues. Even transplanting kidneys from deceased human donors with their prior consent can raise some ethical concerns. For example, we may wonder about the conditions under which their consent is secured, or question a definition of death [1,2]; we may find the content and consequences of their consent objectionable, as when racist donors agree to transplants provided priority is given to members of their own race when distributing their organs [3]; or we may object to transplants of certain organs, such as wombs, because of the possible effects on third parties, such as the baby growing with immunosuppressants [4]. \n\nIn cases of xenotransplantation, when the donor and the recipient belong to different species, further issues arise, regarding (i) the unavoidable harms to the donor and (ii) the possible harms to the recipients. When the donor is a chimeric pig, designed to contain a percentage of human genes and cells, xenotransplantation provokes two opposing sets of reactions [5]. \n\nFor some, the use of human-pig chimeras strengthens both recipient-based and donor-based objections, rendering xenotransplantation more objectionable or even impermissible. Many feel an aversion to such a deep transgression of the natural order, for reasons that may be theological, ecological, or involve human dignity, animal rights or fear of scientists yet again producing undesirable, unforeseen, and irreversible consequences. Others have more specific concerns. For example, the US National Institutes of Health suspended funding of their chimeric xenotransplantation program in 2015 over concerns about introducing human DNA into a member of another species, and particularly doing so at such an early developmental stage. As Carrie Wolinetz, Salz Institute's Associate Director for Science Policy, explains: 'people were concerned about human cells populating the brain of the animal or the germline of the animal' [6]. In the first case, the animal might acquire morally relevant human traits; in the second case, the animal might transmit human genes and traits to its offspring, for example, if accidentally released into the wild.",

            "text": "Jaboulay used the vascular technique to transplant a pig kidney onto the brachial artery and cephalic vein of a 48-yr-old woman. Immediately and for the first day and a half he saw significant urine output, but on the third day, he was forced to remove the kidney because of vascular thrombosis (17). Sadly, a lack of understanding of immunology, hematology and any of the intricacies of transplantation, let alone the issues of cross-species xenotransplantation prevented any chance of longerterm success. These early attempts were characterized by a lack of ethical and scientific groundwork, and the risks and consequences of such procedures were often not well understood. \n\nThe ensuing centuries saw sporadic and largely unsuccessful attempts at xenotransplantation, with frequent instances of graft rejection and infections that further tempered enthusiasm for the field (18-20). Moreover, as medical ethics evolved and animal welfare concerns gained prominence, the scientific community was challenged to grapple with the significant ethical implications of these procedures, especially when it came to the use of animals involved in the pre-clinical trials and as a source of organs, tissues and cells for transplantation into humans (6). \n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, with the advent of organ transplantation and the increasing demand for donor organs, the potential of xenotransplantation was revisited with renewed enthusiasm pushing the field forward. The discovery of alpha Gal as the mechanism responsible for causing hyperacute rejection (HAR) (21) and the concept of utilizing specifically designed genetically modified pigs (9,13,22), capable of providing organs less immunogenic to the human immune system, marked a significant turning point in xenotransplantation's history. These developments paved the way for the initiation of initial clinical trials involving xeno-kidneys and soon to be islet cell xenotransplants. \n\nAs we explore the ethical and legislative advances propelling xenotransplantation toward clinical translation, we must acknowledge the lessons of history. The historical backdrop of early, less-informed attempts, coupled with ethical concerns, has played an instrumental role in shaping the ethical and legislative frameworks we see today (23).",

Correlatively, it is extremely unlikely that the identity of those receiving xenotransplants can be kept confidential, so it is quite possible that such people will be seen as significantly different, or even as \"freaks\", particularly if the recipient is a child and will likely be subject to taunting with locutions like \"pig heart\" regularly thrown at them, which in turn can cause significant psychological damage. Another ethical issue associated with xenotransplantation is the question of how such organs would be distributed. What is a fair way to assure equitable distribution of both risks and benefits [5]? \n\nIn sum, there are a variety of dangers associated with xenotransplantation, both for recipients and for the public at large. As yet, however, none of these projected dangers have come to pass, in part because there have been no successful xenotransplants. Governments have been extremely cautious about allowing unrestricted research into xenotransplantation to proceed, presumably because of societal hesitation regarding all aspects of biotechnology.",

The problematic aspects of XTP, from an ethical perspective, although not addressed in the article, are evoked in their theoretical relevance for the concept of justification, in an ethical, normative sense. Preliminary conceptual and terminological clarifications are offered by the authors so as to make clear what is meant, after all, by \u201cnature\u201d, both in a narrow sense and in its relevance to ethical discussions. The current debate around issues of normative and naturalist nature and ethics is reviewed in several aspects, culminating in an alternative system to be developed and proposed.",

Bach, an authority on xenotransplantation at Harvard Medical School, opined that helping individuals relieve pain was an adequate justification for the risk to the public, which was known to exist but could not be quantified at the time.The consensus was that xenotransplantation is ultimately an ethical issue rather than a technical one [11].At about that time, many countries around the world began to consider the ethical governance and legal issues around xenotransplantation.\n\nChina was late in starting xenotransplantation research.Some medical universities have performed xenotransplantation in animal models and have carried out related preclinical research.Some of these studies have been supported by major national projects in China.The number of articles on preclinical studies of xenotransplantation published in the journal China Organ Transplantation is increasing each year, as is the number of articles on xenotransplantation considered at the annual National Organ Transplantation Academic Conference.Nevertheless, ethical issues are hardly discussed.",

            "text": "We also aim to apply lessons learned through historical analysis to reveal bioethical concerns that are critically underdiscussed. Organ transplantation appears poised on the precipice of spectacular, paradigmatic change. However, little has been done to show that xenotransplantation will not also fall victim to the issues currently troubling traditional organ transplantation. Without this analysis, researchers, physicians, and patients may adopt ostensible solutions plagued by the same problems they were meant to solve. If the set of reasons concerning why so many would-be transplant recipients suffer and die are connected to a broader network of social and cultural considerations, it would follow that simply replacing human donors with nonhuman donors would fail to rectify the many problems within today's transplant practices. \n\nUsing the current shortfalls of traditional organ transplantation as a justification for shifting to xenotransplantation leaves us vulnerable to repeating past mistakes, particularly when we discover that the rhetoric around xenotransplantation research today paints an alarmingly optimistic, solutionoriented picture. Moreover, xenotransplantation has not yet engaged with a number of critical ethical issues, such as how human subjects will be used as the proving ground for this therapy. Broad and thorough bioethical outlining can protect against a similar fate befalling xenotransplantation practice in the future. In other words, if we work to synergize historical and bioethical perspectives today, we may generate positive downstream effects on researchers, patients, and non-human animals within a new biomedical system of relationships and practices. \n\nOne tool at our disposal for generating these positive effects is bioethics, one of the most important institutions in biomedical research for helping to orchestrate, buffer, and rebuff the complex web of interactions guiding medical research. This system includes a robust legal framework guiding research and protecting patients, a governing and review body present at most research institutions, and an informal network of academics, scientists, lawyers, researchers, theologians, philosophers, and, indeed, the public itself. All individuals and groups involved are tasked with protecting the most vulnerable in society while biomedical research continues to seek new heights in knowledge and understanding. \n\nNevertheless, bioethics was born in response to history.",

            "text": "Simple Summary The dream of transferring bodily organs from animals to humans goes back to antiquity, as articulated in the myth of Daedalus and Icarus. But the genuine possibility of xenotransplantation is largely a creature of the last half-century. That possibility raises a plethora of genuine ethical issues, as well as spurious ones occasioned by societal ignorance of science. Abstract There are three sorts of issues associated with genetic engineering and, by implication, with xenotransplantation. These are dangers associated with the technology, animal welfare issues, and the claim that genetic engineering represents a technology that humans should not embark upon. Using the hearts of pigs for humans in need of transplants has been a major issue in xenotransplantation. There are dangers associated with such use, such as immunological rejection of the organ, endogenous viruses infecting the recipients, and issues of privacy. In addition, the issue of fair distribution of organs arises. Animal welfare issues also arise, most notably the living conditions of the donor animals, issues notably present in confinement agriculture. A major issue emerges from animals\u2019 being kept under conditions that fail to meet the needs dictated by the animals\u2019 biological and psychological natures. Xenotransplantation animals will be kept under deprived laboratory conditions that similarly fail to meet the animals\u2019 natures. This is a significant concern for society in general. There are also issues of \u201cbad ethics\u201d arising from scientists\u2019 disavowal of ethical concerns in science. This in turn, coupled with societal ignorance of science, creates a climate for proliferation of religious and other non-rational concerns, such as the claim that xenotransplantation violates God\u2019s will. These spurious concerns can only be ameliorated when public understanding of science improves, and scientific understanding of ethics increases.",

            "text": "As stated in the latest Changsha Communiqu\u00e9, public engagement and consultation are important to build societal acceptance of a new treatment that exposes the world's population to new risks, including the remote risk that xenotransplantation could expose humankind to the emergence of a new pandemic infection [63]. \n\nUntil now, public engagement regarding xenotransplantation trials has not been systematically undertaken. Active research in the field of xenotransplantation in the 1990s/2000s was associated with several reports related to the ethical and safety aspects of xenotransplantation [65,66]. Overall, these were favorable, with support of xenotransplantation by the major religions based on easing the suffering of patients if the basic principles of biomedical ethics are observed and animals are treated humanely and with respect [65,67,68]. \n\nA common assumption is that patients with end-stage organ failure who are not eligible for allotransplantation will be enthusiastic participants in xenotransplantation programs and several studies have demonstrated this [3]. However, this has not always been the case, as one study reported that a proportion of acutecare nurses were opposed to xenotransplantation, although this was in the late 1980s when primates were the donors of choice for clinical xenotransplantation [69]. This negative perception has changed as there seems to be less issue with the pig as the donor source animal. However, concerns raised include animal rights and welfare, patient acceptance and informed consent, risk of infectious diseases, and broader public health issues [70]. \n\nThe costs of organ transplantation underlie the potential for inappropriate or corrupt practices in living donor or even cadaveric organ donation in poorer socioeconomic countries. The gap between demand and supply of organs for transplant has led to organ trafficking, organ tourism, and commercialism. This problem remains an overwhelmingly negative issue and raises ethical dilemmas that could be resolved if xenotransplantation were successful and broadly adopted [5,71]. Additionally, multiorgan donation costs are extensive, complicating current financial repatriation to the donor family, donor hospitals, organ donor agencies, and all involved in the extensive logistics of the organ donor process.",

While HAR has been alleviated owing to gene-editing technologies, DXR and chronic rejection remain urgent issues to be solved. Another concern focuses on PERVs transmission, which is a major hurdle to the clinical use of pig cells, tissues, and organs for treatment of organ failure in humans. However, it is still uncertain whether PERVs is pathogenic to humans, or if it could recombine with hERVs to form new viruses. Genetic engineering techniques such as CRIPSR/Cas9 genome editing system could prevent their activation or delete them from the pig cells (245,246). Further, the ethical issues around xenotransplantation have not been sufficiently discussed. Strict medical and ethical guidelines and regulations are needed before clinical applications can be tried on selected patients. Beyond the common ethical and technical issues shared by the different areas of xenotransplantation, there are also organ-specific barriers that are briefly addressed below.",

            "text": "This review aims to show and illustrate the history, current, ethical considerations, and limitations concerning xenotransplantation. Due to the current shortage of available donor organs for transplantation, many alternative sources are being examined to solve the donor shortage. One of them is xenotransplantation which refers to the transplantation of organs from one species to another. Compared to other nonhuman primates (NHP), pigs are ideal species for organ harvesting as they rapidly grow to human size in a handful of months. There is much advancement in the genetic engineering of pigs, which have hearts structurally and functionally similar to the human heart. The role of genetic engineering is to overcome the immune barriers in xenotransplantation and can be used in hyperacute rejection and T cell-mediated rejection. It is technically difficult to use large animal models for orthotopic, life-sustaining heart transplantation. Despite the fact that some religious traditions, such as Jewish and Muslim, prohibit the ingestion of pork products, few religious leaders consider that donating porcine organs is ethical because it saves human life. Although recent technologies have lowered the risk of a xenograft producing a novel virus that causes an epidemic, the risk still exists. It has major implications for the informed consent procedure connected with clinical research on heart xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "Abstract Over the past several decades, significant scientific progress in xenotransplantation has brought the field to the threshold of clinical trials. In the past 3 years in the United States, experimental pig kidney and heart xenotransplantation have been performed on human subjects recently declared dead by neurological criteria (decedents). In addition, two pig heart transplants have been carried out in living patients under the United States Food and Drug Administration's expanded access guidelines. However, though there has been a flurry of activity there remain unanswered questions regarding how the public views xenotransplantation, what concerns may exist, and how to address these concerns in a meaningful way. This paper aims to underscore the importance of public engagement in xenotransplantation, emphasizing the ongoing need for studies to assess public opinions. The current evidence on public engagement studies is reviewed and gaps in our understanding are identified. We propose practical steps to advance this field. Additional studies to determine the extent of racial/ethnic differences in attitudes to xenotransplantation should be conducted. Empirical and descriptive analysis of certain religious viewpoints\u2014especially minority faiths\u2014would be valuable. As public engagement is an important aspect of public acceptance of novel research that is accompanied by risk, we suggest that xenotransplantation biotechnology companies might consider leading the way in funding this research.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation (cross-species transplantation; specifically, genetically modified pig-to-human transplantation) is advancing as a potential alternative to allotransplantation (human-tohuman transplantation). To date, seven patients have received genetically modified pig xenografts. In the United States (US), four patients have received kidney xenografts [1,2] and two have received cardiac xenografts [3,4]. One patient has received a liver xenograft in China [5]. In addition, several decedent studies in which a xenograft has been transplanted into a person declared dead by neurological criteria have been undertaken in the US and China [6][7][8][9][10]. Clinical trials are likely forthcoming in the US and elsewhere in the coming years. \n\nEngaging diverse societal perspectives in a discussion about novel medical technology is an important complement to support the ethical conduct of clinical research. The importance of societal engagement is recognized in international research ethics guidelines, such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization's \"Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights\" [11] and the \"International Ethical Guidelines for Health-Related Research Involving Humans\", a joint venture from the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences and the World Health Organization (WHO) [12]. The Changsha Communiqu\u00e9, a summary document published following the First WHO Global Consultation on Regulatory Requirements for Xenotransplantation Clinical Trials, specifies that any xenotransplantation regulatory system \"should be transparent, must include scientific and ethical assessment and should involve the public\" [13]. This was reaffirmed by the WHO in 2011 and 2018 in collaboration with the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA), an official section of The Transplantation Society [14,15]. Overall, attitudes toward xenotransplantation have been assessed empirically in certain populations [16][17][18].",

A number of the core areas of ethical concern that have been central to the discourse surrounding xenotransplantation are: the potential for xenozoonosis, public and regulatory issues, crossing of species boundaries and ensuring appropriate animal ethics. However, these must be balanced against the absolute positive gains for the overwhelming number of potential patients that can benefit from xenotransplantation when there are so many medical, financial and social issues for these patients. As can be seen in Figure 2, the balance between the negative aspects of their disease versus receiving a cure from the transplant is overwhelmingly weighted to the positive. This is because the benefits far outweigh the problems of ongoing and increasing ill health, secondary complications, invalidity and ultimately death. However, there are not enough human donor organs available for transplantation and using this single example, the case of patients suffering from type 1 diabetes, there are innumerable patients that could benefit from islet cell xenotransplantation with it being life changing and lifesaving. A concise timeline of some of the major developments that have occurred in the field of xenotransplantation.

            "text": "The unknown potential to transmit known and unknown diseases from the pig organ to human recipient [16,17] elevates the risk profile of first-in-human pig kidney xenotransplant trials. \n\nThe five xenotransplants (2 heart, 3 kidney) performed under the FDA's Expanded Access program [14,[18][19][20] provide some information about how xenotransplants functioned in those recipients (e.g., the fact that grafts survived 2 months). However, the different eligibility criteria, different gene-edited pigs used, and patients' grave conditions mean that their outcomes are unlikely to be commensurate with clinical trial outcomes. Accordingly, the information disclosed to prospective trial participants about such xenotransplants must be qualified. \n\nMagnifying these challenges is that few, if any, treatment alternatives for patients with end-stage kidney disease exist, which can render patients vulnerable and undermine voluntary decision-making [12,13]. Such vulnerability commonly occurs among patients undergoing innovative surgical procedures for which alternative standard treatments are either ineffective or nonexistent [21]. In regard to first-inhuman xenotransplant trials, waitlisted candidates may have exhausted all life-saving options, as in the Expanded Access xenotransplants. \n\nThe ethical challenges to informed consent comprise a component of translational research that requires resolution. Current federal regulations (i.e., the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984) lack guidance on informed consent for xenotransplant clinical trials [22]. Organ Procurement and Transplant Network policies only pertain to human organs. Thus, policies on information disclosure may not translate to the xenotransplant context. \n\nFew scholars have made headway in addressing this problem. Padilla and colleagues reviewed The US Department of Health and Human Services nine minimum elements that consent forms must include to protect human subjects, highlighting how these elements should be conveyed in the consent process and in the informed consent form for xenotransplantation [23]. Drawing upon this work, Cooper prepared an informed consent form template tailored to the xenotransplant trial context [24].",

In concluding, we will question the way the debate over xenotransplantation often proceeds, and draw attention to some important recipient-based concerns. \n\nAdvocates of xenotransplantation often proceed by balancing the life that a transpig owes to xenotransplantation against the lives of a larger number of human persons. Others more critical of xenotransplantation focus on the practice more generally. They attend to the risk to recipients as well as the harms to donors it generates, and contrast the practice with some alternative practice, like cell-printing or scaffolding, that reduces those risks and harms. When evaluating the case for a moratorium on the use of transpigs, we should not only weigh the certain harms and their possible justifications in terms of non-identity, self-defense, or human need, as we have done here so far. In addition, we need to adopt a more general perspective, and take into account at least the following factors. \n\nFirst, we must attend to risks not only to donors and recipients but also to third parties, whether human or not, who may face, for example, zoonotic risks. Second, we need to focus on xenotransplantation procedures not only in their perfected form but also consider the moral and non-moral costs involved in their development, including the large number of discarded transpigs and failed transpig transplants that will take place as the procedure is refined. Third, we must not assume that procedures will always take place in conditions of perfect compliance with the relevant rules and protocols but assume human failure and human misconduct will sometimes take place. Fourth, we must consider the practice not only within a single research center or even a single country [39]. \n\nFor example, we may feel confident that our own governments will prohibit transpig xenotransplantation until the technique is perfected and will never permit the use of pigs that have not been properly edited, thus risking zoonotic contamination. Nevertheless, we cannot be certain how all governments will act.",

            "text": "Other concerns are ethical. Xenotransplantation carries the potential risk of transmitting infectious diseases from animals to humans. Ethical concerns center on the precautionary principle, which suggests that xenotransplantation should not be pursued until the risks of zoonotic diseases are better understood and minimized [7]. Likewise, the long-term health and safety of recipients of xenotransplants are still not fully known, which raises ethical issues regarding patient safety and the potential for unforeseen complications [8]. \n\nThe ethics of human-animal relations are also an issue. There are concerns about the conditions in which donor animals are raised and the potential for harm, suffering, and exploitation of these animals [9]. As with animal experimentation, there is the ethical difficulty of consent [10]. In human-to-human organ transplantation, informed consent is typically obtained from donors or their families. In xenotransplantation, there is no way to obtain informed consent from the donor animals, raising ethical questions about the use of animals for the benefit of humans without their consent [11,12]. \n\nWhile these are ethical issues that are likely to affect xenotransplantation globally, there are also specific geographic areas where xenotransplantation might pose additional ethical concerns. For example, in countries with greater percentage of vegans amongst the population, or with higher sensitivity towards animal suffering, there may be hesitations about killing animals in order to use their organs. \n\nBut even more so, moral qualms about xenotransplantation may be especially salient regions where there are cultural prohibitions on pigs. Pigs are considered the most suited species for xenotransplantation [13], due to various reasons: their organs have similar sizes and functions as for humans; pigs are widely available, and they have potential for large scale reproduction; they are anatomically comparable to human beings; they can be genetically modified more effectively than some other animals; and humans have a lower risk of immune rejection of pig tissue. \n\nTraditionally, Islamic societies have considered pigs impure animals [14]. This is done on a scriptural basis.",

            "text": "There are several ethical issues pertaining to clinical xenotransplantation. One such issue concerns defining the harm/benefit ratio in the context of the initial clinical attempts. It might also be difficult to institute an appropriate informed-consent procedure. The fact that the patients will have to be monitored for possible infectious diseases for an extended time, possibly for life, is another ethical concern. \n\nMoreover, there are a number of ethical issues with regards to society at large. The public health hazard posed by the possible transmission and activation of PERV created considerable public concern a few years ago. The public debate that took place also generated some emotionally colored skepticism towards xenotransplantation, in which it was argued that \"transplantation from animal to man will violate the order of nature\". Other objections were with regard to the safety of the future recipients: \"xenotransplantation will constitute experimentation on sick human beings\". It is interesting to note that similar skepticism prevailed in the 1960s and 1970s when human organ transplantation was in its infancy. When it became apparent that transplantation could save a dying patient and bring him back to a normal life, the skepticism and the criticism abated. \n\nThe existence of national guidelines and of an official, institutional surveillance system are prerequisites for clinical trials with xenotransplantation. A number of countries, including the USA and the UK, already have guidelines in place, while others are lagging behind. This raises concerns that some such countries might initiate xenotransplantation programs and attract desperate patients in need of a transplant. The WHO has recently issued a statement against such \"xenotourism\".",

            "text": "The common complications include coagulopathy, stemming from endothelial damage and acute rejection, further complicate the post-transplant scenario, necessitating ongoing research and development of strategies to mitigate these effects. \n\nViral infections, particularly those associated with porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) and porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV/PRV), pose significant risks for xenotransplantation. Nevertheless, both preclinical and clinical investigations conducted thorough pathogen screening to exclude prevalent viruses in pig donors, such as PERV-3 and PCMV. The posttransplantation virus detection in the decedents also remained negative (12,27) However, the limitations of these negative findings are underscored by the relatively short observation periods. Consequently, developing future strategies to detect and eliminate these viruses is imperative to uphold the safety of both the graft and the recipient (28). \n\nAdditionally, the ethical landscape of xenotransplantation, encompassing animal rights, public attitudes, and regulatory milestones such as the FDA's 2022 approval of a pig-to-human heart transplant, presents ongoing challenges (29). The pilot xenotransplantation trials have underscored various ethical and medicolegal considerations inherent in xenotransplantation research (12,18). In these studies, brain-dead decedents were precluded from organ donation, and obtaining proper informed consent from their families was deemed essential. Notably, the absence of specific legislation governing xenotransplantation necessitates evolution of the regulatory frameworks to enhance research protocols and future clinical applications. Consultation with ethics committees is imperative to ensure adherence to established guidelines such as the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA) and the dead-donor rule, while also acknowledging the cultural and religious nuances surrounding organ transplantation (30). Public acceptance and ethical considerations remain integral to the advancement and clinical application of xenotransplantation, highlighting the need for continued research, dialogue, and education in this evolving field. \n\nIn summary, xenotransplantation's journey towards becoming a viable clinical option is fraught with complex immunological, physiological, virological, and ethical challenges.",

Yet, the precise basis of the recipient's death continues to be uncertain and remains under evaluation. 16 The porcine donor in this case had 10 genetic modulations (knock out of three porcine genes that promote hyperacute rejection, knock out of one gene that causes continued organ growth, and six human genes that promote tolerance (rejection reduction) were inserted (knock-in) in the porcine genome. 17 owever, despite these advances and optimism, bioethical issues related to xenotransplantation remain polemic and some issues deserve particular attention. Clinical application of innovation such as xenotransplantation raises questions concerning the balance between beneficence, individual autonomy and the recognition of possible damage to society and the environment. 18,19 The problems of autonomy in xenotransplantation are related to the difficulty of composing the free and informed consent form, since the risks and benefits for the recipient, given the complexity of the situation, are still unknown. Furthermore, some of the greatest risks of this procedure, zoonosis, is associated with the possibility of its success. Therefore, the recipient's notion of being able to withdraw from participating in the research at any time must be very well clarified before proceeding with the xenotransplantation, if there is a predictable chance of survival for a long period. 18,19 he risk of xenotransplant recipients contracting and transmitting Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses (PERV) infections is another bioethical issue that represents a potential public health problem because could cause a pandemic. This xenozoonosis or xenosis would be hazardous not only to the recipient but also to their contacts who would not even be aware of this situation. 20,21  recipients and their contacts probably will need lifelong surveillance to detect and treat any unexpected disease early and protect society as a whole. 20,21 he appropriate care of the swine that will be a donor in the xenotransplantation is another important bioethical issue.",

            "text": "In our eagerness to press on toward new territories in medicine, it is important to consider the moral and ethical aspects of any new therapeutic approach. With regard to xenotransplantation, several issues must be considered and, indeed, have been previously reviewed by several aut h o r~.~~-*~ As in many other attempts to take great leaps in medicine, the moral and ethical views of the general public may differ from those in the medical field. Indeed, therapeutic xenotransplantation has the potential to evoke a great deal of controversy. Thus, public opinion must be carefully considered since, if antagonistic, it has the potential to prevent clinical implementation. Ethical concerns include those relating to animal welfare and animal rights, as well as the rights of the individual patient and of the community. Particular aspects that require consideration include the appropriate timing of the initial clinical trial of cardiac xenotransplantation, the selection of the first patients, and the abilityto obtain fully-informed consent from them and their families.\n\nPerhaps because approximately 100 million pigs are slain each year in the United States for food,84 research using pigs evokes less public opposition than that using nonhuman primates or even dogs. This, coupled with the fact that pig heart valves have been used therapeutically in the medical arena for several years, suggests that there may be general public acceptance to the use of pigs as a source of organs.\n\nThe major ethical concern is probably the potential risk of infection to the population at large. Before clinical trials proceed, sufficient evidence must be gathered to ensure that the welfare of the community is not jeopardized for the sake of what will initially be a very small number of sick patients. The anticipated benefit to the patient must be carefully weighed against the potential risk to the community. It is this potential risk to the community that mandates that all clinical trials are carried out under the authority of a body or organization which has powers to allow or discontinue the trial, and ensure that the necessary specimens are taken from the source pig and human recipient for storage for later study if necessary. Local institutional review boards do not have the wide expertise nor the powers necessary to perform this role.\n\nThe control of such trials should therefore be at a national or even international level.\n\nIf genetically-engineered pigs are to be produced, it is",

            "text": "For example, a member of the xenotransplantation team outlined the \"ethical algorithm\" at use during the xenoheart's development and eventual transplant. The clinician-scientist in question, Martine Rothblatt 28 , reassured readers in a commentary published in Xenotransplantation that a balance was struck between the \"public's concern not to face a new pandemic\" with the \"patient's concern not to die from their disease.\" The ethical dilemma, as perceived by the xenotransplantation team, was primarily concerned with how to \"comply with infection control procedures,\" diminish the \"possibility of transmissible pathogens,\" a \"commitment to biosurveillance,\" and \"humane care practices\" 28 for the donor pigs. In other words, an ethical algorithm that intended to balance the desire to break new grounds in xenotransplantation science with the all-too-real fear of zoonotic spillover. It should come as no surprise that many of the ethical considerations at the forefront of the biomedical team are, in a sense, deeply rooted in pragmatic scientific considerations. \n\nThe immunological response has been one of the most significant stumbling blocks for replacing solid organ transplantation with xenotransplantation. Current studies often utilize genetically modified porcine donor organs that lack the alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene (\"alpha Gal\"), which is thought to prevent hyperacute rejection of the transplanted non-human organ as well as acute vascular rejection events 34 . However, it is not just the knockout of alpha-Gal which may need to occur to prevent rejection. Some studies are exploring the combined effect of alpha-Gal knockouts and randomly inserted human alpha 1,2-fucosylosyltransferase (HT) transgene in the hopes that the addition of the human HT gene will produce better results than just the null porcine line 34 . These alterations and research lines refer to the porcine donor's genetic makeup. This work does not touch on the pharmaceutical course and immunological therapies that need to be developed or altered to prepare human and animal donors for transplantation.",

Current solid organ transplantation systems are seemingly unsustainable and ineffective in satisfying a growing global demand for organs. Despite the shortcomings of current systems, we argue that the discourse surrounding xenotransplantation science is insufficient to construct a long-lasting and equitable replacement for solid organ transplantation. Xenotransplantation is more than a surgical technique, an interdisciplinary health concern, or a biomedical technology\u2014it is deeply dependent on a series of cultural, historical, and social factors.

While it provides hope for patients with irreversible organ failure, it also raises ethical, psychosocial, and regulatory issues. These issues challenge us both as human beings and in our relationship to animals and should be discussed among broader society. In order to elicit well-informed public opinion on the benefits and risks of xenotransplantation, we organized a citizens' conference. After deliberating over three weekends, the participants drafted an evaluative statement on xenotransplantation and made recommendations to scientists and policy makers. Overall, the citizen group considers the benefits of xenotransplantation to outweigh the risks, but calls for strict regulatory measures to ensure the development of a sustainable and ethically justifiable biotechnology. One hundred and ninety-five days. This is the period of time denoted for a scientific breakthrough in the field of xenotransplantation (XT) (La \u00a8ngin et al, 2018). Baboons survived for 6 months with a genetically modified pig heart. Bringing xenotransplantation to patients with the prospect of reducing the current shortage of donor organs has thus become more realistic. This success owes to significant progress regarding the immunological challenges of XT on the molecular level and by better genome editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 (Sykes & Sachs, 2019). The time has come to align the necessary infrastructure of policy making, legal, and medical regulation, political administration, market interests, and public opinion. \n\nWhile these advances in XT provide hope for patients with irreversible organ failure, they also raise ethical and philosophical issues: Is it ethically acceptable to breed animals and use them as an organic spare parts stock? What does it mean anthropologically for patients to live with an animal organ or animal tissue? How shall we balance the potential benefits and risks of XT therapies, given that everyone could potentially benefit as an organ recipient, but at the same time may risk acquiring a xenogeneic infectious disease?",

We received 40 responses and analyzed the data.\nThis survey showed that all of the respondents answered that xenotransplantation research is ethically legitimate. But 'very much legitimate'(43.6%) is little lower than 'some legitimate'(56.4%).\nIn related to the ethics of animal experiments, this survey showed some meaningful results: the establishment of Animal Experiment Committee, the need to regular education about animal experiment guideline, the need and justness of transgenic animal and primates recipients etc.\nIn relation to the clinical trial, this survey showed the researchers are very prudent and cautious.

Much like our current organ transplantation system, the discourse surrounding-and eventual success of-xenotransplantation is deeply dependent on a series of cultural, historical, and social factors. In what follows, we have attempted to meld bioethical and historical analysis to briefly show the messy foundations of solid organ transplantation, including many failures that proponents of xenotransplantation promise to replace or address. By examining the story of Alexis Carrel, a prominent figure in early 20th-century transplantation research, the vulnerability of xenotransplant recipients, and contemporary global markets in organ trafficking, we hope to show that issues in solid organ transplantation ought to be discussed without the use of ideological or disciplinary restraints. Instead, by telling a holistic story of the history and ethics of transplant practice, we may improve the chances of xenotransplantation truly being a successful alternative to current practices and systems.",

            "text": "Discussion about the ethics of xenotransplantation from the 1990s and early 2000s evolved as the science advanced. Initial concerns centered on whether animal-to-human transplants violate the laws of nature and whether it is wrong to sacrifice animals as organ donors to humans. Some feared social injustice by lopsided distribution of scarce resources to a few at the expense of broader basic medical care for all. Critics wondered whether xenotransplantation would endanger public health [7]. Other pressing questions touched on prerequisites for clinical trials: identifying acceptable risk-benefit thresholds and clinically defining success (extra days versus extra weeks or months of life, for example). Some questioned whether informed consent should be obtained from close contacts of the patient and medical personnel involved in the recipient's care, given concerns about zoonotic infection. It was argued that informed consent from recipients should include a broader set of risks including public attention, risk of transmitting disease and isolation. A final set of questions touched on who is responsible for oversight of clinical trials in xenotransplantation (local hospital review boards, national committees, or some combination)? \n\nEthicists and researchers considered the role of local institutional review boards (IRB) in approving xenotransplant clinical trials [8]. They argued that IRB members, particularly community members who may not have scientific or medical knowledge, would need ongoing education about xenotransplantation. They cited the model of the National Institutes of Health's Re-combinant DNA Advisory Committee, which focused initially on public fears about gene transfer but ultimately provided a public forum to discuss broader issues of gene transfer. IRBs would have to confront the inability of a subject to withdraw from a study once the xenotransplant had been made. In addition to ongoing training, the authors recommend that IRBs bring in nonvoting consultants to help them reach a decision, as well as involve hospital ethics committees in an advisory role, particularly for the ethical concerns of the post-transplant period. \n\nScholars have looked at societal and religious attitudes toward xenotransplantation, convening focus groups of local religious leaders, organ procurement organizations' staff, patients who need or have already received a transplant and local members of the business community [9].",

In recent decades, the ever increasing demand for clinical transplantation and shortage of allogeneic sources for patients on the waiting lists has led to considerable amounts of clinical and experimental research in order to overcome the barriers of xenotransplantation. However, a great number of ethical red tape and immunological roadblocks are yet to be surpassed. Graft rejection and failure to achieve successful long-term outcomes are the main issues to be addressed, as there are great disparities between MHCs of different species. Another concern is the risk of zoonotic infections, particularly unidentified viruses. In addition, xenotransplantation is by itself a controversial ethical issue and sometimes raises religious concerns because it involves sacrificing animals to harvest organs and tissues for human usage [16] .",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation, the latest frontier in transplantation is the process of retrieving organs, tissues or cells from one species and transplanting them into another. It has long been heralded as the ultimate solution to the overwhelming shortage of human organs available for transplantation (1). The concept of utilizing nonhuman organ and tissue sources to meet the overwhelming demand on conventional donors has captured the attention of clinicians, scientists, healthcare providers, and patients alike for many decades but has also been a concept for hundreds of years (Figure 1). As can be seen in Figure 1, which is a timeline of some of the major landmarks in the journey of xenotransplantation. The first published attempts of xenotransplantation occurred with xenotransfusion occurring in the 1600's then in the 1800's xeno-skin transplants were attempted prior to more ambitious attempts at kidney xenotransplantation. There has been a long line of endeavor as advancements in medical science and technology have brought the prospect of xenotransplantation closer to reality. Importantly the ethical and legislative landscape surrounding this pioneering field has undertaken renewed and ever-increasing attention but still requires ongoing updates (2)(3)(4). A large effort from the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) in conjunction with others such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Transplantation Society (TTS) have been constantly undertaken, however as the field progresses more needs to be done from a broader international and national regulatory perspective. \n\nXenotransplantation offers us the potential to save countless lives by providing a readily available supply of organs, tissues and cells, significantly reducing the waiting time for transplants, and alleviating the suffering of patients on transplant wait lists. It is also a major means by which we can actively abolish the trade in trafficked organs and organ transplant tourism. However, with this promise comes a complex web of ethical considerations and legal frameworks that must be carefully navigated to ensure the responsible and ethical translation of xenotransplantation from the laboratory to the clinic.",

The purpose of this review is to summarize the early experiences of xenotransplantation, with special focus on heart xenotransplantation. It aims to highlight the important ethical concerns of animal-to-human heart xenotransplantation, identify the key immunological barriers to successful long-term xenograft survival, as well as summarize the progress made in terms of development of pharmacological and genetic engineering strategies to address these barriers. Lastly, we discuss more recent attempts of porcine-to-human heart xenotransplantation, as well as provide some commentary on the current concerns and possible applications for future clinical heart xenotransplantation.",

We ( 1) assess what we foresee as the pressing ethical considerations relating to pediatric xenotransplantation, clarifying where gaps exist and which areas need further consensus before initiating clinical trials and (2) provide initial recommendations on how the field might proceed.

            "text": "A controversial topic comprises the ethical issues involved not only in the clinical practice of transplanting human organs, but in technologies focused on relieving the organ shortage available for transplants. Here, we present a brief summary of considerations put to discussion for almost 70 years, related to the limits of \"doing good\" by avoiding harm to others. \n\nRegarding living donor organ donation, the safety of healthy people is a big concern where a balance between risk to the donor and the high possibility of a successful transplant must be taken into account [126]. Other topics under discussion are: if the altruist donor freely makes his/her decision; the possibility of receiving a reimbursement; or if it is acceptable to use hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected organs for uninfected recipients [127,128]. \n\nAlthough living donors can donate part of their liver, the shortage of organs is still a big concern. Xenotransplantation as an alternative, but brings new challenges. Clearly, this option is even more risky than orthotopic transplantation due to the high possibility of rejection and the potential emergence of a new virus and even worse, of a pandemic. However, the use of genetically modified animals in the attempt to reduce rejection rates is not exempt from ethical discussion [129,130]. In order to avoid rejection, it is possible to develop a \"humanized organ\" inside animals for later transplantation. In this case, the ethical concerns refer to the possibility, quite unlikely, of introducing human DNA into an animal embryo, and thereby compromising human dignity. \n\nAn emerging ethical concern while xenotransplantation is under experimental research is that once this procedure is established, the production of animals for this purpose, basically pigs, will be discussed in the context of life-saving benefits versus the use of animals for meat consumption. Undoubtedly, many ethical issues will be raised in the process of minimizing the risk of spreading zoonosis to humans, because everyone close to the recipient may well be subject to long-term observation, affecting their rights to privacy and confidentiality.",

Xenotransplantation also encompasses anthropology, sociology, and ethics, all of which may have significant impacts on our society, hence we must proceed with caution.\n\nThe experiences in allogeneic organ transplantation have shown that recipients have the belief that they have acquired qualities or adopted traits from the donors after transplantation [24,25].Therefore, human xenotransplantation might bring ethical dilemmas pertaining to personal identity and human dignity, which need to be cautiously evaluated in the process of preparation for clinical trial.\n\nIn 2008 and 2018, in Changsha China, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) developed and updated the WHO regulation for xenotransplantation clinical trials (the Changsha Communiqu\u00e9) with the participation of the Chinese transplant community [26,27].The Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 indicated that the Chinese transplant professionals held the ethical and legal issues associated with xenotransplantation in high regard.",

            "text": "In terms of the non-human animals involved, the ethical focus is often restricted to comparing the relatively small number of pigs used for research with the much larger numbers of animals farmed for meat production. While using animals as a source of 'spare parts' for humans may align with an anthropocentric worldview, it is essential to insist that the frequently made assumption-that using animals to save human lives is acceptable when people also consume them for pleasureis not uncontested (Koplin 2020). From a biocentric perspective, which underlies animal rights activism, dietary choices such as vegetarianism and veganism, both of which are gaining prominence, particularly in countries where xenotransplantation research is conducted, may influence public perception and acceptance. \n\nIt is crucial to note that using animals in xenotransplantation does not equate the life of one pig to the life of one human (Baban et al 2023). In the production process of genetically engineered pigs, less than 1% mature into animals (Entwistle et al 2022), and on the path to clinical implementation in humans, a range of non-human primates, who have been used as proxies, will have perished during preclinical trials. In addition, for porcine islet cell xenotransplants, 10 adult or more than 90 juvenile pigs would be required for one person (Coe et al 2020). Clearly, the number of animals needed for experimental and clinical xenotransplantation is significant. \n\nThe acceptability of animal use for human purposes constitutes one aspect of the 'xenotransplantation paradox' (Haddow 2021a) which involves the simultaneous emphasis on sameness and difference between humans and animals in xenotransplantation discourse (Brown 1999;Cook 2006Cook , 2013;;Hansson 2011;Sharp 2011). The emphasis on similarity across species, as opposed to differences, serves to underscore the feasibility of xenotransplantation. From this framing, physiological differences are not seen as insurmountable barriers. For example, the heart is held to be merely a pump that can function in biological organisms regardless of their species-bound specificity.",

This has led scientists and clinicians to explore alternative means of meeting this organ shortfall. One of the alternatives to human organ transplantation is xenotransplantation, which is the transplantation of organs, tissues, or cells between different species. The resurgence of interest in xenotransplantation and recent scientific breakthroughs suggest that genetically engineered pigs may soon present a realistic alternative as sources of kidneys for clinical transplantation. It is therefore important for healthcare professionals to understand what is involved in xenotransplantation and its future implications for their clinical practices. First, we explore the insufficiency of different organ donation systems to meet the kidney shortage. Second, we provide a background and a summary of the progress made so far in xenotransplantation research. Third, we discuss some of the scientific, technological, ethical, and public health issues associated with xenotransplantation. Finally, we summarize the literature on the attitudes of healthcare professionals toward xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "Embodied in the wider concepts of informed consent are considerations that young people and the old or infirm are not exploited. Peoples with poor understanding of the language and scientific concepts involved are not to be misled. Religious and cultural feelings are not to be disregarded in potential recipients who find it difficult to express their reluctance to participate in the presence of those whom they perceive as medical authorities. \n\nThe ethical issues of xenotransplantation include concerns over the cultural, ethical and spiritual dimensions of xenotransplantation; the ethical acceptability of using animals to provide tissue for human transplantation; how the welfare of donor animals can be adequately protected and their suffering reduced; and how the welfare and interests of patients in early clinical xenotransplantation trials can be protected. These issues have been addressed by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics in the United Kingdom (1996) and, in New Zealand, the Bioethics Council, Toi te Taiao (2005). The latter body concluded that prohibition of xenotransplantation could not be justified, given the compelling human need argument, and that it should be allowed to develop in New Zealand, with that development being demonstrably shaped by the resolution and management of safety issues by a competent authority; the relationship between the majority European culture and indigenous Maori people and the cultural, ethical and spiritual factors that matter to most New Zealanders. \n\nIn recent years, a number of recommendations to protect the ethical integrity of future human research have been made by various regulatory authorities. Key issues in the conduct of clinical trials of xenotransplantation include the requirement to provide patients with an explanation of the likely success, its attendant risks, and the subsequent quality-oflife that can be expected when obtaining their informed consent, and informing patients that their consent to the procedure includes consent to ongoing post-transplantation microbiological monitoring. \n\nOther international spiritual organisations have given their opinions about xenotransplantation. The Vatican in Rome, Italy have considered xenotransplantation in some depth and suggest it is worthy of serious consideration (Vatican, 2011). Jewish organisations have given qualified support to xenotransplantation as a life enhancing procedure while Muslim opinion is unclear but has generally been negative because of the status of pigs in the religious context.",

We discuss our views regarding important patient-selection criteria that should be considered for future clinical trials. These criteria concern the appropriate balancing of risks and benefits with respect to patients and society, the role of an a priori psychosocial determination that allegedly predicts compliance to posttransplant medical requirements (such as medications and follow-up appointments), and the requirements for and the proper assessment of informed and voluntary consent from critically ill patients who are presented with the prospect of life-saving xenotransplantation when no other options are available except for hospice care. Such a Hobson's choice was presented to the recent pig-human transplant patient.\n\nThe ethics framework we propose incorporates guiding principles developed by the Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association 7 and builds on earlier frameworks developed for the use of unproven clinical interventions outside of clinical trials during public health emergencies. 8 The framework also includes values regarding transparency and accountability that serve to enhance the public's trust in the scientific community, transplant investigators, and the science of transplant itself. (See table 1.) Commentators have proposed preliminary recommendations for selection criteria to enroll patients in clinical trials involving porcine xenotransplantation. 9 In general, xenotransplantation should be limited to patients with life-threatening diseases who do not have access to traditional allotransplantation. 10 Accordingly, physiologic criteria that make patients eligible for xenotransplantation include",

This includes evaluating safety, efficacy, and long-term outcomes to address potential risks such as zoonotic infections and immunological responses. Secondly, engaging a diverse group of stakeholders, including bioethicists, clinicians, patients, and regulatory bodies, ensures that multiple viewpoints are considered [75]. Public consultations and generally accepted existing ethical frameworks, like the Declaration of Helsinki and the Belmont Report, can guide the development of standards that respect human rights and social values; xeno-specific features need also to be considered [76]. Finally, harmonizing regulations across countries, facilitated by international collaborations and agreements, is highly desirable for the consistent application of ethical standards and to address cross-border ethical dilemmas, and we suggest that this can best be done if WHO and member states agree that all xeno trials should be undertaken with the collaboration, engagement and support of the IXA, TTS and the WHO. The ideal setting for this undertaking is by comprehensively reviewing the current guidelines for xenotransplantation by international experts in an update of the Changsha Communiqu\u00e9.",

There was consensus among the speakers that xenotransplantation, now more so than in any of the previous decades, is an imminent possibility. It was beyond the remit of this symposium to generate and ratify formal recommendations on how the UK should proceed; however, a few key messages could be taken away. A regulatory framework and the appropriate technical resources will need to be established to facilitate a clinical xenotransplantation programme. Moreover, in the wake of COVID, in an ever more connected world of international travel, an international monitoring and regulatory framework is essential. There remain significant legal and ethical questions regarding recipient selection, risk benefit analysis and the allocation of resources, which will require detailed discussion. Above all, up-to-date public consultation is essential to finding acceptable resolutions. \n\nTwitter Sara Fovargue @SFovargue and Brendan Parent @parent_brendan Contributors RT: first author, original draft, and writing, review and editing.

Ethical issues surrounding XTx have been studied since initial interest arose decades ago and have experienced renewed discussion in the literature. However, the distinct and relevant differences when applied to children has largely been overlooked with few groups attending to the concerns that XTx in children raises. In this paper, we explore ethical challenges to be expected in paediatric XTx, in particular exploring organ sizing concerns, infectious risks, psychological burdens, and issues of moral hazard. We review these domains with the aim of highlighting the implications of pursuing paediatric XTx and the cross-disciplinary approach needed to solve these issues. Children require a unique analysis from a bioethical perspective to best prepare for the issues XTx presents.",

These perturbations, as I note above, stem from insights into genomics but also the creation of transpecies hybrid embryos for research and other areas of biotechnology including genetic engineering in addition to immunological insights into species symbiosis and beneficial parasitism, and so on. Xenotransplantation also extends and focuses long-standing controversies about the use of animals as model proxies for humans in medical research, let alone as novel sources of immunologically 'humanised' cells, organs, tissues and biodevices. In historical terms, dating back centuries even, humans have been the recipients of blood and tissues from an eclectic menagerie of animals including other primates and 'higher' simians (apes, baboons, macaques, rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees, etc.) and 'domesticated' animals (guinea pigs, dogs, rabbits, goats, sheep, cows and pigs, etc.). \n\nThe question of species desirability in xenotransplantation has operated in relation to a rich and complex number of socio-cultural, scientific and physiological factors. These include, but are not limited to, the conventional use of some animals as 'meat' in the human food chain; or conversely the breeding of some species as 'companion animals' and pets; whether a species is understood to be a 'wild type' and subject to certain kinds of international protections; the amenability of some animals to rapid reproduction and therefore accelerated cycles of bespoke breeding programmes; the extent to which certain species are known to harbour, or not, various pathogens, parasites and viruses; the relative physiological size of a source species; the different responses of species to genetic engineering for immunological adaptation; the impact of sterile biosecurity measures upon the welfare of different species, and so on. The immunitary biopolitics of xenotransplantation are therefore rife with dilemmas N. Brown and contradictions which pitch differing species as either desirable or undesirable sources for tissues and organs.",

            "text": "This study indicates that people's views on xenotransplantation in Egypt are not dramatically different from those held in other countries [39][40][41][42]. While the benefits of xenotransplantation are appreciated, there may still be some ethical concerns, and this is reflected in the overall moral approval rate. The results of the present study suggest that moral opinions about this issue are roughly evenly distributed, suggesting that it is a complicated moral matter. \n\nThe prospect of xenotransplantation makes some people uneasy, given that it raises ethical questions about the boundaries between species [43][44][45][46][47]. This concern typically has various dimensions. First, there is the issue of human exceptionalism. Many philosophical and religious traditions emphasize the unique status of humans. The idea of human exceptionalism asserts that humans possess a distinct moral, intellectual, or spiritual essence that sets them apart from other species. The crossing of species boundaries, such as through genetic engineering or xenotransplantation, challenges this perception and raises ethical questions about the manipulation of fundamental aspects of life. Ethical frameworks often draw on distinctions between species to guide moral decisionmaking. Some individuals believe that certain rights and responsibilities are exclusive to humans, based on perceived moral or cognitive differences. The blurring of species boundaries, as in the case of xenotransplantation, can provoke ethical dilemmas for those who hold such beliefs. Some authors call this the \"xenotransplantation paradox. \" Gill Haddow defines it as the tension in thinking that \"although non-human animals and humans are thought to be biologically compatible or similar, many assume and emphasise just how different we are from  human and what is a non-human animal and yet how shallow the socially constructed division between the species is\" [48]. From a moral psychology perspective, xenotransplantation elicits cognitive discomfort in many people, to the extent that animals used as donors must be sufficiently close to humans (for purposes of anatomical and physiological compatibility, etc.), yet sufficiently distant to not be disturbed by their exploitative use.",

Recent scientific and biotechnological advancements, coupled with the scarcity of human allografts, have led to renewed interest in developing exploratory treatment strategies that use xenotransplantation products in human recipients. However, despite its potential benefits, the use of xenotransplantation is still limited due to various considerations, as discussed in this review of the past, present, and future directions of xenotransplantation. One of the key ethical concerns surrounding xenotransplantation is the potential impact on the animals from which the cells, tissues, or organs are obtained. As with genetic modification to fix genetic defects or prevent disease, the ideal outcome for these animals is that they will be better off as a result of the change. However, unless there are major changes in the way science is taught to incorporate ethics into recognized scientific theory and practice, these concerns will not be adequately addressed",

            "title": "The Dilemma of Ethical Recipients of Xenotransplantation under the Biopsychosocialmedical Model",
            "text": ": In recent years, there have been continuous reports of new breakthroughs in clinical xenotransplantation, indicating that xenotransplantation is expected to become the main method of clinical transplantation. However, at present, clinical workers mostly focus on technological development and current clinical trial ethical principles, to some extent neglecting the psychological and social adaptability of individuals. The biopsychosocial medical model not only acknowledges the influence of biological factors on individuals but also recognizes the role of psychological and social factors in human health and disease. Therefore, this article discusses and analyzes the ethical issues of xenotransplantation recipients from the perspective of the biopsychosocial medical model: human integrity, consciousness, and personality changes; pre-transplant psychological cognition and acceptance level, post-transplant psychological adaptation; social rejection, fair distribution of transplantation rights. Corresponding solutions are provided, including the establishment of a personality database, popularization of relevant knowledge, strengthening medical insurance coverage, providing humanistic care, conducting psychological analysis, enhancing self-regulation awareness, encouraging social acceptance, formulating relevant social systems, rationalizing surgical costs, and issuing effective laws and regulations. It is hoped that the rationalization of xenotransplantation in the ethical field can be achieved as soon as possible, which can not only save and prolong the lives of patients, and provide a higher quality of life, realizing the inherent value of life, but also promote the development and improvement of xenotransplantation technology, advancing more humane applications.",

            "text": "ignificant immunological and technical limitations, ethical and moral implications, and clinical, public health, and environmental risks restrict xenotransplantation as a viable, mainstream treatment for organ failure. A more careful, balanced, and holistic consideration of these limitations is needed to critically reevaluate and inform the direction and sensibility of pursuing xenotransplantation. Such analyses have been carried out previously, [14,15] but the state of xenotransplant science has the practice closer to clinical trials than ever before and urgent action is needed to mitigate risks and costs. Although xenotransplant kidneys, hearts, pancreatic islet cells, and livers are currently being developed, we use heart failure as an example to explore the immunological, ethical, and economic limitations of xenotransplantation and examine alternative solutions to the transplant shortage that should take precedence. \n\nWe explore how xenotransplantation poses risks for individual human recipients and for public health due to the risks of xenozoonoses-infectious disease transmission from one species to another via xenotransplant; how it requires harm to nonhuman animals both in research and throughout its clinical implementation, and as it scales, how it will necessitate environmental impact; and how the significant investment in xenotransplantation will impose opportunity costs of diverting finite public and private funds away from the development and implementation of more viable strategies. Transplantation and xenotransplantation are both intended to treat end-stage organ failure caused by chronic diseases like coronary artery disease, adultonset diabetes, emphysema, and cirrhosis, many of which are preventable. Instead of concentrating attempts to make xenotransplantation more viable, we consider whether investments in proven public health measures that more effectively prevent and manage chronic diseases leading to organ failure would substantively reduce the need for transplantation in the first place. Finally, we propose more immediate strategies that should continue to be prioritized to improve outcomes and access for patients waiting for organ transplants, as well as specific policy changes that can dramatically improve the availability of human donor organs.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation has shown considerable promise in earlystage studies, bridging a critical gap between theoretical potential and practical clinical application (31). This transition from laboratory success to real-world efficacy underscores the importance of preclinical research as an essential step. This phase serves not only to validate findings from controlled laboratory settings in more clinically relevant scenarios but also to identify unforeseen challenges that may not be apparent in initial studies. The intricate dance between clinical application and laboratory research is informed by these challenges, directing the trajectory of future investigations. The exploration of genetically engineered pigs, particularly those modified with multiple genes, marks a significant advancement in this field (3). However, delving deeper into the specific functions of these genetic modifications and the discovery of new xenoantigens remain critical areas for further research. The protracted process of breeding these genetically altered pigs also poses a logistical challenge, emphasizing the need for streamlining breeding techniques to enhance research efficiency. \n\nThe ethical considerations surrounding the selection of participants for clinical trials, especially the inclusion of end-stage renal disease patients or those not eligible for conventional transplants, continue to provoke debate. Alternatively, the use of brain-dead individuals in preclinical studies presents a less contentious pathway, aligning with both ethical standards and research needs. Meanwhile, the quest for optimal immunosuppression strategies remains ongoing, with the current regimens requiring refinement to improve outcomes and reduce adverse effects. The consistency in selecting donor genotypes and standardizing perioperative care protocols also presents a significant hurdle, mirroring the complexity of translating xenotransplantation into a clinically viable option. Persistent issues such as graft rejection, inflammation, coagulation disorders, maintaining the physiological function of transplanted kidneys, and managing the risk of viral transmission underscore the multifaceted challenges ahead. \n\nAs preclinical research progresses, it is imperative to tackle these obstacles head-on, paving the way for the successful integration of xenotransplantation into clinical practice. The future of this innovative field hinges on our ability to navigate these complexities, requiring a concerted effort from researchers, clinicians, and ethicists alike.",

Prior to implementation, careful consideration of religious and other factors is essential to prevent unfavorable public opinion and secure consensus in clinical application [43,83]. For instance, in the USA, the responsibility falls under federal laws, with the FDA overseeing. Germany, on the other hand, relies on the Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association, following European Union guidelines and German law. In Korea, the ethical framework is established through the Biomedical Research Committee Ethics [4,14]. Pursuing ethical and social issues is a common standard for cardiac xenotransplantation programs. \n\nEach country operates under its unique legal system, which can impact the cardiac xenotransplantation process [40]. An illustrative example is seen in heart transplantation donors, where changing the legal policy from opt-in to optout for organ donation has significantly expanded the pool of donated organs [90,91]. Therefore, before implementing cardiac transplantation, it is essential to establish a consensus on legal policies with health management agencies. For instance, the first case of cardiac xenotransplantation from pig gene modification received FDA approval and supervision [34]. Similarly, countries like Germany, Korea, and China are actively developing policies to advance this field [4,14,86]. Ensuring national legality becomes a standard in implementing cardiac heart transplantation.",

This entails conducting research on various aspects, including the patient (and relatives') perspective (consent, autonomy, selection process, identity and subjectivities), the construction of the animals involved, the forms of regulation, biopolitics and bioeconomy (including the competition between various differently engineered pigs/products) in play on a national and global scale, the knowledge constructed through xenotransplantation, public opinion and the various publics produced through xenotransplantation, the opinions of researchers, clinicians and other stakeholders and the interplay between allotransplantation and xenotransplantation, along with their dynamics and management among other relevant factors. \n\nBy emphasising the importance of the social issues and challenges discussed in this article, we hope to raise awareness among medical staff, researchers and policymakers involved in xenotransplantation regarding these matters. \n\nTwitter Peta S Cook @PetaCook",

Unfortunately, this colossal achievement of human progress has a problematic side \u2013 the shortage of donor organs. The use of animal organs could solve it. Currently, the issues of xenotransplantation have become relevant again after the experimental xenotransplantation of the kidney of a genetically modified pig in 2021, and the xenotransplantation of the heart in 2022. This practice raises a number of ethical questions. Is it ethical to put humanity at risk by saving one person? Is it ethical to limit the civil rights of a xeno-recipient? Will xenotransplantation create another reason for discrimination? Can the creation of xenochimeras be considered an unacceptable interference in the Divine plan from a religious point of view? Is it ethical to use higher animals for xenotransplantation? Will an increase in the number of xenotransplants create a risk of the identity of the human race? Will xenotransplantation create new questions about equitable organ allocation? The sources of scholars of theologians related to the main Abrahamic religions on this topic are analyzed. Consideration of theological approaches to the new ethical problems presented by xenotransplantation does not allow us to find a unanimity of opinion. However, as this new branch of medical science makes concrete clinical progress, the attitude of society, religious leaders and ordinary believers towards it will improve. From an individual point of view, Judaism does not object to xenotransplantation to prolong and save human life, even in the case of non-kosher animals with genetic modifications. The preservation of life outweighs other values almost without exception. Xenotransplantation, even from a pig, is hailed as a life-sustaining medical intervention from a Jewish ethical perspective by most authors. In Christianity, the motivation is to try to follow the example of Jesus Christ in bringing healing to all those in need. While physiological healing is important, the ultimate goal is the overall well-being of the individual, which requires spiritual, mental, and social well-being in addition to physical health. The most correct generalization about Islamic bioethical views on xenotransplantation would be that, given the state",

Advances in gene editing, including CRISPR technology, have reduced the risk of hyperacute rejection, bringing xenotransplantation closer to clinical application [49]. If successful, xenotransplantation could dramatically expand the organ pool, reducing the need for both deceased and live donors. \n\nHowever, several challenges remain before xenotransplantation can become a routine clinical practice. Concerns about zoonotic disease transmission, long-term immunological compatibility, and ethical questions surrounding the use of animal organs in humans must be addressed. Regulatory frameworks are still developing, and more data are needed to assess the long-term viability and safety of xenotransplanted organs. Despite these hurdles, xenotransplantation has the potential to fundamentally alter LT, providing organs to patients who might otherwise be excluded due to organ shortages.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation necessitates the use of animals as organ donors. Pigs being primarily used due to their physiological compatibility with humans, their ability to be bred in large numbers at a rapid rate, and their ability to be readily genetically altered. This along with their longstanding acceptance as a source of medical products such as drugs and heart valves and other decellularized tissues. With by far the strongest reason being there acceptance as a major food supply and source of products for man for as long as they have been domesticated should ensure their ease of use ethically (6). However, the welfare of these animals is of paramount concern. As some organizations push the principal that pigs are not merely commodities but sentient beings with the capacity to experience pain and suffering. \n\nThe major issues raised are to ensure the donor pigs are being ethically and humanely cared for and ensure the process of genetic manipulation does not cause them any health issues. One could argue that the facilities and conditions that these animals are housed and the care they receive is of a superior level to a normal commercial piggery due to the highly controlled and run facilities including the need for donor animals to be in DPF facilities. Underpinning this is the fact that all animal research projects including the breeding of, care and handling of the animals are undertaken in strict compliance under animal ethics legislation and under scrutiny of ethics committees (6). The genetic modifications required for these donor animals have been carefully designed to ensure they do not affect the health of the source pigs at all. Therefor from an ethical standpoint the level of suffering could be perceived as minimal or negligible. On the other hand, the potential benefit for patients is very high, being lifesaving and life changing (6). \n\nThere are also the ethical concerns for pre-clinical study recipients the various animals used and especially the non-humanprimates (NHP) which are the benchmark for preclinical trials. Their use is highly recommended prior to acceptance of any program moving to the clinic, and has been advised in many guidance's such as the \"Changsha Communique\" that recommend their use to provide safe and efficacious treatment regimen and modalities prior to commencement of any clinical trials (4).",

            "text": "The demand for transplant organs far outstrips the supply, forcing thousands of patients to face the possibility that they will die before a compatible organ becomes available. This shortage is particularly acute in patients needing a kidney, where the average wait time for a deceased donor is 5 years (1). The Department of Health and Human Service's Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data reported that an average of 20 Americans die each day awaiting transplant. In 2018, 11 of those deaths were while waiting for a kidney. Additionally, 12 people per day were removed from the kidney transplant waiting list because they were deemed too sick to undergo the rigors of surgery (2).\n\nXenotransplantation (XTx) may be an option in addressing the organ shortage. Recent advances in genetic modification of pigs have demonstrated recipient survival in excess of a year (3). Despite their life-saving potential, the use of animal tissues in humans creates religious, ethical, and psychosocial considerations for all involved parties (4). To begin addressing these, directives from the World Health Organization, the Food and Drug Administration, and the International XTx Association all call for public involvement and transparency in evaluating the ethics and risks of XTx (5)(6)(7).\n\nGauging public attitudes toward cross-species transplantation is a necessary component to preparing for, and preemptively addressing, concerns should XTx become a clinical reality. Potential ethical considerations for society include religious objections specific to porcine tissues, animal rights, and individual fears of XTx violating the very idea of \"personhood\" (8). However, there is a lack of studies that capture the perceptions of the other major stakeholders regarding the issue of transplant organ supply from the health care providers themselves (9). The purpose of this study was to identify attitudes, perceptions, and beliefs to XTx between different stakeholders in the renal community, who will ultimately be involved in the clinical uptake and/or care of individuals who receive a xenograft.",

Scientific investigation has been undertaken in parallel with the development of guiding ethical principles and evidence-based regulatory oversight as the basis for building a logical, safe, and efficacious path to the clinic [3]. Both scientific research and regulatory guidance efforts have been focused on the goal of developing a readily available, predictably efficacious, affordable technology for worldwide application [4,5]. \n\nScientific advances have occurred on a number of fronts as the result of a concerted effort primarily led by members of the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) to usher xenotransplantation to the clinic. Pre-clinical testing in nonhuman primate (NHP) models has sought to define the most appropriate genetic characteristics of source animals for each proposed xeno organ, tissue, or cell type, and in some instances required development or adoption of supportive technology platforms (e.g., ex vivo heart perfusion for ischemia minimization) [6,7]. In addition, increasingly effective immunosuppressive protocols and herd and donor health screening protocols have been developed [8], piggery practices refined, and animal facilities built to enable efficient production of \"designated pathogen free\" animals and organs [9]. In parallel, IXA, in consultation with the Transplantation Society (TTS) and the World Health Organization (WHO), has contributed to the development of the appropriate regulatory guidances and standards around the globe for more than 25 years [10]. The journey undertaken over this time has not been without hurdles. For example, in the 1990s the risk that pandemic infection (\"xenozoonosis\") might occur as the result of xenotransplants from NHPs or pigs resulted in government moratoria preventing clinical xenotransplant trials. Here, we describe the positive advances that have enabled and justified advancing to the clinic.",

The resulting Changsha Communiqu\u00e9 broadly inscribed 10 guiding principles and 20 recommendations for consideration by \"the WHO, Member States, Investigators, and proposers of clinical trials using xenotransplantation products\". This pivotal document provided evidence-based guidance as well as expert opinion regarding clinical trial design and was a landmark document in establishing guidance for xenotransplantation. It also strengthened the collaborative link between the IXA and TTS and the WHO. This guidance was approved by the WHA and published in 2009 [49,63]. The guiding principles addressed the ethical and safety considerations surrounding xenotransplantation, emphasized the need for rigorous scientific research, robust ethical standards, and the protection of public health and animal welfare, and advocated for transparent risk assessment, informed consent, and international collaboration to minimize potential risks and address ethical concerns. The recommendations provide detailed specific guidance on ensuring the safety and efficacy of xenotransplantation practices, including the establishment of regulatory frameworks, the implementation of stringent biosafety measures, and the promotion of public and scientific dialogue to ensure responsible and ethical advancements in this field. \n\nIn 2011, the WHO and IXA organized the Second WHO Global Consultation on Regulatory Requirements for Xenotransplantation Clinical Trials, held at the WHO headquarters in Geneva [50]. This meeting focused on the refinement of guidance for infectious disease surveillance, prevention, and how best to respond appropriately to various clinical xenotransplant trial scenarios [50] significantly updating the 2001 document (WHO Guidance document on Xenogeneic Infection/Disease Surveillance and Response: A strategy for International Cooperation and Coordination) [24,33,50]. \n\nAs a direct outcome of the 2011 meeting, IXA infectious disease experts and other participants from the Consultation published a position paper in 2012 on xenotransplantation-associated infectious risks and proposed several preventative and mitigation strategies [24].",

On January 7th, 2022, a successful genetically edited porcine to human HT was performed with 60 days patient survival (31). On autopsy, the xenograft showed findings that were not consistent with typical rejection: it was edematous, nearly doubled in weight, and histologic examination revealed scattered myocyte necrosis, interstitial edema, and red-cell extravasation, without evidence of microvascular thrombosis. Studies are currently under way to identify the mechanisms responsible for these changes (32) and clearly, this experience has highlighted the presence of pathophysiological patterns that have yet to be understood. The topic of xenotransplantation, which could allow new, exciting therapeutic perspectives, raises political, ethical and moral concerns, that will have to be addressed in the years to come. Nevertheless, it represents an interesting new frontier which could make a significant contribution in solving the problem of donor shortage, guaranteeing survival hopes for patients with terminal heart disease currently lacking therapeutic alternatives.",

            "text": "The world has witnessed several efforts in xenotransplantation involving the implantation of genetically engineered organs derived from pigs into human patients. Specifically, these include two heart and two kidney surgeries in the USA and a liver transplant in China. The heart transplantation patients survived 6 and 8 weeks, the kidney patients 2 months. For the liver transplantation patient from China, there is no news available. 1 Xenotransplantation has also seen initial exemplifications as a subject of policymaking. It marked the first instance in which the precautionary principle was advised in the realm of bioethics (Sobbrio and Jorqui 2014). Additionally, xenotransplantation has prompted public consultation projects in several countries as well as an European Union-wide research project on participatory technology assessment (Griessler et al 2012). In social research, xenotransplantation serves as an instructive example to illustrate forms of governance and control such as 'pre-emptive' biopolitics and various social relations (including those associated with patienthood, animal ethics, biocapital and expertise). \n\nXenotransplantation is not a new science and there are documented experiments dating back to at least the 1600s (Deschamps et al 2005) with an intensification of sporadic attempts in the USA especially during the mid-to-late 20th century involving non-human primates as source animals and human patients. Most recently, novel scientific insights have emerged with the development of the gene editing system CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), a tool that scientists working in the field of xenotransplantation praise for its technoscientific capacities to overcome previous hurdles like porcine endogenous retroviruses alongside a host of other transspecies immunological challenges. In addition to the recent pig-to-human transplantations, experiments with genetically engineered pig organs have been conducted on brain-dead individuals in the USA and in China, attempting to supplement the preclinical non-human primate model (Montgomery et al 2024). Yet despite these developments and changes in the scientific and clinical landscape of xenotransplantation, many social and ethical aspects persist.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, bioethics was born in response to history. A global regime of horrific human subject research from the early to mid-20th century prompted a sharp, introspective examination of biomedicine that saw patients, practitioners, and experts in research, law, and what was to be known as the burgeoning field of bioethics focus on explicit and  implicit rights within the researcher-subject relationship. In the United States, the 1970s saw a radical change in biomedical practice \"from a narrow focus on the physician's or the researcher's obligation to disclose information\" to a new paradigm of patient-practitioner relationships that emphasized the \"quality of a patient's or subject's understanding.\" Notably, this paradigm included newfound rights to \"authorize or refuse a biomedical intervention\" 9 . In other words, these years saw a \"dramatic solidification\" of specific research and care-oriented perspectives, including biomedical researchers' new \"moral and legal duty\" 9 to seek consent from patients. This duty includes a continuous process of providing sufficient information for subjects to establish and maintain informed consent 9 . The purpose of this article is not to provide a comprehensive or even robust history of bioethics. Rather, we refer to this history to highlight the historical purpose of the institution's function: to protect those most vulnerable to potential abuse by biomedical researchers. When examining bioethics' interaction with xenotransplantation, we find the ethical discussion of relevant issues, particularly the utilization and treatment of initial transplant recipients, underdeveloped. Ethical issues concerning human and non-human research subjects within the realm of xenotransplantation ought to be openly discussed with a host of different stakeholders, including the public (comprised of would-be transplant recipients), biomedical researchers, and experts in as many fields that still allow for coherent and progressive discourse. We hope that by identifying ethical areas in need of attention, both the animals and research subjects will meet a better fate than their predecessors. Additionally, if it can truly operate as a panacea for so many preexisting issues within solid organ transplantation systems, xenotransplantation's role in society should be constructed with these sociohistorical consequences in mind.",

Along with a view over the past several decades with the overall significant advancements in pre-clinical study outcomes particularly in islet, kidney, and heart xenotransplantation, to ultimately reach the pinnacle of successful clinical heart and kidney xenotransplants. It outlines the importance for the appropriate guidance\u2019s required to have been developed by experts, scientists, clinicians, and other players who helped develop the field over the past decades. It also touches upon patient advocacy along with perspectives and expectations of patients, along with public opinion and media influence on the understanding and perception of xenotransplantation. It discusses the legislative environment in different jurisdictions which are reviewed in line with current clinical practices. All of which are ultimately based upon the guidance\u2019s developed from a strong long-term collaboration between the International Xenotransplantation Association, the World Health Organisation and The Transplantation Society; each having constantly undertaken consultation and outreach to help develop best practice for clinical xenotransplantation application. These clearly helped forge the legislative frameworks required along with harmonization and standardization of regulations which are detailed here. Also, in relation to the significant advances in the context of initial xeno-kidney trials and the even greater potential for clinical xeno-islet trials to commence we discuss the significant advantages of xenotransplantation and the ultimate benefit to our patients.",

The risk for unrecognized pathogens is present but ill defined.\n\nSurveillance for the transmission of known or unknown pathogens among health care workers must be conducted by monitoring for unexpected or unexplained adverse health events. It is difficult to monitor for the unknown; therefore, surveillance should include notifying the principal investigator's office of any unexplained illness in exposed health care workers, as well as telephone interviews of these personnel every 6 months by the principal investigator's office.\n\nConcurrent with scientific advances in xenotransplantation have been the necessary ethical debates concerning the appropriateness of this endeavor (5). Disputes regarding animal experimentation notwithstanding, the ethical issues raised by many of these debates are strikingly similar to those put forth 25 years ago in reference to the (then new) field of human heart transplantation. Indeed, the timeless nature of these queries itself attests to their essence, for such ethical concerns are appropriate in the appraisal of any new therapeutic procedure in medicine.\n\nCan one ever hope to determine if or when the clinical application of xenotransplantation is justified? The assessment of any experimental therapy, as Fox and Swazey (6) have suggested, should encourage the investigator to address three critical questions: 1) in the laboratory, what defines \"success\" sufficient to warrant advancement to the clinical arena? 2) under what clinical conditions should this advancement proceed? and 3) in the clinical arena, what defines \"success\" sufficient to warrant further evaluation (6)? Providing answers to this threefold inquiry requires a reliance upon defined \"success,\" itself an appraisal of judgment that can only confidently be made in retrospect.\n\nBecause human heart transplantation is now considered by most justifiable for the treatment of end-stage heart disease, I would first like to review the history of cardiac allotransplantation in light of its ability to address the above threefold inquiry. I will also discuss the history of cardiac xenotransplantation with reference to scientific advances made in the field throughout the past quarter century.

One of the challenges that patients and their relatives may face can be seen in the dual construction of the xenotransplanted body (viewed as sacred and profane, subjective and depersonalised, both similar and different from the 'donor' species; organs as essential and disposable, simultaneously vitalistic and mechanical). These complexities may pose a potential burden for those affected (potential and actual recipients) necessitating careful consideration and grappling with these intricate aspects. \n\nMany factors remain speculative, such as the potential impact of organ transplant commodification on society and the symbolic value of the organ as a gift. Companies producing genetically engineered pigs for xenotransplantation are already implementing different strategies for their 'products'. Revivicor, which provided the porcine hearts for the first cardiac xenotransplants, and eGenesis, which respectively provided the first kidney, each implemented 10 or more genetic modifications to the source pigs. Meanwhile, scientists in Germany Current controversy advocate that fewer genetic edits to the source pigs are a safer and more reproducible approach (Kemter et al 2020;Wolf et al 2023). These competing approaches have the potential to develop into national market strategies as companies work to develop different models of genetically modified pigs as new biocommodities. This could lead to challenges in decisionmaking options for xenotransplantation patients, and is likely to pose new regulatory challenges (Cook et al 2013).",

It is due to the fact that transplants of animal organs are currently in the experimental phase. The main current problem of transplantology is the shortage of organs; hence, the search for new solutions has become an everyday challenge. If a way for the human body to tolerate animal organs could be found, transplant medicine and humanity would be in a completely different place. The authors introduce the concepts of transplantation and xenotransplantation and their origins, then they raise ethical issues related to this type of organ transplantation. Finally, the authors conclude that xenotransplantations have a chance to be \u201cincorporated\u201d (back again) in the \u201ctransplants\u201d category when the experimental phase of xenotransplantation shifts to the implementation stage. Time will tell whether it will be possible.",

In addition to these general ethical concerns, South Korea's strong Confucian influence necessitates culturally tailored ethical considerations. Therefore, enough public discussions, social consensus and appropriate regulatory framework are required before proceeding with human trials and clinical application [13]. Previously, similar surveys on the perception of xenotransplantation were conducted in Korea [14,15]. Given that xenotransplantation technology now extends to organ transplantation, which bring about new issues and ethico-legal implications, it is time to conduct another perception survey.",

            "text": "One ethical concern intrinsic to xenotransplantation relates to the potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans, a phenomenon known as xenozoonosis. The concept of transmission although theoretical is not unfounded, as various pathogens, including retroviruses, have been identified in pigs could be potential threats in immunocompromised transplant recipients and then theoretically spread to direct close contacts and the broader community (24,25). \n\nAs such this raises potential ethical dilemmas. The duty to protect the broader community and prevent the spread of theoretically potential infectious diseases must be weighed against the need to explore novel medical solutions to help these patients suffering from end stage organ failure and other diseases (6). The possibility of creating animals free from such pathogens as porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) through genetic engineering (26) has already been shown to be possible along with raising donor animals in designated pathogen free (DPF) facilities. Along with pigs that have limited pathogens including restricted PERV (27) or where studies have shown no potential for transmission (28, 29). Despite best intensions and even following screening of donor animals we have seen that donor pig organs can still potentially have undetectable porcine viruses such as cytomegalovirus or porcine roseolovirus (PCMV/PRV) detected posttransplant in the donor tissue by plasma microbial cell-free DNA (30). This occurred despite pre-transplant screening and following transplantation into a patient (25). \n\nFrom a patient and community perspective it is therefore essential for the patients, their family and immediate direct contacts along with the community to understand that if there were in fact a positive case of transmission of a xenozoonosis into a xenotransplant patient that there may well be serious implications to all involved. These implications are potentially as severe as lifelong restriction and quarantine of the recipient and may extend to their direct close contacts (25).",

            "text": "first-in-human porcine heart xenotransplantation, which was performed on January 7, 2022. The patient, who was not eligible for a heart allotransplant (humanto-human transplantation) due to a history of noncompliance with a recommended medical regimen and was unsuitable for an LVAD because of arrhythmias, survived for over two months before succumbing to heart failure. The experience showed the promise of xenotransplantation. It also attested to the risks. For example, although the exact cause of the patient's death requires further investigation, tests performed shortly after the xenotransplant procedure revealed a latent porcine cytomegalovirus that had infected the pig and might have been responsible for the patient's heart dysfunction. The viral infection occurred even though the pig had been bred in a virus-free environment and the viral testing performed on the pig prior to the transplant was negative. Alternatively, an untoward reaction to an antirejection drug might have contributed to the patient's heart failure. 4 Even with this uncertainty about why the patient died, there will be ongoing attempts at xenotransplantation. This prospect, in conjunction with additional animal experiments as mandated by the FDA, suggests that the time has come to discuss the design of the forthcoming clinical xenotransplantation trials. 5 Such clinical trials would require continued refinement of a regulatory framework for interspecies transplantation. Such a framework, which the FDA has begun to outline, would attempt to ensure the efficacy and safety of xenotransplantation products and procedures and to provide strategies to measure their identity, purity, and potency; develop methods to assess infectious disease risks associated with xenotransplantation products and porcine donor animals; review current strategies to control xenotransplant rejection; and address the appropriate surveillance monitoring techniques of potential viral transmissions posttransplant to ensure patient and societal safety from zoonotic infections. 6 In addition to a regulatory framework, ethical guidelines are needed to answer the question, when is it ethically permissible to involve patients in xenotransplantation, specifically, in the context of clinical trials?\n\nIn this article, we approach this question",

            "text": "Scholars have looked at societal and religious attitudes toward xenotransplantation, convening focus groups of local religious leaders, organ procurement organizations' staff, patients who need or have already received a transplant and local members of the business community [9]. Participants expressed concern about the ethics of using animals and the stigma of pigs in some religions. While many participants expressed ethical concerns, they didn't see them as a roadblock, particularly if the heart and islet cells from the pig kidney donor could be used for other recipients. Imams and rabbis argued that the need to honor human life would take precedence over religious prohibitions against eating pork. Some participants worried about stigma for the recipient, particularly children, as well as isolation if infection risk required them to stay [10] away from other people. Transplant administrators wondered whether insurers would pay for a pig kidney in someone who was too sick for a human kidney. Some participants questioned whether children should be given priority, while others worried about creating a two-tier system of who gets pig kidneys and whether pig and human kidneys are allocated differently. \n\nIn a theological symposium on xenotransplantation, the main themes among Jewish, Christian and Islamic commentators concerned the duty to heal, the need to treat the whole person and the need to put xenotransplantation in the context of its goals, the effect on the recipient, and the effects on society in terms of equity, justice and cost. A separate discussion of Islamic legal thinking about xenotransplantation examined the inherent contradictions in using an impure animal only if the treatment is considered life-saving [11]. Muhammad Mohiuddin, one of the cardiothoracic surgeons who transplanted a pig heart into a human recipient at the University of Maryland in January, told The New Yorker that as a Muslim he faced resistance from his family when he started to work with pigs. 'We don't eat pork or talk about pork.' But he said after talking to religious leaders, 'the consensus was that saving lives takes precedence over everything' [12].",

Scientists have explored xenotransplantation methods for decades, but research with vital organ xenotransplants has been in largely haphazard and non-controlled studies, which demonstrated only short-duration survival for recipients.[iv] Recent advances using gene modification and improved immunosuppression in single-patient attempts to transplant porcine organs into brain-dead human recipients have presented more realistic human-environment models; however, these modified xenografts have still functioned only for very short durations.[v]\nThe limited bioethics discourse on xenotransplantation centers primarily on the ethical use of high-order animals and the risks of zoonotic infectious disease spread.[vi] Bioethics pays insufficient attention to the potential for exploitation of vulnerable individuals in need of a transplant amid growing interest in phase I clinical trials in living human subjects. Clinician-investigators in contemporary literature repeatedly recommend that these trials enroll subjects who are medically eligible for, but effectively excluded or outright denied access to, an allograft.[vii] The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) recommends xenotransplants be limited to subjects with serious or life-threatening diseases for whom adequately safe and effective alternative therapies are not available.[viii] The ethically salient difference between the investigator and the regulatory recommendations is why alternatives are not available to potential subjects: because transplant centers have subjectively denied access or because there is a clinical contraindication that proves prohibitively risky.\u00a0 In a notable single-patient emergency use authorization, physician-investigators offered a genetically modified porcine heart to a living male recipient after denying him access to the waitlist for a human-donor heart, citing a history of non-compliance.[ix] \u00a0This case suggests that a person denied access to a transplant waitlist due to subjective compliance criteria is an appropriate research subject. The physician-investigators failed to acknowledge how offering a xenotransplant to a contextually vulnerable subject is potentially unfair. Contextual vulnerability is a specific feature of a research environment that increases a subject\u2019s risk of harm.

Other issues need to be considered and reconciled before xenotransplantation of pig kidneys becomes a solution to the organ shortage for people waiting for a kidney transplant or as a viable alternative to the deceased donor or living donor human kidneys. Human trials will be needed beyond brain-dead individuals to show that xenotransplantation is safe from immunologic and infectious standpoints. Transplant centers will need to show that xenotransplantation provides a long-term benefit to recipients and is financially viable. If trials are successful and receive regulatory approval, pig xenotransplants may become another option for people waiting for a kidney.

While the academic discussion on the ethical implications of XT has already started (Manesh et al, 2014), a broader societal debate is still lacking. This public deliberation may be more relevant for XT than for other biomedical innovations as it affects us as human beings and our relationship to animals. Therefore, the questions raised cannot be answered by reference to scientific evidence or ethical theories, but have to be deliberated in society. Not discussing these issues could result in an ethical rejection of promising XT therapies. However, public deliberation about XT is especially difficult, as the topic is hardly recognized among the general population owing to its novelty and biomedical complexity. We therefore organized a citizens' conference because it provides a useful tool to elicit well-informed and carefully reflected opinions on the topic. The results of the conference, a written evaluative statement on xenotransplantation, the so-called citizens' vote, has been published online, debated publicly, and was sent to healthcare politicians. The goals of the citizens' conference were to inform public debate and support policy and political decision-making. The results seem especially relevant in that it marks the first public consultation since the aforementioned research breakthrough in XT, thus reflecting the latest stage of research and development. Public deliberation on XT has been considered especially necessary because \"[t]o date [. . .] ethical thinking has largely been left in the hands of scientists\" (Jasanoff, 2018). For example, in Germany, there has hardly been any public debate on the current state of XT so far, nor has XT been considered by law or politics (Brown & Beynon-Jones, 2010). \n\n\"Yes, but. . .\"-the citizens' statement on xenotransplantation Eighteen citizens, recruited through a multistage process based on random and self-selection, met over three weekends, during which they received information about XT, listened to and discussed with experts from various disciplines, and engaged in intensive group deliberations.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation is emerging as a vital solution to the critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, significantly propelled by advancements in genetic engineering and the development of sophisticated immunosuppressive treatments. Specifically, the transplantation of kidneys from genetically engineered pigs into human patients has made significant progress, offering a potential clinical solution to the shortage of human kidney supply. Recent trials involving the transplantation of these modified porcine kidneys into deceased human bodies have underscored the practicality of this approach, advancing the field towards potential clinical applications. However, numerous challenges remain, especially in the domains of identifying suitable donor-recipient matches and formulating effective immunosuppressive protocols crucial for transplant success. Critical to advancing xenotransplantation into clinical settings are the nuanced considerations of anesthesia and surgical practices required for these complex procedures. The precise genetic modification of porcine kidneys marks a significant leap in addressing the biological and immunological hurdles that have traditionally challenged xenotransplantation. Yet, the success of these transplants hinges on the process of meticulously matching these organs with human recipients, which demands thorough understanding of immunological compatibility, the risk of organ rejection, and the prevention of zoonotic disease transmission. In parallel, the development and optimization of immunosuppressive protocols are imperative to mitigate rejection risks while minimizing side effects, necessitating innovative approaches in both pharmacology and clinical practices. Furthermore, the",

In March 2024, the first xenotransplant of a pig's kidney in a 62-year-old man living with ESKD was conducted in the United States. The organ was genetically edited to prevent rejection and infections. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently approves xenotransplants for compassionate use only [25]. This novel procedure, greeted as a major milestone in the effort to provide available organs to patients in the future, raises additional clinical and ethical issues as it offers a potentially viable alternative to LDKT. \n\nThe aim of this narrative review is to discuss the main current ethical challenges in performing LDKT for both recipients and donors and to inform clinical professionals in the field. Ethical topics will be explored through the four key principles of biomedical ethics: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice.",

            "text": "The transplantation of organs across differentially raced bodies has elicited questions about the nature of race itself, from both biological and cultural perspectives (Lederer 2008;Park et al 2022). In the case of xenotransplantation, issues concerning race have the potential to expand in complicated ways. While some researchers hail xenotransplants as potentially superior to allotransplants (Hunter 2009), such an understanding fails to take into account social and cultural aversions towards violating the animal-human boundary. It is therefore not clear whether, if given a choice, patients would ever voluntarily opt for a non-human over a human organ. For minoritised groups who have historically been animalised through scientific rhetoric, the stakes of crossing this boundary are even higher (Glick 2018). While the perspectives of minority groups on xenotransplantation have been examined occasionally (eg, Padilla et al 2021 assessed acceptance across different racial groups in the USA), the views of minorities across various social categories and in different countries require more systematic research. \n\nMoreover, we have also observed challenges in the patient selection process for 'compassionate use' (or 'expanded access') candidates for xenotransplantation, particularly in the USA, where requirements for psychosocial support and compliance are biased in terms of class, race and dis/ability. This leaves those patients in a particularly vulnerable position with no alternatives once experimental xenotransplantation is offered (Strand 2023). \n\nOn the other hand, the debate on global justice (Rothblatt 2004;Sparrow 2009), especially concerning the unequal distribution of risks, has diminished with some even now endorsing xenotransplantation development in selected countries (Rothblatt 2023). Nevertheless, the unequal distribution of risks is still possible through the outsourcing of xenotransplantation experiments and trials to parts of the world where regulatory requirements may be less stringent or where the potential economic benefits of offering niche treatments to medical (xeno)tourists may be highly appealing (Cook 2013;Cook et al 2011).",

As science has advanced, the regulations have been adapted to keep pace with the changing landscape in transplantation but it still lacks the oversight and ability to completely control all that occurs. Despite the best policies and guidance's more universal legislation is required to outlaw and prevent organ trafficking and ongoing issues associated with unscrupulous operators (44). The early years of xenotransplantation were characterized by limited regulatory oversight and fragmented approaches to the management of potential risks due to limited legislation to this new field. However, significant oversight was established early on by the WHO, TTS and IXA to ensure there were guidance's developed to underpin the field (2-4). \n\nHowever, high-profile setbacks and scientific developments have prompted a revaluation of regulatory frameworks. An example of this was the identification of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) which raised concerns by government legislators about the potential transmission of these retroviruses to immunocompromised transplant recipients (45). As a result, several jurisdictions-initiated moratorium preventing any clinical xenotransplantation trials from commencing and as such a stronger focus was placed on the assessment and management of this risk in regulatory guidelines (46). \n\nRecently, regulatory bodies have intensified their efforts to provide comprehensive guidelines for xenotransplantation, reflecting a growing recognition of the field's incredible potential with a balance against the risks. Some guidance's such as from the USA FDA have addressed issues such as genetic modifications in source animals, monitoring for infectious agents, and the ethical treatment of donor animals (42).

            "text": "Historically, xenotransplantation has traversed a challenging path, with initial attempts to transplant animal organs into humans dating back to the early 20th century, notably beginning in 1906 (13). The pursuit of understanding xenotransplantation's complexities led researchers to utilize animal models that have smaller body sizes, despite their significant genetic differences from humans (e.g., a 33.4% nucleotide difference between mice and rats, compared to a 2.6% difference between macaques and baboons). These models, particularly rodents, were instrumental in elucidating the humoral and cellular dynamics of xenotransplantation. Up until 2012, rodents were the backbone of xenotransplantation studies, contributing to approximately 95% of research in the field. The advent of sophisticated genetic editing technologies has recently shifted the preference towards NHPs as models, given their closer genetic proximity to humans, which allows for more accurate simulation of immunosuppressive strategies and rejection mechanisms. \n\nThe utilization of brain-dead individuals as recipients of pig kidney transplants has served as a crucial intermediary step towards clinical xenotransplantation research (14). Although this model has provided invaluable insights, it is limited by the short survival times of the recipients, which restricts the exploration of long-term complications such as viral transmissions or abnormal organ growth (15). Establishing a standardized selection criterion for human recipients of xenotransplant organs remains a work in progress. Proposals suggest prioritizing individuals for whom conventional treatments have failed, or who face long waiting time for allogeneic transplants due to immunological sensitivities, such as a high level of panel reactive antibodies (PRA) (16). However, the selection of highly sensitized patients poses its own set of challenges, including the potential for adverse reactions between pig (swine leukocyte antigen, SLA) and human (human leukocyte antigen, HLA) antigens (16,17). The field of xenotransplantation is at a critical juncture, requiring expanded research efforts to explore not only the scientific and ethical ramifications of these procedures but also the practical aspects of preparing for and managing post-transplant care.",

This meticulous genetic engineering aims to produce organs that are not only less likely to be rejected but also capable of performing their physiological functions without inducing harmful side effects in the recipient. \n\nThe continuous exploration and refinement of these genetic modifications underscore the complexity of making xenotransplantation a viable clinical option. As researchers dive deeper into the genetic underpinnings of immune rejection and organ compatibility, xenotransplantation alleviating the organ shortage crisis is coming true. Yet, it is essential to balance the enthusiasm for these technological advances with a careful assessment of their long-term implications for both organ recipients and the broader field of transplantation medicine. \n\nFuture research must also address the ethical considerations and regulatory challenges associated with xenotransplantation. As genetic engineering techniques become more sophisticated, consensus of the moral, ethical, and societal implications of using genetically modified animals for organ transplantation must be reached. Those topics warranting immediate attention includes animal welfare, the potential impact on natural ecosystems, and the long-term health outcomes for transplant recipients. Moreover, as the field progresses towards potential clinical applications, establishing clear and comprehensive regulatory frameworks will be crucial to ensuring the safety, efficacy, and ethical integrity of organ xenotransplantation. \n\nWhile the genetic engineering of pigs for kidney xenotransplantation represents a frontier of medical science with the potential to dramatically expand the organ donor pool, it also poses a myriad of scientific, ethical, and regulatory challenges.",

Although potential harms of pig-to-human xenotransplantation exist, such as cross-species infection, transplant rejection, psychological harm, risks of wear and tear and threats to altruism, these harms may be mitigated through appropriate strategies. We address the objection that xenotransplantation is unnatural. We respond that the sense in which xenotransplantation is unnatural is unclear, and moreover, does not demonstrate that it is wrong. Overall, we claim that the benefits of pig-to-human xenotransplantation are likely to outweigh the harms, if appropriate steps are taken.

            "text": "Additionally, multiorgan donation costs are extensive, complicating current financial repatriation to the donor family, donor hospitals, organ donor agencies, and all involved in the extensive logistics of the organ donor process. The ability to acquire a GE pig organ whenever required through a simple commercial transaction (as in the purchase of a life-saving drug) will be of great benefit to the patient and society [72]. \n\nIn today's information-driven society, public consultation is crucial for ensuring that individuals are well-informed and able to make educated decisions about complex issues such as xenotransplantation. As advancements in medical science continue to push boundaries, the public demands comprehensive and transparent information to understand the implications of new technologies. Effective public consultation involves not only providing detailed background information but also engaging in open dialogues that address the diverse perspectives and concerns of the community. This approach ensures that decisions are made with a thorough understanding of both the potential benefits and risks, fostering a more informed and participatory society. \n\nThere are several avenues by which we can move forward, but the IXA leadership believes that a systematic public consultative process performed at an international level should be undertaken as the basis for developing a consensus on the multiple challenging aspects from both safety and ethical areas associated with xenotransplantation clinical translation. The IXA is concerned that if clinical trials take place without proper consultation of health professionals and the public at large, there is a risk that xenotransplant activities could generate a negative perception among the public, which could degenerate rapidly via social media into a world-wide negative perception of the field, likely delaying or preventing evaluation of potentially life-saving new xeno-based treatments. In the estimation of IXA Council, it is important to be pro-active and to proceed deliberately in anticipation of clinical application of xenografts, rather than to act in response to a crisis, trying to deal with foreseeable concerns after the fact. In Table 1. we propose a plan for public consultation on xenotransplantation for clinical application. This plan aims to educate, foster transparency, build trust, and ensure that the public's voice is heard and considered in the decision-making process related to xenotransplantation.",

The concept of utilizing non-human sources to meet the organ demand has captured the imagination of scientists, healthcare providers, and patients alike. As advancements in science and technology have brought the prospect of xenotransplantation closer to reality, the ethical and legislative landscape surrounding this pioneering field has gained increasing attention especially with the last few years of accelerated progress and commencement of limited life-saving heart and kidney xenotransplantation which have been approved under special compassionate use authorization (i.e., a specific treatment for patients with immediate life-threatening conditions to have access to investigational products outside of an U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved clinical trial when no comparable or alternative therapeutic treatment exists to treat the patient's life threatening illness) (10-12, 15). \n\nHistorically, xenotransplantation's journey has been marked by both hope and challenge. As seen in Figure 1.

Unfortunately, on the second attempted use of xeno-transfusion it proved unsuccessful and resulted in the death of the patient after which xeno-transfusion was outlawed by the French government (16). \n\nIn 1906 the first reported successful kidney xenotransplant was carried out by Mathieu Jaboulay after he and Alexis Carrel perfected the technique of vascular anastomosis. Jaboulay used the vascular technique to transplant a pig kidney onto the brachial artery and cephalic vein of a 48-yr-old woman.",

            "text": "Humans have long been captivated by the possibility of merging physical features of animals and humans. This is evident in Greek, Roman and Egyptian mythology, in which human-animal hybrids are deeply entrenched. [1] Xenotransplantation, which is the trans plantation of organs, tissues or clusters of specialised cells from one species to another, may seem like a modern extension of this ancient mythology. [2] nterest in animal-to-human transplantation (xenografts) has significantly increased in the last few decades, owing to the limitations on successful human-to-human organ transplantation (allografts) resulting from chronic scarcities of donated human organs, and transplant rejection. [3] Pig organs are of particular interest, and hold enormous potential to mitigate the rising demand for transplantable human organs, by creating a new and vast supply of organs for human transplantation, thereby potentially resolving the crisis of human organ scarcity. [3] till, xenotransplantation raises several ethical issues. While the ethical and regulatory aspects are much discussed in international contexts, there is little work that considers the South African (SA) context. [4] This is problematic, since in SA there is currently no direct legislation or regulation addressing xenotransplantation. [4] To inform potential regulation in SA, we address the ethics of fatally extracting pig organs for transplantation in humans, and argue that: (i) the benefits of the intervention are likely to outweigh the harms, provided harm mitigation strategies to be discussed are employed; and (ii) that the perceived unnaturalness of xenotransplantation ought not be considered an obstacle to its morality. \n\nBefore proceeding, it is important to clarify our scope in three respects. First, our focus is on pig-to-human organ transplantation, rather than xenograft cell and tissue transplantation. This is because the donation of organs appears likely to raise more significant ethical and emotional concerns. Second, our focus on pigs in particular for xenotransplantation is justified by the fact that this is the type of animal source about which there is the most scientific knowledge. The scientific basis for our claim may differ in other animal species.",

Yet, these different notions of similarity and difference create a paradox within xenotransplantation. That is, xenotransplantation rests on a boundary that is supposed to exist between non-human animals and humans, which makes non-human and human the same but different. Herewith the paradox; on the one hand, xenotransplantation relies on the perceived biological similarity of organs between human and non-human animals and yet on the other, xenotransplantation challenges both the biological and social boundary of difference that makes humans separate and different to non-human animals. Hinterberg draws attention to this anomaly in her analysis of regulatory decisionmaking whereby 'regulators and policymakers now find themselves in a curious position. On the one hand, they continue to regulate the estrangement between humans and other animals, but on the other, they support the creation of chimeric life-a form of life that draws into question the very basis of such separations' (Hinterberger 2020(Hinterberger , 1065.\n\nTo demonstrate the xenotransplantation paradox (that is, 'nonhuman animals are the same as humans but different') I begin reviewing research on patient, health professional and public attitudes that have consistently demonstrated negativity towards xenotransplantation (Appel III, Alwayn, and Cooper 2000;Bona et al 2004;Brown 1999;Brown and Michael 2004;Butler 1998;Canova et al 2006;Conesa et al 2006;Cook 2013;Fovargue 2007;Hagelin 2004;Lundin 2002;Lundin and Idvall 2003;Lundin and Widner 2000;Macer et al 2002;Martinez-Alarcon et al 2005;Michael and Brown 2004;Mohacsi et al 1995;Mohacsi et al 1997;Mohacsi, Thompson, and Quine 1998;Persson et al 2003;Rios et al 2007;Sanner 2005;Schlitt et al 1999).

Two primary cardiac transplantation procedures have been explored: orthotopic cardiac xenotransplantation (oCXTx) and intrathoracic heterotopic cardiac xenotransplantation (ITHCXTx) [12]. \n\nThe ultimate goal of xenotransplantation is to save human lives and alleviate suffering related to organ failure [13]. While certain achievements have gained recognition, xenotransplantation remains largely in the preclinical phase, especially for organs with complex vasculature. Ethical considerations also come into play, including concerns related to animal welfare and human autonomy. From a theological ethics perspective, a complete ban on xenotransplantation is not justifiable. Instead, the practice should be conducted responsibly, preserving human dignity and autonomy while ensuring the ethical treatment of animals [8].",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation aspires to be the next medical frontier, offering therapeutic solutions to patients with end-stage organ disease. Yet despite progress in genetic engineering of more immune-compatible pigs as donors, the question remains how to best operationalize xenotransplantation from experimental to mainstream practice to address current organ access disparities and inherent inequities in the organ allocation system, without compromising patient outcomes 12 . In an ideal scenario, the introduction of a supply of pig organs that could be produced just-in-time for transplant and function as well as current standards of human organ donation would alleviate pressures on the allocation system (and may potentially eliminate the need for an allocation system). It would also shift the public health priority to organ manufacturing, distribution, identifying suitable patients with end-stage organ disease, and developing a workforce with the capabilities of caring for xenotransplant patients. \n\nHowever, the science of xenotransplantation remains in its early stages. In 2022, the first pig-to-human heart transplant was performed in a 57 year-old man with end-stage heart disease who was denied a human heart transplant based on concerns he was not a suitable candidate 13 . He did not leave the hospital postoperatively and died of complications within 2 months of the xenotransplant. Although he was fully consented for the potential risks and many would describe this first xenotransplant as an innovative success, his outcome was far below the expected survival from a human heart transplant. More recently, in March 2024, a 62 year-old man (whose previous human kidney transplant failed after 5 years) received the world's first pig kidney transplant and was discharged 2 weeks later to continue his recovery from home; as of this writing, he remains in good condition 14 . \n\nSo, to continue advancing this innovation, who should be the research participants? Medical history would suggest that medical advances often occur through the efforts of vulnerable populations with limited treatment options 15 . There are thus several challenges in developing an equitable, highquality xenotransplant system. The first challenge is determining the functional quality of transplanted pig organs as better or worse than human organs, or good enough to justify consideration as a viable treatment modality versus no transplant.",

Specifically, an abundance of available organs means little when the cost of receiving a transplant is still prohibitive. A \"wiser\" approach, they continue, would be to invest in \"primary health care\" rather than \"expensive biotechnologies\" 38 . In other words, society should work to prevent organ failure \"as opposed to instituting transplant programs with limited accessibility\" 38 . \n\nAn illegal market in trafficked organs is nearly universally identified as a moral wrong arising in response to global organ scarcity. However, it is not yet clear to what degree developments in xenotransplantation would disrupt the current system. If, for example, organ is a concern in the existing network of policies and market powers, does it follow that shifting biomedical interest away from human donors to non-human donors would eliminate that practice? Or would organ tourism be replaced with a type of xenotourism, where wealthy would-be xenotransplant recipients could search the world for biomedical facilities with relatively lax rules and limited ethical oversight? As we recover from the zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, other contributors to the bioethical discourse argue that \"robust precautions\" are necessary to safeguard against the transmission of non-human diseases to \"human xenograft recipients\" 39 in what many envision as a global market in xenotransplantation. Despite earlier evidence that xenotransplantation teams are acutely aware of the risk of xenogeneic diseases, brief published commentaries and ethical algorithms pale compared to global markets pushing for further exploitation of xenohearts and other organs. \n\nWhile it remains to be seen how and to what degree xenotransplantation might address the black market of trafficked organs, we can use our current system to speculate on how to implement what is seemingly the inevitable rise of xenotransplantation practices.",

One cautionary argument in opposition to the use of animal organs concerns the possibility of transferring animal bacteria and viruses to humans. Some argue that xenotransplantation is the only www.intechopen.com potential way of addressing this shortage. As immunological barriers to xenotransplantation are better understood, those hurdles are being addressed through genetic engineering of donor animals and the development of new drugs therapies [Starzl etal 1964& Grant etal 2001. The focus of ethical attention has changed from the moral correctness of using animals for research/therapy to an increasingly appreciated danger of the establishment and spread of xenozoonses in recipients, their contacts and the general public. There are a number of reasons for not using subhuman primates for xenotransplantation, including their closeness to humans, the likelihood of passing on infections, their availability (gorillas, chimpanzees), their slow breeding and the expense of breeding them under specified pathogen free conditions. The pig, although domesticated and familiar, is too distant to evoke the same feeling as we have for primates, has the correct size organs, is probably less likely to pass infections, breeds rapidly and is not endangered; moreover, millions of them are eaten every year. Although drawing ethical conclusions is difficult at the stage of knowledge and debate, it seems acceptable to manipulate pigs genetically and to proceed to using their organs for xenotransplantation trials when infection control measures and the scientific base justify it [Bukler etal 1999& Sim etal 1999. The use of pigs in Muslim countries would be more controversial and disruptive although it is acceptable by Islamic religion in case of a real need and when there is no alternative [Rahman 1998]. In this case the question of informed consent is likely to be ambiguous and awkward. It might end up more of a binding legal contract than consent, as we understand it now. Xenotransplantation is also unlikely to cost less than or significantly alleviate the shortage of cadaveric organs in the short term. The international dimension of the risk of infection is becoming obvious, but there has so far been no effort to",

A concerted effort is required to navigate the intricate interweaving of scientific advancement and ethical imperatives. Recognition of underlying ethical issues, awareness and education of ethical dilemmas are the key first step to resolve. Clinical ethicists and bioethicists should be involved in research protocols, scientific experimentation, and implementation procedures. One such avenue for future exploration lies in addressing ethical concerns surrounding interspecies organ transplantations. Research endeavours should prioritize the development of robust immunomodulatory strategies to minimize the risk of rejection and zoonotic transmission, ensuring the safety, efficacy and long-term utility of xenogeneic liver transplantation. Furthermore, the emergence of stem cell therapies offers unprecedented opportunities to overcome the limitations of traditional organ transplantation. Ethical issues such as informed consent, patient autonomy and equitable access to emerging treatment modalities should find a prominent place in public discourse. A deeper dive into the concerns related to genetic manipulation and long-term safety is due. Ethical frameworks have to be established to properly govern the creation and utilization of human-animal hybrids. Collaborative efforts between scientists, surgeons, policymakers and ethicists will be essential to navigate the complexities to ensure that management principles are still guided by the principles of beneficence, justice and respect for human dignity.",

            "text": "The reemergence of xenotransplantation as a therapeutic option for the hundreds of thousands of people dying each year of heart, kidney, lung, and liver failure has raised ethical, social, and scientific questions. End-stage organ failure is one of the most important public health problems facing Americans today. Heart failure, for example, kills four times as many people as does HIV infection and three times as many people as does breast cancer; it is a disease with an increasing incidence, and the cost of taking care of affected patients is 8 to 35 billion dollars each year. The single most effective therapy for it is transplantation. Preventive therapies have had little impact on diseases due to end-stage organ failure and are unlikely to have an impact at least in the next decade. In the meantime, demand for organs, which far outstrips the supply, continues to grow. It has been estimated that approximately 45,000 Americans under age 65 could benefit each year from heart transplantation, yet only 2,000 human hearts are available annually. Patients are more likely to die waiting for a human donor heart than in the first 2 years after transplantation.\n\nAlthough clearly an experimental procedure, xenotransplantation between closely related species, such as baboons and humans, offers an alternative to allotransplantation as a source of human organ replacement. Alternatives to allograft donors, such as baboon or pig xenografts, require serious investigation if clinical transplantation is ever to meet the current demand and continue the explosive growth pattern it has established over the past quarter century.\n\nBiologic cardiac replacement poses the immunologic problems of rejection and infection associated with transplantation. Increasing clinical experience worldwide has shown that rejection and infection can be managed successfully in most patients who receive human cardiac allografts. Further, the introduction of cyclosporine as the primary immunosuppressive agent for cardiac transplant recipients has resulted in excellent survival rates (85% 1-year survival at most centers) and has decreased illness associated with infection and rejection. Although considerable advances have been made in the field of cardiac xenotransplantation since its first clinical application by Hardy in 1964 (1), it remains uncertain whether xenotransplantation as destination therapy can be successfully applied to humans",

Additionally, this does not include the pharmaceutical supports that will need to be developed to prevent the rejection of the organs throughout the recipient's life. Getting the genetic basis of the porcine donor is just one step of many that will need to be perfected to make xenotransplantation a legitimate realworld solution to the crisis of demand for organ transplants. Notably, the xenotransplantation team at the heart of Mr. Bennett's story recalled the difficult biomedical journey that resulted in a transplant-ready xenoheart as \"based on trialand-error over a decade\" with \"many dozens of experiments carried out\" 28 . \n\nSurmounting one of the immunological hurdles previously preventing xenotransplantation from becoming a mainstay of biomedical practice is undoubtedly a result to be celebrated. However, it seems likely that the biomedical focus on donor-to-host immunological response has overshadowed other serious bioethical concerns. Bennett's new xenoheart was not the product of a clinical study. Instead, as stated, it resulted from a unique, singular approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration for an operation on an otherwise poor candidate for traditional transplantation with no alternatives. Other ethical treatments of the Bennett case similarly focus on the welfare of donor animals and the prevalence of zoonosis. In the latter case, the emphasis is still on \"xenogeneic diseases\" and how to account for informed consent given the \"Ulysses contract,\" or a contractual agreement that \"waives the right to withdraw from the clinical trial\" 35 . Discussion of whether Bennett ought to have been the target of this xenotransplantation team, given his markedly vulnerable status, is conspicuously absent. \n\nIt is not necessarily the number of studies conducted that will automatically confirm or deny the permissibility of xenotransplantation from a bioethical perspective. Instead, to be seen as a safe and effective solution to the shortage of human organs for organ transplantation, xenotransplantation science needs to grapple with a greater variety of ethical considerations.",

On the other hand, xenotransplantation research was also contested by political parties and NGOs including the Green Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Basel Appeal Against Genetic Engineering, Greenpeace Switzerland, Physicians against Animal Experimentation and the Swiss Animal Protection. The local public debate on xenotransplantation began in the mid-1990s. According to Griessler, 'the debate was neither extensive nor continuous and only of concern to a small group of informed actors from research, parliament, public administration and stakeholder organizations' (Griessler 2012: 64). A diverse range of views on xenotransplantation was canvassed in the federal parliamentary debates. Though a proposed bill banning the procedure was introduced into the Swiss parliament, it was defeated towards the end of 1999. In the following year, at the 'PubliForum'-a consensus conference on transplantation medicine-a majority of lay participants affirmed their support for xenotransplantation research (Griessler 2012: 66). Notwithstanding public objections to xenotransplantation among sections of the community, the introduction of permissive laws sought to protect local research and economic interests in the Swiss pharmaceutical industry. The conflict between global science and local concerns regarding public health and patient safety have taken place in other parts of the world. As foreshadowed, I will explore comparable developments in Canada and Australia in the following two sub-sections of this paper.",

Headway into the development of informed consent forms has been made, one example being the draft consent form created by USA's Secretary's Advisory Committee on Xenotransplantation [41,42]. Informed consent forms have also been proposed by the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) and adopted in various countries such as Germany and Taiwan [43]. Being thoroughly informed throughout the consenting process is a key ethical consideration -further endeavours should delve into clarifying the consenting process and ensuring that organ recipients are told exactly what is being done to their body and enable them to understand reasonably foreseen issues. This is especially true in the unique context of xenotransplantation which has an obvious risk-benefit divergence -is this procedure likely to prolong and ensure good quality of life [44]? It is currently unclear if the risks of developing novel zoonotic infections far outweigh the potential benefits [45], and from an animal rights and welfare perspective, the humanity of such novel technologies is still not well established [46]. The recipient is mandated to participate in lifelong follow-up to detect potential transmission of infections to humans, a form of Ulysses contract. Withdrawal from the follow-up based on personal autonomy must be balanced against risk of infection transmission [47]. In the interest of public health, lifelong surveillance of the individual is required to assess and control a possible spread of zoonotic and infectious diseases [48]. Such doctrines may be difficult to enforce due to potential compromise to patient autonomy. The double standards in human behavior were clearly visible during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, as many people expected others to follow quarantine rules while believing they deserved exemptions from those same rules [39]. As a result, enforcing these regulations created ethical challenges for healthcare providers, who had to spend extra time navigating legal discussions to find solutions.",

Having animal organs or tissue in a human body is likely to raise \"physiological and psychological issues.\" (Hagelin, 2004). More importantly, the ethics of rearing animals with the sole purpose of harvesting their organs for transplantation needs to be examined (Sykes et. al., 2003). This issue must be further ascertained from the Islamic perspective particularly when pigs are involved due to Islamic prohibition on the consumption of the animal.\n\nThe use of non-human organs further raises concerns on the interests of society at large. The transplantation of non-human organs into human beings exposes the recipient and society to the risks of virus transmission (Sykes et. al., 2003). This may occur when the organ harvested from the animal contains an infectious virus and is transmitted to the human recipient who may then spread the virus to others (Hagelin, 2004). It has been argued that:\n\n\"Everyone in society is placed at risk of a pandemic by allowing xenotransplantation to proceed. As a consequence, society\"s infrastructure might collapse; indeed, we have been living with this possibility since early 2009 with regard to the global swine flu pandemic.\" (Fovargue and Ost, 2010) The issues highlighted above represent the possible ramifications of xenotransplantation which must be carefully evaluated before the technique can be offered to public.",

These issues were previously discussed in detail (54,55). Briefly, in patients with chronic liver failure who retain capacity to make their own medical decisions the issue of patient consent is straightforward. For patients who arrive to the hospital unconscious in fulminant hepatic failure, the current standard is to place them on the waiting list for an emergent human liver allotransplant. The current ethical framework for treating life-threatening emergencies differs substantially from non-emergency situations, in that informed consent is not required in order to treat. In a scenario where the pig liver xenotransplantation is a reasonable alternative, the clinician would be required to choose between placing the patient on the waiting list or proceeding with liver xenotransplantation with an informed consent obtained from the family and/or hospital's ethical committee.",

            "text": "Rabbis are always concerned about the psychological state of the patient asking for a legal decision and how potential stigma issues may influence the psychological state of a patient. While, for example, pregnancy terminations are only allowed if the pregnant mother is in medical danger, psychological trauma of the pregnant woman can play a critical role in allowing fetal termination. Thus, in the case of xenotransplantation, most rabbis will adjudicate these situations on a case-by-case basis to ascertain whether a person should undergo the procedure. In many previous situations, the recommendations are that several physicians and rabbis are consulted before xenotransplantation is FDA-approved. \n\nIt is important to mention one other ethical challenge regarding xenotransplantations: its effect on human organ trafficking. 32 Trafficking people for organ removal is a form of trafficking in which individuals are exploited for their organs, by coercion, deception, or abuse of a position of vulnerability. The non-governmental organization (NGO) Global Financial Integrity (GFI) estimates that the annual value of organ trafficking ranges from $840 million to upwards of $1.7 billion globally, and that about 12,000 illegal transplants occur each year, around 8,000 of which are for kidneys. It is not difficult to predict that if xenotransplantation becomes an effective therapy to save human life, the number of illegal transplants would decrease dramatically. Rabbinical scholars would thus be further encouraged to permit xenotransplantation to decrease global organ trafficking. \n\nThere are other ethical issues that will require further rabbinical analysis and resolution. For example: \uf0b7 Autonomy-the right versus duty to engage in medical interventions that have not yet been approved by the FDA or are in clinical trials. \n\n\uf0b7 Defining and assessing human and animal pain and the degree of pain and patient suffering that results from transplants. \n\n\uf0b7 Determining how much pain and suffering a patient must bear when agreeing to medical inter-ventions or a clinical trial such as in the case of xenotransplantation. \n\n\uf0b7 Defining medical success (e.g. increased longevity and quality of life) following an organ transplant. \n\n\uf0b7 Allocation of resources to the served and unserved populations that require heart transplants.",

The WHO recommended that: \"The regulatory system should be transparent, must include scientific and ethical assessment and should involve the public.\" 40 Indeed, the public should be involved in assessing the regulatory system for xenotransplantation, and we believe it has an even wider role in accepting its development. To date, only limited viewpoint studies of the public's attitudes toward xenotransplantation have been published. 56,57 Viewpoints of adult patients who may benefit from xenotransplantation-such as those on dialysis awaiting a kidney transplant-have only been minimally studied. 56 The empirical data on viewpoints of pediatric heart patients who may need a cardiac xenotransplant and their parents or guardians of pediatric patients are especially sparse. 55,58 n 2 studies of pediatric cardiac surgeons, pediatric transplant cardiologists, pediatric cardiac nurses, and parents of children with CHD, acceptance of xenotransplantation was high as long as xenotransplantation had similar outcomes to allotransplantation. 58,59 Acceptance fell if results were anticipated to be inferior to those of allotransplantation. More viewpoint studies, especially of key stakeholders, will reveal important attitudes about xenotransplantation, concerns and reasons for hesitancy, and how these may be mitigated. or xenotransplantation education campaigns should be conducted to gauge and promote public acceptance. 4.

            "text": "This diversity in views on xenotransplantation reflects the broader Hindu approach to bioethical issues-emphasizing the ethical process rather than a singular outcome. Hinduism offers concepts and ideas that could be used in ethical reflection without imposing an outcome of ethical reasoning [36]. Bearing this in mind, the 20th century Hindu philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan described Hinduism as a \"view of life\" [37]. Mahatma Gandhi saw that view of life as a search for truth [38]. Within the context of Hindu views on xenotransplants, this dynamic and contextual approach to moral reasoning may lead to diverse outcomes but will always take into account the suffering and needs of both humans and animals. Given this diversity of views, it is essential for healthcare providers, especially in multicultural contexts, to approach the topic of xenotransplantation with cultural competence and humility.",

            "text": "Still, Reichart 5 opined that a more acceptable costimulation blockade was required for future human applications and safe donor animals that would not cause harmful infectious diseases in human recipients. \n\nFrom a technical perspective, pig heart donor grafts offer such advantages as similarity with the human heart, relatively swift breeding, cost-efficiency, and fewer ethical barriers. 6 he construction of a modified donor heart is complicated, with the principal goal being the creation of chimeric animals. More specifically, gene-editing technologies combined with cross-breeding are employed to produce personalized organ generation. The generated organ in tandem with immunosuppression and gene reprogramming constitutes the step preceding xenotransplantation. 7 In the technical field, the formidable barriers to overcome are as follows: a) hyperacute rejection and acute humoral xenograft rejection, happening from minutes to hours posttransplantation; b) initial cellular xenograft dysfunction, presenting from minutes to hours post-transplantation; and c) acute humoral rejection, attributed to coagulation dysregulation and elicited antibody immunity, presenting from days to weeks post-transplantation. 8,9 Nonetheless, even the supporters of cardiac xenotransplantation admit that this method is indicated in selected cases. Pierson et al 10 defined the criteria for cardiac xenotransplantation consisting of 4 principal categories: the risk of allograft failure due to immunologic factors, contraindications for the ventricular assist device, adult congenital heart diseases, and severe biventricular failure without established end-organ failure. \n\nIndubitably, the enthusiasm for new methods that could offer solutions in the treatment of end-stage cardiac failure is elevated. Nevertheless, the technical barriers notwithstanding, ethical parameters should be considered. First and foremost, the transmission of zoonotic viral diseases is a complication that cannot be neglected, especially after the disastrous experience of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. In other words, are we ready to take the risk of performing xenotransplantation even though the risk of a new pandemic may arise? Is it ethical to risk the creation of new zoonotic diseases in order to treat cardiac failure in some patients?",

To date, both the UMMC investigators and the FDA have been silent on this issue, which we believe to be a very important one in need of addressing due to the importance of observing post-xenotransplantation biosurveillance. \n\nMr. Lawrence Faucette, a 58-year-old male with terminal heart disease, received the second genetically modified pig heart transplantation in September 2023 at UMMC [19]. \n\nApplication of expanded access criteria to Mr. Faucette follows a similar course. Due to pre-existing peripheral vascular disease (criterion 1), Mr. Faucette was deemed ineligible for heart allotransplantation (criterion 2). Enrolling Mr. Faucette in a cardiac xenotransplantation clinical trial was not a possibility as none exist (criterion 3) and as investigational trials also do not exist, interference was not a concern (criterion 5). As with Mr. Bennett, the transplant team at UMMC considered criterion 4 to be met. Surprisingly, as of the time of this writing in mid-2024, detailed information pertaining to Mr. Faucette's death has not been publicly released. His post-transplantation course included reports that he developed renal failure requiring dialysis and ultimately evidence of xenograft organ rejection after 42 days [7]. Thus, given the paucity of information, a thorough analysis of the ethical components of decisionmaking in Mr. Faucette's case is not possible. At bare minimum, it seems prudent for the sake of transparency and the advance of xenotransplantation that the results of expanded access cases be shared publicly, which has yet to be done in this instance. It remains important that when more is known that we review the application of the expanded access criteria and whether it highlights any further criteria that will aid in patient selection.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation is 'the practice of transplanting, implanting or infusing cells, tissues or organs from one species to another' (Ravelingien et al. 2002, 92). It may involve internal or external xenogenic therapies 1 designed as a temporary bridging device or as a 'final solution to end-stage organ failure' (Boneva and Folks 2004, 504). For the purpose of addressing organ scarcity, scientists have generally experimented with organs and tissues from different breeds of pigs. However, towards the end of the 1990s, virologists began to query the safety of xenotransplantation due to the possibility of infectious diseases caused by porcine endogenous retroviruses. A number of scientists called for a moratorium until the controversy could be resolved through open debate and public policy.\n\nWhile some countries adopted a ban, others pursued a permissive stance on clinical xenotransplantation. A de facto moratorium was adopted in Canada following a novel experiment in public consultation. In Australia, the xenotransplantation controversy was sparked by a clinical trial involving the use of porcine cells to treat diabetes. Following a national inquiry, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) imposed a 5 year moratorium on clinical trials involving animal-to-human transplantation.\n\nSobbrio and Jorqui observed that public engagement on xenotransplantation in Canada and Australia represented significant developments in 'experimental democracy' (Sobbrio and Jorqui 2014, 523). They wrote, democratic social contract between institutions and citizens; they aimed at engaging citizens in more direct decision-making; they explored and inquired into relevant issues about technological innovation and social change; and they attempted to introduce a new concept of scientific citizenship through the identity of the citizen scientist (Sobbrio and Jorqui 2014: 528).\n\nA number of publications have analysed the Canadian and/or Australian xenotransplantation controversies. Such work generally adopt either a national or comparative perspective (Sobbrio and Jorqui 2014;McLean and Williamson 2005;Cook 2011Cook , 2014Beynon-Jones and Brown 2011;Einsiedel et al. 2011a;Tallachini 2011;Allspaw 2004;",

However, space needs to be made for a broader discourse on the future of xenotransplantation in order to secure an equitable and sustainable biomedical future for us all. While the process of interdisciplinarity may be slow and frustrating in the short term, the methodologies of history and bioethics are critical tools for understanding where the biomedical practices in question have come from and, importantly, how they might proceed. Focusing on genealogies of biomedical researchers and narrow bioethical algorithms is not sufficient for a future system of xenotransplantation that is just, equitable, and truly a panacea for existing issues. Notable bioethical and sociohistorical factors include preexisting systemic issues with legal organ procurement, anticipated disruptions to ongoing illegal markets that trade in human organs, continuing robust clinical study programs, protecting vulnerable patients, considering the long and complex history of transplantation, and the importance of engaging the public's interest and imagination in xenotransplant science.",

Regulation should have a legal basis with powers to ban unregulated procedures and enforce compliance with regulatory requirements. The regulatory system should be transparent, must include scientific and ethical assessment and should involve the public.\" 2 This also applies to the field of hospital chaplaincy. While there are empirical studies on the assessment and acceptance of xenotransplantation, 3,4 there is no empirical exploration of the assessment of pastoral workers in German-speaking countries. In the face of prospective clinical trials, in-depth research is both sensible and necessary.\n\nSince both xeno-and allotransplantation can have far-reaching consequences for patients, their relatives, and the social environment, in addition to the tasks of health monitoring, questions of personal contact and integration must also be considered. They can affect one's own identity and self-image and thus also affect religious dimensions. Hence, they make a comprehensive range of accompaniment necessary. 5",

[3] Such cells, tissues or organs are called xenografts or xenotransplants. It is contrasted with allotransplantation (from other individual of same species), syngeneic transplantation or isotransplantation (grafts transplanted between two genetically identical individuals of the same species) and auto transplantation (from one part of the body to another in the same person). \n\nXenotransplantation of human tumor cells into immune compromised mice is a research technique frequently used in pre-clinical oncology research. Human xenotransplantation offers a potential treatment for end-stage organ failure, a significant health problem in parts of the industrialized world. It also raises many novel medical, legal and ethical issues. [4] A continuing concern is that many animals, such as pigs, have a shorter lifespan than humans, meaning that their tissues age at a quicker rate. Disease transmission (xenozoonosis) and permanent alteration to the genetic code of animals are also causes for concern. Similarly to objections to animal testing, animal rights activists have also objected to xenotransplantation on ethical grounds. [5] A few temporarily successful cases of xenotransplantation are published. [6] It is common for patients and physicians to use the term \"allograft\" imprecisely to refer to either allograft (human-tohuman) or xenograft (animal-to-human), but it is helpful scientifically (for those searching or reading the scientific literature) to maintain the more precise distinction in usage.",

            "text": "With themes of public reaction and the promise of synergizing historical and bioethical lines of discourse, we now turn to an underdiscussed aspect of current xenotransplantation practice: the vulnerability of xenotransplant recipients. The case of Mr. David Bennett Sr. received worldwide acclaim when a \"xenoheart\" 28 , or a human heart sourced from a genetically modified pig, was transplanted into a profoundly ill patient. Mr. Bennett experienced \"8 weeks of post-operative success\" with his new xenoheart that, according to a care provider involved in the case, \"continued to function until his death\" 28 . \n\nMr. Bennett's case is complex, touching on a wide range of potential ethical issues. While Mr. Bennett's life was extended by 2 months through the use of a xenoheart (also referred to as a \"porcine\" or \"pig\" heart in the popular press), several notable characteristics of Bennett as a patient highlight how medically risky it is to replace traditional forms of solid organ transplantation and life-sustaining treatment. For example, during the time that Bennett was kept alive through the use of a xenoheart, he was described as bedridden and on life support. Some of the promotional material coming out of the University of Maryland School of Medicine's animal-tohuman transplant program, where Bennett was receiving care, certainly suggested a less-than-pleasant quality of life 29 . Additionally, Bennett, 57 at the time of the operation and suffering from life-threatening arrhythmia, was categorized as historically \"medically noncompliant.\" In simpler terms, Bennett was not eligible for placement on the national organ waiting list due to a history of \"failing to follow doctors' orders\" 30 . The doctor that performed the transplant described Bennett as \"someone with no alternatives\" and \"who very likely wouldn't be able to leave the hospital without a transplant\"-an ideal candidate to receive a \"genetically modified pig heart transplant\" 31 . \n\nIn these initial, groundbreaking cases, recipients of xenohearts, porcine, or other non-human organ transplants are likely to be similarly situated: incredibly vulnerable patients deserving of increased bioethical scrutiny.",

Those resources become even more challenging to manage 4 as selecting donors and transplant candidates requires navigating a dangerous, widespread virus. Additionally, consideration for transplant status includes many factors evaluated on both biological and social measures. Transplant programs often rely on judgments about social support for candidacy status 5 and prompt critical ethical questions over whether receiving a life-saving organ should depend on relationships one may (or may not) have in postoperative care. Transplant programs also need to consider that brain death in human donors has significant effects on the soon-to-be-transplanted organs. This illustrates that a system experiencing scarcity also requires intense and efficient management to facilitate timely transplantation procedures. Finally, solid organ transplantation is marred, both presently and historically, by the so-called \"black market\" 6 body brokers exploiting organ scarcity around the globe for immense profit. \n\nThus, the growing interest in xenotransplantation comes as no surprise as biomedical and transplant communities scramble for solutions. Relying solely on human donors to supply human organs creates a system where there are too few organs to meet the demand of a growing population of would-be recipients alongside a host of other transplantrelated disparities. According to the data released by the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) and the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) 7 , despite the increasing number of successful liver transplants from year to year, the need for liver transplants continues to outstrip the organ supply. Using large animals, such as those in the porcine family, as biological incubators for human organs ostensibly offers immediate solutions to many issues with current organ transplantation practices. Indeed, these interspecies chimeras are often touted as a panacea for the ills and inefficiencies in our current system 8 . \n\nThis brief commentary aims to explore the myriad of factors that have coalesced to bring xenotransplantation to the forefront of medical research. We also aim to apply lessons learned through historical analysis to reveal bioethical concerns that are critically underdiscussed.",

            "text": "In 2004, the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Secretary's Advisory Committee on Xenotransplantation (SACX) issued draft guidelines on informed consent in clinical studies of xenotransplantation, stating that \"as a general matter, children should not participate in xenotransplantation protocols.\" [22] To defend this position, SACX argued (i) that xenotransplantation is in early experimental stages and (ii) that lifelong medical monitoring will be required of all research participants [22]. SACX provided one exception to this recommendation: if \"the potential benefit to a child from a xenotransplantation procedure is high given the available alternatives,\" then proceeding may be allowable, but this must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Since 2004, notable scientific progress has been achieved in xenotransplantation, particularly concerning the pediatric population [23]. One study demonstrated evidence of little to no preformed anti-pig antibodies from exposure to genetically engineered pig organs among infants [24]. Other studies have hinted at the immunological advantages of children over adults as xenograft recipients such as higher chances of tolerance and lower innate cell activity [8,25,26]. In fact, it has been proposed that children may benefit more from cardiac xenotransplantation over adults due to several biological factors and their lack of clinical alternatives. However, there is currently a lack of updated guidelines from the DHHS or other bodies regarding informed consent for pediatric cardiac xenotransplantation and what a reasonable benefit and risk assessment might be for each case. \n\nDue to the unknown benefit and risk assessment of the initial first-in-human xenotransplants and that limited alternative therapeutic options may exist for a patient, it is paramount that surrogate decision-makers (e.g., parents) be knowledgeable and have a realistic appraisal of the procedure. While DHHS does not have updated guidelines on informed consent-an element we recommend needs revisiting-other researchers have provided recommendations. Padilla and colleagues have recommended a \"cooling off period\" be implemented for authorization of xenotransplantation [27].",

It becomes practical due to the organ gap between need and supply from the donors (Chrenek et al., 2010;Murray et al., 2010). The technology tries to produce humanized organs from pigs by controlling organ rejection due to physiological incompatibility in humans and pigs and transfer of generelated diseases (Bagle et al., 2012;Einsiedel, 2005). Moreover, clinical and safety problems, welfare and ethical issues are among the challenges. Improving provision of National Health Services and encouraging donation and regeneration of tissues from stem cells may be alternatives to solve the problems of transgenic organs in the future (Einsiedel, 2005).",

This event would prove seminal for xenotransplantation as it attracted increased interest in the ethical issues and ignited new debate. 11 Pediatric cardiac xenotransplantation has not been attempted again, and the particular ethical considerations related to xenotransplantation in this age group have received little attention in the literature in the 40 y since this case. \n\nMeanwhile, the science that supports pediatric cardiac xenotransplantation has made significant recent progress. Blood from infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) with or without a history of prior cardiac surgery contain no anti-pig antibodies toward cells of the gene-edited pig source for the hearts. 12 Additionally, several experiments have been carried out in a preclinical model for pig-to-baboon pediatric heart xenotransplantation. Meanwhile, in \"adult\" preclinical models, consistent survival of heterotopic pig heart grafts (in the abdomen and nonlife-supporting) in baboons has been reported, in 1 instance for >2 y. 13 Orthotopic pig hearts have provided life-supporting function in immunologically mature baboons for up to 8 mo. 14 n July 2023, eGenesis, a biotechnology company producing genetically engineered pigs for xenotransplantation, announced plans to initiate pediatric cardiac xenotransplantation clinical trials as soon as 2024. 15 Children have a critical need for increased access to healthy, durable transplantable organs. In 2021, >700 pediatric candidates were added to the heart transplant waitlist, bringing the total to >1000. 16 Neonates and infants experience the highest waitlist mortality when compared with any other solid organ group, and there exist limited options for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) for these children. 17 Half of infants who are on MCS awaiting a cardiac allograft die within 6 mo. 18 Allotransplantation has to date proven incapable of serving all children who need it.",

            "text": "In this lecture xenotransplantation is considered from the point of view of animal ethics. The main point is to show that a specific cluster of arguments commonly used in favour of xenotransplantation, simplifies the ethical questions involved. This simplification may be favourable for political reasons in a short time perspective, but may at the same time be disastrous from an ethical point of view in the long run. If the ethical questions regarding xenotransplantation are reduced to a simple yes or no, this will overshadow more important questions of how xenotransplantation may be implemented in an ethically responsible way. Resisting this simplification, we have to explore instead the necessary conditions under which xenotransplantation may be carried through or rejected. Ethics is often expected to deliver simple answers to complex questions. The bottom line of an ethical argument is expected to say yes or no. This way of understanding ethical contributions to the public and scientific discourse about xenotransplantation, or any scientific and public discourse, is however not in accordance with the ethical point of view. People who expect simple and clear-cut answers to moral questions do not or at least not always \u2013 expect these unambiguous answers because they want ethics to be of importance to the questions involved. Very often they expect unambiguous answers for the opposite reason. They want clear-cut answers just to get rid of ethical considerations. When ethics is reduced to a simple yes or no, then it is of no use and not worth taking into consideration. So ethics is from this point of view trapped in a \"catch 22\". If it can't deliver simple answers, it is of no use, and if it delivers simple answers, it certainly is of no use. Contrary to the demand for simplicity I therefore want to say, using the words of the poet Soren Kierkegaard, \"that in this day and age when everybody is striving to make everything more easy, my task is to make everything more difficult\", or at least as difficult as possible within twenty minutes. I am not doing this because I love difficulties, but because I think we have to consider more deeply what xenotransplantation is all about. Putting something into action, there is a world of",

            "text": "Here, efforts to protect, enhance and improve individual lives are seen to occur at the potential expense and endangerment of a wider universe of nonbeneficiaries. It is, as myself and colleagues have put it, ' through this unique combination of private benefit vs. public risk' that xenotransplantation can be seen to 'exemplify deeper political tensions between neoliberalism (individualised free choice, health care consumption, etc.) on the one hand and risk-averse public health-oriented governance on the other' (Brown et al. 2010, 6). There is therefore something particular to our times and politics in the profound contradiction centred on the ascendant immunitary protections of the individual, of self-determination and autonomy. \n\nThe threat to biosecurity arising from the xenotransplantation imaginary is also spatially expressed in anxieties about the capacities of nation state regulators to geographically 'contain' risk across globally fluid territory. Indeed, national regulatory borders have been seen to offer insufficient protections in the prevention of simultaneously transnational and transpecies infections. Early in the xenozoonotic debate, concerns had been expressed that global variation in biosecurity measures would naturally lead to pockets or 'havens for the performance of less regulated, and therefore more dangerous, xenotransplantation procedures' (Collingnon 1998, 519). That prospect has since been borne out. In the early 2000s, news began to emerge of xeno-trails undertaken in Mexico City. Rafael Valdes Gonzalez had, together with collaborators in New Zealand and Canada, implanted porcine pancreatic islet xenografts into children with Type 1 diabetes. \n\nThe disclosure of the Mexico City trial became the focus of intense international criticism and subsequent sanction by Mexican medical authorities (Cook et al. 2011). This and similar events have been taken as expressions of contrasting biopolitical conditions distributed between 'core' and 'peripheral' regulatory spaces.",

            "text": "he appropriate care of the swine that will be a donor in the xenotransplantation is another important bioethical issue. The swine has less social rejection for use as a donor due to the fact that this species is normally bred and slaughtered for food practically all over the world. However, according to Dr. Entwistle from Thomas Jefferson University (Philadelphia, USA), confinement, social isolation (to avoid infections), and repeated procedures such as blood collections, which are part of the protocol for producing these animals, violate guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and deserves, at the very least, discussion and open public debate. 18 he bioethical enigmas from xenotransplantation arouse philosophical questions that will be discussed below. \n\nSince Hippocrates, the human being has assumed responsibilities with another human being to deal with health/disease issues. Currently, fiction is realized as robots, cyborgs, and chimeras. Technology (a technique provided by science) is precisely allowing the expansion of the integration of Homo sapiens to Nature. There have been centuries of this integration into the plant world, pharmaceuticals, for example. Integration with the animal is essentially food, but also transport (horses), safety (guard dog, visually impaired dog), and Health (leeches are still used in reconstructive surgeries to prevent thrombosis). \n\nSince the use of porcine tissue bioprostheses, which was abandoned especially for infectious aspects, transhumanism is related to the treatment of several diseases. The cyborg is there, those who have a coronary stent, implantable defibrillator, or other therapeutic equipment are people analogous to cyborgs. In fact, the defibrillator is independent of the person and acts by itself. The potential of xenotransplantation is an evolutionary variation of transplantation between humans because it not only expands the potential of donor availability, but also does not depend on the donor's will, but on various laws, including those related to the protection of animals. \n\nThe pig, unlike the non-human great primates, seems to be the element of nature that best fits the human being to serve as a donor.",

            "text": "The improved life expectancy of humans over the past decades has increased the prevalence of a growing number of chronic diseases 1 . The increasing application of organ transplantation, the last resort and definitive treatment for endstage organ failure, has resulted in a disparity in the supply and demand for such organs 1 . Therefore, xenotransplantation has become an appealing solution to overcome this obstacle 2 . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines xenotransplantation as \"any procedure that involves the transplantation, implantation or infusion into a human recipient of either (a) live cells, tissues, or organs from a nonhuman animal source, or (b) human body fluids, cells, tissues or organs that have had ex vivo contact with live nonhuman animal cells, tissues, or organs\" 3 . Currently, xenotransplant use has been reported mainly for the kidneys, hearts, livers, skin, and corneas 4 . \n\nPigs are the species of choice to harvest organs for xenotransplantation, as they have anatomically similar organs to humans and are suitable for genetic modification 5 . They are highly bred and often consumed, clearing the way for the ethical decision to use pig organs to treat human diseases. Although the genetic discrepancies between humans and pigs are greater than those of primates, the use of primate organs is not sustainable for ethical reasons and because most primates are considered endangered 5 . Furthermore, primate organs have a substantial chance of carrying viruses that can infect humans 5 . Hence, genetic engineering techniques have been developed to decrease porcine and human genetic dissimilarities 1 , paving the road for the usage of pig organs for xenotransplants. Indeed, recent studies described two successful cases of kidney transplants from pigs in brain-dead patients 6 , and another reported a successful case of a heart transplant from a pig to a human 7 . These breakthroughs marked a great milestone for the field of xenotransplantation. \n\nThe main obstacle facing xenotransplants is immunological reactions. Although the mechanism behind hyperacute rejection (HAR) in the xenograft is well defined, the mechanisms of acute cellular rejection are not fully understood 2 .",

National governmental organizations including the FDA, OECD [36], and the Infection Surveillance Steering Group of the UK Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority (UKXIRA) established a series of recommendations, highlighting the importance of establishing criteria for source pig characterization and \"designated pathogen free\" status, and explicit guidelines for xenotransplantation clinical trial conduct, including recipient monitoring criteria and recommendations regarding regulatory oversight [39,40]. \n\nThe IXA and TTS, under the auspices of the WHO, built on the framework of the \"WHO Guidance on Xenogeneic Infection/Disease Surveillance and Response\" document [33] by holding the first WHO consultation on transplantation ethics, access, and safety in Madrid in October 2003, with experts from 23 countries. This led to the World Health Assembly Resolution WHA57.18 in 2004, which encouraged member states to permit xenotransplantation trials only when effective national regulatory controls were in place, and called for establishing global data collection on xenotransplantation practices [41]. \n\nFollowing publication of WHA57.18, international bodies including the FDA, UKXIRA, SACX, European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the Australian Xenotransplantation Working Party reviewed and acted upon the WHO advisory recommendations, resulting in new laws and/or regulations in each of these jurisdictions. In 2003, IXA's Ethics Committee published its inaugural \"position paper\" that emphasized the importance of peer-reviewed preclinical data as the necessary basis for the design and conduct of a clinical trial, including the informed consent process, and the ethical necessity for effective oversight of clinical xenotransplantation research by competent authorities as a precondition for regulatory approval [42]. In this landmark document, five potential advantages of xenotransplantation were articulated to justify the risks and costs associated with xenotransplantation activities: \n\n1. In countries where human organ donation has not been accepted for ethical or cultural reasons, xenotransplantation might provide an acceptable alternative.",

Early clinical trials of xenotransplantation will be a form of therapeutic research. Therapeutic research must offer some prospect of genuine benefit for the patient, but it involves greater uncertainties than treatment, and therefore greater caution must be exercised. Many working parties concerning xenotransplantation, such as the British Pediatric Association and the Medical Research Council, have advised that therapeutic research should not involve children if it could equally well be performed with adults. It would be difficult to justify the involvement of children in major and risky xenotransplantation trials before some of the uncertainties have been eliminated in trials involving adults. Therefore, the FDA and WHO also recommend that the first xenotransplantation trials involve adults rather than children.\n\nThen, although the authors tried to continue animal experiment to start clinical pediatric xenoHTx in the mid-2000s, we resigned.",

As we have discussed, meeting these criteria merely reveals who may be a good candidate for xenotransplantation and justifies its use, but this equation contains additional important considerations, especially in children. That is, the FDA criteria do not capture the breadth of ethical questions that must be satisfied before moving forward with xenotransplantation. As researchers plan investigational studies, numerous other recommendations exist that should be considered. In particular, how best to obtain informed consent of the surrogate decisionmaker(s) and additional conversation around biosurveillance and protection of certain bystanders should be thoughtfully considered.",

The risk of infectious diseases makes xenotransplantation a relevant issue also to people beyond the xenograft recipient. This peculiarity of xenotransplantation is reflected in the ethical literature, also regarding its relevance for informed consent to xenotransplantation therapies [1][2][3][4]. As any member of society is potentially at risk of acquiring a xenogeneic infection, the informed consent of the patient who shall receive the xenograft is not enough: xenotransplantation becomes a societal matter [1]. Hence, a \"collective informed consent\" [2] or a \"community consent\" [5] have been suggested. As the community at risk is the global community, xenotransplantation also becomes a matter of global justice [3,6]. \n\nHowever, for potential xenotransplantation candidates, more practical aspects are of primary interest [7]. They are concerned with questions regarding how a xenograft will affect their well-being, identity and self-perception, as well as how others will perceive them, including fear of stigmatisation. In addition, the effects on partners and family have to be considered. Besides these psychosocial aspects, patients have a high interest in maintaining a good quality of life and reduce the diabetes-associated burden. \n\nAmong the various types of xenotransplantation, the transplantation of islet cells is the only form of cell or tissue transplantation that has seen clinical implementations [8,9]. As it is likely that Germany will see its first islet xenotransplantation within the near future, we have chosen to interview potential candidates, i.e. patients with T1DM, to assess their attitudes to this potential therapy.",

            "text": "organ-replacement therapies. Second, xenotransplantation bears the small, but not completely excludable risk of the transmission of viruses from animals to the recipient. The risk of infectious diseases makes xenotransplantation a relevant issue also to people beyond the xenograft recipient. This peculiarity of xenotransplantation is reflected in the ethical literature, also regarding its relevance for informed consent to xenotransplantation therapies [1][2][3][4]. As any member of society is potentially at risk of acquiring a xenogeneic infection, the informed consent of the patient who shall receive the xenograft is not enough: xenotransplantation becomes a societal matter [1]. Hence, a \"collective informed consent\" [2] or a \"community consent\" [5] have been suggested. As the community at risk is the global community, xenotransplantation also becomes a matter of global justice [3,6]. \n\nHowever, for potential xenotransplantation candidates, more practical aspects are of primary interest [7]. They are concerned with questions regarding how a xenograft will affect their well-being, identity and self-perception, as well as how others will perceive them, including fear of stigmatisation. In addition, the effects on partners and family have to be considered. Besides these psychosocial aspects, patients have a high interest in maintaining a good quality of life and reduce the diabetes-associated burden. \n\nAmong the various types of xenotransplantation, the transplantation of islet cells is the only form of cell or tissue transplantation that has seen clinical implementations [8,9]. As it is likely that Germany will see its first islet xenotransplantation within the near future, we have chosen to interview potential candidates, i.e. patients with T1DM, to assess their attitudes to this potential therapy.",

            "text": "Abstract A major limiting factor with heart allotransplantation remains the availability of organs from deceased donors. Porcine heart xenotransplantation could serve as an alternative source of organs for patients with terminal heart failure. A first\u2010in\u2010human porcine xenotransplantation that occurred in January 2022 at the University of Maryland Medical Center provided an opportunity to examine several ethical issues to guide selection criteria for future xenotransplantation clinical trials. In this article, the authors, who are clinicians at UMMC, discuss the appropriate balancing of risks and benefits and the significance, if any, of clinical equipoise. The authors also review the alleged role of the psychosocial evaluation in identifying patients at an elevated risk of posttransplant noncompliance, and they consider how the evaluation's implementation might enhance inequities among diverse populations. The authors argue that, based on the principle of reciprocity, psychosocial criteria should be used, not to exclude patients, but instead to identify patients who need additional support. Finally, the authors discuss the requirements for and the proper assessment of informed and voluntary consent from patients being considered for xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "Overall, attitudes toward xenotransplantation have been assessed empirically in certain populations [16][17][18]. Given that around 85% of the world's population identifies with a religious tradition [19], and that religion and/or spirituality oftentimes play a role in a patient's medical decision-making [20], assessing religious viewpoints toward xenotransplantation is important. Religious viewpoints of persons toward xenotransplantation have only been assessed to a limited degree by empirical means [21]. Viewpoints of Protestant Christianity [22], Catholicism [23,24], Hinduism [25], Judaism [26], Shia Islam [27], and Sunni Islam [28] have been described by academics and clergypersons. Theological symposiums have been held with various religious traditions to discuss viewpoints toward xenotransplantation [29,30]. In 2017, at the 14th Congress of the International Xenotransplantation Association, a theological symposium was hosted that described Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theological perspectives toward xenotransplantation [31]. \n\nIn the past several years, as enumerated above, the field of xenotransplantation has experienced several advances. Ethical issues continue to be at the forefront of the field, and religious viewpoints may shift or become more well-defined with the progression of xenotransplantation. Hence, assessing religious perspectives toward xenotransplantation will not be a one-time occurrence, but will likely require periodic review. \n\nHerein, we report on religious perspectives regarding the ethical issues associated with clinical xenotransplantation that were presented at a session of the 30th International Congress of The Transplantation Society in Istanbul, T\u00fcrkiye (September 2024). Definitive \"official\" statements on the permissibility or impermissibility of xenotransplantation are lacking from most religious communities; the Catholic Church's Pontifical Academy for Life is the exception [23]. As many religions lack an official governing body empowered to issue decisive rulings regarding medical decision-making or are cautious about doing so, this is likely to continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.",

            "text": "In addition, cultural factors play a significant role in the acceptance of xenotransplantation in countries where post-mortem allotransplantation is not possible from a social point of view. For example, in Japan and India organ transplants from animals are a feasible alternative, but the opponents of these procedures cite various arguments against them, including philosophical, legal and medical factors. Of significance are also the above-mentioned arguments concerning the pursuit of anthropocentrism at all costs, and the utilitarian nature of such activity when animals become a \"reservoir of spare parts\" for people. Other issues involve potential problems with the recipient's identity and concerns relating to the \"tyranny of the gift\"6 . \n\nIn general, transplantation is usually perceived as a gift (Chyrowicz 2011), as an informed and fully voluntary decision. But can we really speak of informed decisions in the case of animals? Could the moral dilemma that is harvesting animal organs be solved by measures taken to increase the number of allotransplantations? These measures should target the largest possible groups of recipients to reliably present to them the dangers of organ donation, in addition to making them aware that transplantation is a lifesaving procedure which has no other substitute (Baum 2017). Using animal organs would not be necessary if there was a significant increase in donations from relatives and other unrelated living donors7 . \n\nLegal issues are also a cause of concern as the recipient loses at least some of their rights to anonymity and privacy, whilst being obliged to inform the people around them (including the medical community) of having a xenograft in their body (Smor\u0105g 2006). This may cause the organ recipient to feel discomfort and a sense of discrimination. Another legal aspect is the possible existence of \"xenotourism\", in other words, organised and commercial journeys to countries where xenotransplantation is possible8 . Nowadays, another example of controversial ethical research is creating animal embryos that contain human cells and transplant them into surrogate animals. The study was approved in 2019 in Japan (Cyranowski 2019).",

More deliberation is needed on these points as well as how best to counsel surrogate decision-makers who must consent on behalf of the recipient. As parents/guardians may be in a desperate state to try any potential means to save their child's life, great attention will need to be given to ensuring that they understand the research nature of xenotransplantation to avoid therapeutic misconception, the risks (including unknown risks) involved, and the potential need to carry out retransplantation of the heart at a later time, should the xenograft be utilized only as a bridge or should it fail. \n\nParents/guardians will need to be informed of the potential effects that participating in initial trials may have on the privacy of their lives and their child's, including potential implications for health insurance. Industry and researcher influence and interests must be divested completely from the consent process. As parents/guardians may be overly trusting of the recommendations of the treating physician(s), it may be wise to have consent obtained by another qualified individual who is not participating directly in their child's care. \n\nLast, we should not assume that the OHRP, FDA, and IRBs are familiar with applications for research under 45 Code of Federal Regulations 46.407, as they are rare. Agencies should be certain that reviewers are educated and prepared for this type of research application within these agencies. DHHS should also consider convening a multidisciplinary panel of experts who can judge the science and ethics of pediatric cardiac xenotransplantation clinical trials as applications arise. As mentioned above, one company has already announced that it hopes to initiate a pediatric cardiac xenotransplantation clinical trial in 2024. Establishing a plan for who might comprise such an expert panel, and how protocols and research documents will be reviewed to protect pediatric (and adult) human subjects, would be prudent.",

The field of xenotransplantation was initiated with chimpanzees for human kidney transplantation by Reemtsma et al in the early 1960s. As a result of the transplant, there was one patient who survived for 9 months after a chimpanzee kidney transplant. However, it is clearly recognized that chimpanzees are an endangered species, unable to meet the growing need for organ transplants [17]. \n\nXenotransplantation deals with the transfer of cells or tissues and organs from a single biological species. The research that is currently being carried out is examining the removal of xenografts of whole organs, for example the heart, tissue and cell transplantation, for example, insulin-producing pancreatic cells from pigs to humans. It is estimated that within the next 9 years, there is a very real possibility of xenotransplantation entering contemporary medical practice [18].Because xenotransplantation can increase the availability of organs for donation and the support of society and professionals is very important, further research is carried out to investigate how this \"therapy\" can be accepted by the wider community. One of them is a religious leader, because religion in this case plays a very important role in the issue of ethical issues related to organ donation and transplantation [18].",

To fail to include such discourse in the xenotransplant space is concerning. If we take the historical precedent for organ transplantation and xenotransplantation seriously, we see that there is no inherent disgust or revulsion of such practices and instead attitudes that are constructed and deconstructed over time. The actions and considerations of biomedical researchers are an essential factor in the messiness of historically contingent systems. It would likely befit us all to see experts in the field rise above disciplinary blinders and address bioethical issues outside their immediate wheelhouse.",

Yet this strategy poses risks of zoonotic infection for potential recipients and a credible threat to public health via transmission of such viruses, and it requires the creation of an entirely new type of farming where untold numbers of pigs would be sacrificed for years of testing, breeding, and harvesting under demanding conditions of pathogen-free confinement. As public opinion shifts away from the mass production of animal-based foods due to its accompanying costs to the environment, to workers, and to the health of consumers, the costs and risks of establishing another form of large-scale animal commodification deserve thorough consideration, especially in light of powerful alternatives that reduce demand for organs and increase organ supply. Medical stakeholders have failed to adequately consider or address these limitations, as evidenced by continued investment in the approach, operating under the assumption that xenotransplantation will proceed and contributing inertia toward its commercialization. An informed decision must not be limited to these and other vested parties but rather necessitates a broader societal and environmental examination. \n\nThis collective re-evaluation is framed not merely as questioning how to proceed but rather as a more comprehensive consideration of whether xenotransplantation can or ought to proceed. In 2020, Cengiz and Wareham concluded: \"The range of feasible alternatives to xenotransplantation to increase organ supply should be examined before resorting to xenotransplantation because of the moral distinction between imposing certain risks on others before, or after, alternative solutions have been exhausted.\" [34] A multitude of feasible, cost-effective strategies presented herein are available to accomplish this directive. \n\nPrevention of diseases that drive demand for organ transplants is essential to help address the organ shortage but will never be a complete solution and should be paired with aggressive changes to make allotransplantation more efficient and robust. We do not recommend shying away from biotechnological solutions altogether. Rather, we advocate for safer, more sensible, and more ethical approaches that can be rapidly commercialized and integrated into standard healthcare practice.",

Specifically, the transplantation of kidneys from genetically engineered pigs into human patients has made significant progress, offering a potential clinical solution to the shortage of human kidney supply. Recent trials involving the transplantation of these modified porcine kidneys into deceased human bodies have underscored the practicality of this approach, advancing the field towards potential clinical applications. However, numerous challenges remain, especially in the domains of identifying suitable donor-recipient matches and formulating effective immunosuppressive protocols crucial for transplant success. Critical to advancing xenotransplantation into clinical settings are the nuanced considerations of anesthesia and surgical practices required for these complex procedures. The precise genetic modification of porcine kidneys marks a significant leap in addressing the biological and immunological hurdles that have traditionally challenged xenotransplantation. Yet, the success of these transplants hinges on the process of meticulously matching these organs with human recipients, which demands thorough understanding of immunological compatibility, the risk of organ rejection, and the prevention of zoonotic disease transmission. In parallel, the development and optimization of immunosuppressive protocols are imperative to mitigate rejection risks while minimizing side effects, necessitating innovative approaches in both pharmacology and clinical practices. Furthermore, the post-operative care of recipients, encompassing vigilant monitoring for signs of organ rejection, infectious disease surveillance, and psychological support, is crucial for ensuring post-transplant life quality. This comprehensive care highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving transplant surgeons, anesthesiologists, immunologists, infectiologists and psychiatrists. The integration of anesthesia and surgical expertise is particularly vital, ensuring the best possible outcomes of those patients undergoing these novel transplants, through safe procedural practices. As xenotransplantation moving closer to clinical reality, establishing consensus guidelines on various aspects, including donor-recipient selection, immunosuppression, as well as surgical and anesthetic management of these transplants, is essential. Addressing these challenges through rigorous research and collective collaboration will be the key, not only to",

Attempts to meet this need include the use of organs from living related and unrelated donors, financial or other incentives for the donor family, and even the reuse of transplanted organs. Despite these initiatives, the supply of organs for transplantation still falls far short of the demand, as evidenced by longer waiting times for transplantation and decreasing transplantation rates. Even if Canada were able to increase its organ donor rate to that of Spain (40 to 50/million), where organ donation is governed by 'presumed consent' legislation, this would not alleviate the problem of donor shortage. Interest in xenotransplantation stems from the need to overcome this increasingly severe shortage of human organs. Indeed, some argue that xenotransplantation is the only potential way of addressing this shortage. As immunological barriers to xenotransplantation are better understood, those hurdles are being addressed through genetic engineering of donor animals and the development of new drug therapies. However, before xenotransplantation can be fully implemented, both the scientific/medical communities and the general public must seriously consider and attempt to resolve the many complex ethical, social and economic issues that it presents.",

            "text": "Diabetes causes several complications in patients, which burden health care systems. Allogeneic islet transplantation could improve physiological glucose metabolism [1]. However, the number of available human donor organs has not kept pace with the growing transplant candidate waiting lists, and a significant number of these patients die without receiving transplants [2]. This allotransplantation issue has stimulated research on the induction of insulin-producing cells and bioengineering. An alternate approach is the use of living cells, tissues, or organs from another species as donors. The concept of cross-species transplantation is known as xenotransplantation, and the transplanted cells, tissues, or organs are called xenografts. Xenotransplantation is an attractive option to overcome the issue of donor shortage [3,4]. \n\nPigs have been selected as the most suitable potential source of organs for xenotransplantation, because there are many similarities between humans and pigs, including similarities related to physiology and anatomy [5,6]. Additionally, porcine and human insulin differ by only one amino acid, and porcine insulin has been used for several decades in clinics. Pigs are widely available in many countries, are easily bred, and are known to have large litters. Additionally, ethical issues associated with the slaughter of nonhuman primates do not exist. Moreover, ethical and regulatory frameworks for islet xenotransplantation are present in several countries, and now, there is a greater awareness of the importance of developing an internationally harmonized ethical and regulatory framework [7]. Thus, pig-to-human xenotransplantation offers a potential bridge to the growing disparity between graft requirement among patients with diabetes and graft availability [3,4]. Indeed, islet transplantation from porcine pancreas was performed for the first time in the 1990s [8]. The International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) launched a consensus statement in 2009 on conditions for safely undertaking clinical trials of porcine islet products in patients with type 1 diabetes [9]. This statement covers the key aspects of ethical requirements. Recently, clinical porcine islet xenotransplantation was restarted under comprehensive regulations in New Zealand [10].",

As part of all Xenotransplantation trial participation it has been advised by the WHO and IXA \"Changsha Communique\" that all xenograft recipients' commit to lifelong xenozoonotic monitoring, including agreement to quarantine as a measure to prevent any serious potential spread of infection if detected or suspected (4,31). As part of the enlistment and education process of patients, patients should be advised of these requirements at the time of prospective trial participation and informed consent process. If the participants choose to they should have the right to withdraw from a xenotransplant trial prior to transplantation. However, once they have been informed, consented and commenced in the trial having undergone xenotransplantation, recipients would be subject to the regulations governing infection containment at a National and International level. Most countries have in place legislation that enforces such quarantinable regulations in relation to communicable diseases (8,32,33). \n\nAs additional safeguards we also have significant arrays of new antiviral agents capable of eliminating or treating such disease potential (34). Yet, it is essential to ensure that the risk of transmission is minimized and that robust safety measures are in place to protect recipients. This however, does require further address by responsible organizations (WHO, TTS, IXA) and legislators in the many and various international jurisdictions (2-4).",

Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. \n\nshould not participate in xenotransplantation protocols,\" citing (1) that xenotransplantation is in very early experimental stages and (2) that lifelong medical monitoring will be required of all xenotransplantation research participants. 45 SACX does provide an exception to this recommendation: if \"the potential benefit to a child from a xenotransplantation procedure is high given the available alternatives\" then proceeding may be allowable, but this must be determined on a case-by-case basis. SACX concluded that additional study of these points was needed. Since 2004, xenotransplantation has made significant scientific advancements specific to the pediatric population, yet no updated guidelines for pediatric consent exist. \n\nThe safety and efficacy of the initial pediatric cardiac xenotransplantation trials will be speculative until such trials are completed and analyzed. However, the hopedfor patient benefit and avoidance of predictable harms, which will be necessary to establish a favorable benefit-torisk ratio relative to other available treatments, may not be demonstrated in the first patients. Based on preclinical results and initial clinical experience in the decedent model and in 2 pig heart recipients, we predict that the risks from early graft failure and adventitious infection during a pediatric heart xenotransplantation trial are likely greater than \"minimal\" to inform our recommendation regarding the DHHS category that should guide the protocol review process for studies in children. Under 45 Code of Federal Regulations 46.407, research that may help in \"understanding, preventing or alleviating a serious problem affecting the health or welfare for children, and that doesn't meet the other children's risk level categories,\" is allowable. 46 nder this section, the importance of adhering to sound ethical principles and of obtaining child assent and parental consent is affirmed.",

This review intends to describe the latest cutting-edge progress in knowledge and methodologies developed to overcome potential obstacles that may preclude the translation and successful application of clinical xenotransplantation. Recent findings Preclinical studies have demonstrated that it is now possible to extend beyond two years survival of primate recipients of life saving xenografts. This has been accomplished thanks to the utilization of genetic engineering methodologies that have allowed the generation of specifically designed gene-edited pigs, a careful donor and recipient selection, and appropriate immunosuppressive strategies. In this light, the compassionate use of genetically modified pig hearts has been authorized in two human recipients and xenotransplants have also been achieved in human decedents. Although encouraging the preliminary results suggest that several challenges have yet to be fully addressed for a successful clinical translation of xenotransplantation. These challenges include immunologic, physiologic and biosafety aspects. Summary Recent progress has paved the way for the initial compassionate use of pig organs in humans and sets the scene for a wider application of clinical xenotransplantation.",

            "text": "Xenotransplantation may provide a unique opportunity in the medical care of patients with organ failure. The risk of xenogeneic infection is only beginning to be explored. Unfortunately, despite the wealth of data accumulating regarding the immunology of xenotransplantation, relatively little new information has accumulated regarding xenosis. Routine opportunistic infections of allograft recipients are often difficult to treat in the transplant patient but generally pose little threat to the immunologically normal, general public. Thus, common bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites in the xenograft recipient will require prompt and aggressive treatment, but pose no unique hazard for the general population. Unique risks exist only because of the possibilitythat novelorganisms may infect xenograft recipients and spread to the community. Given significant investigation, prospective monitoring may detect novel organisms (viruses, bacterial, fungi, protozoa, algae, cyanobacteria, others) of the types which have been detected in other immunosuppressed hosts. \n\nThe assessment of the risks associated with xenotransplantation is essential to public acceptance of this therapy. In the absence of data, it is difficult to develop a meaningful dialogue regarding the risks to the recipient or to the community at large. Research is essential regarding the behavior of organisms known to be present in prospective donor species in xenograft recipients and on the detection of novel potential pathogens. Significant dangers of infection exist for all transplant recipients given the available immunosup-pressive regimens. Careful source animal selection and studies in preclinical models may allow the risks to the recipient and to the community to be reduced, and may confer substantial benefits when the potential of xenotransplantation is recognized. The development of clinical xenotransplantation from the infectious disease perspective is viewed as an example of the potential risks of new technologies in the emergence of novel infection. However, in the absence of further data, the risks remain theoretical. Thus, fundamental research using innovative preclinical models and careful examination of clinical research subjects will provide a rational basis for decision-making in this field as for allotransplantation over the past 20 years.",

This study conducted a quantitative analysis of the perspectives of heart xenotransplantation in the treatment of patients with heart disease. The objective was to evaluate clinical efficacy, the immunosuppression techniques used, the results obtained in case studies and meta-analyses, and compare xenotransplantation with allogeneic transplantation methods. The methodology involved a literature review covering the period from 2014 to 2024, using databases such as Scielo, Google Scholar, scientific journals, repositories, and virtual libraries. Initially, 105 studies were found, of which 15 were selected after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results showed that grafts from genetically modified pig hearts can survive for extended periods in non-human primates, with some survivals documented for up to 945 days. Effective immunosuppression techniques, such as CD40-CD154 costimulation blockade and the use of anti-CD20 antibodies, significantly reduced episodes of acute rejection. Practical implications include the potential reduction of waiting time for patients in need of transplants and offering new hope for those with terminal heart failure. However, technical, ethical, and biological challenges still need to be overcome. It is concluded that heart xenotransplantation is a promising field that deserves continuous attention and investment in research to advance towards safe and effective clinical application.",

            "abstract": "Background \n \nIn contrast to allotransplantation, xenotransplantation has thus far attracted lit-tle interest within the field of theological ethics [6]. This can essentially be attributed to the fear of considerable problems regarding the medical feasibility due to possible immune reac-tions and the risk of infection [10,11]. Consequently, at the beginning of the 21st century a recommendation was issued to stop all relevant research; this also led to a retardation of theo-logical-ethical reflections on xenotransplantation. \n \n \n \nEthical questions: Irrespective of technical feasibility, the question whether xenotransplanta-tion is ethically justifiable or not can systematically be divided into three areas [10]: (i) Ethics regarding animals and nature are concerned with the significance of non-human rights; (ii) ethics in the areas of medicine, biomedicine and research deal with the importance of human rights; (iii) within the frame of a social-ethical perspective, these rights need to be debated within the context of distributive justice. The prevalent ethical discussions regarding xeno-transplantation focus on the following issues [2, 10]: protection of animals, risks of infection and informed consent. These have been the main reasons for the reluctance regarding human experiments [3, 5, 8]. Another range of concerns centers on the creation of human/animal chimeras by Xenotransplantation and the psychosocial and sociocultural acceptance of such procedures. These reservations are especially strong where the heart is concerned, since it has a special value in terms of personal and cultural identity, and a strong symbolic meaning. The morality of breeding transgenic pigs as donor animals has also recently been questioned, rais-ing the question of whether it is legitimate to transgress the human-animal boundary [1]. \n \n \n \nSince chimerism raises questions regarding its psychosocial and sociocultural acceptance, the basic levels of the bioethical discourse that underlie the specific normative regulations are addressed. This concerns the anthropological question of human self-conception and ques-tions regarding fundamental interpretations of life and essential beliefs regarding the meaning of life. To the extent that the last mentioned levels are inevitably incorporated into the norma-tive judgments of applied ethics and relate to the psychosocial and sociocultural acceptance of the xenotransplantation of the heart, it is necessary to bear in mind the fundamental anthropo-logical and ideological implications [4, 9]. These implications are reflected by theological ethics. From a perspective of theological ethics the question of identity also has to be debated within a theological anthropological framework. \n \n \n \nMost ethical perspectives on xenotransplantation refer explicitly or implicitly to the question of the psychosocial and sociocultural acceptance of Xenotransplantation. As a consequence, the question of personal [7], social and cultural identity as well as the pivotal question con-cerning the significance of the acceptance category for the ethical argumentation and ethical legitimization of standards are addressed. According to the ethical standards definition, validi-ty of a standard is also characterized by an opportunity to achieve social recognition and ac-ceptance. \n \n \n \nResearch areas: The relationship between psychosocial and sociocultural acceptance and ethical legitimization shall be discussed within the context of xenotransplantation, and the relevance of public opinion shall be mapped out with the goal of achieving social acceptance and thereby facilitating the success of xenotransplantation. With reference to the psychosocial conditions for acceptance and success, the relevance as well as the tasks of pastoral compan-ionship and pastoral-psychological support for potential organ recipients shall be debated and guidelines shall be drafted. In light of the identity-related challenges, an ethical and theologi-cal request for psychosocial counseling and pastoral companionship. Furthermore, special focus shall be given to the particular importance of the spiritual dimension of counseling. \n \n \n \nThis project is funded by DFG (TR CRC 127 \u201cBiology of xenogeneic cell, tissue and organ transplantation \u2013 from bench to bedside\u201d). \n \n \n \nReferences \n \n[1] Beckmann JP.

Nonetheless, ethical concerns, specifically the risk of xenozoonotic transmission and the necessity for stringent biosafety measures, remain significant obstacles.

These issues were previously discussed in detail (Schuurman et al., 2020)(Hurst et al., 2021). Briefly, in patients with chronic liver failure who retain capacity to make their own medical decisions the issue of patient consent is straightforward. For patients who arrive to the hospital unconscious in fulminant hepatic failure, the current standard is to place them on the waiting list for an emergent human liver allotransplant. The current ethical framework for treating life-threatening emergencies differs substantially from non-emergency situations, in that informed consent is not required in order to treat. In a scenario where the pig liver xenotransplantation is a reasonable alternative, the clinician would be required to choose between placing the patient on the waiting list or proceeding with liver xenotransplantation with an informed consent obtained from the family and/or hospital's ethical committee.",

This, together with increased insights into a low risk of pig\u2010to\u2010human transmission of porcine endogenous retrovirus, has opened the perspective of starting with first\u2010in\u2010human trials with xenogeneic organs. The regulatory path to clinical development is complex. Unlike an organ from human donors, an organ from pigs, either genetically modified or wild\u2010type pigs, is considered a medicinal product for human use and hence is under regulatory oversight, in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration and in Europe by the national competent authorities of the member states as well as the European Medicines Agency. Related to the status of medicinal product, \u201c(current) good practices\u201d apply in the process of generating a xenogeneic organ through to the transplantation into a patient and life\u2010long follow\u2010up. In addition, guidances for xenotransplantation products and genetically modified organisms do apply as well. This commentary focuses on regulatory aspects of transplantation of organs from genetically modified pigs into humans, with the intention to facilitate the interactions between regulatory agencies and institutions (sponsors) in research and clinical development of these organs, to support the perspective of speeding up the process with a proper entry in clinical application, to fill an unmet medical need in patients with end\u2010stage organ disease.",

The first clinical trials may aim to transplant genetically\u2010modified pig kidneys into adult humans. The impetus for beginning these first\u2010in\u2010human trials is the severe lack of deceased donor kidneys for transplantation and the number of patients with end\u2010stage renal disease currently on transplant waitlists, which in the USA approaches 100 000. The majority of patients on the kidney transplant waitlist receive continuous renal replacement therapy. In the United States, for patients on the kidney waitlist, the median wait\u2010time to receive a deceased human donor organ is approximately 4.5 years for patients aged 45\u201374, with a 5\u2010year mortality (or removal from the waitlist because of deteriorating health) of approximately 40%. XTx has the potential to reduce the kidney waitlist morbidity and mortality while improving quality of life. By focusing on scientific and psychosocial criteria, we present ethical considerations of certain inclusion and exclusion criteria for these first\u2010in\u2010human clinical trials that we suggest have not yet been fully explored."

(1998) Other challenges include the fairness of resource allocation and distributive justice, in an era when there is already much confusion in patients with respect to the current organ allocation system.\n\nAnother major aspect will be appropriately educating clinicians and patients, particularly with respect to the challenge of obtaining well-informed consent in an area with a high degree of uncertainty.

(Entwistle et al., 2022)(Silverman et al., 2022) The problems of autonomy in xenotransplantation are related to the difficulty of composing the free and informed consent form, since the risks and benefits for the recipient, given the complexity of the situation, are still unknown. Furthermore, some of the greatest risks of this procedure, zoonosis, is associated with the possibility of its success. Therefore, the recipient's notion of being able to withdraw from participating in the research at any time must be very well clarified before proceeding with the xenotransplantation, if there is a predictable chance of survival for a long period. (Entwistle et al., 2022)(Silverman et al., 2022) he risk of xenotransplant recipients contracting and transmitting Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses (PERV) infections is another bioethical issue that represents a potential public health problem because could cause a pandemic. This xenozoonosis or xenosis would be hazardous not only to the recipient but also to their contacts who would not even be aware of this situation.

Porcine heart xenotransplantation could serve as an alternative source of organs for patients with terminal heart failure. A first\u2010in\u2010human porcine xenotransplantation that occurred in January 2022 at the University of Maryland Medical Center provided an opportunity to examine several ethical issues to guide selection criteria for future xenotransplantation clinical trials. In this article, the authors, who are clinicians at UMMC, discuss the appropriate balancing of risks and benefits and the significance, if any, of clinical equipoise. The authors also review the alleged role of the psychosocial evaluation in identifying patients at an elevated risk of posttransplant noncompliance, and they consider how the evaluation's implementation might enhance inequities among diverse populations. The authors argue that, based on the principle of reciprocity, psychosocial criteria should be used, not to exclude patients, but instead to identify patients who need additional support. Finally, the authors discuss the requirements for and the proper assessment of informed and voluntary consent from patients being considered for xenotransplantation.",

In immunosuppressed human xenograft recipients, infection is most likely to be due to the same pathogens seen in human allotransplantation. However, organisms derived from swine and transmitted with xenografts have the potential to cause novel infections in xenograft recipients. The specific organisms likely to cause infection or \u201cxenosis\u201d are unknown but are postulated to be like those causing infection in allograft recipients. On this basis, theoretical exclusion criteria have been developed to guide the development of source animal herds. Herds developed based on the exclusion of potential human pathogens have been termed \u201cdesignated pathogen\u2010free\u201d (DPF). Lists of potential pathogens will require revision with changing epidemiology of infection in swine worldwide and clinical experience. Development of new microbiological assays is required both for animal screening and in clinical diagnosis should infections occur. Genetic modifications of swine have the potential to eliminate certain infectious agents such as the porcine endogenous retrovirus; infectious complications of such modifications have not been observed. Unexpected, off target effects of genetic modifications require further study.

The unique features of xenotransplantation from pigs relative to infectious risk center on the potential for unusual organisms derived from swine causing productive infection, \u201cxenosis\u201d or \u201cxenozoonosis,\u201d in the host. Based on experience in allotransplantation, the greatest hazard is due to viruses, due to the relative lack of information regarding the behavior of these potential pathogens in humans, the absence of validated serologic and molecular assays for swine\u2010derived pathogens, and uncertainty regarding the efficacy of therapeutic agents for these organisms. Other known, potential pathogens (i.e., bacteria, fungi, parasites) tend to be comparable to those of humans. Concerns remain for unknown organisms in swine that may replicate in immunosuppressed humans. Clinical trials of genetically modified organs sourced from swine in immunosuppressed humans with organ failure are under development. Such trials require informed consent regarding potential infectious risks to the recipient, determination of breeding characteristics of swine, assessments of potential risks to the public and healthcare providers, consideration of ethical issues posed by this novel therapy, and defined strategies to monitor and address infectious episodes that may be encountered by healthcare teams. Clinical trials in xenotransplantation will allow improved definition of potential infectious risks."

(Entwistle et al., 2022)(Silverman et al., 2022) The problems of autonomy in xenotransplantation are related to the difficulty of composing the free and informed consent form, since the risks and benefits for the recipient, given the complexity of the situation, are still unknown. Furthermore, some of the greatest risks of this procedure, zoonosis, is associated with the possibility of its success. Therefore, the recipient's notion of being able to withdraw from participating in the research at any time must be very well clarified before proceeding with the xenotransplantation, if there is a predictable chance of survival for a long period. (Entwistle et al., 2022)(Silverman et al., 2022) he risk of xenotransplant recipients contracting and transmitting Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses (PERV) infections is another bioethical issue that represents a potential public health problem because could cause a pandemic.

But the genuine possibility of xenotransplantation is largely a creature of the last half-century. That possibility raises a plethora of genuine ethical issues, as well as spurious ones occasioned by societal ignorance of science. Abstract There are three sorts of issues associated with genetic engineering and, by implication, with xenotransplantation. These are dangers associated with the technology, animal welfare issues, and the claim that genetic engineering represents a technology that humans should not embark upon. Using the hearts of pigs for humans in need of transplants has been a major issue in xenotransplantation. There are dangers associated with such use, such as immunological rejection of the organ, endogenous viruses infecting the recipients, and issues of privacy. In addition, the issue of fair distribution of organs arises. Animal welfare issues also arise, most notably the living conditions of the donor animals, issues notably present in confinement agriculture. A major issue emerges from animals\u2019 being kept under conditions that fail to meet the needs dictated by the animals\u2019 biological and psychological natures. Xenotransplantation animals will be kept under deprived laboratory conditions that similarly fail to meet the animals\u2019 natures. This is a significant concern for society in general. There are also issues of \u201cbad ethics\u201d arising from scientists\u2019 disavowal of ethical concerns in science. This in turn, coupled with societal ignorance of science, creates a climate for proliferation of religious and other non-rational concerns, such as the claim that xenotransplantation violates God\u2019s will. These spurious concerns can only be ameliorated when public understanding of science improves, and scientific understanding of ethics increases.",
                    "[23169300 | Smetanka et al. | 2005 | Citations: 32]": "Xenotransplantation is the transplantation of organs and cells from one species to another: it has enormous potential to increase the supply of organs and tissues to alleviate human disease. Recent scientific progress has eliminated the obstacle of hyperacute rejection, which is the massive destruction of the transplanted organ within 24 h. Despite this progress and the tremendous clinical potential, a number of ethical issues require careful consideration. These issues involve the human recipients, source animals, biotechnology companies and ultimately, the general public. One of the greatest concerns is the potential risk that an infectious agent will be transferred with the organ to the recipient, from whom it may spread, leading to a possible epidemic. However, there is no current evidence that porcine endogenous retrovirus, which is the agent of greatest concern, will be pathogenic. Using modern biotechnology, it may be possible to generate pigs that are free of this virus in the near future. Addressing these issues deliberately and in a scientific manner, with public involvement and education, will result in a greater understanding of the risks and benefits of xenotransplantation. This knowledge can then be utilised to fulfil the increasing demand for transplantable organs, with minimal risk.",
                    "[32706555 | Morris et al. | 2004 | Citations: 6]": "The Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association produced a position paper last year after widespread consultation on the ethical issues presented by potential clinical trials of xenotransplantation. We regarded this as an important contribution to the field and have reproduced it in our journal with permission in order to give it a wider exposure within the transplant community. Accompanying the paper are three commentaries on different aspects of this position paper. The authors argue the case for clinical xenotransplantation well and, with the ever-growing shortage of organs for transplantation, few would argue that xenotransplantation was not a potential solution to this problem. However, there are both scientific and ethical issues to be overcome before clinical trials could occur; this position paper concentrates on the ethical issues only. Apart from the normal ethical issues raised by the entry of any patient into a clinical trial, xenotransplantation presents specific problems related to the transplantation of a pig organ (the most favored donor species) into man. Truly informed consent will be difficult in a patient, who might have terminal organ failure. In addition, there is the potential problem of introducing infection into society; at this time, the Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus (PERV) is the potential pathogen of concern. Thus the committee correctly stresses the need to assess the risks and benefits of clinical xenotransplantation, not only to the prospective patient but also to society, before any clinical trials are considered. If the risk/ benefit analysis is favorable and experimental trials commence, the committee emphasizes the need for vigilant guidelines to monitor the transmission of infection (not only in the patient, but also in the patient\u2019s immediate contacts). Furthermore, these patients will have to accept the need for long-term monitoring. As part of this risk/benefit analysis, adequate preclinical data must be available to indicate that there is a reasonable chance of a successful outcome. The question of what defines adequate preclinical data is difficult to address, the authors admit, and needs to be assessed when the first trials are being considered. This implies the continuing experimental use of nonhuman primates, which the public has mixed views about, but which is essential to provide the required preclinical data. The authors correctly regard nonhuman primates as unsuitable organ donors, not only from an ethical point of view but also because of an increased risk of transmission of viral infection, but one can see the contradictory ethical dilemma that this presents. The pig is the chosen animal for donation, as it is generally acceptable to the public and is also acceptable from a physiological and anatomical point of view. The committee reviewed the religious views on xenotransplantation and found no serious objections from the monotheistic religions whereas the nonmonotheistic religions, primarily Buddhism and Hinduism, regard it as a matter for personal conscience. In their recommendations, the need for government regulation of clinical trials is stressed by the committee, along with the need for international cooperation to develop uniform operational standards and guidelines for clinical trials. It is suggested that the International Xenotranplantation Association might lead this initiative, but it might have a more powerful voice if done with the Transplantation Society under the umbrella of the World Health Organization. In the first of the three commentaries, Cooke and colleagues discuss the problems of informed consent and wonder whether a patient waiting for a pig heart transplant, when the alternative is death, can really give informed consent. Furthermore, the patient who has a xenotransplant is not in a position to withdraw from the experimental trial which contravenes the Declaration of Helsinki. They cite a similar situation in the recipient of an artificial heart. The authors also comment on the concept of beneficence both in the donor and in society, and express the hope that the small but real risks of PERV transmission will not delay clinical trials, provided the necessary preclinical data is available and the appropriate regulations are in place. The commentary by Einsiedel, although not downplaying the ethical issues, feels that the decision to proceed with clinical trials is a political one as much as a scientific one, and that the public needs to participate fully in this decision. This applies to any new technology but is even more important in xenotransplantation, where not only is there an additional pressure on the health resources of a country but also the risk to the public of the introduction of a new pathogen. Canadian, Dutch, and Australian public surveys have all suggested that a considerable degree of caution is required by the public, and that there is a need for more information before agreeing that clinical trials should proceed. On the other hand, Wright feels that the interpretation of the Canadian study was flawed and suggests that the data reveal a considerable degree of support for the concept of clinical xenotransplantation. Wright, in his concluding sentence, \u201cfeels that the public cannot provide useful insights into the critical safety and efficacy issues\u201d and these issues can only be addressed by carefully regulated trials when merited"

In this study, a risk\u2010based framework was developed, and expert opinion was elicited to evaluate porcine MP based on swine exposure and risk to human health. Experts identified 255 MP to include in the risk assessment. These were rated by experts for five criteria regarding potential swine exposure in the USA and human health risks. MP were subsequently categorized into three risk mitigation groups according to pre\u2010defined rules: disqualifying porcine MP (due to their pathogenic potential, n = 130); non\u2010disqualifying porcine MP (still relevant to consider for biosecurity or monitoring efforts, n = 40); and alert/watch list (not reported in the USA or MP not in swine, n = 85). Most disqualifying (n = 126) and non\u2010disqualifying (n = 36) porcine MP can effectively be eliminated with high biosecurity programs. This approach supports surveillance and risk mitigation strategies for porcine MP in swine produced for xenotransplantation, such as documentation of freedom from porcine MP, or use of porcine MP screening, monitoring, or elimination options. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first effort to comprehensively identify all relevant porcine MP systematically and transparently evaluate the risk of infection of both donor animals and immunosuppressed human recipients, and the potential health impacts for immunosuppressed human recipients from infected xenotransplantation products from pigs."

Ethical concerns center on the precautionary principle, which suggests that xenotransplantation should not be pursued until the risks of zoonotic diseases are better understood and minimized (Fovargue et al., 2010). Likewise, the long-term health and safety of recipients of xenotransplants are still not fully known, which raises ethical issues regarding patient safety and the potential for unforeseen complications (Ravelingien, 2007). \n\nThe ethics of human-animal relations are also an issue. There are concerns about the conditions in which donor animals are raised and the potential for harm, suffering, and exploitation of these animals (Mani et al., 2003). As with animal experimentation, there is the ethical difficulty of consent (Daar, 1997). In human-to-human organ transplantation, informed consent is typically obtained from donors or their families. In xenotransplantation, there is no way to obtain informed consent from the donor animals, raising ethical questions about the use of animals for the benefit of humans without their consent (Rollin, 2020)(Bobier et al., 2022).",

But the genuine possibility of xenotransplantation is largely a creature of the last half-century. That possibility raises a plethora of genuine ethical issues, as well as spurious ones occasioned by societal ignorance of science. Abstract There are three sorts of issues associated with genetic engineering and, by implication, with xenotransplantation. These are dangers associated with the technology, animal welfare issues, and the claim that genetic engineering represents a technology that humans should not embark upon. Using the hearts of pigs for humans in need of transplants has been a major issue in xenotransplantation. There are dangers associated with such use, such as immunological rejection of the organ, endogenous viruses infecting the recipients, and issues of privacy. In addition, the issue of fair distribution of organs arises. Animal welfare issues also arise, most notably the living conditions of the donor animals, issues notably present in confinement agriculture. A major issue emerges from animals\u2019 being kept under conditions that fail to meet the needs dictated by the animals\u2019 biological and psychological natures. Xenotransplantation animals will be kept under deprived laboratory conditions that similarly fail to meet the animals\u2019 natures. This is a significant concern for society in general. There are also issues of \u201cbad ethics\u201d arising from scientists\u2019 disavowal of ethical concerns in science. This in turn, coupled with societal ignorance of science, creates a climate for proliferation of religious and other non-rational concerns, such as the claim that xenotransplantation violates God\u2019s will. These spurious concerns can only be ameliorated when public understanding of science improves, and scientific understanding of ethics increases.",

While recent advances have brought this future closer, worries remain about whether it will be beneficial overall. The unique challenges and risks posed to humans that arise from transplanting across the species barrier, in addition to the costs borne by non\u2010human animals, has led some to question the value of xenotransplantation altogether. In response, we defend the value of xenotransplantation research, because it can satisfy stringent welfare conditions on the permissibility of animal research and use. Along the way, we respond to the alleged concerns, and conclude that they do not currently warrant a cessation or a curtailing of xenotransplantation research.",

Here we explore how matters of private benefit and public risk can be appropriately reconciled and consider whether ideas of public health should take a more central role when deciding whether clinical xenotransplantation should proceed. The risks of xenotransplantation are not certain but the nature of the harm to individual and public health could be severe. The concept of risk is central to our analysis as xenotransplantation threatens potential future harm as well as possible benefit. We argue that it is sometimes legally and ethically necessary for the state to act in advance to protect the health of the public, and that xenotransplantation is such a case. In reaching this conclusion we adopt a precautionary approach; an approach which we modify by Mill\u2019s harm principle."

Ethical concerns center on the precautionary principle, which suggests that xenotransplantation should not be pursued until the risks of zoonotic diseases are better understood and minimized (Fovargue et al., 2010). Likewise, the long-term health and safety of recipients of xenotransplants are still not fully known, which raises ethical issues regarding patient safety and the potential for unforeseen complications (Ravelingien, 2007). \n\nThe ethics of human-animal relations are also an issue. There are concerns about the conditions in which donor animals are raised and the potential for harm, suffering, and exploitation of these animals (Mani et al., 2003). As with animal experimentation, there is the ethical difficulty of consent (Daar, 1997). In human-to-human organ transplantation, informed consent is typically obtained from donors or their families. In xenotransplantation, there is no way to obtain informed consent from the donor animals, raising ethical questions about the use of animals for the benefit of humans without their consent (Rollin, 2020)(Bobier et al., 2022)."

In preparation for a clinical trial of xenotransplantation, we developed an in vivo pre\u2010clinical human model to test safety and feasibility tenets established in animal models. After performance of a novel, prospective compatible crossmatch, we performed bilateral native nephrectomies in a human brain\u2010dead decedent and subsequently transplanted two kidneys from a pig genetically engineered for human xenotransplantation. The decedent was hemodynamically stable through reperfusion, and vascular integrity was maintained despite the exposure of the xenografts to human blood pressure. No hyperacute rejection was observed, and the kidneys remained viable until termination 74 h later. No chimerism or transmission of porcine retroviruses was detected. Longitudinal biopsies revealed thrombotic microangiopathy that did not progress in severity, without evidence of cellular rejection or deposition of antibody or complement proteins. Although the xenografts produced variable amounts of urine, creatinine clearance did not recover. Whether renal recovery was impacted by the milieu of brain death and/or microvascular injury remains unknown. In summary, our study suggests that major barriers to human xenotransplantation have been surmounted and identifies where new knowledge is needed to optimize xenotransplantation outcomes in humans.",

The challenge in this model has been hyperacute rejection. To avoid this, pigs have been bred with a knockout of the alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene and with subcapsular autologous thymic tissue.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe transplanted kidneys from these genetically modified pigs into two brain-dead human recipients whose circulatory and respiratory activity was maintained on ventilators for the duration of the study. We performed serial biopsies and monitored the urine output and kinetic estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to assess renal function and xenograft rejection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe xenograft in both recipients began to make urine within moments after reperfusion. Over the 54-hour study, the kinetic eGFR increased from 23 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area before transplantation to 62 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 after transplantation in Recipient 1 and from 55 to 109 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 in Recipient 2. In both recipients, the creatinine level, which had been at a steady state, decreased after implantation of the xenograft, from 1.97 to 0.82 mg per deciliter in Recipient 1 and from 1.10 to 0.57 mg per deciliter in Recipient 2. The transplanted kidneys remained pink and well-perfused, continuing to make urine throughout the study. Biopsies that were performed at 6, 24, 48, and 54 hours revealed no signs of hyperacute or antibody-mediated rejection. Hourly urine output with the xenograft was more than double the output with the native kidneys.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGenetically modified kidney xenografts from pigs remained viable and functioning in brain-dead human recipients for 54 hours, without signs of hyperacute rejection.

We demonstrate how we translated this preclinical investigation into a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2010approved clinical cardiac xenotransplantation. First, genetically engineered (GE) pig hearts were transplanted into the abdomen of NHP along with IS, which included anti\u2010CD20 and anti\u2010CD40\u2010based co\u2010stimulation blockade antibodies. We reported 945 days of survival of three gene GE pig hearts in NHPs. Building on this proof\u2010of\u2010concept, we tested 3\u201310 gene\u2010modified GE pig hearts (in order to improve the immunocompatibility of the xenograft further) in a life\u2010supporting orthotopic model, but had limited success due to perioperative cardiac xenograft dysfunction (PCXD). With novel non\u2010ischemic continuous perfusion preservation (NICP), using the XVIVO Heart solution (XHS), life\u2010supporting survival was extended to 9 months. We approached the FDA under an application for \u201cExpanded Access\u201d (EA), to transplant a GE pig heart in a patient with end\u2010stage non\u2010ischemic cardiomyopathy. He was without other therapeutic options and dependent on VA\u2010ECMO. A team of FDA reviewers reviewed our preclinical research experience and data and allowed us to proceed. This clinical cardiac xenotransplantation was performed, and the patient survived for 60 days, demonstrating the translational preclinical investigation of cardiac xenotransplantation from bench to bedside. The ultimate etiology of graft failure is currently a topic of investigation and lessons learned will progress the field forward."

[12] ore comprehensive ethics considerations by all stakeholders, including the general public, are necessary to decide the societal acceptability and desirability of xenotransplantation research and commercialization.\n\nAs with animal agriculture, the large-scale farming of pigs for xenotransplantation requires animals to live truncated lives under unnatural conditions. Pathogen-free environments require excluding animals from their natural pasture habitat and raising them in sterile, indoor housing, which severely limits their natural range of animal behavior and social interactions. Captivity, isolation, handling, transport, and other standard conditions of modern pig farming cause significant stress responses in pigs, with a variety of biological and physiological consequences. [37] he number and type of animals at stake are not only the pigs used directly for each transplant, but also the pigs and primates used in research to refine xenotransplant methods and justify human recipient trials, as well as the animals used as feed. Furthermore, not every animal would be killed for their organs; some would be kept for breeding; and some would inevitably fail to meet the required criteria for organ viability, such as the absence of pathogens, and it is unlikely that these animals would be routed to environments in which they can flourish. Every pig and nonhuman primate used in these contexts is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering. [38]",

[12] ore comprehensive ethics considerations by all stakeholders, including the general public, are necessary to decide the societal acceptability and desirability of xenotransplantation research and commercialization.\n\nAs with animal agriculture, the large-scale farming of pigs for xenotransplantation requires animals to live truncated lives under unnatural conditions. Pathogen-free environments require excluding animals from their natural pasture habitat and raising them in sterile, indoor housing, which severely limits their natural range of animal behavior and social interactions. Captivity, isolation, handling, transport, and other standard conditions of modern pig farming cause significant stress responses in pigs, with a variety of biological and physiological consequences. [37] he number and type of animals at stake are not only the pigs used directly for each transplant, but also the pigs and primates used in research to refine xenotransplant methods and justify human recipient trials, as well as the animals used as feed. Furthermore, not every animal would be killed for their organs; some would be kept for breeding; and some would inevitably fail to meet the required criteria for organ viability, such as the absence of pathogens, and it is unlikely that these animals would be routed to environments in which they can flourish. Every pig and nonhuman primate used in these contexts is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering. [38]"

Let me analyze what dimensions would be most useful.\n\nFirst, I'll create a \"Background\" section to provide the user with context about what xenotransplantation is and why it's being pursued. This will help establish the foundation for understanding the ethical challenges.\n\nThen, I'll organize the ethical challenges into several key dimensions:\n\n1. \"Animal Welfare and Rights\" - This dimension will address ethical concerns related to the use of animals as organ sources, including issues of animal rights, suffering, and anthropocentrism. Many quotes (e.g., quotes 4, 7, 9, 11, 16, 17, 23) discuss these concerns.\n\n2. \"Infection and Public Health Risks\" - A major ethical concern is the potential transmission of animal diseases to humans (xenozoonosis) and subsequent spread to the broader population. This is mentioned in numerous quotes (e.g., quotes 1, 3, 10, 16, 25).\n\n3. \"Patient Consent and Autonomy\" - This dimension will cover ethical issues related to informed consent, patient autonomy, monitoring requirements, and psychological impacts on recipients. Several quotes (e.g., quotes 2, 5, 10, 25, 26) address these concerns.\n\n4. \"Broader Societal and Philosophical Concerns\" - This will include discussions of \"playing with nature,\" cultural and religious perspectives, resource allocation, and justice issues that extend beyond individual patients. Multiple quotes (e.g., quotes 3, 4, 7, 13, 16, 31, 32) touch on these themes.\n\n5. \"Regulatory and Governance Challenges\" - This dimension will address the need for appropriate regulatory frameworks, oversight, and international collaboration. Several quotes (e.g., quotes 6, 12, 14, 19) mention these issues.\n\nFor each dimension, I'll need to determine whether a synthesis or list format is most appropriate:\n\n- \"Background\" should be a synthesis to provide a coherent introduction to xenotransplantation.\n- \"Animal Welfare and Rights\" should be a synthesis to present the various ethical arguments and considerations regarding animal use.\n- \"Infection and Public Health Risks\" should be a synthesis to explain the interconnected concerns about disease transmission.\n- \"Patient Consent and Autonomy\" should be a synthesis to explain the complex issues of consent and monitoring.\n- \"Broader Societal and Philosophical Concerns\" should be a synthesis to present the various philosophical, cultural, and social considerations.\n- \"Regulatory and Governance Challenges\" should be a synthesis to explain the need for and challenges of developing appropriate oversight.\n\nAll of these dimensions require synthesis rather than lists because they involve complex, interconnected ethical considerations rather than discrete items that could be enumerated in a list format.",

                "text": "\nXenotransplantation refers to the transplantation of living cells, tissues, or organs from one species to another, specifically from animals (typically pigs or non-human primates) to humans. This medical procedure has been developed as a potential solution to the critical shortage of human organs available for transplantation, with thousands of patients dying annually while waiting for compatible organs. The field has seen significant advancement through genetic engineering techniques that modify animal organs to reduce rejection by the human immune system. While offering potential solutions to organ scarcity, xenotransplantation presents multiple ethical challenges that must be addressed before widespread clinical application. These ethical concerns span from animal welfare considerations to potential zoonotic disease risks, patient consent complexities, religious and cultural objections, resource allocation questions, and the need for comprehensive regulatory frameworks. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                "tldr": "Xenotransplantation raises fundamental ethical concerns about animal welfare and rights, as it requires genetically modifying animals and keeping them in artificial environments that restrict natural behaviors. These concerns include questions about the moral status of animals, whether humans have the right to use animals for human benefit, and the welfare conditions of animals bred specifically for organ harvesting. (11 sources)",
                "text": "\nAnimal welfare and rights concerns represent a significant ethical challenge in xenotransplantation, with many animal rights organizations explicitly opposing the use of animals for such research <Paper corpusId=\"258276646\" paperTitle=\"(Santos, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. A central ethical tension emerges from what some ethicists describe as an \"anthropocentric approach\" that prioritizes human interests over those of animals, contrasting with a more inclusive \"biocentric perspective\" that values all forms of life equally <Paper corpusId=\"267567406\" paperTitle=\"(Hawthorne, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This fundamental tension raises questions about whether animals, like humans, have inherent rights to existence that should not be sacrificed to benefit humans <Paper corpusId=\"253286042\" paperTitle=\"(Oli et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221306753\" paperTitle=\"(Cengiz et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe living conditions of animals bred for xenotransplantation present particular welfare concerns. These animals must be raised in pathogen-free environments that necessitate sterile, indoor housing rather than natural pasture habitats <Paper corpusId=\"276315377\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. Such conditions severely restrict natural behaviors and social interactions, causing significant stress responses with various biological and physiological consequences <Paper corpusId=\"276315377\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. The welfare of animals bred in laboratory conditions that differ significantly from their natural environments requires careful definition and monitoring <Paper corpusId=\"249734546\" paperTitle=\"(Boulet et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe ethical complexity increases when considering the genetic modification of animals for xenotransplantation. Creating human-pig chimeras containing human genes and cells evokes strong reactions from various perspectives <Paper corpusId=\"58644768\" paperTitle=\"(Casal et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Some argue that such modifications represent a \"deep transgression of the natural order\" for theological, ecological, or dignity-related reasons <Paper corpusId=\"58644768\" paperTitle=\"(Casal et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Specific concerns have been raised about human cells potentially populating animal brains or germlines, which might confer morally relevant human traits or lead to transmission of human genes if animals were accidentally released <Paper corpusId=\"58644768\" paperTitle=\"(Casal et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAnother profound ethical issue concerns consent. While human-to-human transplantation typically involves informed consent from donors or their families, animals cannot provide consent for the use of their organs <Paper corpusId=\"267749482\" paperTitle=\"(Andrade et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"221862396\" paperTitle=\"(Rollin, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"255213612\" paperTitle=\"(Bobier et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This raises questions about the ethical permissibility of using animals for human benefit without their consent, especially considering that pigs and non-human primates used in xenotransplantation are cognitively complex animals with capacity for significant suffering <Paper corpusId=\"276315377\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSome ethicists argue that discussion of animal ethics in xenotransplantation often falls short by making inappropriate comparisons to animal use for food or by focusing strictly on welfare without considering broader ethical questions <Paper corpusId=\"276315377\" paperTitle=\"(Krebs et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "Many animal rights organizations are against the use of animals for research, including xenotransplantation.\n\nOthers argue that scientists may disturb the fundamental nature of a species, despite the fact that selective breeding has caused more extensive modifications than the ten genetic alterations engineered for xenotransplantation (George, 2022).\n\nAs xenotransplant may lead to zoonotic diseases with public health implications, one of the most challenging aspects of its implementation is the possible requirement of life-long monitoring for patients and their close contacts [70]. This concern has some regulatory agencies, such as the Council of Europe Recommendations Rec (2003) 10 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on xenotransplantation, Article 21, stating that patients may have to waiver some of their human rights for close follow-up and monitoring",
                            ".individuals seeking xenotransplantation may resort to traveling to countries with looser policies for the life-saving procedure, imposing increased risks for zoonosis upon their return home where animal husbandry and organ screening regulations are more stringent (Jorqui-Azofra, 2020).\n\nMoreover, there are questions if a collective consent should be required prior to initiation of xenotransplant trials since this procedure may carry risks for a broader population beyond the patients participating in the study (Jorqui-Azofra, 2020)."

                            "One ethical concern intrinsic to xenotransplantation relates to the potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans, a phenomenon known as xenozoonosis. The concept of transmission although theoretical is not unfounded, as various pathogens, including retroviruses, have been identified in pigs could be potential threats in immunocompromised transplant recipients and then theoretically spread to direct close contacts and the broader community (24,(Groenendaal et al., 2023)",
                            "The duty to protect the broader community and prevent the spread of theoretically potential infectious diseases must be weighed against the need to explore novel medical solutions to help these patients suffering from end stage organ failure and other diseases (Hawthorne et al., 2022)",
                            "From a patient and community perspective it is therefore essential for the patients, their family and immediate direct contacts along with the community to understand that if there were in fact a positive case of transmission of a xenozoonosis into a xenotransplant patient that there may well be serious implications to all involved. These implications are potentially as severe as lifelong restriction and quarantine of the recipient and may extend to their direct close contacts (25).\n\nXenotransplantation challenges the traditional conceptual boundaries that separate humans from animals. It poses profound philosophical and ethical questions about the nature of different species and the moral obligation we owe to different species. As we engage in practices that involve genetic modification and the use of animals for human benefit, the ethical boundaries are changing with increasing pressure on ethics committees and legislators to keep track with the pace of change, and we have a moral imperative to ensure that we do keep pace and provide adequate oversight (6).\n\nSome ethicists argue that xenotransplantation exemplifies the Anthropocentric approach (38), emphasizing human interests over those of animals, while others advocate for a more inclusive biocentric perspective that values all forms of life equally (39). The challenge is to find a balance between medical innovation and ethical responsibility to both animal and man (6)."

                            "Another fundamental challenge facing xenograft is ethical issues. Three ethical issues quickly come to mind when we talk of xenotransplantation: animal rights (effects on the donor animal), human rights (the impact on the human population and the impact on the individual recipient), and interference with nature. An animal rights issue arises because animals, like humans, also have rights to existence and should not be sacrificed in favor of humans (Cengiz et al., 2020). Human rights regarding the recipient can quickly be cleared by obtaining the necessary informed consent. Still, the populace also needs authorization because of the possibility of transferring new pathogens from animal to human populations -a public health risk (Abouna, 2003). The ethical issue of interference with nature may not be so applied. It may be understandable that by interfering with nature, man can free himself from the extinction effects of some natural phenomena [28]."

Recent findings Developments within xenotransplantation may soon allow for pig-to-human xenotransplantation to take place. Ethical analysis of xenotransplantation commonly follows an anthropocentric cost\u2013benefit analysis, which may imprecisely measure costs. Xenotransplantation should not merely be approached from an anthropocentric perspective. Rather, the potential risks presented to human and nonhuman donors, recipients, and third parties should all be thoroughly considered. Summary The range of feasible alternatives to xenotransplantation to increase organ supply should be examined before resorting to xenotransplantation because of the moral distinction between imposing certain risks on others before, or after, alternative solutions have been exhausted."

[12] ore comprehensive ethics considerations by all stakeholders, including the general public, are necessary to decide the societal acceptability and desirability of xenotransplantation research and commercialization.\n\nAs with animal agriculture, the large-scale farming of pigs for xenotransplantation requires animals to live truncated lives under unnatural conditions. Pathogen-free environments require excluding animals from their natural pasture habitat and raising them in sterile, indoor housing, which severely limits their natural range of animal behavior and social interactions. Captivity, isolation, handling, transport, and other standard conditions of modern pig farming cause significant stress responses in pigs, with a variety of biological and physiological consequences. [37] he number and type of animals at stake are not only the pigs used directly for each transplant, but also the pigs and primates used in research to refine xenotransplant methods and justify human recipient trials, as well as the animals used as feed. Furthermore, not every animal would be killed for their organs; some would be kept for breeding; and some would inevitably fail to meet the required criteria for organ viability, such as the absence of pathogens, and it is unlikely that these animals would be routed to environments in which they can flourish. Every pig and nonhuman primate used in these contexts is a cognitively complex animal with the capacity for significant suffering. [38]"

                            "In cases of xenotransplantation, when the donor and the recipient belong to different species, further issues arise, regarding (i) the unavoidable harms to the donor and (ii) the possible harms to the recipients. When the donor is a chimeric pig, designed to contain a percentage of human genes and cells, xenotransplantation provokes two opposing sets of reactions [5].\n\nFor some, the use of human-pig chimeras strengthens both recipient-based and donor-based objections, rendering xenotransplantation more objectionable or even impermissible. Many feel an aversion to such a deep transgression of the natural order, for reasons that may be theological, ecological, or involve human dignity, animal rights or fear of scientists yet again producing undesirable, unforeseen, and irreversible consequences. Others have more specific concerns. For example, the US National Institutes of Health suspended funding of their chimeric xenotransplantation program in 2015 over concerns about introducing human DNA into a member of another species, and particularly doing so at such an early developmental stage. As Carrie Wolinetz, Salz Institute's Associate Director for Science Policy, explains: 'people were concerned about human cells populating the brain of the animal or the germline of the animal' [6]. In the first case, the animal might acquire morally relevant human traits; in the second case, the animal might transmit human genes and traits to its offspring, for example, if accidentally released into the wild."

                            "Other concerns are ethical. Xenotransplantation carries the potential risk of transmitting infectious diseases from animals to humans. Ethical concerns center on the precautionary principle, which suggests that xenotransplantation should not be pursued until the risks of zoonotic diseases are better understood and minimized (Fovargue et al., 2010). Likewise, the long-term health and safety of recipients of xenotransplants are still not fully known, which raises ethical issues regarding patient safety and the potential for unforeseen complications (Ravelingien, 2007). \n\nThe ethics of human-animal relations are also an issue. There are concerns about the conditions in which donor animals are raised and the potential for harm, suffering, and exploitation of these animals (Mani et al., 2003). As with animal experimentation, there is the ethical difficulty of consent (Daar, 1997). In human-to-human organ transplantation, informed consent is typically obtained from donors or their families. In xenotransplantation, there is no way to obtain informed consent from the donor animals, raising ethical questions about the use of animals for the benefit of humans without their consent (Rollin, 2020)(Bobier et al., 2022)."

While recent advances have brought this future closer, worries remain about whether it will be beneficial overall. The unique challenges and risks posed to humans that arise from transplanting across the species barrier, in addition to the costs borne by non\u2010human animals, has led some to question the value of xenotransplantation altogether. In response, we defend the value of xenotransplantation research, because it can satisfy stringent welfare conditions on the permissibility of animal research and use.

In extreme scenarios, infected recipients might face severe restrictions including potential quarantine measures that could extend to their close contacts <Paper corpusId=\"267567406\" paperTitle=\"(Hawthorne, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nInformed consent procedures for xenotransplantation must therefore address not only typical medical risks but also these broader public health considerations <Paper corpusId=\"248635370\" paperTitle=\"(Bayliss, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Some have questioned whether informed consent should be obtained not only from the recipient but also from close contacts and medical personnel involved in the patient's care, given the potential for disease transmission <Paper corpusId=\"248635370\" paperTitle=\"(Bayliss, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This represents a significant departure from standard informed consent practices in other medical procedures <Paper corpusId=\"276578858\" paperTitle=\"(Gordon et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMore fundamentally, some ethicists argue that xenotransplantation raises questions about collective consent\u2014whether society at large should have input on proceeding with clinical trials that may carry population-level risks <Paper corpusId=\"258276646\" paperTitle=\"(Santos, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "Another fundamental challenge facing xenograft is ethical issues. Three ethical issues quickly come to mind when we talk of xenotransplantation: animal rights (effects on the donor animal), human rights (the impact on the human population and the impact on the individual recipient), and interference with nature. An animal rights issue arises because animals, like humans, also have rights to existence and should not be sacrificed in favor of humans (Cengiz et al., 2020). Human rights regarding the recipient can quickly be cleared by obtaining the necessary informed consent. Still, the populace also needs authorization because of the possibility of transferring new pathogens from animal to human populations -a public health risk (Abouna, 2003). The ethical issue of interference with nature may not be so applied. It may be understandable that by interfering with nature, man can free himself from the extinction effects of some natural phenomena [28]."

                            "One ethical concern intrinsic to xenotransplantation relates to the potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans, a phenomenon known as xenozoonosis. The concept of transmission although theoretical is not unfounded, as various pathogens, including retroviruses, have been identified in pigs could be potential threats in immunocompromised transplant recipients and then theoretically spread to direct close contacts and the broader community (24,(Groenendaal et al., 2023)",
                            "The duty to protect the broader community and prevent the spread of theoretically potential infectious diseases must be weighed against the need to explore novel medical solutions to help these patients suffering from end stage organ failure and other diseases (Hawthorne et al., 2022)",
                            "From a patient and community perspective it is therefore essential for the patients, their family and immediate direct contacts along with the community to understand that if there were in fact a positive case of transmission of a xenozoonosis into a xenotransplant patient that there may well be serious implications to all involved. These implications are potentially as severe as lifelong restriction and quarantine of the recipient and may extend to their direct close contacts (25).\n\nXenotransplantation challenges the traditional conceptual boundaries that separate humans from animals. It poses profound philosophical and ethical questions about the nature of different species and the moral obligation we owe to different species. As we engage in practices that involve genetic modification and the use of animals for human benefit, the ethical boundaries are changing with increasing pressure on ethics committees and legislators to keep track with the pace of change, and we have a moral imperative to ensure that we do keep pace and provide adequate oversight (6).\n\nSome ethicists argue that xenotransplantation exemplifies the Anthropocentric approach (38), emphasizing human interests over those of animals, while others advocate for a more inclusive biocentric perspective that values all forms of life equally (39). The challenge is to find a balance between medical innovation and ethical responsibility to both animal and man (6)."

(Entwistle et al., 2022)(Silverman et al., 2022) The problems of autonomy in xenotransplantation are related to the difficulty of composing the free and informed consent form, since the risks and benefits for the recipient, given the complexity of the situation, are still unknown. Furthermore, some of the greatest risks of this procedure, zoonosis, is associated with the possibility of its success. Therefore, the recipient's notion of being able to withdraw from participating in the research at any time must be very well clarified before proceeding with the xenotransplantation, if there is a predictable chance of survival for a long period. (Entwistle et al., 2022)(Silverman et al., 2022) he risk of xenotransplant recipients contracting and transmitting Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses (PERV) infections is another bioethical issue that represents a potential public health problem because could cause a pandemic. This xenozoonosis or xenosis would be hazardous not only to the recipient but also to their contacts who would not even be aware of this situation. (Fishman, 2020)(Nellore et al., 2022)  recipients and their contacts probably will need lifelong surveillance to detect and treat any unexpected disease early and protect society as a whole.

In immunosuppressed human xenograft recipients, infection is most likely to be due to the same pathogens seen in human allotransplantation. However, organisms derived from swine and transmitted with xenografts have the potential to cause novel infections in xenograft recipients. The specific organisms likely to cause infection or \"xenosis\" are unknown but are postulated to be like those causing infection in allograft recipients. On this basis, theoretical exclusion criteria have been developed to guide the development of source animal herds. Herds developed based on the exclusion of potential human pathogens have been termed \"designated pathogen\u2010free\" (DPF). Lists of potential pathogens will require revision with changing epidemiology of infection in swine worldwide and clinical experience. Development of new microbiological assays is required both for animal screening and in clinical diagnosis should infections occur. Genetic modifications of swine have the potential to eliminate certain infectious agents such as the porcine endogenous retrovirus; infectious complications of such modifications have not been observed. Unexpected, off target effects of genetic modifications require further study. Monitoring for infection in asymptomatic recipients is important to define infectious risks which are unknown in the absence of clinical trials data. Advanced microbiological techniques may be applied to diagnose and prevent infection in xenograft recipients."

The fact that the patients will have to be monitored for possible infectious diseases for an extended time, possibly for life, is another ethical concern.\n\nMoreover, there are a number of ethical issues with regards to society at large. The public health hazard posed by the possible transmission and activation of PERV created considerable public concern a few years ago. The public debate that took place also generated some emotionally colored skepticism towards xenotransplantation, in which it was argued that \"transplantation from animal to man will violate the order of nature\".

Such vulnerability commonly occurs among patients undergoing innovative surgical procedures for which alternative standard treatments are either ineffective or nonexistent [21].\n\nThe ethical challenges to informed consent comprise a component of translational research that requires resolution. Current federal regulations (i.e., the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984) lack guidance on informed consent for xenotransplant clinical trials [22]. Organ Procurement and Transplant Network policies only pertain to human organs. Thus, policies on information disclosure may not translate to the xenotransplant context."

Some feared social injustice by lopsided distribution of scarce resources to a few at the expense of broader basic medical care for all. Critics wondered whether xenotransplantation would endanger public health (Vanderpool, 1998). Other pressing questions touched on prerequisites for clinical trials: identifying acceptable risk-benefit thresholds and clinically defining success (extra days versus extra weeks or months of life, for example). Some questioned whether informed consent should be obtained from close contacts of the patient and medical personnel involved in the recipient's care, given concerns about zoonotic infection. It was argued that informed consent from recipients should include a broader set of risks including public attention, risk of transmitting disease and isolation. A final set of questions touched on who is responsible for oversight of clinical trials in xenotransplantation (local hospital review boards, national committees, or some combination)?"

This concern has some regulatory agencies, such as the Council of Europe Recommendations Rec (2003) 10 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on xenotransplantation, Article 21, stating that patients may have to waiver some of their human rights for close follow-up and monitoring",

(ii) while most medical technologies demand assessment and risk-management at the time when the technology is sufficiently developed to be put into practice, xenotransplantation demands pro-active action at a very early stage of development. A particular challenge for any assessment of xenotransplantation is the inclusion of a satisfactory approach to the ethical issues involved."

Ethical concerns center on the precautionary principle, which suggests that xenotransplantation should not be pursued until the risks of zoonotic diseases are better understood and minimized (Fovargue et al., 2010). Likewise, the long-term health and safety of recipients of xenotransplants are still not fully known, which raises ethical issues regarding patient safety and the potential for unforeseen complications (Ravelingien, 2007). \n\nThe ethics of human-animal relations are also an issue. There are concerns about the conditions in which donor animals are raised and the potential for harm, suffering, and exploitation of these animals (Mani et al., 2003). As with animal experimentation, there is the ethical difficulty of consent (Daar, 1997). In human-to-human organ transplantation, informed consent is typically obtained from donors or their families. In xenotransplantation, there is no way to obtain informed consent from the donor animals, raising ethical questions about the use of animals for the benefit of humans without their consent (Rollin, 2020)(Bobier et al., 2022)."

                            "Xenotransplantation is an example of a developing biotechnology which highlights three differing interests in the health of the public; a specific interest in enhancing the health of individuals who require a particular procedure or treatment, a wider interest in protecting the health of us all by avoiding introducing biotechnologies which risk the health of the public, and a public interest in advancing medical knowledge and treatment. Here we explore how matters of private benefit and public risk can be appropriately reconciled and consider whether ideas of public health should take a more central role when deciding whether clinical xenotransplantation should proceed. The risks of xenotransplantation are not certain but the nature of the harm to individual and public health could be severe. The concept of risk is central to our analysis as xenotransplantation threatens potential future harm as well as possible benefit. We argue that it is sometimes legally and ethically necessary for the state to act in advance to protect the health of the public, and that xenotransplantation is such a case. In reaching this conclusion we adopt a precautionary approach; an approach which we modify by Mill\u2019s harm principle."

                            "Xenotransplantation has the potential to address shortages of organs available for clinical transplantation, but concerns exist regarding potential risks posed by porcine microorganisms and parasites (MP) to the health of human recipients. In this study, a risk\u2010based framework was developed, and expert opinion was elicited to evaluate porcine MP based on swine exposure and risk to human health. Experts identified 255 MP to include in the risk assessment. These were rated by experts for five criteria regarding potential swine exposure in the USA and human health risks. MP were subsequently categorized into three risk mitigation groups according to pre\u2010defined rules: disqualifying porcine MP (due to their pathogenic potential, n = 130); non\u2010disqualifying porcine MP (still relevant to consider for biosecurity or monitoring efforts, n = 40); and alert/watch list (not reported in the USA or MP not in swine, n = 85). Most disqualifying (n = 126) and non\u2010disqualifying (n = 36) porcine MP can effectively be eliminated with high biosecurity programs. This approach supports surveillance and risk mitigation strategies for porcine MP in swine produced for xenotransplantation, such as documentation of freedom from porcine MP, or use of porcine MP screening, monitoring, or elimination options. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first effort to comprehensively identify all relevant porcine MP systematically and transparently evaluate the risk of infection of both donor animals and immunosuppressed human recipients, and the potential health impacts for immunosuppressed human recipients from infected xenotransplantation products from pigs."

The consent process for xenotransplantation is complicated by the uncertainty of risks and benefits, making it difficult for patients to make fully informed decisions <Paper corpusId=\"256590616\" paperTitle=\"(Galvao et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This uncertainty is particularly problematic because some of the greatest risks, such as zoonotic disease transmission, are associated with the procedure's success rather than its failure <Paper corpusId=\"256590616\" paperTitle=\"(Galvao et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"219317659\" paperTitle=\"(Fishman, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA key consent challenge concerns the lifelong surveillance that recipients and possibly their close contacts may require to detect and address potential infections early <Paper corpusId=\"256590616\" paperTitle=\"(Galvao et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"219317659\" paperTitle=\"(Fishman, 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"250989911\" paperTitle=\"(Nellore et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This monitoring requirement raises significant concerns about patient privacy and autonomy <Paper corpusId=\"258276646\" paperTitle=\"(Santos, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"265121285\" paperTitle=\"(Thom et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. In extreme cases, infected recipients might face severe restrictions including quarantine measures that could extend to their close contacts <Paper corpusId=\"267567406\" paperTitle=\"(Hawthorne, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Some regulatory frameworks, such as the Council of Europe Recommendations, have gone so far as to suggest that patients may need to waive certain human rights to facilitate necessary follow-up and monitoring <Paper corpusId=\"258276646\" paperTitle=\"(Santos, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe question of who should provide consent is also complicated in xenotransplantation. Some ethicists have proposed that informed consent should be obtained not only from recipients but also from their close contacts and medical personnel, given their potential exposure to zoonotic risks <Paper corpusId=\"248635370\" paperTitle=\"(Bayliss, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. More fundamentally, some argue that xenotransplantation raises questions about collective consent\u2014whether society at large should have input on clinical trials that carry population-level risks <Paper corpusId=\"258276646\" paperTitle=\"(Santos, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe consent process for xenotransplantation must address a broader set of risks compared to conventional procedures, including potential public attention, disease transmission, and isolation <Paper corpusId=\"248635370\" paperTitle=\"(Bayliss, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This expanded informed consent should be a deliberative process occurring over several days, with participation by representatives from clinical ethics committees <Paper corpusId=\"252874917\" paperTitle=\"(Silverman et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSpecial consent challenges arise in emergency situations. For patients with acute liver failure who arrive unconscious, the standard emergency treatment framework\u2014which doesn't require informed consent\u2014may conflict with the experimental nature of xenotransplantation procedures <Paper corpusId=\"247027354\" paperTitle=\"(Cross-Najafi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"219330997\" paperTitle=\"(Schuurman et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"244428525\" paperTitle=\"(Hurst et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. In such cases, clinicians must navigate difficult decisions about proceeding with xenotransplantation using consent from family members or ethics committees <Paper corpusId=\"247027354\" paperTitle=\"(Cross-Najafi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPatient vulnerability presents another significant challenge. Patients with end-stage organ failure often have few or no treatment alternatives, which can undermine voluntary decision-making and render them vulnerable to accepting higher risks <Paper corpusId=\"276578858\" paperTitle=\"(Gordon et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. This vulnerability is common among patients considering innovative surgical procedures when standard treatments are ineffective or unavailable <Paper corpusId=\"276578858\" paperTitle=\"(Gordon et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCurrent regulatory frameworks provide limited guidance on informed consent for xenotransplantation clinical trials. The National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 lacks specific guidance, and Organ Procurement and Transplant Network policies only apply to human organs <Paper corpusId=\"276578858\" paperTitle=\"(Gordon et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. This regulatory gap underscores the need for comprehensive consent frameworks specific to xenotransplantation.\n\nPatient selection for xenotransplantation trials raises additional ethical questions about justice and beneficence. Current recommendations often prioritize critically ill patients who have exhausted other options, but this approach has been criticized for potentially unfavorable risk-benefit ratios, particularly for patients with complex medical conditions <Paper corpusId=\"276610974\" paperTitle=\"(Shirini et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. Some ethicists argue that psychosocial criteria should be used not to exclude patients but to identify those requiring additional support <Paper corpusId=\"252874917\" paperTitle=\"(Silverman et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPublic perception and emotional reactions to xenotransplantation further complicate the consent process. Arguments that xenotransplantation \"will violate the order of nature\" or constitutes \"experimentation on sick human beings\" reflect deeper societal concerns that may influence patient decision-making <Paper corpusId=\"29444854\" paperTitle=\"(Groth, 2007)\" isShortName></Paper>. Addressing these concerns requires proactive public engagement to build trust and address normative judgments that affect societal acceptance of this emerging biotechnology <Paper corpusId=\"276610974\" paperTitle=\"(Shirini et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "Clinical application of innovation such as xenotransplantation raises questions concerning the balance between beneficence, individual autonomy and the recognition of possible damage to society and the environment. (Entwistle et al., 2022)(Silverman et al., 2022) The problems of autonomy in xenotransplantation are related to the difficulty of composing the free and informed consent form, since the risks and benefits for the recipient, given the complexity of the situation, are still unknown. Furthermore, some of the greatest risks of this procedure, zoonosis, is associated with the possibility of its success. Therefore, the recipient's notion of being able to withdraw from participating in the research at any time must be very well clarified before proceeding with the xenotransplantation, if there is a predictable chance of survival for a long period. (Entwistle et al., 2022)(Silverman et al., 2022) he risk of xenotransplant recipients contracting and transmitting Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses (PERV) infections is another bioethical issue that represents a potential public health problem because could cause a pandemic. This xenozoonosis or xenosis would be hazardous not only to the recipient but also to their contacts who would not even be aware of this situation. (Fishman, 2020)(Nellore et al., 2022)  recipients and their contacts probably will need lifelong surveillance to detect and treat any unexpected disease early and protect society as a whole. (Fishman, 2020)(Nellore et al., 2022) he appropriate care of the swine that will be a donor in the xenotransplantation is another important bioethical issue."

In immunosuppressed human xenograft recipients, infection is most likely to be due to the same pathogens seen in human allotransplantation. However, organisms derived from swine and transmitted with xenografts have the potential to cause novel infections in xenograft recipients. The specific organisms likely to cause infection or \"xenosis\" are unknown but are postulated to be like those causing infection in allograft recipients. On this basis, theoretical exclusion criteria have been developed to guide the development of source animal herds. Herds developed based on the exclusion of potential human pathogens have been termed \"designated pathogen\u2010free\" (DPF). Lists of potential pathogens will require revision with changing epidemiology of infection in swine worldwide and clinical experience. Development of new microbiological assays is required both for animal screening and in clinical diagnosis should infections occur. Genetic modifications of swine have the potential to eliminate certain infectious agents such as the porcine endogenous retrovirus; infectious complications of such modifications have not been observed. Unexpected, off target effects of genetic modifications require further study. Monitoring for infection in asymptomatic recipients is important to define infectious risks which are unknown in the absence of clinical trials data. Advanced microbiological techniques may be applied to diagnose and prevent infection in xenograft recipients."

The unique features of xenotransplantation from pigs relative to infectious risk center on the potential for unusual organisms derived from swine causing productive infection, \"xenosis\" or \"xenozoonosis,\" in the host. Based on experience in allotransplantation, the greatest hazard is due to viruses, due to the relative lack of information regarding the behavior of these potential pathogens in humans, the absence of validated serologic and molecular assays for swine\u2010derived pathogens, and uncertainty regarding the efficacy of therapeutic agents for these organisms. Other known, potential pathogens (i.e., bacteria, fungi, parasites) tend to be comparable to those of humans. Concerns remain for unknown organisms in swine that may replicate in immunosuppressed humans. Clinical trials of genetically modified organs sourced from swine in immunosuppressed humans with organ failure are under development. Such trials require informed consent regarding potential infectious risks to the recipient, determination of breeding characteristics of swine, assessments of potential risks to the public and healthcare providers, consideration of ethical issues posed by this novel therapy, and defined strategies to monitor and address infectious episodes that may be encountered by healthcare teams. Clinical trials in xenotransplantation will allow improved definition of potential infectious risks."

                            "One ethical concern intrinsic to xenotransplantation relates to the potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans, a phenomenon known as xenozoonosis. The concept of transmission although theoretical is not unfounded, as various pathogens, including retroviruses, have been identified in pigs could be potential threats in immunocompromised transplant recipients and then theoretically spread to direct close contacts and the broader community (24,(Groenendaal et al., 2023)",
                            "The duty to protect the broader community and prevent the spread of theoretically potential infectious diseases must be weighed against the need to explore novel medical solutions to help these patients suffering from end stage organ failure and other diseases (Hawthorne et al., 2022)",
                            "From a patient and community perspective it is therefore essential for the patients, their family and immediate direct contacts along with the community to understand that if there were in fact a positive case of transmission of a xenozoonosis into a xenotransplant patient that there may well be serious implications to all involved. These implications are potentially as severe as lifelong restriction and quarantine of the recipient and may extend to their direct close contacts (25).\n\nXenotransplantation challenges the traditional conceptual boundaries that separate humans from animals. It poses profound philosophical and ethical questions about the nature of different species and the moral obligation we owe to different species. As we engage in practices that involve genetic modification and the use of animals for human benefit, the ethical boundaries are changing with increasing pressure on ethics committees and legislators to keep track with the pace of change, and we have a moral imperative to ensure that we do keep pace and provide adequate oversight (6).\n\nSome ethicists argue that xenotransplantation exemplifies the Anthropocentric approach (38), emphasizing human interests over those of animals, while others advocate for a more inclusive biocentric perspective that values all forms of life equally (39). The challenge is to find a balance between medical innovation and ethical responsibility to both animal and man (6)."

                            "Initial concerns centered on whether animal-to-human transplants violate the laws of nature and whether it is wrong to sacrifice animals as organ donors to humans. Some feared social injustice by lopsided distribution of scarce resources to a few at the expense of broader basic medical care for all. Critics wondered whether xenotransplantation would endanger public health (Vanderpool, 1998). Other pressing questions touched on prerequisites for clinical trials: identifying acceptable risk-benefit thresholds and clinically defining success (extra days versus extra weeks or months of life, for example). Some questioned whether informed consent should be obtained from close contacts of the patient and medical personnel involved in the recipient's care, given concerns about zoonotic infection. It was argued that informed consent from recipients should include a broader set of risks including public attention, risk of transmitting disease and isolation. A final set of questions touched on who is responsible for oversight of clinical trials in xenotransplantation (local hospital review boards, national committees, or some combination)?"

To facilitate that deliberation and ensure that the wide range of ethical issues are given due consideration, we have proposed a framework that incorporates both substantive and procedural ethical values and can be used to address pa-tient selection criteria for xenotransplant clinical trials.\n\nThe assessment of benefits and risks should ensure that a trial has significant social benefit to justify excess risks that are not justified by a compensatory potential benefit to patients. The transplant team should have a heightened sensitivity to the distributive and procedural justice concerns of psychosocial criteria used in transplant listing decisions. Efforts should be made to enhance the social support available to a patient, rather than using psychosocial criteria solely to determine the listing of potential candidates. Procuring informed and voluntary consent should represent a deliberative process that occurs over several days, with participation by a representative of the hospital's clinical ethics committee."

                            "There are many ethical considerations and regulatory aspects in xenotransplantation, particularly with respect to patient consent and autonomy. These issues were previously discussed in detail (Schuurman et al., 2020)(Hurst et al., 2021). Briefly, in patients with chronic liver failure who retain capacity to make their own medical decisions the issue of patient consent is straightforward. For patients who arrive to the hospital unconscious in fulminant hepatic failure, the current standard is to place them on the waiting list for an emergent human liver allotransplant. The current ethical framework for treating life-threatening emergencies differs substantially from non-emergency situations, in that informed consent is not required in order to treat. In a scenario where the pig liver xenotransplantation is a reasonable alternative, the clinician would be required to choose between placing the patient on the waiting list or proceeding with liver xenotransplantation with an informed consent obtained from the family and/or hospital's ethical committee."

                            "During the last years, progress has been made in survival and function of pig\u2010to\u2010non\u2010human primate organ xenotransplantation using organs from genetically modified pigs and immunosuppression regimens that are clinically acceptable. This, together with increased insights into a low risk of pig\u2010to\u2010human transmission of porcine endogenous retrovirus, has opened the perspective of starting with first\u2010in\u2010human trials with xenogeneic organs. The regulatory path to clinical development is complex. Unlike an organ from human donors, an organ from pigs, either genetically modified or wild\u2010type pigs, is considered a medicinal product for human use and hence is under regulatory oversight, in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration and in Europe by the national competent authorities of the member states as well as the European Medicines Agency. Related to the status of medicinal product, \"(current) good practices\" apply in the process of generating a xenogeneic organ through to the transplantation into a patient and life\u2010long follow\u2010up. In addition, guidances for xenotransplantation products and genetically modified organisms do apply as well. This commentary focuses on regulatory aspects of transplantation of organs from genetically modified pigs into humans, with the intention to facilitate the interactions between regulatory agencies and institutions (sponsors) in research and clinical development of these organs, to support the perspective of speeding up the process with a proper entry in clinical application, to fill an unmet medical need in patients with end\u2010stage organ disease."

The first clinical trials may aim to transplant genetically\u2010modified pig kidneys into adult humans. The impetus for beginning these first\u2010in\u2010human trials is the severe lack of deceased donor kidneys for transplantation and the number of patients with end\u2010stage renal disease currently on transplant waitlists, which in the USA approaches 100 000. The majority of patients on the kidney transplant waitlist receive continuous renal replacement therapy. In the United States, for patients on the kidney waitlist, the median wait\u2010time to receive a deceased human donor organ is approximately 4.5 years for patients aged 45\u201374, with a 5\u2010year mortality (or removal from the waitlist because of deteriorating health) of approximately 40%. XTx has the potential to reduce the kidney waitlist morbidity and mortality while improving quality of life. By focusing on scientific and psychosocial criteria, we present ethical considerations of certain inclusion and exclusion criteria for these first\u2010in\u2010human clinical trials that we suggest have not yet been fully explored."

                            "The ethical framework of xenotransplantation continues to evolve in response to societal reactions and public discourse surrounding early cases of xenotransplantation. These discussions highlighted tensions between scientific progress and societal ethical standards, underscoring the need for proactive public engagement to build trust and address normative judgments that influence societal acceptance and regulatory approaches to emerging biotechnologies [15]. The progression toward clinical xenotransplantation trials necessitates a patient selection process grounded in medical need, capacity to benefit, patient choice, and compliance to achieve ethically sound and scientifically valuable outcomes [16,17].\n\nOne of the most pressing ethical dilemmas in xenotransplantation is the selection of patients for clinical trials. Current recommendations prioritize critically ill patients who have exhausted all other therapeutic options. However, this approach has been criticized for its potential to produce unfavorable risk-benefit ratios, particularly for patients with complex medical conditions. Furthermore, concerns about justice and beneficence arise when considering acutely ill patients who may struggle to provide fully informed consent [19].\n\nIssues such as informed consent-particularly for minors-and the psychosocial impacts on patients and their families further complicate the discourse. Public perception adds another layer of difficulty, especially when determining whether adults or children should be prioritized in early clinical trials."

One such issue concerns defining the harm/benefit ratio in the context of the initial clinical attempts. It might also be difficult to institute an appropriate informed-consent procedure. The fact that the patients will have to be monitored for possible infectious diseases for an extended time, possibly for life, is another ethical concern.\n\nMoreover, there are a number of ethical issues with regards to society at large. The public health hazard posed by the possible transmission and activation of PERV created considerable public concern a few years ago. The public debate that took place also generated some emotionally colored skepticism towards xenotransplantation, in which it was argued that \"transplantation from animal to man will violate the order of nature\". Other objections were with regard to the safety of the future recipients: \"xenotransplantation will constitute experimentation on sick human beings\"."

These concerns are complicated by the existing confusion among patients regarding organ allocation systems, which xenotransplantation would further complicate <Paper corpusId=\"249734546\" paperTitle=\"(Boulet et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe psychological and social adaptation of xenotransplant recipients merits special consideration but has received less attention than technological development <Paper corpusId=\"269698591\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Pediatric xenotransplantation raises additional concerns about psychological burdens and organ sizing issues <Paper corpusId=\"273237447\" paperTitle=\"(Merlocco et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. As the field advances, addressing these psychological dimensions will be essential for comprehensive patient care.\n\nThe introduction of human DNA into animals at early developmental stages raises specific concerns about human cells potentially populating animal brains or germlines. The first scenario might confer morally relevant human traits to animals, while the second could lead to transmission of human genes if animals were accidentally released <Paper corpusId=\"58644768\" paperTitle=\"(Casal et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. These possibilities have prompted regulatory caution, including temporary suspension of funding by the US National Institutes of Health for chimeric xenotransplantation research.\n\nReligious and cultural perspectives add another layer of complexity. Concerns may arise particularly when certain animals, such as pigs, are used as organ sources in communities where these animals have specific cultural or religious significance <Paper corpusId=\"71697624\" paperTitle=\"(Yaakob et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. Addressing these cultural dimensions requires inclusive dialogue that respects diverse perspectives.\n\nUnlike many medical innovations, xenotransplantation raises ethical issues that have not been formally discussed or agreed upon in the public arena <Paper corpusId=\"28577007\" paperTitle=\"(Sim et al., 1999)\" isShortName></Paper>. The medical and scientific communities have a responsibility to provide sufficient information to enable informed public debate <Paper corpusId=\"28577007\" paperTitle=\"(Sim et al., 1999)\" isShortName></Paper>. This debate must balance the duty to protect broader community health against the need to explore novel medical solutions for patients with end-stage organ failure <Paper corpusId=\"267567406\" paperTitle=\"(Hawthorne, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAs advances in xenotransplantation continue, these broader societal and philosophical considerations require comprehensive ethical assessment involving all stakeholders, including the general public <Paper corpusId=\"267158980\" paperTitle=\"(Coelho, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"51611995\" paperTitle=\"(Loike et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. Finding an ethical balance between medical innovation and responsibility to both animals and humans remains a crucial challenge as the field moves toward clinical application <Paper corpusId=\"267567406\" paperTitle=\"(Hawthorne, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"262207976\" paperTitle=\"(Kwisda, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "the transplantation of tissue and organs between different species, and in particular the transplantation of animal tissue into humans.\" (http://www.dh.gov/ab/Archive/UKXIRA/DH_087869). The technology is being developed with the hope of providing a solution to the shortage of human organs for transplantation. However, several concerns have been put forward on the ethics, morality and safety of the technique. For example, it has been suggested that organs transplantation may raise \"emotional, personal identity issues\" for some people and this \"feeling\" might be heightened when non-human organs are transplanted into human beings (Sykes et al., 2003). Having animal organs or tissue in a human body is likely to raise \"physiological and psychological issues.\" (Hagelin, 2004). More importantly, the ethics of rearing animals with the sole purpose of harvesting their organs for transplantation needs to be examined (Sykes et al., 2003). This issue must be further ascertained from the Islamic perspective particularly when pigs are involved due to Islamic prohibition on the consumption of the animal.\n\nThe use of non-human organs further raises concerns on the interests of society at large. The transplantation of non-human organs into human beings exposes the recipient and society to the risks of virus transmission (Sykes et al., 2003). This may occur when the organ harvested from the animal contains an infectious virus and is transmitted to the human recipient who may then spread the virus to others (Hagelin, 2004)."

                            "In cases of xenotransplantation, when the donor and the recipient belong to different species, further issues arise, regarding (i) the unavoidable harms to the donor and (ii) the possible harms to the recipients. When the donor is a chimeric pig, designed to contain a percentage of human genes and cells, xenotransplantation provokes two opposing sets of reactions [5].\n\nFor some, the use of human-pig chimeras strengthens both recipient-based and donor-based objections, rendering xenotransplantation more objectionable or even impermissible. Many feel an aversion to such a deep transgression of the natural order, for reasons that may be theological, ecological, or involve human dignity, animal rights or fear of scientists yet again producing undesirable, unforeseen, and irreversible consequences. Others have more specific concerns. For example, the US National Institutes of Health suspended funding of their chimeric xenotransplantation program in 2015 over concerns about introducing human DNA into a member of another species, and particularly doing so at such an early developmental stage. As Carrie Wolinetz, Salz Institute's Associate Director for Science Policy, explains: 'people were concerned about human cells populating the brain of the animal or the germline of the animal' [6]. In the first case, the animal might acquire morally relevant human traits; in the second case, the animal might transmit human genes and traits to its offspring, for example, if accidentally released into the wild."

                            "Another fundamental challenge facing xenograft is ethical issues. Three ethical issues quickly come to mind when we talk of xenotransplantation: animal rights (effects on the donor animal), human rights (the impact on the human population and the impact on the individual recipient), and interference with nature. An animal rights issue arises because animals, like humans, also have rights to existence and should not be sacrificed in favor of humans (Cengiz et al., 2020). Human rights regarding the recipient can quickly be cleared by obtaining the necessary informed consent. Still, the populace also needs authorization because of the possibility of transferring new pathogens from animal to human populations -a public health risk (Abouna, 2003). The ethical issue of interference with nature may not be so applied. It may be understandable that by interfering with nature, man can free himself from the extinction effects of some natural phenomena [28]."

Recent findings Developments within xenotransplantation may soon allow for pig-to-human xenotransplantation to take place. Ethical analysis of xenotransplantation commonly follows an anthropocentric cost\u2013benefit analysis, which may imprecisely measure costs. Xenotransplantation should not merely be approached from an anthropocentric perspective. Rather, the potential risks presented to human and nonhuman donors, recipients, and third parties should all be thoroughly considered. Summary The range of feasible alternatives to xenotransplantation to increase organ supply should be examined before resorting to xenotransplantation because of the moral distinction between imposing certain risks on others before, or after, alternative solutions have been exhausted."

                            "Initial concerns centered on whether animal-to-human transplants violate the laws of nature and whether it is wrong to sacrifice animals as organ donors to humans. Some feared social injustice by lopsided distribution of scarce resources to a few at the expense of broader basic medical care for all. Critics wondered whether xenotransplantation would endanger public health (Vanderpool, 1998). Other pressing questions touched on prerequisites for clinical trials: identifying acceptable risk-benefit thresholds and clinically defining success (extra days versus extra weeks or months of life, for example). Some questioned whether informed consent should be obtained from close contacts of the patient and medical personnel involved in the recipient's care, given concerns about zoonotic infection. It was argued that informed consent from recipients should include a broader set of risks including public attention, risk of transmitting disease and isolation. A final set of questions touched on who is responsible for oversight of clinical trials in xenotransplantation (local hospital review boards, national committees, or some combination)?"

(Cengiz et al., 2020) The welfare of animals being bred in laboratories with living conditions that significantly differ from their usual environments will need to be defined. (1998) Other challenges include the fairness of resource allocation and distributive justice, in an era when there is already much confusion in patients with respect to the current organ allocation system.\n\nAnother major aspect will be appropriately educating clinicians and patients, particularly with respect to the challenge of obtaining well-informed consent in an area with a high degree of uncertainty. These considerable ethical, social, and legal challenges will require careful consideration and discourse in a manner concurrent with scientific advances in the field."

                            "One ethical concern intrinsic to xenotransplantation relates to the potential for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans, a phenomenon known as xenozoonosis. The concept of transmission although theoretical is not unfounded, as various pathogens, including retroviruses, have been identified in pigs could be potential threats in immunocompromised transplant recipients and then theoretically spread to direct close contacts and the broader community (24,(Groenendaal et al., 2023)",
                            "The duty to protect the broader community and prevent the spread of theoretically potential infectious diseases must be weighed against the need to explore novel medical solutions to help these patients suffering from end stage organ failure and other diseases (Hawthorne et al., 2022)",
                            "From a patient and community perspective it is therefore essential for the patients, their family and immediate direct contacts along with the community to understand that if there were in fact a positive case of transmission of a xenozoonosis into a xenotransplant patient that there may well be serious implications to all involved. These implications are potentially as severe as lifelong restriction and quarantine of the recipient and may extend to their direct close contacts (25).\n\nXenotransplantation challenges the traditional conceptual boundaries that separate humans from animals. It poses profound philosophical and ethical questions about the nature of different species and the moral obligation we owe to different species. As we engage in practices that involve genetic modification and the use of animals for human benefit, the ethical boundaries are changing with increasing pressure on ethics committees and legislators to keep track with the pace of change, and we have a moral imperative to ensure that we do keep pace and provide adequate oversight (6).\n\nSome ethicists argue that xenotransplantation exemplifies the Anthropocentric approach (38), emphasizing human interests over those of animals, while others advocate for a more inclusive biocentric perspective that values all forms of life equally (39). The challenge is to find a balance between medical innovation and ethical responsibility to both animal and man (6)."

A fundamental challenge is the absence of specific legislation governing xenotransplantation, which necessitates evolution of regulatory frameworks to enhance research protocols and future clinical applications <Paper corpusId=\"268641927\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al._1, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This regulatory gap is particularly concerning given that oversight responsibilities for xenotransplantation clinical trials remain unclear, with questions about whether local hospital review boards, national committees, or some combination should have authority <Paper corpusId=\"248635370\" paperTitle=\"(Bayliss, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nExperts emphasize that before any clinical trials are approved, a legally binding regulatory framework and mechanism should be established to control the safety and quality of animal organs <Paper corpusId=\"252891241\" paperTitle=\"(Zhai, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. These frameworks must address the unique nature of xenotransplantation as a medical technology that poses risks not only to individual patients but potentially to public health more broadly <Paper corpusId=\"34061863\" paperTitle=\"(Kaiser, 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>. Unlike conventional medical technologies that typically require assessment when ready for clinical use, xenotransplantation demands proactive regulatory action at a very early stage of development <Paper corpusId=\"34061863\" paperTitle=\"(Kaiser, 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nInternational coordination represents another critical regulatory challenge. The cross-border implications of xenotransplantation necessitate agreements to cover scenarios where recipients might receive initial treatment in one jurisdiction but move to another <Paper corpusId=\"265121285\" paperTitle=\"(Thom et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Experts have called for international guidelines, compatible information technology, and standardized reporting norms to prevent the transfer of pathogens from source animals to humans <Paper corpusId=\"260047382\" paperTitle=\"(Ku, 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>. Questions remain about who should bear the costs for these international initiatives and public health safety mechanisms <Paper corpusId=\"260047382\" paperTitle=\"(Ku, 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe composition of regulatory bodies is also critical. Ethics review committees should include specialized and competent scientific, medical, ethical, and related disciplinary experts capable of conducting in-depth analysis of the ethical, social, and philosophical issues arising from xenotransplantation <Paper corpusId=\"252891241\" paperTitle=\"(Zhai, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This multidisciplinary approach is essential for addressing the complex ethical considerations that continue to evolve in response to societal reactions and public discourse surrounding early xenotransplantation cases <Paper corpusId=\"276610974\" paperTitle=\"(Shirini et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent pilot xenotransplantation trials have highlighted various medicolegal considerations, including adherence to established guidelines such as the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act and the dead-donor rule <Paper corpusId=\"268641927\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al._1, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"246137465\" paperTitle=\"(Porrett et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"248860025\" paperTitle=\"(Montgomery et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Some experts recommend that consent should represent a deliberative process occurring over several days, with participation by representatives from clinical ethics committees <Paper corpusId=\"252874917\" paperTitle=\"(Silverman et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Questions persist about whether informed consent should be obtained not only from recipients but also from close contacts and medical personnel, given concerns about zoonotic infection <Paper corpusId=\"248635370\" paperTitle=\"(Bayliss, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPatient selection criteria for clinical trials present another regulatory challenge. Current recommendations often prioritize critically ill patients who have exhausted other therapeutic options, but this approach has been criticized for potentially unfavorable risk-benefit ratios <Paper corpusId=\"276610974\" paperTitle=\"(Shirini et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. Regulatory frameworks must balance ensuring significant social benefit to justify excess risks while maintaining sensitivity to distributive and procedural justice concerns <Paper corpusId=\"252874917\" paperTitle=\"(Silverman et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe monitoring requirements imposed on xenotransplantation recipients, their close contacts, and clinical personnel represent a significant regulatory burden that must be carefully structured to protect both individual and public health <Paper corpusId=\"265121285\" paperTitle=\"(Thom et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. These monitoring protocols constitute an essential component of risk assessment, risk management, and risk prevention as public health tools <Paper corpusId=\"260047382\" paperTitle=\"(Ku, 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAs the field advances toward clinical application, these regulatory and governance challenges must be addressed through continued research, dialogue, and education <Paper corpusId=\"268641927\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al._1, 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"271513704\" paperTitle=\"(Thuan et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The pilot xenotransplantation trials have underscored various ethical and medicolegal considerations inherent in xenotransplantation research (Porrett et al., 2022)(Montgomery et al., 2022). In these studies, brain-dead decedents were precluded from organ donation, and obtaining proper informed consent from their families was deemed essential. Notably, the absence of specific legislation governing xenotransplantation necessitates evolution of the regulatory frameworks to enhance research protocols and future clinical applications. Consultation with ethics committees is imperative to ensure adherence to established guidelines such as the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA) and the dead-donor rule, while also acknowledging the cultural and religious nuances surrounding organ transplantation (30). Public acceptance and ethical considerations remain integral to the advancement and clinical application of xenotransplantation, highlighting the need for continued research, dialogue, and education in this evolving field."

                            "Initial concerns centered on whether animal-to-human transplants violate the laws of nature and whether it is wrong to sacrifice animals as organ donors to humans. Some feared social injustice by lopsided distribution of scarce resources to a few at the expense of broader basic medical care for all. Critics wondered whether xenotransplantation would endanger public health (Vanderpool, 1998). Other pressing questions touched on prerequisites for clinical trials: identifying acceptable risk-benefit thresholds and clinically defining success (extra days versus extra weeks or months of life, for example). Some questioned whether informed consent should be obtained from close contacts of the patient and medical personnel involved in the recipient's care, given concerns about zoonotic infection. It was argued that informed consent from recipients should include a broader set of risks including public attention, risk of transmitting disease and isolation. A final set of questions touched on who is responsible for oversight of clinical trials in xenotransplantation (local hospital review boards, national committees, or some combination)?"

(ii) while most medical technologies demand assessment and risk-management at the time when the technology is sufficiently developed to be put into practice, xenotransplantation demands pro-active action at a very early stage of development.

This technology implies many unsolved practical and ethical problems.\nThe article summarizes those issues in xenotransplantation which require international efforts with special emphasis on safety regulations to prevent the transfer of pathogens from source animals to humans.\nThe most important result is the call for international guidelines, norms for reporting and compatible information technology. Means of risk assessment, risk management and risk prevention are necessary as public health tools to reduce or eliminate the risk of infection.\nThese are questions raised by patient monitoring and the implementation of archives, for example, or the economic aspects of xenotransplantation and the question of who is to bear the costs for international initiatives and public health safety mechanisms.\nThe article discusses the medical and ethical problems involved in weighing chances and risks are classified and discussed."

                            "The ethical framework of xenotransplantation continues to evolve in response to societal reactions and public discourse surrounding early cases of xenotransplantation. These discussions highlighted tensions between scientific progress and societal ethical standards, underscoring the need for proactive public engagement to build trust and address normative judgments that influence societal acceptance and regulatory approaches to emerging biotechnologies [15]. The progression toward clinical xenotransplantation trials necessitates a patient selection process grounded in medical need, capacity to benefit, patient choice, and compliance to achieve ethically sound and scientifically valuable outcomes [16,17].\n\nOne of the most pressing ethical dilemmas in xenotransplantation is the selection of patients for clinical trials. Current recommendations prioritize critically ill patients who have exhausted all other therapeutic options. However, this approach has been criticized for its potential to produce unfavorable risk-benefit ratios, particularly for patients with complex medical conditions. Furthermore, concerns about justice and beneficence arise when considering acutely ill patients who may struggle to provide fully informed consent [19].\n\nIssues such as informed consent-particularly for minors-and the psychosocial impacts on patients and their families further complicate the discourse. Public perception adds another layer of difficulty, especially when determining whether adults or children should be prioritized in early clinical trials."

                            "A radical solution is needed for the organ supply crisis, and the domestic pig is a promising organ source. In preparation for a clinical trial of xenotransplantation, we developed an in vivo pre\u2010clinical human model to test safety and feasibility tenets established in animal models. After performance of a novel, prospective compatible crossmatch, we performed bilateral native nephrectomies in a human brain\u2010dead decedent and subsequently transplanted two kidneys from a pig genetically engineered for human xenotransplantation. The decedent was hemodynamically stable through reperfusion, and vascular integrity was maintained despite the exposure of the xenografts to human blood pressure. No hyperacute rejection was observed, and the kidneys remained viable until termination 74 h later. No chimerism or transmission of porcine retroviruses was detected. Longitudinal biopsies revealed thrombotic microangiopathy that did not progress in severity, without evidence of cellular rejection or deposition of antibody or complement proteins. Although the xenografts produced variable amounts of urine, creatinine clearance did not recover. Whether renal recovery was impacted by the milieu of brain death and/or microvascular injury remains unknown. In summary, our study suggests that major barriers to human xenotransplantation have been surmounted and identifies where new knowledge is needed to optimize xenotransplantation outcomes in humans."

                            "BACKGROUND\nXenografts from genetically modified pigs have become one of the most promising solutions to the dearth of human organs available for transplantation. The challenge in this model has been hyperacute rejection. To avoid this, pigs have been bred with a knockout of the alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene and with subcapsular autologous thymic tissue.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe transplanted kidneys from these genetically modified pigs into two brain-dead human recipients whose circulatory and respiratory activity was maintained on ventilators for the duration of the study. We performed serial biopsies and monitored the urine output and kinetic estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to assess renal function and xenograft rejection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe xenograft in both recipients began to make urine within moments after reperfusion. Over the 54-hour study, the kinetic eGFR increased from 23 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area before transplantation to 62 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 after transplantation in Recipient 1 and from 55 to 109 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 in Recipient 2. In both recipients, the creatinine level, which had been at a steady state, decreased after implantation of the xenograft, from 1.97 to 0.82 mg per deciliter in Recipient 1 and from 1.10 to 0.57 mg per deciliter in Recipient 2. The transplanted kidneys remained pink and well-perfused, continuing to make urine throughout the study. Biopsies that were performed at 6, 24, 48, and 54 hours revealed no signs of hyperacute or antibody-mediated rejection. Hourly urine output with the xenograft was more than double the output with the native kidneys.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGenetically modified kidney xenografts from pigs remained viable and functioning in brain-dead human recipients for 54 hours, without signs of hyperacute rejection.

                            "We have been testing genetically engineered (GE) pig hearts and optimizing immunosuppression (IS) in non\u2010human primates (NHPs) since 2005. We demonstrate how we translated this preclinical investigation into a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2010approved clinical cardiac xenotransplantation. First, genetically engineered (GE) pig hearts were transplanted into the abdomen of NHP along with IS, which included anti\u2010CD20 and anti\u2010CD40\u2010based co\u2010stimulation blockade antibodies. We reported 945 days of survival of three gene GE pig hearts in NHPs. Building on this proof\u2010of\u2010concept, we tested 3\u201310 gene\u2010modified GE pig hearts (in order to improve the immunocompatibility of the xenograft further) in a life\u2010supporting orthotopic model, but had limited success due to perioperative cardiac xenograft dysfunction (PCXD). With novel non\u2010ischemic continuous perfusion preservation (NICP), using the XVIVO Heart solution (XHS), life\u2010supporting survival was extended to 9 months. We approached the FDA under an application for \"Expanded Access\" (EA), to transplant a GE pig heart in a patient with end\u2010stage non\u2010ischemic cardiomyopathy. He was without other therapeutic options and dependent on VA\u2010ECMO. A team of FDA reviewers reviewed our preclinical research experience and data and allowed us to proceed. This clinical cardiac xenotransplantation was performed, and the patient survived for 60 days, demonstrating the translational preclinical investigation of cardiac xenotransplantation from bench to bedside. The ultimate etiology of graft failure is currently a topic of investigation and lessons learned will progress the field forward."

                            "The ethical issues with participation in high-risk research involving xenotransplantation are unique and require careful deliberation among the transplant investigators, psychosocial providers, psychiatrists, and ethicists. To facilitate that deliberation and ensure that the wide range of ethical issues are given due consideration, we have proposed a framework that incorporates both substantive and procedural ethical values and can be used to address pa-tient selection criteria for xenotransplant clinical trials.\n\nThe assessment of benefits and risks should ensure that a trial has significant social benefit to justify excess risks that are not justified by a compensatory potential benefit to patients. The transplant team should have a heightened sensitivity to the distributive and procedural justice concerns of psychosocial criteria used in transplant listing decisions. Efforts should be made to enhance the social support available to a patient, rather than using psychosocial criteria solely to determine the listing of potential candidates. Procuring informed and voluntary consent should represent a deliberative process that occurs over several days, with participation by a representative of the hospital's clinical ethics committee."
