With an increase in life expectancy, it has been reported that diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, stroke and brain tumors, along with neuropsychological disorders, are also being reported at an alarmingly high rate. Despite various therapeutic methods for treating brain disorders, drug delivery to the brain has been challenging because of a very complex Blood Brain Barrier, which precludes most drugs from entering the brain in effective concentrations. Nano-carrier-based drug delivery systems have been reported widely by researchers to overcome this barrier layer. These systems due to their small size, offer numerous advantages; however, their short residence time in the body owing to opsonization hinders their success in vivo. This review article focuses on the various aspects of modifying the surfaces of these nano-carriers with polymers, surfactants, protein, antibodies, cell-penetrating peptides, integrin binding peptides and glycoproteins such as transferrin & lactoferrin leading to enhanced residence time, desirable characteristics such as the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), increased bioavailability in regions of the brain and targeted drug delivery.",

                    "text": "Due to BBB, central nervous system disorders are one of the major challenges to treat pharmacologically. Therefore, there is a need to develop novel drug delivery strategies. Hence, surface-modification of nanoparticles are gaining attention and emerging to be a useful approach to overcome the drawbacks faced by conventional nanoparticles not only for neurodegenerative disorders but also for another life-threatening disease. Through surface modification, delivery of poor water-soluble molecules and macromolecular have been made possible without affecting the integrity of loaded drug molecules. Surface modification leads to the generation of desirable characteristics to the nanoparticles, which ease the delivery process, such as crossing BBB in case of brain drug delivery, resulting in more biocompatibility, enhanced drug release and targeted delivery. Various surface modifica-tion methods result in mucoadhesive NPs, mucus penetrating NPs, protein conjugated, and antibody-conjugated nanoparticles. Other approaches have been applied for targeted delivery, such as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), transferrin, lactoferrin and integrin-targeting ligands. CPPs being small and positively charged, are quite favorable for transportation across BBB. Whereas, transferrin and lactoferrin possess unique physiological and biological characteristics, which implies that these can be used in conjugation with the developed nanoparticles for more effective and targeted delivery, especially in the brain region of the affected individual where transferrin and lactoferrin receptors are expressed abundantly. Hence, targeted drug delivery systems could be considered the most promising strategy to deliver across BBB and the brain. \n\nDespite the huge potential of nanocarriers and surfacemodified nanoformulations on drug delivery and treatment of diseases, there are several challenges like in vivo stability, biocompatibility, scale-up of formulations etc. which restrict the clinical translation and commercialization of these nanocarriers and this aspect needs to be addressed and resolved. Some of the basic concerns that need to be addressed are given to signify the superiority of the developed nanomedicines and facilitate the data necessary for further development of a therapeutic product:",

Dang\n## Abstract\nBrain disorders are a prevalent and rapidly growing problem in the medical field as they adversely affect the quality of life of a human. With an increase in life expectancy, it has been reported that diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, stroke and brain tumors, along with neuropsychological disorders, are also being reported at an alarmingly high rate. Despite various therapeutic methods for treating brain disorders, drug delivery to the brain has been challenging because of a very complex Blood Brain Barrier, which precludes most drugs from entering the brain in effective concentrations. Nano-carrier-based drug delivery systems have been reported widely by researchers to overcome this barrier layer. These systems due to their small size, offer numerous advantages; however, their short residence time in the body owing to opsonization hinders their success in vivo. This review article focuses on the various aspects of modifying the surfaces of these nano-carriers with polymers, surfactants, protein, antibodies, cell-penetrating peptides, integrin binding peptides and glycoproteins such as transferrin & lactoferrin leading to enhanced residence time, desirable characteristics such as the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), increased bioavailability in regions of the brain and targeted drug delivery.\n## CONCLUSION & FUTURE PROSPECTS\nDue to BBB, central nervous system disorders are one of the major challenges to treat pharmacologically. Therefore, there is a need to develop novel drug delivery strategies. Hence, surface-modification of nanoparticles are gaining attention and emerging to be a useful approach to overcome the drawbacks faced by conventional nanoparticles not only for neurodegenerative disorders but also for another life-threatening disease. Through surface modification, delivery of poor water-soluble molecules and macromolecular have been made possible without affecting the integrity of loaded drug molecules. Surface modification leads to the generation of desirable characteristics to the nanoparticles, which ease the delivery process, such as crossing BBB in case of brain drug delivery, resulting in more biocompatibility, enhanced drug release and targeted delivery. Various surface modifica-tion methods result in mucoadhesive NPs, mucus penetrating NPs, protein conjugated, and antibody-conjugated nanoparticles. Other approaches have been applied for targeted delivery, such as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), transferrin, lactoferrin and integrin-targeting ligands. CPPs being small and positively charged, are quite favorable for transportation across BBB. Whereas, transferrin and lactoferrin possess unique physiological and biological characteristics, which implies that these can be used in conjugation with the developed nanoparticles for more effective and targeted delivery, especially in the brain region of the affected individual where transferrin and lactoferrin receptors are expressed abundantly. Hence, targeted drug delivery systems could be considered the most promising strategy to deliver across BBB and the brain. \n\nDespite the huge potential of nanocarriers and surfacemodified nanoformulations on drug delivery and treatment of diseases, there are several challenges like in vivo stability, biocompatibility, scale-up of formulations etc. which restrict the clinical translation and commercialization of these nanocarriers and this aspect needs to be addressed and resolved. Some of the basic concerns that need to be addressed are given to signify the superiority of the developed nanomedicines and facilitate the data necessary for further development of a therapeutic product:",

Elevated blood pressure, initiated and maintained by the brain, is defined as neurogenic hypertension (NH), which accounts for nearly half of all hypertension cases. A significant increase in angiotensin II-mediated sympathetic nervous system activity within the brain is known to be the key driving force behind NH. Blood pressure control in NH has been demonstrated through intracerebrovascular injection of agents that reduce the sympathetic influence on cardiac functions. However, traditional antihypertensive agents lack effective brain permeation, making NH management extremely challenging. Therefore, developing strategies that allow brain-targeted delivery of antihypertensives at the therapeutic level is crucial. Targeting nanotherapeutics have become popular in delivering therapeutics to hard-to-reach regions of the body, including the brain. Despite the frequent use of nanotherapeutics in other pathological conditions such as cancer, their use in hypertension has received very little attention. This review discusses the underlying pathophysiology and current management strategies for NH, as well as the potential role of targeted therapeutics in improving current treatment strategies.",

[215], surface functionalization of PLGA nanoparticles with Polysorbate 80 facilitated crossing the bloodbrain barrier.Their study reported a higher brain concentration of the neuroprotective agent Bacoside-A reaching 23.94 \u00b1 1.74 \u00b5g/g tissue, which was over ten times the pure drug-solution concentration in the brain.In a separate study by Rodriguez et al. [22], surface functionalization of liposomes with transferrin and a cell-penetrating peptide was sufficient to improve the brain permeability of liposomes in mice after a single i.v.administration.They observed the sufficient transport of dual functionalized liposomes in an in vitro BBB model and mice.In both of these studies, improvement in drug accumulation in the brain was attributed to surface functionalization.Surface functionalization can also improve the pharmacokinetic profile of the nanocarrier [216,217].The numerous successful demonstrations of surface modification prove its suitability in enhancing brain delivery of therapeutics.Given that specific regions within the brain either promote or inhibit NH, it is also crucial that nanotherapeutics be functionalized with just the proper ligand to ensure it is directed towards the right structures.",

Lamptey, Chengwen Sun, Buddhadev Layek, Jagdish Singh\n## Abstract\nHypertension is a major health concern globally. Elevated blood pressure, initiated and maintained by the brain, is defined as neurogenic hypertension (NH), which accounts for nearly half of all hypertension cases. A significant increase in angiotensin II-mediated sympathetic nervous system activity within the brain is known to be the key driving force behind NH. Blood pressure control in NH has been demonstrated through intracerebrovascular injection of agents that reduce the sympathetic influence on cardiac functions. However, traditional antihypertensive agents lack effective brain permeation, making NH management extremely challenging. Therefore, developing strategies that allow brain-targeted delivery of antihypertensives at the therapeutic level is crucial. Targeting nanotherapeutics have become popular in delivering therapeutics to hard-to-reach regions of the body, including the brain. Despite the frequent use of nanotherapeutics in other pathological conditions such as cancer, their use in hypertension has received very little attention. This review discusses the underlying pathophysiology and current management strategies for NH, as well as the potential role of targeted therapeutics in improving current treatment strategies.\n## Surface Functionalization of Nanotherapeutics\nA better understanding of their physicochemical characteristics is essential to improve nanotherapeutics performance.Previously, one major backlash to nanotherapeutics was their inability to deliver therapeutics at the desired site.The improvements in nanotechnology have provided strategies to ensure that cargo ferried by nanotherapeutics is released at the desired sites.A typical approach is the surface functionalization of nanocarriers with molecules that favor a biased uptake of nanotherapeutics into certain specific cells/tissues.Since its inception, surface functionalization has gained traction as an appealing way to improve the brain permeability of drug molecules.In a study by Jose et al. [215], surface functionalization of PLGA nanoparticles with Polysorbate 80 facilitated crossing the bloodbrain barrier.Their study reported a higher brain concentration of the neuroprotective agent Bacoside-A reaching 23.94 \u00b1 1.74 \u00b5g/g tissue, which was over ten times the pure drug-solution concentration in the brain.In a separate study by Rodriguez et al. [22], surface functionalization of liposomes with transferrin and a cell-penetrating peptide was sufficient to improve the brain permeability of liposomes in mice after a single i.v.administration.They observed the sufficient transport of dual functionalized liposomes in an in vitro BBB model and mice.In both of these studies, improvement in drug accumulation in the brain was attributed to surface functionalization.Surface functionalization can also improve the pharmacokinetic profile of the nanocarrier [216,217].The numerous successful demonstrations of surface modification prove its suitability in enhancing brain delivery of therapeutics.Given that specific regions within the brain either promote or inhibit NH, it is also crucial that nanotherapeutics be functionalized with just the proper ligand to ensure it is directed towards the right structures.",

However, poor biocompatibility of INOPs limits their application. To improve the shortcomings, various surface modifications have been developed, including small molecules coatings, polymers coatings, lipid coatings and lipopolymer coatings. These surface modifications facilitate iron nanoparticles to cross the blood-brain-barrier, which is essential for diagnosis and treatments of brain diseases. Here we focus on the characteristics of different coated INOPs and their application in brain disease, particularly gliomas, Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Moreover, we summarize the current progress and expect to provide help for future researches.\n",

However, the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) often prevents drugs intended for CNS diseases from effectively crossing into the brain parenchyma to deliver their therapeutic effects. The blood\u2013brain barrier is a semi-permeable barrier with high selectivity. The BBB primarily manages the transport of substances between the blood and the CNS. To enhance drug delivery for CNS disease treatment, various brain-based drug delivery strategies overcoming the BBB have been developed. Among them, nanoparticles (NPs) have been emphasized due to their multiple excellent properties. This review starts with an overview of the BBB\u2019s anatomical structure and physiological roles, and then explores the mechanisms, both endogenous and exogenous, that facilitate the NP passage across the BBB. The text also delves into how nanoparticles' shape, charge, size, and surface ligands affect their ability to cross the BBB and offers an overview of different nanoparticle classifications. This review concludes with an examination of the current challenges in utilizing nanomaterials for brain drug delivery and discusses corresponding directions for solutions.

            "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) are a major global public health concern and a leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years, moreover, therapeutic options are limited. Brain targeting has always been challenging due to the presence of various physiological barriers, of which one of the most robust barriers is Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). The BBB consists of endothelial cells which are the tight layers surrounded by astrocyte foot processes, and these anatomic features together constitute a significant barrier that hampers the delivery of drugs to the central nervous system (CNS). In the past few decades, the nose-to-brain targeted delivery has received a great deal of attention because of factors like the rapid onset of action, increased bioavailability, manageable surface area and avoids the first-pass metabolism, thus considering it as a non-invasive, convenient and reliable approach that may overcome the challenges associated with nose-to-brain targeted delivery. However, this strategy still possesses significant limitations, which led to the development of nanotechnological approaches like solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, liposomes and polymeric micelles, thus circumventing these barriers. The present review article highlights a complete understanding of every aspect related to nose-to-brain delivery: mechanism involved in the transport of drugs from noseto-brain via BBB by complex pathways, strategies to overcome the barrier-BBB, recent examples, and applications of nose-to-brain targeted delivery using nanotechnologies for brain gliomas and other neurological disorders.",

                    "text": "Polymeric nanoparticles are colloidal systems which have an ability to load drugs in solid-state or solutions, chemical grafting on the surface or noncovalent adsorption. Polymeric nanoparticles being less rigid and less dense, enables them to encapsulate a wide variety of therapeutic agents including chemotherapeutic drugs, proteins, nucleic acids, and contrast agents. Polymer-based delivery systems offer a number of advantages such as low toxicity of degradation products, biocompatibility, enhanced absorption, sustained release compatibility, ease of production, and localized drug delivery. Biocompatibility and rapid biodegradability of the applied polymer are considered major advantages in transporting nanoparticles in brain delivery systems [28]. Nanoparticle surface modification with adsorption or chemical-linking of polyethylene glycol (PEG), or with targeting ligands can provide an optimal way to prolong their circulation time and facilitate drug delivery across the BBB. Several studies report that PEGylated nanoparticles cross the BBB more efficiently than other nanoparticles with various other surface modifications, although the mechanism of BBB penetration by PEGylated nanoparticles is not clear. The major obstacle encountered in the use of polymeric nanoparticles is the interaction between the carrier and the reticuloendothelial system (RES), thereby exhibiting a rapid clearance from blood circulation. Therefore, lipid nanoparticles propose an alternative strategy for drug delivery to the brain [29].",

Ezhilarasi, Sereena Saju\n## Abstract\nNeurodegenerative diseases (NDD) are a major global public health concern and a leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years, moreover, therapeutic options are limited. Brain targeting has always been challenging due to the presence of various physiological barriers, of which one of the most robust barriers is Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). The BBB consists of endothelial cells which are the tight layers surrounded by astrocyte foot processes, and these anatomic features together constitute a significant barrier that hampers the delivery of drugs to the central nervous system (CNS). In the past few decades, the nose-to-brain targeted delivery has received a great deal of attention because of factors like the rapid onset of action, increased bioavailability, manageable surface area and avoids the first-pass metabolism, thus considering it as a non-invasive, convenient and reliable approach that may overcome the challenges associated with nose-to-brain targeted delivery. However, this strategy still possesses significant limitations, which led to the development of nanotechnological approaches like solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, liposomes and polymeric micelles, thus circumventing these barriers. The present review article highlights a complete understanding of every aspect related to nose-to-brain delivery: mechanism involved in the transport of drugs from noseto-brain via BBB by complex pathways, strategies to overcome the barrier-BBB, recent examples, and applications of nose-to-brain targeted delivery using nanotechnologies for brain gliomas and other neurological disorders.\n## Polymeric Nanoparticles\nPolymeric nanoparticles are colloidal systems which have an ability to load drugs in solid-state or solutions, chemical grafting on the surface or noncovalent adsorption. Polymeric nanoparticles being less rigid and less dense, enables them to encapsulate a wide variety of therapeutic agents including chemotherapeutic drugs, proteins, nucleic acids, and contrast agents. Polymer-based delivery systems offer a number of advantages such as low toxicity of degradation products, biocompatibility, enhanced absorption, sustained release compatibility, ease of production, and localized drug delivery. Biocompatibility and rapid biodegradability of the applied polymer are considered major advantages in transporting nanoparticles in brain delivery systems [28]. Nanoparticle surface modification with adsorption or chemical-linking of polyethylene glycol (PEG), or with targeting ligands can provide an optimal way to prolong their circulation time and facilitate drug delivery across the BBB. Several studies report that PEGylated nanoparticles cross the BBB more efficiently than other nanoparticles with various other surface modifications, although the mechanism of BBB penetration by PEGylated nanoparticles is not clear. The major obstacle encountered in the use of polymeric nanoparticles is the interaction between the carrier and the reticuloendothelial system (RES), thereby exhibiting a rapid clearance from blood circulation. Therefore, lipid nanoparticles propose an alternative strategy for drug delivery to the brain [29].",

Tan, Jialiu Zeng, Chih Hung Lo\n## Abstract\nOvercoming the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) remains a significant hurdle in effective drug delivery to the brain. While the BBB serves as a crucial protective barrier, it poses challenges in delivering therapeutic agents to their intended targets within the brain parenchyma. To enhance drug delivery for the treatment of neurological diseases, several delivery technologies to circumvent the BBB have been developed in the last few years. Among them, nanoparticles (NPs) are one of the most versatile and promising tools. Here, we summarize the characteristics of NPs that facilitate BBB penetration, including their size, shape, chemical composition, surface charge, and importantly, their conjugation with various biological or synthetic molecules such as glucose, transferrin, insulin, polyethylene glycol, peptides, and aptamers. Additionally, we discuss the coating of NPs with surfactants. A comprehensive overview of the common in vitro and in vivo models of the BBB for NP penetration studies is also provided. The discussion extends to discussing BBB impairment under pathological conditions and leveraging BBB alterations under pathological conditions to enhance drug delivery. Emphasizing the need for future studies to uncover the inherent therapeutic properties of NPs, the review advocates for their role beyond delivery systems and calls for efforts translating NPs to the clinic as therapeutics. Overall, NPs stand out as a highly promising therapeutic strategy for precise BBB targeting and drug delivery in neurological disorders.\n",

There are primarily two methods for active targeting modifications: one involves the direct modification by covalently bonding ligands to drug carriers with active functional groups; 97 the other uses an indirect modification method where positively charged ligands are inserted into the membrane, 98 as shown in Figure 3D. \n\nLi et al 99 modified poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers with transferrin and tamoxifen for the treatment of gliomas. The transferrin ligand enables the drug delivery system to cross the blood-brain barrier, while the tamoxifen ligand, targeting modifications, allows the delivery system to further accumulate in the tumor region once inside the brain. This dual-targeting approach not only improves drug efficacy but also reduces toxicity to normal cells, as depicted in Figure 3E.

In contrast, the application of nanocarriers primarily utilizes receptor-mediated transport and adsorption-mediated transport under electric charge, constituting saturated transport methods to breach the BBB. 94 For example, Sun et al 95 developed butyl cyanoacrylate nanoparticles coated with Polysorbate-80, leveraging the surfactant's adsorption of apolipoproteins for tight binding with apolipoprotein receptors on the BBB. Similarly, Lu et al 96 found that cationized bovine serum albumin nanoparticles exhibited an eightfold increase in BBB permeability compared to their non-cationized counterparts, as depicted in Figure 3B.\n\n## Surface Modification Techniques\nNanocarrier surfaces can be modified through adsorption or covalent attachment of ligands, altering their surface charge, aggregation potential, hydrophilicity, and fluidity. These modifications enhance the targeting of particles to specific cells, 1478 increasing cellular uptake and, consequently, drug efficacy, as illustrated in Figure 3C. There are primarily two methods for active targeting modifications: one involves the direct modification by covalently bonding ligands to drug carriers with active functional groups; 97 the other uses an indirect modification method where positively charged ligands are inserted into the membrane, 98 as shown in Figure 3D. \n\nLi et al 99 modified poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers with transferrin and tamoxifen for the treatment of gliomas. The transferrin ligand enables the drug delivery system to cross the blood-brain barrier, while the tamoxifen ligand, targeting modifications, allows the delivery system to further accumulate in the tumor region once inside the brain. This dual-targeting approach not only improves drug efficacy but also reduces toxicity to normal cells, as depicted in Figure 3E. Zhao et al 100 designed dendritic poly-L-lysine (DGL) nanoparticles modified with placental-like chondroitin sulfate A-binding peptides (plCSA-BP) to deliver HDZK-BYSB107 and Lingzhi red pigment (DGL/CSA-PNPs). The plCSA-BP specifically binds to chondroitin sulfate A, highly expressed in the trophoblast of the placenta, enabling DGL/CSA-PNPs to accumulate in choriocarcinoma tissues, thereby achieving effective tumor suppression.",

In research -coated magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4@CMC) demonstrate promise for BBB-crossing drug delivery, with proven biocompatibility and controlled release capabilities. In this research, magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4) are coated with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). The CMC coating provides biocompatibility, stability, and functionalization sites for drug loading. This combination aims to enhance the nanoparticles' ability to cross the blood-brain barrier for targeted drug delivery. Their hydrophilic CMC coating prevents agglomeration, enhances dispersion, and facilitates functionalization for targeted therapy, potentially minimizing neurological treatment side effects. These cost-effective, biodegradable nanoparticles offer a targeted approach for efficient brain drug delivery, highlighting their significance in neurotherapeutics [33]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), particularly when surface-modified (i.e., PEG), offer a promising platform for drug delivery [60,74]. \n\nA diagnostic probe utilizing DNA-modified AuNPs has been developed to detect amyloid-derived diffusible ligands, highlighting their potential in diagnostics [73].

Samadi kafil\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Inorganic nanoparticles (NPs)\nThe fine-tuning of their size, shape, and porosity allows for their specialized application in both therapeutic and diagnostic processes for brain disorders. The use of magnetic fields and near-infrared (NIR) radiation with these nanoparticles facilitates improved imaging techniques and the controlled release of drugs across the BBB on demand (Fig. 7(a-c)) [73]. In research -coated magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4@CMC) demonstrate promise for BBB-crossing drug delivery, with proven biocompatibility and controlled release capabilities. In this research, magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4) are coated with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). The CMC coating provides biocompatibility, stability, and functionalization sites for drug loading. This combination aims to enhance the nanoparticles' ability to cross the blood-brain barrier for targeted drug delivery. Their hydrophilic CMC coating prevents agglomeration, enhances dispersion, and facilitates functionalization for targeted therapy, potentially minimizing neurological treatment side effects. These cost-effective, biodegradable nanoparticles offer a targeted approach for efficient brain drug delivery, highlighting their significance in neurotherapeutics [33]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), particularly when surface-modified (i.e., PEG), offer a promising platform for drug delivery [60,74]. \n\nA diagnostic probe utilizing DNA-modified AuNPs has been developed to detect amyloid-derived diffusible ligands, highlighting their potential in diagnostics [73]. Additionally, AuNPs engineered for theranostic applications have demonstrated the ability to penetrate the BBB and tumors, showing promise for targeted brain drug delivery due to their selectivity and low toxicity [75]. \n\nFunctionalized AuNPs with transferrin (Tf) have shown remarkable penetration into mice, employing the receptor transcytosis pathway [76,77]. AuNPs with a cleavable acid linkage and Tf coating were more effective in brain accumulation than their non-cleavable counterparts due to the cleavable process that allowed for enhanced drug release into the brain.",

Nevertheless, the survival rate for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with a high grade of malignancy is less than one year. From a clinical point of view, effective treatment of GBM is limited by several challenges. First, the anatomical complexity of the brain influences the extent of resection because a fine balance must be struck between maximal removal of malignant tissue and minimal surgical risk. Second, the central nervous system has a distinct microenvironment that is protected by the blood\u2013brain barrier, restricting systemically delivered drugs from accessing the brain. Additionally, GBM is characterized by high intra-tumor and inter-tumor heterogeneity at cellular and histological levels. This peculiarity of GBM-constituent tissues induces different responses to therapeutic agents, leading to failure of targeted therapies. Unlike surgical resection and radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT) can treat micro-invasive areas while protecting sensitive brain regions. PDT involves photoactivation of photosensitizers (PSs) that are selectively incorporated into tumor cells. Photo-irradiation activates the PS by transfer of energy, resulting in production of reactive oxygen species to induce cell death. Clinical outcomes of PDT-treated GBM can be advanced in terms of nanomedicine. This review discusses clinical PDT applications of nanomedicine for the treatment of GBM.",

                    "text": "One of the major limitations of treating brain tumors is the difficulty of delivering drugs to the brain. The brain is surrounded by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a selective barrier formed by endothelial cells in the cerebral microvessels, which regulates nutrient and ion transport and protects the brain from neurotoxic molecules to maintain brain homeostasis [34]. Unfortunately, most drugs cannot cross the BBB via physiological pathways due to the extreme selectivity of the barrier, which constitutes the greatest obstacle to systemic treatment for most central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In the recent decade, many strategies have been studied, such as topical delivery, implantation of a sustained drug-release scaffold [35], nasal administration [36], ultrasound to temporarily open the BBB [37], and nanoparticle functionalization to enhance BBB penetration [38]. However, local drug delivery methods are considered highly invasive because they require procedural surgery. In addition, the intranasal route has a disadvantage in that the delivered dose varies greatly depending on the condition of the nasal mucosa. Therefore, despite the difficulties across the BBB, the most popular and well-studied delivery route remains the systemic route through the functionalization of nanoparticles. \n\nNanocarriers can traverse the BBB using a variety of physiological pathways, including receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) or adsorption-mediated transcytosis (AMT). To achieve this goal, many nanocarrier systems, such as inorganic, polymeric, or lipid-based nanoparticles, have been developed and shown to cross the BBB due to their tailored surface properties. Numerous studies have demonstrated that physically coating nanoparticles with surfactants and chemical functionalization with specific ligands is a successful strategy to enhance BBB traversing via the physiological pathways mentioned above [39,40]. The size and charge of nanoparticles are also aspects that can affect brain penetration, but if the surface functionalization is done properly, there is no significant difference in a wide size range (from 5 to 400 nm) [41].",

Huh\n## Abstract\nThe last two decades have witnessed explosive growth in the field of nanoengineering and nanomedicine. In particular, engineered nanoparticles have garnered great attention due to their potential to enable new capabilities such as controlled and targeted drug delivery for treatment of various diseases. With rapid progress in nanoparticle research, increasing efforts are being made to develop new technologies for in vitro modeling and analysis of the efficacy and safety of nanotherapeutics in human physiological systems. Organ-on-a-chip technology represents the most recent advance in this effort that provides a promising approach to address the limitations of conventional preclinical models. In this paper, we present a concise review of recent studies demonstrating how this emerging technology can be applied to in vitro studies of nanoparticles. The specific focus of this review is to examine the use of organ-on-a-chip models for toxicity and efficacy assessment of nanoparticles used in therapeutic applications. We also discuss challenges and future opportunities for implementing organ-on-a-chip technology for nanoparticle research.\n## In vitro modeling of targeted nanoparticle delivery in organ-chips 3.1.1 Investigating the effect of physicochemical properties of nanoparticles\nA good example of such systems is provided by a microfluidic model of the vascular endothelium established by using rat brain endothelial (RBE4) cells to examine cellular adhesion and internalization of different nanoparticle shapes [73]. By flowing spherical and rod-shaped nanoparticles (Fig. 2c) coated with anti-intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-mAb) antibody or immunoglobulin G antibody (IgG) over the surface of the RBE4 monolayers, this study showed enhanced targeting and stronger attachment of nanorods to the endothelium compared to the spherical particles, highlighting the potential of unconventional nanoparticle shapes for more efficient and target-specific drug delivery. \n\nLastly, based on a growing body of evidence showing significant effects of surface chemistry on the behavior of nanoparticles [74,75], microengineers have also begun to explore the use of organ-chips for studying how surface functionalization can be leveraged as a means to enhance nanoparticle delivery.

The emergence of antiretroviral therapy agents has significantly increased the life expectancy and the patient s quality of life. In the 1990\u2019s, there was a great improvement in the knowledge of the disease, enlargement of therapeutic resources, a rise in life expectancy and the epidemiologic profile. Since the mid-1990\u2019s, the advancement of pharmacology studies and the arrival of protease inhibitor antiretroviral have given rise to a new era of anti-HIV agents, known as Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) (Geocze et al., 2010, Richman et al., 2009). The HAART\u2019s adhesion improved the clinical results, the control of the advancement of the disease and decreased the mortality rate, which resulted in an improvement of the patient\u2019s life quality. Despite the successful administration of HAART, latently infected cells can escape the viral immune response and persist for long periods of time (Alexaki et al., 2008). In addition, the HAART presents several collateral effects, such as fatigue, nausea, sickness, diarrhea and lipodystrophy. These symptoms contribute to a lack of treatment adhesion in the patient, resulting in a rise in the blood viral load and a decline in CD4+ T cells count, as well as an increased tolerance of anti-HIV drugs, treatment failure, increased opportunistic infections and in wasted investments (Geocze et al., 2010). Moreover, many antiretroviral drugs undergo extensive pre-systemic metabolism and instability in the gastrointestinal environment, resulting in inadequate and erratic oral absorption as well as low bioavailability. The half-life for most anti-HIV drugs is short, and thus, it requires frequent dosage administrations, leading to a decrease in patient compliance. Also, some antiretroviral classes present poor solubility, low absorption and limited bioavailability. Another limitation of the current HAART is the inefficiency of the regimens to eradicate HIV from various anatomical reservoirs (e.g., central nervous system (CNS) and gastrointestinal tract) and intracellular sites (e.g., macrophages, hepatocytes, dendritic cells and Langerhans cells) (Ojewole et al., 2008, Saksena & Haddad, 2003). Large concentrations are essential for eliminating HIV from these reservoirs to achieve the desired therapeutic effect, but these large doses contribute to severe side effects associated with anti-HIV therapy (Ojewole et al., 2008).

The size and surface charge are also important parameters in a nanostructured system because these characteristics interfere directly in biological processes, such as the transport across biological membranes and the recognition by M/Ms and biodistribution. Another important factor that must be taken into account in the design strategies used to improve AIDS treatment is the brain delivery system of antiretroviral drugs. Because of the restricted entry of anti-HIV drugs, the brain is thought to form a viral sanctuary, and the treatment and control of HIV within this reservoir must be primordial. Nanoparticles can enhance the brain-drug delivery by three major pathways, which include the following: i) increasing the local drug gradient at the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) by passive targeting, ii) allowing drug-trafficking by non-specific or receptor-mediated endocytosis and iii) blocking drug efflux transporters at the BBB (Wong et al., 2010). Consequently, the use of nanocarriers should help to achieve higher concentrations of encapsulated drugs and also allow their prolonged residence in the CNS. One of the most used polymers for the development of nanoparticles intended for brain delivery is poly-(butylcyanoacrylate) (PBCA) (Koziara et al., 2006). Studies have shown that the surface modification of PBCA nanoparticles using other polymers or surfactant agents, such as polysorbate 80, could increase the transport of particles through the BBB. Polysorbate 80 has been found to increase the translocation of nanoparticles by increasing the particle interaction with the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated endocytic pathway in brain endothelial cells and by inhibition the efflux function of P-gp (Goppert & Muller, 2005).

Selvin\n## Abstract\nNano particles are widely used in the drug delivery systems to improve efficacy, bioavailability and targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. They are typically ranging from the 1-100 nm in size and emerged as versatile tools in the field of drug delivery, revolutionizing the way therapeutic agents are transported and released within the human body. Role played by nanoparticles in crossing physiological barriers and enhancing the efficacy of therapeutic decisions. Nanoparticles exhibit unique physicochemical properties that enable them to navigate the intricate biological milieu and optimize drug delivery. The Blood Brain Barrier (BBB\u2019s) intricate structure and its pivotal role in maintaining neural homeostasis Endothelial cells, tight junctions, and efflux transporters make up the majority of this specific barrier, which has historically made it difficult to deliver medications and therapeutic agents to the brain. These problems can only be solved by using nanoparticles\u2019 unique physical and biological characteristics, which also provide a wide variety of nanocarriers and methods for improving BBB permeability. Nanoparticles use a variety of techniques to improve their interactions with the BBB, such as size optimization, surface charge alteration, and active targeting ligands the interplay of these mechanisms serves to overcome the physical and biochemical restrictions, allowing for controlled and targeted drug delivery to specific brain regions.\n",

Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is one of the major causative factors to induce progressive dementia. AD is a neurodegenerative disease, and its pathogenesis has been attributed to extracellular aggregates of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles made of hyperphosphorylated \u03c4-protein in cortical and limbic areas of the human brain. It is characterized by memory loss and progressive neurocognitive dysfunction. The anomalous processing of APP by \u03b2-secretases and \u03b3-secretases leads to production of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 monomers, which further oligomerize and aggregate into senile plaques. The disease also intensifies through infectious agents like HIV. Additionally, during disease pathogenesis, the presence of high concentrations of A\u03b2 peptides in central nervous system initiates microglial infiltration. Upon coming into vicinity of A\u03b2, microglia get activated, endocytose A\u03b2, and contribute toward their clearance via TREM2 surface receptors, simultaneously triggering innate immunoresponse against the aggregation. In addition to a detailed report on causative factors leading to AD, the present review also discusses the current state of the art in AD therapeutics and diagnostics, including labeling and imaging techniques employed as contrast agents for better visualization and sensing of the plaques. The review also points to an urgent need for nanotechnology as an efficient therapeutic strategy to increase the bioavailability of drugs in the central nervous system.",

Yao\n## Abstract\nSome of the most important advances in the life sciences have come from transitioning to thinking of materials and their properties on the nanoscale rather than the macro or even microscale. Improvements in imaging technology have allowed us to see nanofeatures that directly impact chemical and mechanical properties of natural and man-made materials. Now that these can be imaged and quantified, substantial advances have been made in the fields of biomimetics, tissue engineering, and drug delivery. For the first time, scientists can determine the importance of nanograins and nanoasperities in nacre, direct the nucleation of apatite and the growth of cells on nanostructured scaffolds, and pass drugs tethered to nanoparticles through the blood-brain barrier. This review examines some of the most interesting materials whose nanostructure and hierarchical organization have been shown to correlate directly with favorable properties and their resulting applications.\n## Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery\nSEM analysis showed that this was because the additive created large interconnected pores connected to the nanoparticle surface which formed solvent-filled channels large enough for the drug to seep out [61]. \n\nPreviously the criteria for successfully preparing nanoparticles loaded with a drug were broadly presented; however, there are many innovative direct applications that should be considered as well. One of the most challenging organs to deliver drugs to is the brain because it is protected by a blood-brain barrier which is composed of the basal membrane, and tightly packed endothelial and neuroglial cells. However, the brain is understandably also one of the most helpful targets for treating maladies from depression to tumors [62]. The brain has two main methods by which it allows molecules across the barrier. First, compounds that are at physiological pH, lipophilic, and have low molecular weight can pass through by diffusion [63]. Second, compounds that resemble specific proteins and other components needed for brain function have specified receptors in the blood-brain barrier which actively transport these [63]. The brain also has an impressive ability to keep things out. Junctions between cells are tight and circumferential such that there are no continuous pathways between them and pumps operating in the cell reject lipophilic compounds that should not be allowed to cross [32]. To get around this, nanoparticles are often coated or surface treated to produce more favorable interaction properties. Nanoparticles coated with polysorbate-80 and polysorbate-85 were found to effectively transport drugs through the barrier [32]. Later work by Schroeder et al., proposed that these coatings help bind nanoparticles to the lining of the capillaries such that they induce a large concentration gradient which facilitates diffusion or purposefully induce phagocytosis processes in the epithelial cells [64]. Kreuter found that nanoparticles coated with polysorbate-80 transported drugs through the barrier with a 20-fold improvement over the uncoated nanoparticles [62]. However, he concluded that it is because the polysorbate-80 coating attracts apolipoprotein E from the blood to the surface [62].",

            "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most malignant primary brain tumor, presenting significant treatment challenges due to its heterogeneity, invasiveness, and resistance to conventional therapies. Despite aggressive treatment protocols, the prognosis remains poor, with a median survival time of approximately 15 months. Recent advancements in mRNA vaccine technology, particularly the development of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), have revitalized interest in mRNA-based therapies. These vaccines offer unique advantages, including rapid production, personalization based on tumor-specific mutations, and a strong induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses. mRNA vaccines have demonstrated potential in preclinical models, showing significant tumor regression and improved survival rates. Early-phase clinical trials have indicated that mRNA vaccines are safe and can induce robust immune responses in GBM patients. Combining mRNA vaccines with other immunotherapeutic approaches, such as checkpoint inhibitors, has shown synergistic effects, further enhancing their efficacy. However, challenges such as optimizing delivery systems and overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment remain. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges and exploring combination therapies to maximize therapeutic benefits. Large-scale, randomized clinical trials are essential to validate the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines in GBM therapy. The potential to reshape the tumor microenvironment and establish long-term immunological memory underscores the transformative potential of mRNA vaccines in cancer immunotherapy.",

This method exploits endogenous transport mechanisms by attaching ligands or antibodies to nanoparticles that bind to specific receptors on the BBB, such as the transferrin or insulin receptors, facilitating the transport of encapsulated mRNA across the barrier [13]. \n\nThirdly, the development of novel nanoparticle formulations that can naturally cross the BBB is under investigation. For example, nanoparticles can be designed with surface modifications that enhance their ability to traverse the BBB. PEGylation, the attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to nanoparticles, is one such modification that increases the stability and circulation time of nanoparticles, enhancing their chances of crossing the BBB [14]. \n\nAnother approach involves the use of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), which are short peptides that can facilitate the delivery of therapeutic agents across cellular membranes, including the BBB. CPPs can be conjugated to nanoparticles carrying mRNA, improving their delivery efficiency to brain tissues [15]. \n\nAdditionally, ongoing research is focused on utilizing viral vectors that have a natural ability to cross the BBB. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) and lentiviruses are being engineered to deliver mRNA directly to brain cells, taking advantage of their efficient transduction capabilities [16]. \n\nDespite these advancements, ensuring the stability and controlled release of mRNA once it reaches the target site remains a challenge. Novel hydrogel-based delivery systems are being developed to provide sustained release of mRNA, enhancing its therapeutic efficacy while minimizing potential side effects [17].",

Liki\u0107\n## Abstract\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most malignant primary brain tumor, presenting significant treatment challenges due to its heterogeneity, invasiveness, and resistance to conventional therapies. Despite aggressive treatment protocols, the prognosis remains poor, with a median survival time of approximately 15 months. Recent advancements in mRNA vaccine technology, particularly the development of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), have revitalized interest in mRNA-based therapies. These vaccines offer unique advantages, including rapid production, personalization based on tumor-specific mutations, and a strong induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses. mRNA vaccines have demonstrated potential in preclinical models, showing significant tumor regression and improved survival rates. Early-phase clinical trials have indicated that mRNA vaccines are safe and can induce robust immune responses in GBM patients. Combining mRNA vaccines with other immunotherapeutic approaches, such as checkpoint inhibitors, has shown synergistic effects, further enhancing their efficacy. However, challenges such as optimizing delivery systems and overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment remain. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges and exploring combination therapies to maximize therapeutic benefits. Large-scale, randomized clinical trials are essential to validate the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines in GBM therapy. The potential to reshape the tumor microenvironment and establish long-term immunological memory underscores the transformative potential of mRNA vaccines in cancer immunotherapy.\n## Mechanism of Action\nThis technique uses targeted ultrasound waves to temporarily open the tight junctions of the BBB, facilitating drug delivery to the brain. \n\nSecondly, receptor-mediated transcytosis is another innovative approach being explored. This method exploits endogenous transport mechanisms by attaching ligands or antibodies to nanoparticles that bind to specific receptors on the BBB, such as the transferrin or insulin receptors, facilitating the transport of encapsulated mRNA across the barrier [13]. \n\nThirdly, the development of novel nanoparticle formulations that can naturally cross the BBB is under investigation. For example, nanoparticles can be designed with surface modifications that enhance their ability to traverse the BBB. PEGylation, the attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to nanoparticles, is one such modification that increases the stability and circulation time of nanoparticles, enhancing their chances of crossing the BBB [14]. \n\nAnother approach involves the use of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), which are short peptides that can facilitate the delivery of therapeutic agents across cellular membranes, including the BBB. CPPs can be conjugated to nanoparticles carrying mRNA, improving their delivery efficiency to brain tissues [15]. \n\nAdditionally, ongoing research is focused on utilizing viral vectors that have a natural ability to cross the BBB. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) and lentiviruses are being engineered to deliver mRNA directly to brain cells, taking advantage of their efficient transduction capabilities [16]. \n\nDespite these advancements, ensuring the stability and controlled release of mRNA once it reaches the target site remains a challenge. Novel hydrogel-based delivery systems are being developed to provide sustained release of mRNA, enhancing its therapeutic efficacy while minimizing potential side effects [17].",

                    "text": "Nanoparticles have attracted significant nanotechnology attention due to their distinctive properties and extensive potential applications [27]. The extensive research into nanoparticles is primarily driven by their inherent attributes, including heightened stability, precise targeting capabilities, and controlled drug release mechanisms [27,28]. These qualities make nanoparticles exceptionally well-suited for an ideal pharmacotherapeutic approach, particularly in disorders such as epilepsy, where the need for on-demand drug release and effective blood-brain barrier penetration is pronounced [29]. Furthermore, nanoparticles offer a versatile formulation approach, as they can be synthesized from diverse organic and inorganic materials, encompassing lipids, proteins, polymers, and metals [27,30]. \n\nMaximizing the effectiveness and safety of nanoparticles in epilepsy treatment necessitates a holistic evaluation of critical properties. These properties encompass size, shape, surface attributes, core stability, biocompatibility, toxicity, release kinetics, and intricate targeting mechanisms [31,32]. While a universal nanoparticle blueprint remains elusive, specific attributes have emerged as pivotal in aiding these agents to overcome the blood-brain barrier [33,34]. Notably, nanoparticles with dimensions smaller than 200 nm, particularly in the 10 to 100 nm range, exhibit remarkable permeability and optimal performance [35,36]. The sustained release of drugs plays a vital role in epilepsy management, ensuring therapeutic drug levels within the brain, reducing seizures, and minimizing the need for frequent medication administration [37][38][39]. Strategies like pH-responsive polymers and stimuli-responsive systems are employed for controlled and sustained drug release [40]. Additionally, surface modifications, such as attaching targeting ligands and implementing stealth coatings, enhance specificity, stability, and circulation longevity [16,41]. An ideal surface charge for effective brain drug delivery is either positive or neutral, allowing nanoparticles to interact with the blood-brain barrier and cellular receptors [42][43][44]. However, despite extensive research and its significant potential, the availability of nanomedicines for therapeutic purposes remains limited.",

In animal model results indicated that nanoparticle-based drugs were beneficial in reducing seizure scores, improving seizure onset latency, and providing neuroprotective effects. Conclusion: The characteristics of nanoparticle drug delivery varied, influenced by formulation factors and preparation methods. Nanoparticle-based AEDs exhibit higher efficacy compared to conventional AEDs. All studies included present an opportunity for the development of epilepsy therapies, although future studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n## Discussion\nNanoparticles have attracted significant nanotechnology attention due to their distinctive properties and extensive potential applications [27]. The extensive research into nanoparticles is primarily driven by their inherent attributes, including heightened stability, precise targeting capabilities, and controlled drug release mechanisms [27,28]. These qualities make nanoparticles exceptionally well-suited for an ideal pharmacotherapeutic approach, particularly in disorders such as epilepsy, where the need for on-demand drug release and effective blood-brain barrier penetration is pronounced [29]. Furthermore, nanoparticles offer a versatile formulation approach, as they can be synthesized from diverse organic and inorganic materials, encompassing lipids, proteins, polymers, and metals [27,30]. \n\nMaximizing the effectiveness and safety of nanoparticles in epilepsy treatment necessitates a holistic evaluation of critical properties. These properties encompass size, shape, surface attributes, core stability, biocompatibility, toxicity, release kinetics, and intricate targeting mechanisms [31,32]. While a universal nanoparticle blueprint remains elusive, specific attributes have emerged as pivotal in aiding these agents to overcome the blood-brain barrier [33,34]. Notably, nanoparticles with dimensions smaller than 200 nm, particularly in the 10 to 100 nm range, exhibit remarkable permeability and optimal performance [35,36]. The sustained release of drugs plays a vital role in epilepsy management, ensuring therapeutic drug levels within the brain, reducing seizures, and minimizing the need for frequent medication administration [37][38][39]. Strategies like pH-responsive polymers and stimuli-responsive systems are employed for controlled and sustained drug release [40]. Additionally, surface modifications, such as attaching targeting ligands and implementing stealth coatings, enhance specificity, stability, and circulation longevity [16,41]. An ideal surface charge for effective brain drug delivery is either positive or neutral, allowing nanoparticles to interact with the blood-brain barrier and cellular receptors [42][43][44]. However, despite extensive research and its significant potential, the availability of nanomedicines for therapeutic purposes remains limited.",

This obstacle has spurred the development of innovative strategies to overcome the BBB, with nanoparticle-based delivery systems emerging as a promising approach. Nanoparticles offer a unique solution to the challenge of drug delivery across the BBB. As shown in Scheme 2, these tiny particles can be designed to interact with the BBB in various ways, such as paracellular transport, carrier-mediated transport, and cell-mediated transport, enabling them to transport therapeutic agents into the brain. Some nanoparticles utilize adsorptive-mediated transcytosis, where their positive charge interacts with the negatively charged cell membrane of brain endothelial cells, facilitating uptake and transport. Additionally, others employ receptor-mediated transcytosis, using specific ligands to bind to receptors on the BBB and trigger internalization. The use of nanoparticles for brain drug delivery offers several advantages over traditional methods. These include improved drug stability, targeted delivery to specific brain regions or cell types, and enhanced BBB penetration [53][54][55][56]. \n\nMOFs have attracted significant interest in recent years due to their potential to overcome the challenges posed by the BBB in treating brain disorders. This interest is due to their unique physicochemical properties, including high drug loading efficiency, controlled drug release, nanoscale size, ease of surface modification, stability, biodegradability, and biocompatibility with low systemic toxicity. A key advantage of MOFs in crossing the BBB is their ability to be functionalized with various ligands and molecules that can target specific receptors on the BBB. This receptor-mediated transport mechanism improves the ability of MOFs to penetrate the BBB and deliver therapeutic agents directly to brain tissues. Additionally, modifying the surface of MOFs can enhance their biocompatibility, stability, and targeting capabilities, further increasing their potential as drug delivery systems [57,58]. \n\nNanomaterials 2024, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW traditional methods.

Nabipour, Sohrab Rohani\n## Abstract\nThe blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) plays a vital role in safeguarding the central nervous system by selectively controlling the movement of substances between the bloodstream and the brain, presenting a substantial obstacle for the administration of therapeutic agents to the brain. Recent breakthroughs in nanoparticle-based delivery systems, particularly metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), provide promising solutions for addressing the BBB. MOFs have become valuable tools in delivering medications to the brain with their ability to efficiently load drugs, release them over time, and modify their surface properties. This review focuses on the recent advancements in molecular-based approaches for treating brain disorders, such as glioblastoma multiforme, stroke, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This paper highlights the significant impact of MOFs in overcoming the shortcomings of conventional brain drug delivery techniques and provides valuable insights for future research in the field of neurotherapeutics.\n## MOFs in the Treatment of Brain Diseases\nMany therapeutic agents are unable to cross this barrier, limiting their effectiveness in treating brain-related conditions. This obstacle has spurred the development of innovative strategies to overcome the BBB, with nanoparticle-based delivery systems emerging as a promising approach. Nanoparticles offer a unique solution to the challenge of drug delivery across the BBB. As shown in Scheme 2, these tiny particles can be designed to interact with the BBB in various ways, such as paracellular transport, carrier-mediated transport, and cell-mediated transport, enabling them to transport therapeutic agents into the brain. Some nanoparticles utilize adsorptive-mediated transcytosis, where their positive charge interacts with the negatively charged cell membrane of brain endothelial cells, facilitating uptake and transport. Additionally, others employ receptor-mediated transcytosis, using specific ligands to bind to receptors on the BBB and trigger internalization. The use of nanoparticles for brain drug delivery offers several advantages over traditional methods. These include improved drug stability, targeted delivery to specific brain regions or cell types, and enhanced BBB penetration [53][54][55][56]. \n\nMOFs have attracted significant interest in recent years due to their potential to overcome the challenges posed by the BBB in treating brain disorders. This interest is due to their unique physicochemical properties, including high drug loading efficiency, controlled drug release, nanoscale size, ease of surface modification, stability, biodegradability, and biocompatibility with low systemic toxicity. A key advantage of MOFs in crossing the BBB is their ability to be functionalized with various ligands and molecules that can target specific receptors on the BBB. This receptor-mediated transport mechanism improves the ability of MOFs to penetrate the BBB and deliver therapeutic agents directly to brain tissues. Additionally, modifying the surface of MOFs can enhance their biocompatibility, stability, and targeting capabilities, further increasing their potential as drug delivery systems [57,58]. \n\nNanomaterials 2024, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW traditional methods. These include improved drug stability, targeted delivery to brain regions or cell types, and enhanced BBB penetration [53][54][55][56]. \n\nScheme 2.

The unique targeting properties of the AuNPs after fabrication with the brain-targeted exosomes was demonstrated by their binding to brain cells under laminar flow conditions as well as their enhanced transport across the blood brain barrier. In a further demonstration of their ability to target brain cells, in vivo bioluminescence imaging revealed that targeted-exosome coated AuNPs accumulated in the mouse brain after intravenous injection. The surface modification of synthetic AuNPs with the brain-targeted exosome demonstrated in this work represents a highly novel and effective strategy to provide efficient brain targeting and shows promise for the future in using modified AuNPs to penetrate the brain.",

This limitation is bypassed by apolipoprotein E (ApoE)\u2010functionalized polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) that are able to transport drugs (e.g., dalargin, loperamide, doxorubicin, and nerve growth factor) across the BBB via low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor\u2010mediated transcytosis. Coating with polysorbate 80 or poloxamer 188 facilitates ApoE adsorption onto polymeric NPs enabling recognition by LDL receptors of brain endothelial cells. This effect is even enhanced when NPs are directly coated with ApoE without surfactant anchor. Similarly, covalent coupling of ApoE to NPs that bear reactive groups on their surface leads to significantly improved brain uptake while avoiding the use of surfactants. In this Progress Report several in vitro BBB models using brain endothelial cells or cocultures with astrocytes/pericytes/glioma cells are described, which provide insights regarding the ability of a drug delivery system to cross this barrier. In vivo models are described which simulate central nervous system\u2010relevant diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease and cerebral cancer.\n",

Despite the current strategies to circumvent the BBB, nanotechnology offers unprecedented opportunities for combining selective delivery, improved bioavailability, drug protection, and enhanced pharmacokinetics profiles. Chitosan nanocarriers allow for a more efficacious strategy at the cellular and sub-cellular levels. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a targeted chemo-radiotherapeutic technique that allows the selective depletion of cancer cells by means of selective tagging of cancer cells with 10B, followed by irradiation with low-energy neutrons. Consequently, the combination of a polymer-based nanodelivery system enclosing an effective BNCT pharmacophore can potentially lead to the selective delivery of the load to cancer cells beyond the BBB. In this work, synthesized novel boronated agents based on carborane-functionalized Delocalized Lipophilic Cations (DLCs) are assessed for safety and selective targeting of tumour cells. The compounds are then encapsulated in nanocarriers constituted by chitosan to promote permeability through the BBB. Additionally, chitosan was used in combination with polypyrrole to form a smart composite nanocapsule, which is expected to release its drug load with variations in pH. Results indicate the achievement of more selective boron delivery to cells via carboranyl DLCs. Finally, preliminary cell studies indicate no toxicity was detected in chitosan nanocapsules, further enhancing its viability as a potential delivery vehicle in the BNCT of brain tumours.",

                    "text": "There are a number of alterations that may be required for the nanodelivery systems to be more effective. The zeta surface charge is an important parameter for nanoparticle delivery through the BBB, as a study showed that highly positive surface charged nanovehicles might cause toxicity to the BBB [44]. Gao et al. [45] and Jallouli et al. [46] showed efficient drug delivery of positively surface charged (above 15 mV) vehicles across the BBB. These results are significant, as brain drug delivery is regulated by multiple factors, including size, shape, hydrophobicity, and surface charge. Having control over these features can help permeate through the BBB and help improve the therapeutic agent's stability when in circulation [47][48][49]. In addition, the alteration of the size of the nanoparticles is essential in order to infiltrate the blood-brain barrier; this can be achieved through the potential modification of chitosan or polypyrrole. Several studies have shown an inverse correlation between the nanoparticle size and the BBB penetration [50][51][52]. The smaller the nanoparticles, the higher the penetration of the nanovehicle through the BBB. Furthermore, the shape of the nanovehicles influences the body distribution and cellular uptake [53]. \n\nOver the years, DLCs have been known to accumulate selectively at a higher rate in tumour cells [15] because mitochondria of tumour cells present a higher transmembrane potential than healthy ones. The positive surface charge of DLCs in combination with their lipophilicity allows for diffusion of DLCs at a higher rate into cancer cells. This can be favourably used to promote the selective accumulation of therapeutic amounts of boron into cancer cells [22].",

Alany, G. Calabrese\n## Abstract\nDrug delivery through the Blood\u2013Brain Barrier (BBB) represents a significant challenge. Despite the current strategies to circumvent the BBB, nanotechnology offers unprecedented opportunities for combining selective delivery, improved bioavailability, drug protection, and enhanced pharmacokinetics profiles. Chitosan nanocarriers allow for a more efficacious strategy at the cellular and sub-cellular levels. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a targeted chemo-radiotherapeutic technique that allows the selective depletion of cancer cells by means of selective tagging of cancer cells with 10B, followed by irradiation with low-energy neutrons. Consequently, the combination of a polymer-based nanodelivery system enclosing an effective BNCT pharmacophore can potentially lead to the selective delivery of the load to cancer cells beyond the BBB. In this work, synthesized novel boronated agents based on carborane-functionalized Delocalized Lipophilic Cations (DLCs) are assessed for safety and selective targeting of tumour cells. The compounds are then encapsulated in nanocarriers constituted by chitosan to promote permeability through the BBB. Additionally, chitosan was used in combination with polypyrrole to form a smart composite nanocapsule, which is expected to release its drug load with variations in pH. Results indicate the achievement of more selective boron delivery to cells via carboranyl DLCs. Finally, preliminary cell studies indicate no toxicity was detected in chitosan nanocapsules, further enhancing its viability as a potential delivery vehicle in the BNCT of brain tumours.\n## Discussion\nThere are a number of alterations that may be required for the nanodelivery systems to be more effective. The zeta surface charge is an important parameter for nanoparticle delivery through the BBB, as a study showed that highly positive surface charged nanovehicles might cause toxicity to the BBB [44]. Gao et al. [45] and Jallouli et al. [46] showed efficient drug delivery of positively surface charged (above 15 mV) vehicles across the BBB. These results are significant, as brain drug delivery is regulated by multiple factors, including size, shape, hydrophobicity, and surface charge. Having control over these features can help permeate through the BBB and help improve the therapeutic agent's stability when in circulation [47][48][49]. In addition, the alteration of the size of the nanoparticles is essential in order to infiltrate the blood-brain barrier; this can be achieved through the potential modification of chitosan or polypyrrole. Several studies have shown an inverse correlation between the nanoparticle size and the BBB penetration [50][51][52]. The smaller the nanoparticles, the higher the penetration of the nanovehicle through the BBB. Furthermore, the shape of the nanovehicles influences the body distribution and cellular uptake [53]. \n\nOver the years, DLCs have been known to accumulate selectively at a higher rate in tumour cells [15] because mitochondria of tumour cells present a higher transmembrane potential than healthy ones. The positive surface charge of DLCs in combination with their lipophilicity allows for diffusion of DLCs at a higher rate into cancer cells. This can be favourably used to promote the selective accumulation of therapeutic amounts of boron into cancer cells [22].",

There are multiple potential points of intervention to combat excitotoxicity and downstream oxidative stress, yet there are currently no therapeutics clinically approved for this specific purpose. For a therapeutic to be effective against excitotoxicity, the therapeutic must accumulate at the disease site at the appropriate concentration at the right time. Nanotechnology can provide benefits for therapeutic delivery, including overcoming physiological obstacles such as the blood\u2013brain barrier, protect cargo from degradation, and provide controlled release of a drug.

There are a wide variety of nanoparticle platforms used for therapeutic delivery to the brain, including polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, hydrogels, and dendrimers. Polymeric nanoparticles can provide controlled drug release, targeting capabilities, and prolonged drug action by protection from proteases, and have been shown to cross an intact or impaired BBB. 72,83 Nanoparticle size, shape, flexibility, and surface charge can be tailored to overcome steric clearance and non-specific binding to alter pharmacokinetics and improve brain accumulation. [84][85][86] With a dense poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) coating, nanoparticles exhibit increased systemic circulation time by reducing interactions that lead to clearance and opsonization. 75 Densely-PEG coated nanoparticles up to 114 nm are also capable of diffusive and convective transport through the brain parenchyma. 87,88 Drug-incorporation strategies include loading within nanoparticle matrices, cores, or lipophilic bilayers, or covalent conjugation to surface end groups. 8 To improve pharmacokinetics or cellular uptake, nanoparticles can also be further decorated with surface ligands or surfactants, while incorporation of biology-responsive materials can further specialize therapeutic delivery. 83,89 Incorporation of pH-sensitive groups can imbue nanoparticles with triggered release capabilities, only releasing drug when reaching the acidotic ischemic area, or when internalized within an acidic lysosome. 90,91 Similar strategies apply for attachment of protease-cleavable linkers and oxidation/reduction-sensitive bonds. 92,93 Superparamagnetic nanoparticles can also be guided to diseased tissue regions using magnetic resonance (MR). 94 Nanoparticles may also serve as biomarkers of disease, however, biomarker applications are outside the scope of this review and have been covered in other reviews. 95,96 By leveraging the benefits of nanoparticle drug delivery and understanding neurological disease processes at the biomolecular level, therapeutic agents can be better designed to combat",

Wood, Elizabeth A. Nance\n## Abstract\nExcitotoxicity is a primary pathological process that occurs during stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and global brain ischemia such as perinatal asphyxia. Excitotoxicity is triggered by an overabundance of excitatory neurotransmitters within the synapse, causing a detrimental cascade of excessive sodium and calcium influx, generation of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial damage, and ultimately cell death. There are multiple potential points of intervention to combat excitotoxicity and downstream oxidative stress, yet there are currently no therapeutics clinically approved for this specific purpose. For a therapeutic to be effective against excitotoxicity, the therapeutic must accumulate at the disease site at the appropriate concentration at the right time. Nanotechnology can provide benefits for therapeutic delivery, including overcoming physiological obstacles such as the blood\u2013brain barrier, protect cargo from degradation, and provide controlled release of a drug. This review evaluates the use of nano-based therapeutics to combat excitotoxicity in stroke, TBI, and hypoxia\u2013ischemia with an emphasis on mitigating oxidative stress, and consideration of the path forward toward clinical translation.\n## Application of nanoparticles and their therapeutic benefits\nNanotechnology holds promise to both maintain therapeutic stability and overcome the barriers to brain delivery. There are a wide variety of nanoparticle platforms used for therapeutic delivery to the brain, including polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, hydrogels, and dendrimers. Polymeric nanoparticles can provide controlled drug release, targeting capabilities, and prolonged drug action by protection from proteases, and have been shown to cross an intact or impaired BBB. 72,83 Nanoparticle size, shape, flexibility, and surface charge can be tailored to overcome steric clearance and non-specific binding to alter pharmacokinetics and improve brain accumulation. [84][85][86] With a dense poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) coating, nanoparticles exhibit increased systemic circulation time by reducing interactions that lead to clearance and opsonization. 75 Densely-PEG coated nanoparticles up to 114 nm are also capable of diffusive and convective transport through the brain parenchyma. 87,88 Drug-incorporation strategies include loading within nanoparticle matrices, cores, or lipophilic bilayers, or covalent conjugation to surface end groups. 8 To improve pharmacokinetics or cellular uptake, nanoparticles can also be further decorated with surface ligands or surfactants, while incorporation of biology-responsive materials can further specialize therapeutic delivery. 83,89 Incorporation of pH-sensitive groups can imbue nanoparticles with triggered release capabilities, only releasing drug when reaching the acidotic ischemic area, or when internalized within an acidic lysosome. 90,91 Similar strategies apply for attachment of protease-cleavable linkers and oxidation/reduction-sensitive bonds. 92,93 Superparamagnetic nanoparticles can also be guided to diseased tissue regions using magnetic resonance (MR). 94 Nanoparticles may also serve as biomarkers of disease, however, biomarker applications are outside the scope of this review and have been covered in other reviews. 95,96 By leveraging the benefits of nanoparticle drug delivery and understanding neurological disease processes at the biomolecular level, therapeutic agents can be better designed to combat",

Many approved antidepressant drugs undergo extensive first-pass metabolism, resulting in low oral bioavailability. As a result, it takes a long time for these drugs to reach therapeutic concentrations, leading to delayed onset of effects and reduced efficacy. Furthermore, the low bioavailability often necessitates higher dosages, which increases the risk of toxic side effects over time. Another significant challenge is the limited ability of conventional antidepressants to cross the BBB and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), which restricts their therapeutic potential in treating CNS disorders like depression [117][118][119][120][121]. \n\nIn recent years, nanotechnology has gained significant attention for its potential to overcome many of these limitations [122][123][124]. Nanoparticles offer unique advantages, such as enhanced drug solubility, targeted delivery, and the ability to cross biological barriers more efficiently. However, nanoparticles also face challenges, including instability and a lack of specificity when exposed to the complex biological environment [125][126][127][128][129]. Therefore, it is crucial to modify nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems to enhance their therapeutic efficacy. One promising approach is the surface modification of nanoparticles, which can improve several key factors, including drug specificity, nanoparticle circulation time, biosafety, biocompatibility, and the solubility of hydrophobic drugs [130][131][132]. Many nanoparticles, particularly those made from hydrophobic polymers, are inherently hydrophobic, which limits their effectiveness in aqueous biological environments. Surface modification can address this issue by coating nanoparticles with biopolymers (e.g., polyethylene glycol, PEG) and conjugating them with targeting ligands (e.g., transferrin) that enhance specificity to the target site.",

Many nanoparticles, particularly those made from hydrophobic polymers, are inherently hydrophobic, which limits their effectiveness in aqueous biological environments. Surface modification can address this issue by coating nanoparticles with biopolymers (e.g., polyethylene glycol, PEG) and conjugating them with targeting ligands (e.g., transferrin) that enhance specificity to the target site.",

            "text": "Abstract Nanoparticle-based drug delivery presents a promising solution in enhancing therapies for neurological diseases, particularly cognitive impairment. These nanoparticles address challenges related to the physicochemical profiles of drugs that hinder their delivery to the central nervous system (CNS). Benefits include improved solubility due to particle size reduction, enhanced drug penetration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and sustained release mechanisms suitable for long-term therapy. Successful application of nanoparticle delivery systems requires careful consideration of their characteristics tailored for CNS delivery, encompassing particle size and distribution, surface charge and morphology, loading capacity, and drug release kinetics. Literature review reveals three main types of nanoparticles developed for cognitive function enhancement: polymeric nanoparticles, lipid-based nanoparticles, and metallic or inorganic nanoparticles. Each type and its production methods possess distinct advantages and limitations. Further modifications such as coating agents or ligand conjugation have been explored to enhance their brain cell uptake. Evidence supporting their development shows improved efficacy outcomes, evidenced by enhanced cognitive function assessments, modulation of pro-oxidant markers, and anti-inflammatory activities. Despite these advancements, clinical trials validating the efficacy of nanoparticle systems in treating cognitive defects are lacking. Therefore, these findings underscore the need for researchers to expedite clinical testing to provide robust evidence of the potential of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems.",

            "text": "-head comparisons of brain delivery between the different classes and/ or formulations of nanoparticles. Secondly, what is the best route of delivery? In preclinical studies, intranasal delivery of drugbound nanoparticles showed superior pharmacokinetic qualities and CNS bioavailability when directly compared to intravenous delivery [162]. Thus, nose-to-brain delivery of nanoparticles may be a preferred approach for future SUD-related studies.\n\nFinally, what surface modifications are likely to increase brain uptake and/or cell type-specific delivery? Thus far, the majority of studies have focused on disrupting the blood-brain barrier to improve nanotherapeutic delivery. For example, as a strategy to reduce brain efflux of therapeutic agents, Gomes and colleagues demonstrated that nanoparticles containing siRNAs for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporters increased drug permeability of an in vitro blood-brain barrier model [163]. In preclinical studies, other researchers have utilized ultrasound to disrupt the blood-brain barrier, allowing brain region-specific uptake of nanoparticle-bound treatments [164,165]. Nanoparticles containing ligands (e.g., transferrin, insulin, leptin, low-density lipoprotein) that bind to receptors on the circulation side of the blood-brain barrier is another approach that has been shown to facilitate transport across the blood-brain barrier via receptor-mediated transcytosis [166]. For cell-type-specific targeting, Tat and RVGbound nanoparticles have been shown to facilitate uptake in neurons, while quantum dot formulations have been found to selectively target microglia in preclinical experiments [167][168][169]. Last, drug-induced changes in the brain's microenvironment is an important factor to consider when designing nanoparticles for SUD treatment. For example, blood-brain barrier permeability and integrity may differ depending on the drug(s) abused and the duration of drug use [170], generating additional opportunities or barriers for nanomedicine products.\n\nTo move the field forward, more testing and validation is needed using clinically relevant routes of administration",

            "title": "Advances and Opportunities in Nanoparticle Drug Delivery for Central Nervous System Disorders: A Review of Current Advances",
            "text": "The treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders poses significant challenges due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which restricts the passage of most therapeutic agents from systemic circulation to the brain. Over the years, nanoparticle (NP) -based drug delivery systems have emerged as promising solutions to overcome these challenges and improve the efficacy of CNS disorder treatments. Nanoparticles offer unique advantages, such as enhanced drug stability, prolonged circulation time, and the ability to encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic agents. This narrative review provides an overview of the current advances, challenges, and opportunities in nanoparticle drug delivery for CNS disorders. \n\nThe BBB functions as a selective barrier, preventing noxious substances from entering the brain while controlling the passage of necessary nutrients and drugs. The delivery of therapeutic medications is nevertheless restricted by its tight junctions and efflux transporters. Drugs can be delivered to the brain effectively by using nanoparticles that can be created to avoid or take advantage of these obstacles [1]. For CNS medication delivery, several formulations based on nanoparticles have been created, including liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and solid lipid nanoparticles. These formulations may be modified to increase targeting to certain brain areas, improve stability, and optimize drug-release patterns [2]. \n\nNanoparticles offer the ability to encapsulate a wide range of therapeutic agents, including small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, and even gene-editing tools. This adaptability makes it possible to give various medications in a single formulation, use combination therapy, and employ personalized medicine techniques [3]. Additionally, ligands or antibodies that recognize receptors overexpressed in sick brain areas can be used to functionalize nanoparticles. While minimizing off-target effects, this active targeting strategy enhances drug accumulation at the target location [4]. Nanoparticles can also circumvent multidrug resistance mechanisms in CNS disorders by modulating drug release kinetics, co-delivering efflux pump inhibitors, or utilizing alternative drug delivery routes to bypass resistant cells [5]. They have the potential to operate as multifunctional platforms that combine medicinal drugs with imaging agents and diagnostic technologies.",

            "text": "Polymeric nanoparticles are colloidal systems which have an ability to load drugs in solid-state or solutions, chemical grafting on the surface or noncovalent adsorption. Polymeric nanoparticles being less rigid and less dense, enables them to encapsulate a wide variety of therapeutic agents including chemotherapeutic drugs, proteins, nucleic acids, and contrast agents. Polymer-based delivery systems offer a number of advantages such as low toxicity of degradation products, biocompatibility, enhanced absorption, sustained release compatibility, ease of production, and localized drug delivery. Biocompatibility and rapid biodegradability of the applied polymer are considered major advantages in transporting nanoparticles in brain delivery systems [28]. Nanoparticle surface modification with adsorption or chemical-linking of polyethylene glycol (PEG), or with targeting ligands can provide an optimal way to prolong their circulation time and facilitate drug delivery across the BBB. Several studies report that PEGylated nanoparticles cross the BBB more efficiently than other nanoparticles with various other surface modifications, although the mechanism of BBB penetration by PEGylated nanoparticles is not clear. The major obstacle encountered in the use of polymeric nanoparticles is the interaction between the carrier and the reticuloendothelial system (RES), thereby exhibiting a rapid clearance from blood circulation. Therefore, lipid nanoparticles propose an alternative strategy for drug delivery to the brain [29].",

            "text": "Neurological disorders are a large group of diseases that affect the brain and the central nervous system and include neurodegenerative, neuroinflammatory, and neoplastic diseases. The incidence of neurological disorders is increasing due to the aging of the population, and these pathologies are becoming one of the most deadly and expensive medical conditions in the world. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD), are disorders characterized by an irreversible and progressive loss of neuronal cells that cause severe disability with a strong social and economic impact. At present, existing treatments can improve the symptoms but not cure these diseases due to the impairment of the functioning of various factors such as proteins and enzymes. The greatest obstacle encountered by drugs is the selectivity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which severely limits the number of therapeutic substances able to reach the brain to induce a positive effect. Recently, efforts have thus been made to develop systems that facilitate the passage of drugs through the BBB. Nanomedicine and in particular the targeted delivery of nanoparticle systems are gaining increasing interest among the possible strategies to be used for drug transport to the central nervous system [62,63]. The main objective of the nanoparticles is to deliver a diagnostic or therapeutic agent to a specific site. \n\nThe potential benefit of site-specific delivery includes a reduction of drug dosage, an increase of the bioavailability at the desired site, and a decrease of peripheral side effects. \n\nFor this reason, in recent years, many researchers have focused their studies on the production and use of PGA, PLA, and PLGA nanoparticles that are able to cross the BBB and release drugs for the treatment of neural diseases. At first, the ability of functionalized NPs to cross the BBB was evaluated. Because of the versatility of NPs, it is possible to modify their surface during production to facilitate the interaction with different components of the BBB.",

            "text": "Surface modified fluorescent silica nanoparticle derivatives have shown potential for applying them as nano-vehicles for drug delivery to the brain considering the possibility of attaching various types of molecules to the core [86]. By attaching lactoferrin on the surface of the polyethylene glycol-coated silica nanoparticles, the process of receptor-mediated transcytosis of these nanosystems has been enhanced, with a maximum transport efficiency observed for nanoparticles with 25 nm in diameter. Thus, these nanosystems could be employed for drugs and imaging probes delivery across the blood-brain barrier [87]. The application of silica nanoparticles to deliver nootropics, such as piracetam, pentoxifylline, and pyridoxine, that are designed to enhance the permeability of the blood-brain barrier has been reported. The efficiency of silica nanoparticles as nanocarriers for drugs in comparison to the unencapsulated drugs has been demonstrated, since the latter were not detected in the brains of the mice [58]. \n\nA comparative study between spherical and rod-shaped bare mesoporous silica nanoparticles and poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ethylene imine)-coated mesoporous nanoparticles has been conducted. Although the effect of the shape on the blood-brain barrier permeability, coating the nanoparticles greatly enhanced the cellular uptake for the in vitro models. However, the in vivo imaging experiments on mice showed no blood-brain barrier penetration, which could be associated to the large dimensions of the particles, ranging from 50 to 240 nm [88]. Another study on zebrafish embryos demonstrated that blood-brain barrier penetration is dependent on the surface charge and the size of the nanoparticles, with enhanced transport capacity related to negative charges and reduced sizes [Chen C-T, Chen Y-P, Wu S-H, Chang T-Y, Chou C-M.

            "text": "Brain cancer is one of the prominent dreadful diseases among other CNS related disorders. Although various treatment strategies including surgery, chemotherapy have been available to control the progression of diseases, but still mortality rate against brain cancer is very high [1,2]. This may be attributed to the development of resistance against existing treatment strategies [3]. There is an unmet need to provide better strategies especially to blood-brain barriers that provide enough quantity of drugs to the site of action. It is very difficult to improve the availability of drugs to the brain compartment by passing blood-brain barriers [4 -8]. \n\nMany novel drug delivery systems have been designed to improve the bioavailability of drug to brains including nanoparticles, micellar systems, microemulsion, solid lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, niosomes etc. [9 -12]. Among them, nanoparticles based delivery of drugs to the brain has shown significant potential. Nanometric size of these particulate carriers not only improves the permeation and availability of drugs to the brain, but also provides a large surface area, improves solubility and ability to encapsulate both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. Further, it is also possible to regulate the release of drugs for a prolonged period of time [13,14]. Furthermore, several studies have reported that the presence of surface active agents, permeabilizers, solubilizers cationic and anionic agents at the surface of nanoparticles provides better stability of carrier systems in blood and better brain uptake. Many drugs have been delivered using these strategies that include paclitaxel, doxorubicin, docetaxel, dalargin, methotrexate, kytorphin, loperamide, tubocurarine, MRZ2/576 etc. [15 -23]. \n\nTemozolomide, a prodrug, is a nonfunctional alkylating agent that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. It is derived from a series of modified imidazotetrazinones. It is chemically related to dacarbazine and is the 3-methyl derivative of the experimental anticancer drug mitozolomide [24,25].",

            "text": "Nanoparticles play an indirect yet significant role in enhancing the efficacy of cognitive impairment treatments through several functional mechanisms. These include improving solubility, stability, selectivity, and prolonging drug release, all of which ultimately contribute to better drug bioavailability in the brain, the target organ (Figure 2). One key mechanism is solubility enhancement, where drugs are encapsulated within nanoparticles, maintaining them in a nano-scaled or molecularly dispersed form within the nanoparticle matrix. 50 This approach is particularly beneficial for lipophilic drugs, which can be encapsulated within lipid-based nanoparticle systems where the outer surface is hydrophilic. 51 Such mechanisms are instrumental, especially in facilitating the distribution of drugs in the bloodstream, which typically favors hydrophilic environments. 52 Consequently, nanoparticle-based strategy holds promise for overcoming challenges associated with the blood-brain barrier and enhancing therapeutic outcomes in cognitive impairment treatments. \n\nIn addition to enhancing solubility, nanoparticles also provide protection to loaded drugs during the delivery process. 53 The encapsulated drugs are shielded from potential negative effects that may arise from degradative substances present in the bloodstream or target organs. 54 Consequently, drugs can maintain their high concentration levels to reach the brain as the target organ. This high drug bioavailability indirectly reduces the need for effective dosage compared to unmodified drug administration. 55 Moreover, enhanced bioavailability is supported by nanoparticles' mechanisms to increase selectivity, both actively and passively. 56 Passively, lipid-based nanoparticles exhibit high selectivity towards lipid components in the endothelial cell membrane, such as those found in the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Additionally, nanoparticles can actively target the brain by utilizing specific ligands targeting surface receptors on BBB endothelial cells, such as low-density lipoprotein receptor, insulin receptor, and transferrin receptor. 57,58 These dual mechanismsprotection and enhanced targeting-make nanoparticles highly effective for drug delivery in cognitive impairment treatments. \n\nGiven the chronic nature of cognitive impairment conditions, maintaining drug availability in the brain over extended periods is essential. 59",

The brain is surrounded by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a selective barrier formed by endothelial cells in the cerebral microvessels, which regulates nutrient and ion transport and protects the brain from neurotoxic molecules to maintain brain homeostasis [34]. Unfortunately, most drugs cannot cross the BBB via physiological pathways due to the extreme selectivity of the barrier, which constitutes the greatest obstacle to systemic treatment for most central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In the recent decade, many strategies have been studied, such as topical delivery, implantation of a sustained drug-release scaffold [35], nasal administration [36], ultrasound to temporarily open the BBB [37], and nanoparticle functionalization to enhance BBB penetration [38]. However, local drug delivery methods are considered highly invasive because they require procedural surgery. In addition, the intranasal route has a disadvantage in that the delivered dose varies greatly depending on the condition of the nasal mucosa. Therefore, despite the difficulties across the BBB, the most popular and well-studied delivery route remains the systemic route through the functionalization of nanoparticles. \n\nNanocarriers can traverse the BBB using a variety of physiological pathways, including receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) or adsorption-mediated transcytosis (AMT). To achieve this goal, many nanocarrier systems, such as inorganic, polymeric, or lipid-based nanoparticles, have been developed and shown to cross the BBB due to their tailored surface properties. Numerous studies have demonstrated that physically coating nanoparticles with surfactants and chemical functionalization with specific ligands is a successful strategy to enhance BBB traversing via the physiological pathways mentioned above [39,40]. The size and charge of nanoparticles are also aspects that can affect brain penetration, but if the surface functionalization is done properly, there is no significant difference in a wide size range (from 5 to 400 nm) [41].",

The tightness of the BBB is attributed mainly to the vascular layer of brain capillary endothelial cells which are interconnected side-by-side by tight and adherens junctions. Among the different nanodevices, nanosize drug delivery systems between 1 and 100 nm work as a whole unit in terms of transport to cross BBB [43]. Nanosize brain drug delivery systems may promote the targeting ability of drug in brain and at the same time enhance the permeability of molecules through BBB. However crossing of BBB by the nano drug carriers will depend completely on the physicochemical and biomimetic features and does not depend on the chemical structure of drug, inside the nanoparticles [44]. Nanosize drug carriers which do not cross BBB generally can be made \"stealth\" coated with some polymeric materials or other chemicals to avoid the reticuloendothelial system, to display long circulation time and stability in blood, and may be functionalized to successfully cross the BBB and target brain [45].",

            "text": "The tight junctions of the microvascular endothelial cell lining in the cerebral capillary walls form the BBB [14]. The presence of various cell types (astrocytes, pericytes, microglia and endothelial cells) and the high selectivity of the BBB maintain a highly controlled environment in the brain. The entry of pathogens, large or hydrophilic molecules and the diffusion of solutes in the blood is restricted, whereas some small molecules (such as O2 and CO2) can move across the BBB through diffusion. Despite this, only approximately 2% of all small molecules can cross the BBB [14]. Therefore, due to difficulties in crossing the BBB and the removal of drugs by efflux pumps, drug delivery into the brain via the oral and intravenous routes is particularly challenging. Nanoparticles present unique opportunities in crossing the BBB owing to the flexibility in the modifications of their sizes, shapes, surfaces and physiochemical properties based on different synthesis and functionalisation processes. Nanoparticles are small particles (typically 1 to 100 nm in diameter) that can be synthesised from a range of organic, inorganic and carbon-based materials. Nanoparticles show size-dependent permeation across the BBB. A 2020 study investigated the optimal brain delivery size using gold nanoparticles enhanced by focused-ultrasound-induced BBB opening. It was reported that nanoparticles ranging from 3 to 200 nm are able to permeate through the BBB, and while smaller nanoparticles show greater permeation across the BBB, larger nanoparticles (200 nm) show greater accumulation in the brain due to slower clearance from the blood [15]. Furthermore, different functionalisation and conjugation strategies, for instance, the incorporation of specific ligands, have been shown to improve the targeting effects of drug delivery nanosystems. Here, we review various nanosystems that have been proposed as potential therapeutic agents against AD and summarise their key properties (Table 1). Liposomes are small, spherical vesicles that contain one or multiple phospholipid bilayers, which can be synthesised from cholesterol or non-toxic phospholipids.",

To overcome such problems various approaches are used. \n\nThe liposomes offer a promising tool to resolve the low permeability and high selectivity of the BBB. \n\nLiposomes are non-toxic, biocompatible and biodegradable drug carrier systems. Their structure which is composed of phospholipids with an aqueous reservoir allows the encapsulation of a wide variety of hydrophilic and hydrophobic agents [1][2][3][4]. Their phospholipid bilayer structure, similar to physiological membranes, makes them more compatible with the lipoid layer of BBB and increase the permeability of the drug. \n\nLiposomes allow relatively higher intracellular uptake than other particulate systems, due to their sub-cellular size. They are highly studied for the treatment of central nervous system's pathologies such as infections, cerebral ischemia, brain tumors and neurodegenerative diseases, for instance Parkinson's and Alzheimer's [5,6]. Several studies have reported an increased transport across the BBB of encapsulated drugs both through intracerebral and intravenous administration [7]. \n\nThe surface can be modified with functional ligands to enhance the brain targeting. The functionalized nanoparticles with structures able to interact with targets on the surface of the BBB represents a tool of enormous potentiality to ameliorate the bioavailability and to reduce side effects. Several studies on animal models of Alzheimer's disease demonstrated the efficacy of functionalized liposomes to cross BBB and ameliorate impaired cognitions [8][9][10]. \n\nIn a previous research studies, the authors developed solid lipid nanoparticles [11] and polymeric nanoparticles [12] to deliver the andrographolide (AG), a natural compound, through the central nervous system and ameliorate its biopharmaceutical characteristics.",

With an increase in life expectancy, it has been reported that diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, stroke and brain tumors, along with neuropsychological disorders, are also being reported at an alarmingly high rate. Despite various therapeutic methods for treating brain disorders, drug delivery to the brain has been challenging because of a very complex Blood Brain Barrier, which precludes most drugs from entering the brain in effective concentrations. Nano-carrier-based drug delivery systems have been reported widely by researchers to overcome this barrier layer. These systems due to their small size, offer numerous advantages; however, their short residence time in the body owing to opsonization hinders their success in vivo. This review article focuses on the various aspects of modifying the surfaces of these nano-carriers with polymers, surfactants, protein, antibodies, cell-penetrating peptides, integrin binding peptides and glycoproteins such as transferrin & lactoferrin leading to enhanced residence time, desirable characteristics such as the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), increased bioavailability in regions of the brain and targeted drug delivery.",

            "text": "As the world's population ages, neurological disorders are becoming more prevalent, drawing the attention of researchers worldwide (Deuschl et al., 2020). Over the last 30 years, neurological diseases have led to a dramatic rise in fatalities and disabilities, making them a major global public health issue (Feigin et al., 2020). The production of drugs for brain disorders on a global scale is expected to increase dramatically in the near future. Drug research for neurological disorders has been far from satisfactory when compared to that of other diseases; one of the major hindrances to the successful creation of medications for the management of neurological disorders is the inability for most drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Banks, 2016;Yang et al., 2023). The BBB is a complex and delicate structure responsible for controlling the transport of substances between the brain and the blood, preserving ion homeostasis, and protecting brain nerve cells from any potentially harmful chemicals in the blood; unfortunately, it also blocks up to 95% of substances from becoming drugs for neurological disorders (Greene et al., 2019). To improve drug delivery to the brain, researchers have been working to create systems that are capable of efficiently crossing the BBB. To this end, novel drug delivery systems, such as liposomes, nanoparticles, and micelles, have been developed (Pardridge, 2022). Liposomes have become a widely used platform in drug delivery systems for the treatment of neurological disorders due to their enhanced bioavailability and stability, reduction in toxicity, and targeted release (Duong et al., 2023). \n\nCommon modifications that help liposomes cross the BBB include the following: (i) Surface functionalization of liposomes using polyethyleneglycol, which enables a longer circulation of liposomes and avoids rapid reticulo-endothelial system clearance (Lam et al., 2023); (ii) Surface design of bioactive ligands to increase the targeting of liposomes by enabling ligands to specifically bind to receptors or transporters that are highly expressed on brain endothelial cells.",

Using TAT-modified gold nanoparticles, Krpetic and co-workers were able to monitor and describe the intracellular trafficking of nanoparticles after endosomal escape [30]. They found that, after an initial phase of accumulation in the cytoplasm, nucleus and mitochondria, the particles were confined to vesicular bodies and eventually released again in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic delivery of specific payloads and materials was shown to enhance the anticancer properties of the system. Liu and colleagues showed that peritumoral injection of TATmodified silver nanoparticles efficiently inhibited multidrug resistance phenomena in vitro and in vivo [31]. Due to enhanced cellular uptake and a consequent increase in cellular drug accumulation, TAT-modified particles exerted a tumor growth inhibition power fourfold higher than unmodified particles [23]. \n\nCPPs have been also investigated for their capability to deliver drugs to the central nervous system. In fact, nanoparticles modified with TAT in combination with polyethylene glycol (PEG) favored brain accumulation and a higher penetration of the blood-brain barrier [32,33]. Although surface modification of particles with TAT does not ensure specific targeting of nervous tissue, TAT-modified particles can be used to treat severe diseases like brain tumors, thanks to their ability to accumulate in abnormal tumor vasculature [34].",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintains homeostasis in the brain by selective transport of metabolic compounds, while excluding harmful compounds from the blood circulation. These barrier properties prevent adequate BBB crossing of many high potential ''would-be'' central nervous system (CNS) drugs. Most hydrophilic molecules are not able to cross the BBB due to the presence of tight junctions between the brain endothelial cells preventing paracellular transport. Transport of other more lipophilic small molecules that could potentially cross the barrier is often limited because they are substrate for efflux transporters like the p-glycoprotein (Pgp), multidrug related protein (MRP) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters [1][2][3]. Many strategies to enhance the BBB transport of drugs have therefore been investigated. These strategies are either focused on locally circumventing the BBB by direct injections in the brain or through the blood stream for widespread delivery [4][5][6][7].\n\nFor the blood-to-brain delivery of drugs via the blood stream, advanced drug delivery systems like nanocarriers can best be used. Some examples of commonly used nanocarriers are liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, albumin nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles [8]. Drug delivery using nanocarriers may increase the bioavailability and stability of drugs and decrease the (peripheral) toxicity. Furthermore, drugs delivered by liposomes are described to be able to bypass the efflux transporters at the BBB [9,10]. Moreover, liposomal formulation allows a wide range of compounds, like small molecules, peptides, proteins and RNA to be encapsulated without changing their function and protecting them against degradation and potential immune responses. Coating of liposomes with polyethylene glycol (PEG) further ensures a prolonged circulation time in plasma allowing prolonged dosing intervals. As a result, liposomes have been used in clinical practice for several years and are shown to be effective and safe for human use (e.g. Doxil \u00d5 , Ambisome \u00d5 ). Liposomes can furthermore be functionalized with ligands to target specific cell types",

            "text": "Thanks to nanoformulation and conjugation, we have gained enhanced drug solubility and bioavailability due to a nanoparticle's ability to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs. This achievement has therefore ensured a higher amount of a pharmacological agent to reach the brain. Most nanoparticles are designed to overcome Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) penetration limits. The BBB serves as a highly selective interface, limiting the permeability of substances from the bloodstream into the central nervous system (CNS) and thereby presenting a formidable challenge for drug delivery to the brain. Nanomedicine offers a promising approach to overcome this barrier through the use of nanoparticles, which can be engineered to improve drug solubility, protect therapeutic agents from degradation and facilitate targeted delivery to specific brain tissues. This innovative strategy enhances the efficacy and precision of treatments for neurological disorders. Additionally, as previously mentioned, the functionalization of nanoparticles with targeting ligands (which can include specific peptides or even antibodies with a high affinity) could reduce off-target effects, minimizing unwanted side effects. Importantly, nanoparticles can also be developed to provide sustained therapeutic effects, therefore reducing the need of frequent, repeated dosing. Several laboratories have focused on the use of temperature-responsive nanoparticles (for example, hydrogel nanoparticles) that allow for the release of conjugated compounds in response to temperature changes, therefore, allowing on-demand drug release in the brain [188].",

Nanotechnology has emerged as a promising tool to tackle these problems by providing a novel platform to improve the transport of drugs across the physiological barrier. Nanoparticles (promising carriers) have become the major focus of drug delivery research for drug delivery to the brain due to unique characteristics such as small size, enhanced drug solubility, the ability for multi-functionality, a controlled drug release profile, and the potential for site-specific targeting [20]. The nanoparticle surface can be readily modified to incorporate the targeting ligands to bind receptors and transporters at the BBB enables them to bypass receptor mediated endocytosis to improve CNS selectivity and permeability. Various classes of nanoparticles including polymeric, metallic and lipid nanoparticles can also enter the brain and cross the BBB through different endocytotic mechanisms [21].",

A drug-carrying nanoparticle based on pterostilbene (Pte) and black phosphorus (BP) was developed by Yin et al. Polydopamine (PDA) was applied to modify it, resulting in the formation of the BP-Pte@PDA delivery system. This delivery system specifically degrades and releases the drug in ischemic brain regions, significantly reducing infarction, improving neurological function, and inhibiting apoptosis [82]. Qi et al. created a dual-modified liposome using lactoferrin and musk, which effectively crossed the BBB and enhanced the brain-targeting efficacy of docetaxel, resulting in more potent glioma treatment [83]. Wiwatchaitawee et al. coupled polyethylene glycol (PEG) with PAMAM or PEI, which could mitigate their toxicity, and then evaluated biodistribution in a healthy mouse model, which was measured to be highly active and safe [84].

The presence of barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier are a major obstacle to delivering drugs to the brain (only small molecules can cross these barriers), reducing the efficacy of various therapies. Recently, it has been identified that membrane-bound vesicles of brain endothelial cells influence the formation of nanotubes involved in the construction of the BBB (Mentor and Fisher, 2021). In addition to crossing the BBB is necessary to target specific cell types such as neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia involved in specific brain diseases. Several DDSs, including nanoparticles, extracellular vesicles, and artificial vesicles have been studied for brain drug delivery (Dong 2018;Nuzzo et al., 2021). Vesicles derived from cells and brain tissue have been fabricated recently as DDS. In this review, we analyzed these new systems and their potential as DDS to contrast the brain disorders.",

            "text": "Many targeting approaches utilize such mechanisms that exploit extracellular barriers to ensure efficient delivery of drugs. Nanocarriers following intravenous administration are rapidly recognized by reticuloendothelial system (liver and spleen macrophages), making it difficult for drug to reach its site of action at the minimum effective concentration [20]. This owes to opsonization of particle surface with certain plasma proteins (albumin, apolipoprotein-E, etc.) that make them recognizable by body's immune system and thus are rapidly evacuated from circulation. Therefore, the extent of opsonization will determine the fate of nanoparticles in vivo [21]. \n\nRecognition of nanoparticles by RES and their uptake by macrophages can be avoided by modifying surface properties of these carrier systems. One of such modifications is by making surface of nanoparticles to be very hydrophilic. This avoids adsorption of opsonins and ensures nanoparticles to pass unrecognized by RES [22]. Surface of nanoparticles has been made more hydrophilic by increasing the thickness of coating layer of poloxamer and poloxamine. Coating layers up to 10 nm were considered necessary to bypass RES [23]. \n\nMany drug molecules have shown poor penetration across the blood-brain barrier due to their inherent nature. These molecules have been successfully delivered to the brain when incorporated into nanocarriers [24]. Coated nanoparticles have been studied for delivery of drug into the brain. Polybutylcyanoacrylate (PBCA) nanoparticles coated with polysorbate-80 have been studied to improve penetration of drug across the blood-brain barrier [25]. In a study, transport of nanoparticles across BBB was investigated. Penetration of nanoparticles across BBB was three to four times increased when charged nanoparticles were coated with dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline and cholesterol-based lipid bilayer [26]. Multifunctional nanoparticles have also been investigated for delivery of proteins and peptides. These biological molecules are associated with rapid degradation at acidic pH of GIT and by activity of proteolytic enzymes that owe to their shorter half-life.",

            "text": "In such cases, binding competition on the transporter with endogenous products or nutrients occurs and limits the drug transfer [13]. The blood-brain barrier can be a major impediment for the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system, because many drugs are unable to reach the brain at therapeutic concentrations [13]. \n\nLocalized and controlled delivery of medications at a desired site is preferred, because it reduces toxicity and increases treatment efficacy [12]. The various strategies explored to increase drug delivery into the brain, include chemical delivery systems, such as lipid-mediated transport, biological delivery systems, in which pharmaceuticals are re-engineered to cross the BBB via specific endogenous transporters localized in the brain capillary endothelium, disrupting the BBB [13]. For instance, through modification of tight junctions, which cause a controlled and transient increase in the permeability of brain capillaries, a molecular Trojan horse, such as a peptidomimetic monoclonal antibody can transport large molecules including antibodies, recombinant proteins, nonviral gene medicines or RNA interference drugs across the BBB and particulate drug carrier systems [11]. Research have shown promising methods of nanotechnology delivery systems include liposomes, microspheres, nanoparticles, nanogels, and bionanocapsules to enhance drug delivery to the brain [10]. \n\nAnother way to increase or decrease brain delivery of drugs is to modulate the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) whose substrates are actively pumped out of a cell into the capillary lumen. Many P-gp inhibitors, or inducers, are available to enhance the therapeutic effects of centrally acting drugs or to reduce central adverse effects of peripherally active drugs [13].",

Ideally, these nanosystems should also be easy to produce, cost-effective, and easy to scale up [108]. Diverse nanocarriers have been explored based on the method of preparation, type of materials used, drug loading, and release behavior. Special attention has been given to liposomes, micelles, inorganic nanoparticles, polymeric and dendrimers-based nanoparticles, exosomes, quantum dots, and carbon nanotubes [109][110][111]. \n\nIn the same way, various methods and routes of delivery have been investigated for their ability to enhance the efficiency of delivering nanoparticles to the brain and allowing them passage through the brain barriers.

However, the BBB also significantly precludes the delivery of drugs to the brain, thus, preventing the therapy of a number of neurological disorders. As a consequence, several strategies are currently being sought after to enhance the delivery of drugs across the BBB. Within this review, the recently born strategy of brain drug delivery based on the use of nanoparticles, multifunctional drug delivery systems with size in the order of one-billionth of meters, is described. The review also includes a brief description of the structural and physiological features of the barrier and of the most utilized nanoparticles for medical use. Finally, the potential neurotoxicity of nanoparticles is discussed, and future technological approaches are described. The strong efforts to allow the translation from preclinical to concrete clinical applications are worth the economic investments.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the most extensive of barriers that protect the brain's internal milieu and maintain its homeostasis [1]. Structurally, the BBB is formed by brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC). While sharing some features with other endothelial cells, BCEC have a number of marked differences such as the structure of their tight junctions, lack of fenestrations, diminished pinocytosis, high mitochondrial activity, high percentage of proteins in the cell membrane and the expression of various BBB markers. Key components of the BBB-the paracellular barrier formed by circumferential tight junctions between adjacent BCEC and the transcellular barrier consisting of cell membranes, efflux transporters and various enzymatic filters-act together to form a dynamic interface that incorporates physical, metabolic and enzymatic mechanisms to screen the brain from harmful agents and ensure that its tightly controlled extracellular fluid microenvironment remains resistant to the much more volatile environment of blood [2,3]. Unfortunately, this barrier function also makes the BBB filter out the vast majority of drugs, making the treatment of various brain disorders highly dependent on drug delivery limitations. The problem is widely acknowledged, and it has been estimated that 100% of large molecules (over 500 Da) and 98% of small molecules do not reach the brain after systemic administration, making the central nervous system drug market largely underpenetrated [4]. \n\nNanoparticles, due to their high drug load capacity and possible functionalization for facilitating BBB permeability, as well as imaging and targeting, have emerged as a possible solution to this challenge [5][6][7]. They come in a variety of sizes and shapes and can be further tailored to desired needs by surface modification. They can carry many drug molecules without requiring chemical modification of the same, which is important for preserving drug activity. Unlike traditional drug formulations, where drug release is spontaneous and immediate, often requiring frequent administrations, drug delivery using nanoparticles can be controlled and sustained, thus increasing target availability. Both qualities may further be enhanced by functionalization, e.g. by capping porous particles with 'gatekeepers' or using cleavable agents, respectively.",

Gold nanoparticles contain an inner inorganic layer surrounded by a nonpolar organic monolayer that stabilizes the inner core and interacts with the environmental targets [58]. This approach enhances solubility and protects the inner core from degradation. The main difference between gold nanoparticles and the previously discussed delivery systems is that the payload binds to the surface of the gold core instead of encapsulation [59]. Gold nanocarriers are capable of delivering a wide range of therapeutics range from antibiotics to DNA, due to their ability to conjugate to a diverse set of molecules [60,61]. Like other nanoparticle systems, gold nanoparticles are adaptable to surface modifications allowing for brain and/or cell type-specific targeting [62]. With their small size (<100 nm), gold nanoparticles have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier in multiple preclinical studies [63,64]. However, in some experiments, unmodified, highly charged gold nanoparticles have been shown to induce an immune response in the brain, which may limit their therapeutic potential as a SUD treatment [65] (Fig. 1). To address this potential liability, surface modifications that alter the positive charge of the gold nanoparticles have been shown to minimize the potential toxic side effects [66].",

The size and surface charge are also important parameters in a nanostructured system because these characteristics interfere directly in biological processes, such as the transport across biological membranes and the recognition by M/Ms and biodistribution. Another important factor that must be taken into account in the design strategies used to improve AIDS treatment is the brain delivery system of antiretroviral drugs. Because of the restricted entry of anti-HIV drugs, the brain is thought to form a viral sanctuary, and the treatment and control of HIV within this reservoir must be primordial. Nanoparticles can enhance the brain-drug delivery by three major pathways, which include the following: i) increasing the local drug gradient at the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) by passive targeting, ii) allowing drug-trafficking by non-specific or receptor-mediated endocytosis and iii) blocking drug efflux transporters at the BBB (Wong et al., 2010). Consequently, the use of nanocarriers should help to achieve higher concentrations of encapsulated drugs and also allow their prolonged residence in the CNS. One of the most used polymers for the development of nanoparticles intended for brain delivery is poly-(butylcyanoacrylate) (PBCA) (Koziara et al., 2006). Studies have shown that the surface modification of PBCA nanoparticles using other polymers or surfactant agents, such as polysorbate 80, could increase the transport of particles through the BBB. Polysorbate 80 has been found to increase the translocation of nanoparticles by increasing the particle interaction with the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated endocytic pathway in brain endothelial cells and by inhibition the efflux function of P-gp (Goppert & Muller, 2005). Kuo and Chen (2006) showed that methylmethacrylate-sulfopropylmethacrylate (MMSPM) nanoparticles were able to significantly increase the BBB permeability of zidovudine and lamivudine by 100%, using blood-brain-microvascular endothelial cells model. In the same study, PBCA nanoparticles increased",

            "text": "The use of nanoparticles as drug delivery systems allows controlled and site-specific delivery of therapeutic agents. Nanoparticles are able to protect the drug from biological or chemical degradation and help to evade drug-efflux mechanisms as P-gycoprotein transporter in the blood-brain barrier, due to encapsulation of the drug [133]. To ensure the release of the content on the site of action, nanoparticles may be linked to specific targeting ligands [15,133]. \n\nPardeshi et al. described some useful properties nanoparticles should show for efficient N2B delivery: non-toxic, biocompatible, as well as biodegradable, physical stability, cost effective manufacturing process and scale-up, compatible to link with small molecules, proteins, peptides or nucleic acids. Furthermore, formulating into nanoparticles can improve the drug's stability and reduce excipient-induced drug alterations to a minimum. To reduce the frequency of drug administration and improve patient's compliance particulate formulations can provide controlled drug release profiles [133]. \n\nThere are three options of tailoring nanoparticle uptake that are suitable for N2B transport. The first one is to enhance the mucoadhesion to prolong the time of nanoparticle interaction with the mucosa. This will enhance the probability of the drug passing the epithelium and, finally, reaching the brain. The second one is the ability of different materials used for particulate formulations to decrease the barrier function of tight junctions. These specialized particles would be able to transiently open tight junctions and thus allow the drug to enter the nasal mucosa. The last opportunity is to enhance the chance of endocytosis of nanoparticles. Once endocytosed, the nanoparticles could release their drug content, which would be further delivered to the brain [68,[133][134][135]. \n\nThe use of nano-and microparticles for drug delivery brings along some benefits, such as a controlled and sustained drug release or by shielding the drug against environmental influences. This is in particular important when delivering proteins and peptides.",

            "text": "Interaction of a nanoparticulate system with biological cells is very much influenced by the functionality of the nanoparticle surface. In order to achieve high specificity, the nanoparticle surface can either be modified by conjugating it with an antibody as already discussed, or coating it with different surfactants. 140,141 Bioadhesive surfactants, such as PEG-D-\u03b1-tocopheryl, polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate or polyvinyl alcohol can certainly enhance adhesion and adsorption by intestinal cells, while masking efflux mechanisms. However, targeting specificity will primarily depend on the physicochemical and biochemical properties of the surfactant. Previous reports underscore the importance of polysorbate 80-coated nanoparticles for brain-specific delivery. Polysorbate 80 surface-modified doxorubicin-loaded and gemcitabine-loaded polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles showed enhanced brain specificity and efficacy compared with unmodified nanoparticles, highlighting the importance of surface modification by surfactants. 142,143 Another surfactant reported to have the ability to enhance brain permeability is poloxamer 188 (F68) which was found to increase the delivery of drug-loaded polybutylcyanoacrylate and poly(lactide-coglycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles to the brain in rats. 144,145  study conducted by Kulkarni et al demonstrated more effective delivery of F68-modified PLGA nanoparticles than F127 and polysorbate 80-modified nanoparticles into the brain. The plausible mechanism behind enhanced brain permeation by these surfactants is that they inhibit the efflux action of P-glycoprotein and solubilize the cell membrane lipids of brain endothelial cells for entry. 146 Also, polysorbate 80 and F68 surface-modified nanoparticles adsorb apolipoprotein E, apolipoprotein B, or both, mimic low-density lipoproteins, and enter the brain via receptor-mediated endocyto sis.",

            "text": "There has been an increasing population worldwide suffering various central nervous system disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, cerebral ischemia, and brain tumor. The treatment for these diseases is still confronting a big challenge due to the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents most drug molecules from entering the brain. The BBB controls substance flow in and out of the brain with precision and strictness, so as to maintain the internal environment of the brain. Besides the physical barrier characterized by the tight junction, the brain capillary endothelial cells highly express the active efflux system. 1 The system that is representative of P-glycoprotein (member of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette P-gp) greatly reinforces BBB function by effectively removing drugs from the brain and pumping them back into blood. 2 Therefore, the development of brain-targeting drug-delivery systems has become an urgent matter. \n\nA number of attempts have been made to overcome the barrier. Various nanoparticle delivery systems were designed for brain targeting, including liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and polymeric micelles. Among these, polymeric micelles have emerged as an ideal candidate for brain-targeting delivery. The amphiphilic copolymer can self-assemble into micelles in aqueous solution with a core-shell structure. The hydrophobic core acts as the drug-loading depot, with the surrounding hydrophilic block to increase stabilization. Incorporation of low molecules into micelles can effectively enhance drug solubility and improve drug pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. 3 Polymeric micelles possess many advantageous properties: small particle size that allows escaping from the reticuloendothelial system, stability in plasma, and flexibility of modification with targeting ligands. Compared to liposomes, polymeric micelles require less excipients and are easier to formulate, with high physical stability and sustained drug release. 4 4][15] Known as a biodegradable and biocompatible material, CS with its low molecular weight is studied widely as a drug carrier due to its good solubility in physiological conditions. 16",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the major problem for the treatment of brain diseases because we need to be able to deliver drugs from the vascular system into the central nervous system (CNS). There are no drug therapies for a wide range of CNS diseases and these include neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases and cerebral ischemia. Therefore, the focus of this chapter is to discuss how nanoparticles (NPs) can be modified to transport different drug molecules for the treatment of brain diseases. In essence, NPs\u2019 surface can be functionalized with molecules such as peptides, antibodies and RNA aptamers and these macromolecules can be attached to the receptors present at the BBB endothelial cell surface, which allows the NPs cross the barrier and subsequently deliver pharmaceuticals to the brain for the therapeutic and/or imaging of neurological disorders. In fact, part of the difficulty in finding an effective treatment for these CNS disorders is that there is not yet an efficient delivery method for drug delivery across the BBB. However, over the last several years, researches have started to understand some of the design rules to efficiently deliver NPs to the brain.",

The presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that has a highly selective permeability system is the main problem when delivering therapeutic agents to the brain [30]. Nanoparticles can be the possible solution for delivering drugs across the barrier. The BBB is made up of specific vascular endothelial cells that bound with neurons, pericytes, and astrocytes. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have the potential to deliver the desired quantity of the drug to the brain. Currently, micelles, dendrimers, liposomes, and carbon nanotubes as nanocarriers are being investigated to overcome the blood-brain barrier [31]. Size, charge, and surface ligands of the nanoparticles can potentially be considered for overcoming the BBB. Nanoparticles with a smaller size than 200 nm have more chances to cross the BBB via the clathrinmediated mechanism [32]. Positively charged nanoparticles preferentially use the adsorptive transcytosis pathway than the neutral or negatively charged [33] In addition, coating the nanoparticles with surface ligands increases the possibilities of crossing the BBB. For example, nanoparticles coated with cell-penetrating peptides can avoid the endocytic pathway and deliver the nanoparticles directly in the cell cytoplasm [34]. Some researcher group has taken the advantage of transport-receptor mediated transcytosis (GLUT1 or albumin transporters, LF receptors, LRP1 (targeted by angiopep-2), or Tf receptors) to overcome the BBB [35][36][37]. An interesting example is the use of MRIguided focused ultrasound to locally disrupt the BBB [38]. Overall,    nanoparticle conjugation with therapeutic agents may prove to be a promising tool in brain drug targeting for safer therapies.",

            "text": "The diagnosis and therapy of central nervous system (CNS) and brain pathologies, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy and glaucoma, are inadequate because of the limited ability to deliver drugs and imaging contrast agents across the blood brain barrier (BBB) [1]. The BBB separates circulating blood from the brain extracellular fluid (BECF) in the CNS and protects the brain from various circulating toxins and infected cells [2]. It is estimated that more than 98% of small molecular weight drugs and practically 100% of large molecular weight drugs developed for CNS pathologies do not readily cross the BBB [3]. Therefore, it is extremely important to investigate the BBB penetration mechanism in order to treat and prevent brain disorders. To improve brain penetration for therapeutic agents, medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical technology-based strategies have been explored and developed widely [4].\n\nDuring the last decade, nanoparticles have gained attention as promising drug delivery agents that can transport across the BBB and increase the uptake of appropriate drugs in the brain [1,[4][5][6]. Nanoparticles increase the duration of drug circulation in the blood, which facilitates drug ability to interact with specific molecules expressed on the luminal side of BBB endothelial cells, and consequently to cross the BBB. In addition, nanoparticles can be engineered to provide designed functionalities using standard procedures in nanotechnology [7][8][9][10]. The type and number of linkers on the surface of the nanoparticles, as well as the size of the nanoparticles themselves, can be modulated to increase their ability to cross the BBB. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have attracted enormous scientific interest due to properties that make them useful for a large variety of biological and chemical applications [11][12][13][14]. Their major advantages are the ability to be synthesized at diverse sizes, their chemical stability and their unique optical properties [7,15,16]. Their surface has a strong binding affinity towards thiol, disulfide and amine groups, which allows by simple chemistry, surface conjugation with various peptides, proteins, antibodies and other biomolecules",

            "text": "Diseases affecting the nervous system represent a worldwide public health problem, particularly neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke, multiple sclerosis, and dementia [101]. These might result from different causes, including genetic disorders; neurodegeneration and inflammation; lifestyle; structural, biochemical, or electrical abnormalities in the brain; and traumatic brain injury [102]. \n\nThe major challenge of treating these conditions results from the selective permeability of brain barriers, namely, the BBB, that limit most drug molecules from reaching their therapeutic targets in the brain. This blockage is due to the presence of active efflux systems and tight junction overexpression, of which ABC protein superfamily transporters, such as the ABCB1, are the most effective in removing drugs from the brain and pumping them back into the blood [103]. \n\nAs a consequence, higher doses are required, causing toxic effects and limiting the treatment effectiveness of central nervous system (CNS) diseases [104]. In recent years, several strategies have been developed to enhance drug delivery to the brain, with some being more beneficial and minimally invasive. They include osmotic disruption of the tight junctions, chemical modification of drugs, ultrasound-mediated BBB opening, intrathecal therapies, local delivery by neurosurgery, and nanoparticle mediation. However, some of these approaches are risky, as they damage and compromise the integrity of the membranes, causing the influx of unwanted molecules in the CNS. Among these, nanoparticle-based approaches are emerging as effective delivery systems. Nanoparticles (NPs) are nanoscale particles ranging from 1 nm to 1000 nm in diameter, employed to encapsulate therapeutic agents within or conjugate onto their surfaces [105]. Its benefits include the capability of creating small and more stable structures to encapsulate poorly soluble drugs, prolonging their circulation time, improving their bioavailability, and controlling the release rate. Additionally, NP surfaces can be functionalized with specific moieties for targeted delivery to a region of interest [106].",

            "text": "In recent years, the field of nanotechnology has emerged as an important area of biomedical research. Nanoparticles (NPs) are studied in a variety of biological systems, and the use of NPs as novel therapeutic agents has been described in several experimental systems, such as cancer, eye diseases, diabetes, coronary artery disease, etc. [1][2][3][4]. While this disease model has shown promise for the use of NPs and nanocarrier drug delivery systems, the issues of biodistribution and toxicity need to be addressed. The nanosize dimensions of NPs have been reported to facilitate the crossing of several biological barriers such as the skin, tight junctions of various epithelial layers, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [5,6]. \n\nThe BBB is a tight barrier of cells which separates the circulating blood from the central nervous system (CNS). The walls of BBB capillaries are composed of brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC), which form tight junctions. Tight junctions contain integral membrane proteins that form a seal between adjacent endothelial cells. In addition, accessory structures that surround the BCECs include pericytes, associated astrocytes and neurons [7][8][9]. While the BBB is essential for maintaining CNS function and homeostasis, it is also a major obstacle in the treatment of many brain diseases. The poor permeability of various drugs and delivery systems across the BBB is primarily due to tight junctions, lack of capillary fenestrations and presence of efflux transporters. The BBB can reportedly block more than 98% of CNS drugs [10]. Consequently, finding new ways to deliver therapeutic drugs to the CNS safely and effectively is essential. \n\nVarious drug delivery and targeting strategies to overcome the BBB are under investigation, and a number of nanoparticle delivery systems have shown promise [10][11][12][13]. One approach is the use of surface-modified polymeric nanoparticles as drug carriers, such as dendrimers.",

One of the most challenging organs to deliver drugs to is the brain because it is protected by a blood-brain barrier which is composed of the basal membrane, and tightly packed endothelial and neuroglial cells. However, the brain is understandably also one of the most helpful targets for treating maladies from depression to tumors [62]. The brain has two main methods by which it allows molecules across the barrier. First, compounds that are at physiological pH, lipophilic, and have low molecular weight can pass through by diffusion [63]. Second, compounds that resemble specific proteins and other components needed for brain function have specified receptors in the blood-brain barrier which actively transport these [63]. The brain also has an impressive ability to keep things out. Junctions between cells are tight and circumferential such that there are no continuous pathways between them and pumps operating in the cell reject lipophilic compounds that should not be allowed to cross [32]. To get around this, nanoparticles are often coated or surface treated to produce more favorable interaction properties. Nanoparticles coated with polysorbate-80 and polysorbate-85 were found to effectively transport drugs through the barrier [32]. Later work by Schroeder et al., proposed that these coatings help bind nanoparticles to the lining of the capillaries such that they induce a large concentration gradient which facilitates diffusion or purposefully induce phagocytosis processes in the epithelial cells [64]. Kreuter found that nanoparticles coated with polysorbate-80 transported drugs through the barrier with a 20-fold improvement over the uncoated nanoparticles [62]. However, he concluded that it is because the polysorbate-80 coating attracts apolipoprotein E from the blood to the surface [62].",

            "text": "The choice of the nanometre range for drug delivery loaded with Class II drugs is also linked to their ability to either cross biological barriers themselves, or to allow loaded drugs to cross them. This is a key factor for some specialised barriers, such as barriers between the blood and neural tissues, and in particular, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which are very difficult to cross by drugs because of their function for maintaining the homeostasis of the brain by regulating the chemical environment, immune cell transport, and entry of xenobiotics. The BBB represents the most important factor limiting the development of drugs for the central nervous system, and it is characterized by relatively impermeable endothelial cells with tight junctions, enzymatic activity, and active efflux transport systems. The tight junctions formed by brain microvascular endothelial cells regulate paracellular transport, whereas transcellular transport is regulated by specialised transporters, pumps, and receptors. Nanocarriers can open the tight junctions between endothelial cells, transcy-tosis through the endothelial cell layer, and endocytosis by endothelial cells, releasing the drug inside the cell. Furthermore, coating agents, such as polysorbates, inhibit the transmembrane efflux systems (i.e., P-glycoprotein). Various novel drug delivery systems, such as liposomes, microspheres, polymeric nanoparticles, lipid nanoparticles, and inorganic systems, have been proposed to overcome the limitations imposed by the BBB [40].",

The treatment of central nervous system disorders is challenging due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. Promising approaches to address these issues and improve the efficacy of CNS disease therapies are provided by nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems. Nanoparticles, such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and solid lipid nanoparticles, can be modified to enhance targeting, stability, and drug-release patterns. They allow for the encapsulation of a variety of therapeutic compounds and can be functionalized with ligands or antibodies for active targeting, minimizing off-target effects. Additionally, nanoparticles can circumvent drug resistance processes and provide versatile platforms for applications that combine therapeutic and diagnostic functions. Although the delivery of CNS medications using nanoparticles has advanced significantly, there are still challenges to be resolved. These include understanding the BBB interactions, doing long-term safety studies, and scaling up the production. However, improvements in nanotechnology and a deeper comprehension of CNS disorders provide opportunities to enhance treatment results and address unmet medical requirements. Future research and ongoing clinical trials are required to further explore the potential of nanoparticle drug delivery for CNS disorders.",

            "text": "The prevalence of brain disorders is increasing worldwide, and there is a need for new therapeutic strategies to reach brain cells. The neurodegenerative conditions, including AD and PD, result in atrophy of the brain and rob the cognitive function of elders. Though the liposomes are proved to be good carriers, and therapeutically experimented with for brain disorders, most of the studies were demonstrated on animal models. Most of the drugs are medicated orally for the management of neurodegenerative disorders. At the same time, they are aided in symptoms management, not reaching the target properly due to their metabolism by the liver [173]. The preset barriers of CNS are composed of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and the BBB [26]. These barriers not only impede the medications for AD or PD but also meningitis viral and bacterial infections, psychiatric disorders, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome [174]. The boundaries set around the BBB offer new limits for nanotherapeutics to surpass in the delivery system's domains such as affinity, absorption, and function. Site-specific delivery facilitates bypass of oral and intestinal absorption of drugs and enhances the bioavailability at the target site. The liposomal formulations need to be improved to enhance the efficacy and specificity of chemotherapeutics, subsequently reducing the adverse effects of drugs. \n\nThe surface modifications with peptides, proteins, aptamers, and antibodies perhaps enhance the BBB penetrating ability of liposomes; meanwhile, the formation of antibodies and clearance of liposomes from circulation need to be addressed. Albeit the liposome formulations are proven to treat brain disorders, and some of them are under clinical trials, there are some downsides from the view immune system. Liposomes and their formulations are readily cleared by the mechanism of opsonization, RES, ABC, and CARPA. Novel methodologies are needed to overcome or reduce the immunogenicity against the liposomes or PEGylated liposomes. Surface orchestration allows the nanomaterials to cross BBB and avoids the phagocytic opsonization process [175].

Delivering drugs and therapeutics to the brain is even more challenging due to the presence of the blood\u2212brain barrier (BBB). Overcoming this barrier to deliver drugs to the brain is a major first step toward treating neurological diseases by circumventing the need for invasive brain surgeries. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems can also help to deliver therapeutics to a targeted brain region, thereby reducing adverse effects due to nonspecific drug delivery. 1,2 hough there are a number of platforms available to deliver cargo to the brain such as viral vectors, liposomes, carbon nanotubes and carbon sots, dendrimers, and micelles, only a few of them can cross the BBB and deliver drugs and therapeutics to the brain efficiently. 3 The stability, solubility, and the ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion/clearance) properties of the nanodelivery system depend on many critical characteristics of the nanoparticle such as its overall size, potential toxicity, molecular weight, \u03b6-potential, and drug encapsulation and release efficacy. 4,5 e have focused on using in-house synthesized polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer nanomolecules to deliver drugs and biomolecules to cells in vitro and to the brain in vivo. We have synthesized PAMAM (polyamidoamine) dendrimers of different sizes, surface groups, and cores to minimize toxicity and improve drug delivery efficacy. We tested these dendrimers in different cell models as well as in animal models. We have published data addressing toxicity 6\u22128 and have shown that our surface-modified dendrimers (with 10% of the surface covered with \u2212NH 2 and 90% of the surface covered with hydroxyl groups \u2212OH; G4\u221290/10 dendrimers used in this paper) were not toxic. \n\nPAMAM dendrimers are nanomolecules ranging from 1 to 10 nm in diameter. The three components of the dendrimer are (1) a core, ( 2) generations (G), and (3) surface groups.",

            "text": "Although the blood-brain barrier poses a serious limitation for delivery of therapeutics to the brain, this barrier is often surmountable when its integrity is disrupted or when the characteristics of a drug molecule are modified. For instance, administering analogs of bradykinin generates osmotic pressure, thus opening the tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier. This allows paracellular drug transport through the blood-brain barrier. Drug permeation has also been reported to be enhanced after intracarotid administration of a hyperosmotic solution of arabinose. 130 owever, these modifications are not always compatible because they disturb homeostasis and allow entry of undesirable toxic molecules along with the therapeutic molecule, leading to potential side effects. Hence, targeted delivery of nanoparticles has become a focus of considerable research attention. The primary objective of a targeted delivery system is to deliver a diagnostic or therapeutic agent to a specific site. Because it is associated with localized delivery, targeted nanoparticles have attracted immense attention over the past 15 years. The potential advantages of site-specific delivery include reduced dosage of the drug molecule, enhanced bioavailability at the desired site, and reduced likelihood of peripheral side effects. Accumulation of nanoparticles at a specific site depends on various factors, and, in general, biodistribution is primarily affected by chemical properties, size of the nanoparticle, and availability of the targeted ligand. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of targeted nanoparticles is extremely valuable in evaluating the dose, because although targeted delivery is considered to be site-specific, few nanoparticles seem to distribute to nonspecific sites. 131",

            "text": "Abstract The central nervous system (CNS) diseases are major contributors to death and disability worldwide. However, the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) often prevents drugs intended for CNS diseases from effectively crossing into the brain parenchyma to deliver their therapeutic effects. The blood\u2013brain barrier is a semi-permeable barrier with high selectivity. The BBB primarily manages the transport of substances between the blood and the CNS. To enhance drug delivery for CNS disease treatment, various brain-based drug delivery strategies overcoming the BBB have been developed. Among them, nanoparticles (NPs) have been emphasized due to their multiple excellent properties. This review starts with an overview of the BBB\u2019s anatomical structure and physiological roles, and then explores the mechanisms, both endogenous and exogenous, that facilitate the NP passage across the BBB. The text also delves into how nanoparticles' shape, charge, size, and surface ligands affect their ability to cross the BBB and offers an overview of different nanoparticle classifications. This review concludes with an examination of the current challenges in utilizing nanomaterials for brain drug delivery and discusses corresponding directions for solutions. This review aims to propose innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CNS diseases and enhance drug design for more effective delivery across the BBB. Graphical abstract",

            "text": "Neurotherapeutics are classes of drugs used in the treatment of brain or central nervous system disorders. The effectiveness of these actives is generally compromised due to failure reaching the site of action sufficiently. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is considered the most dominant physiological barrier impeding the passage of neuropharmaceuticals to the brain cells. It is a highly fortified membrane system, composed of specialized capillary endothelial cells, that protects the brain from extraneous organisms and harmful chemicals, and supplies the brain with the nutrients required (Salunkhe et al., 2015). Overcoming the difficulty in crossing BBB is the key strategy for efficient delivery of therapeutic molecules to the brain. \n\nSeveral delivery approaches were implemented aiming to target drugs to the brain via enhancing their transport across BBB. The application of nanotechnology coupled with surfactant coating is one of these propitious tactics. \n\nFor a long time, nanoparticle (NP)-mediated drug transport to the brain has been governed by particle coating with surfactants. The surfactant Tween V R 80 (polyethylene glycol sorbitan monooleate) is considered the gold standard effectively crossing BBB. The fact is due to the preferential adsorption of apolipoprotein E (Apo E), present in blood, on NP surfaces coated with Tween 80, rendering particles resembling the low density lipoproteins (LDL), hence interacting with LDL receptors on BBB and enhancing their cellular uptake via receptor-mediated transcytosis mechanism (Gessner et al., 2000;G\u20ac oppert & M\u20ac uller, 2003). Other surfactants were investigated for their capabilities to transport drugs across BBB, from which D-a-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) and Solutol V R HS 15 (polyethylene glycol-15-hydroxy stearate) (Lamprecht & Benoit, 2006;Wa Kasongo, 2010;Agrawa et al., 2017;Meng et al., 2017).",

            "text": "With the advent of nanotechnologies, nanoparticles have been proposed as an intriguing tool to potentially enhance drug delivery across the BBB. Extensive reviews can be found elsewhere [29][30][31]. This review focuses on new findings to redefine some concepts in this research area. \n\nWhen applying nanoparticles for brain drug delivery, the first question that has to be answered is whether nanoparticles, by themselves, could cross the BBB. Nanoparticles in general have the advantages on multifunctionalization, ability to carry drug payloads, control of drug release and modification of the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Moreover, nanoparticles, because of their nano size (< 200 nm), could penetrate into 'leaky' tumor tissue to facilitate drug delivery according to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [32]. However, for brain drug delivery, observing increased drug concentration in the brain using nanoparticles does not necessarily imply that the small size of the nanoparticles makes them cross the healthy BBB. Nanoparticles could increase the drug concentration at the surface of BBB cells, or nanoparticles could provide more opportunities to the drug to cross the BBB by increasing their circulation time in the blood compared to conventional formulations. For instance, poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (lactic acid) blockcopolymer (PEG-PLA)-protein complex nanoparticles cannot cross the healthy BBB [33]; however, the complex nanoparticles delivered brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to the brain and enhanced efficacy in a middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model for stroke [34]. Very likely, the PEG-PLA BDNF complex entered the brain via the disrupted BBB caused by stroke [33]. Also, the complex probably increased the plasma half-life of BDNF for the enhanced therapeutic value observed in mice. Thus, there are extensive debates on whether nanoparticles versus their encapsulated payloads cross the BBB [29,31,35].",

            "text": "Many therapeutic agents are unable to cross this barrier, limiting their effectiveness in treating brain-related conditions. This obstacle has spurred the development of innovative strategies to overcome the BBB, with nanoparticle-based delivery systems emerging as a promising approach. Nanoparticles offer a unique solution to the challenge of drug delivery across the BBB. As shown in Scheme 2, these tiny particles can be designed to interact with the BBB in various ways, such as paracellular transport, carrier-mediated transport, and cell-mediated transport, enabling them to transport therapeutic agents into the brain. Some nanoparticles utilize adsorptive-mediated transcytosis, where their positive charge interacts with the negatively charged cell membrane of brain endothelial cells, facilitating uptake and transport. Additionally, others employ receptor-mediated transcytosis, using specific ligands to bind to receptors on the BBB and trigger internalization. The use of nanoparticles for brain drug delivery offers several advantages over traditional methods. These include improved drug stability, targeted delivery to specific brain regions or cell types, and enhanced BBB penetration [53][54][55][56]. \n\nMOFs have attracted significant interest in recent years due to their potential to overcome the challenges posed by the BBB in treating brain disorders. This interest is due to their unique physicochemical properties, including high drug loading efficiency, controlled drug release, nanoscale size, ease of surface modification, stability, biodegradability, and biocompatibility with low systemic toxicity. A key advantage of MOFs in crossing the BBB is their ability to be functionalized with various ligands and molecules that can target specific receptors on the BBB. This receptor-mediated transport mechanism improves the ability of MOFs to penetrate the BBB and deliver therapeutic agents directly to brain tissues. Additionally, modifying the surface of MOFs can enhance their biocompatibility, stability, and targeting capabilities, further increasing their potential as drug delivery systems [57,58]. \n\nNanomaterials 2024, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW traditional methods.

            "text": "Recently bioplastic MPs/NPs have been engineered to overcome the BBB or target specific cell types in the brain, such as neurons or glial cells. These targeted nanoparticles can enhance drug delivery to specific regions of the brain and reduce off-target effects [140]. Essentially, there are three distinct strategies to accomplish this objective: adsorptive-mediated transcytosis, transporter-mediated transcytosis, and receptor-mediated transcytosis. The first mechanism can be facilitated through electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged components present on the luminal surface of cerebral endothelial cells and the cationic groups or conjugating specific compounds, such as lectins, cardiolipin, and heparin to the NPs surface [141]. Another approach for delivering drugs to the brain is utilizing transporter-mediated transcytosis. Indeed, it is feasible to synthesize nanoparticles with surface-conjugated molecules (glucose and its analogs, glutathione, and amino acids) that exhibit strong recognition by the transporters that are overexpressed in brain endothelial cells [142]. The last approach to access brain tissue involves the use of receptors overexpressed within the BBB. In more detail, transferrin, lactoferrin, low-density lipoproteins, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are commonly employed receptors to achieve receptor-mediated transcytosis across the BBB [140]. \n\nFinally, the use of prodrug strategies can also enhance the delivery of bioplastic MPs/NPs to the brain. Prodrugs are inactive precursors of active drugs that can be activated within the brain by specific enzymes. In fact, hydrophilic and high-molecularweight compounds cannot traverse the BBB or the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) through paracellular pathways. In contrast, lipophilic solutes can passively permeate these barriers [143]; hence, hydrophilic drugs can be chemically modified into lipophilic prodrugs by concealing polar functional groups. This approach can increase the brain concentration of active drugs while reducing their systemic toxicity [144].",

The infected resting CD4 T-cells containing HIV envelope glycoproteins on their surface attract the drug loaded nanoparticles coated with recombinant CD4 molecules or Fab fragments of monoclonal anti-gp120 antibodies [13].\n\nNanotechnology also offers a solution for the problem of poor drug penetration in certain anatomical sites. One such anatomical reservoir is the brain, where the infected microglial cells rest safely with the protection conferred by the blood brain barrier against the systemically administered anti-retroviral agents. The blood brain barrier functions not only by preventing the permeation of the circulating anti-retroviral compounds into the brain tissue, but also by efflux of a considerable portion of the compounds that have managed to cross through. With the ability to increase the crossing and reduce the efflux of drugs, nanotechnology methods help in reservoir elimination by overcoming the privilege offered by the blood brain barrier [122].\n\nNanotechnology methods that increase the drug transport across the blood brain barrier function by mimicry of natural substrates, utilization of cell penetrating peptides or by active targeting of molecules of abundance in neuronal vasculature with suitable surface ligands. The non-ionic surfactant 'polysorbate-80' has found to be an effective enhancer of drug delivery to the brain using the principle of substrate mimicry. Upon systemic administration, the drug loaded nanoparticles coated with polysorbate-80 adsorb various apolipoproteins in circulation to form a complex that mimics lipoproteins. Presuming them as natural substrates, the blood brain barrier permits the entry of these complexes by receptor mediated transcytosis resulting in delivery of the drug to the brain tissue [123]. Nanoparticles coated with cell penetrating peptides such as the HIV-1 tat peptide has shown enhanced efficacy in crossing the blood brain barrier. As the microvasculature of the brain is rich in receptors such as transferring receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor and \u03b22 receptors, their respective ligands such as transferrin, apolipoprotein-E and \u03b22 agonists are considered possible candidates for active targeting.\n\nThe use of nanotechnology for reservoir elimination poses some peculiar problems in addition to other drawbacks",

            "text": "Compared to local delivery, systemic drug delivery offers greater flexibility and controllability in terms of timing and dosage. However, the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)/blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) may pose challenges to drug delivery efficiency. Additionally, physiological conditions within the body can affect drug stability and efficacy. Therefore, it is crucial to consider transporting active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to target tissues and enhance their targeting specificity. Nanomaterials exhibit several unique advantages in neuroprotection [116] (sees in Fig. 4 and Table 3): (i) the ability to overcome barriers such as the blood-brain barrier/blood-spinal cord barrier; (ii) the advantage of retaining drug activity; and (iii) the potential for further enhancing targeting capabilities through coupling modifications [117][118][119]. Nanoparticles have been widely employed in systemic drug delivery for spinal cord injury, although they are also used locally at injury sites for slow and sustained drug release or to improve the microenvironment [120][121][122]. Here, we primarily review systemic delivery strategies involving nanoparticle-encapsulated drugs. \n\nOverall, current strategies to enhance targeting in the field of SCI include: (i) reactive oxygen species (ROS) response; (ii) pH response (acidic environment at the injury site [46]); (iii) matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) response [19,123]; (iv) chemotactic factor response; and (v) other specific environmental cues. Inorganic materials such as metal and metal oxide-doped nanoparticles have widely and effectively application. Most of them naturally possess antioxidative properties and exhibit excellent ROS-responsive capabilities, although Fig. 4. Types and modification of nanoparticles used for systemic delivery in spinal cord injury: Based on complex and adverse microenvironment post injury, 4 modification strategies were used for constructing environment specific response scaffold, including (i) coating with peptide, (ii) coupling to form environment response bonds, (iii) designing in different types to load drugs and (iv) coating with cell membranes. they initially predominantly accumulate at the injury site through penetrating the BSCB.",

The combination of low inherent toxicity and tunable stability provides them with unique attributes that should enable new delivery strategies. \n\nSeveral nano-biotherapeutic approaches have been adopted in the field of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems to surpass the bloodbrain barrier (BBB). The attraction and binding of lipophilic nanoparticles to endothelial cells increases the transport of drug molecules via endocytosis or lipophilic transcellular pathways, and their adsorptive properties towards blood capillaries offers a sustained release of drugs in the bloodstream with a higher probability of penetration across the BBB. Furthermore, functionalized nanocarriers elicit receptormediated transcytosis and carrier proteinmediated shuttling of drug molecules across the BBB (Bilal et al., 2020). As the therapeutic potential of drug delivery systems is dependent on the ability of nanocarriers to escape the immune system, penetrate the BBB, and perform task-specific functions in the targeted tissues, any hindrances can vividly reduce their efficacy. In the last 20 years, a large number of nano-delivery systems have been introduced for the treatment and improvement of neurodegenerative disorders. Nanostructured carriers such as magnetic nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, polymeric nanocapsules, multifunctional nanoliposomes, nanoemulsions, and other cell membranebased nanocarriers have demonstrated satisfactory encapsulation of cargoes with improved physicochemical stabilities for enhanced brain-targeting ability (Bilal et al., 2020).

These debilitating conditions are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons and declining cognitive function, motor control, and behavior. Current treatment options are often ineffective or associated with severe side effects. For instance, anti-inflammatory drugs can induce gastrointestinal distress, while neuroprotectants may exhibit neurotoxicity [1]. \n\nIn recent years, nanopharmacology has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for these challenging diseases. Nanoparticles, with their unique size-dependent properties, offer the potential to deliver drugs directly to specific cells or tissues in the brain, enhancing efficacy and minimizing side effects. This targeted delivery strategy holds particular promise for neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric diseases due to the challenges of conventional drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [1,2]. \n\nSeveral advantages make nanoparticles well-suited for treating these neurological disorders. First, they can improve the solubility and stability of drugs, particularly those with poor pharmacokinetic properties. Second, nanoparticles can be functionalized to target specific cells or tissues in the brain, ensuring precise drug delivery to the desired site of action. Third, nanoparticles can effectively cross the BBB, overcoming a significant hurdle in conventional drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) [3]. \n\nSignificant advancements have been made in developing nanoparticulate drug delivery systems for treating neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric diseases. Nanoparticles have been successfully employed to deliver anti-inflammatory drugs to the brain for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) [4]. Similarly, nanoparticles have been utilized to provide neuroprotective agents to the brain in treating Parkinson's disease and stroke [5] (Figure 1). \n\nIn this mini-review, we explore the therapeutic potential of nanopharmacology for neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric diseases.",

Both of these barriers, having important protective roles, have been studied widely over the past few years. One of the current strategies for specifically targeting the BBB is to design vehicles able to cross the barrier using nanoparticles (NPs). The therapeutic compound can thus be enclosed inside a functionalized capsule made of lipids or polymers [1]. Such features allow the drug to be protected at many stages starting with its transport from the digestive tract to the blood stream. There are several parameters that affect the efficiency of nanoparticles systemic circulation, BBB passage and cellular delivery [2]. Among them are, notably: (i) a clear inverse correlation among NPs size and BBB penetration; (ii) the influence of NPs shape on body distribution and cellular uptake; (iii) the type of ligands; and (iv) the zeta potential. Moreover, with specific structures presented at the surface of the nanoparticles, it is possible to target and penetrate the brain, via transportation through the BBB. As we have recently noticed [3], the information found on the surface of extracellular vesicles (EVs) could be used to functionalize nanoparticles that could travel unharmed and reach the brain.",

Additionally, the prolonged or excessive use of drugs that can cross the BBB can damage liver and kidney function. Recent studies have shown that nose-to-brain drug delivery can noninvasively bypass the BBB, allowing drugs to enter the brain through the olfactory or trigeminal nerve pathways; additionally, nanoparticle carriers can enhance drug delivery. This review introduces drug carrier nanoparticles for nose-to-brain delivery systems, compares the advantages and disadvantages of different nanoparticles, and discusses the factors influencing nose-to-brain nanomedicine delivery and enhancement strategies.

Before they can be used, though, a number of factors must be taken into account, including surface chemistry, hydrophobicity, shape, size, and charge, to name a few. One of the biggest obstacles in CNS-targeted therapies is crossing of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems are crucial in addressing this issue. The BBB acts as an obstacle that keeps out various propagated molecules, along with deadly ones, so that only the right ratio of nutrients passes through instead of harmful/foreign substances. It is possible to create drug delivery systems using nanotechnology that interact with specific cellular subsets or molecules, providing more targeted treatment. With these systems, it is also possible to simultaneously achieve multifunctional qualities like bioactivity, targeting, imaging capabilities, and gene delivery. In this regard, the use of drug delivery methods based on nanotechnology for diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitative purposes has been widely adopted. Numerous studies have been conducted on nanosystems with various biological characteristics and combinations for applications in gene and drug delivery. 10 oth invasive and noninvasive methods are available for increasing BBB permeability, including intraventricular or intracerebral injections or implantation, infusion, and intranasal administration using drug modification. In some situations, disruption may also work well for crossing of the BBB. The BBB is frequently ruptured to increase the effectiveness of drug delivery to the brain. The physical and chemical properties of NPs determine their path and the methods by which they can cross the BBB. Designing and creating nanoparticles that specifically target the appropriate fraction of affected neurons without damaging other healthy neurons can be tricky. This is crucial, particularly when harmful medications are used to treat aggressive brain tumors. 11",

[23] highlight the effectiveness of Gold Nanoparticle Conjugates (LCM-GNP) containing Lacosamide in reducing seizure activity, alleviating anxiety-like behavior, and influencing critical proteins in the cerebral cortex. A novel approach to efficient drug delivery to the brain through the blood-brain barrier, involving the conjugation of LCM to GNPs targeted to Glut-1 carriers on brain capillary endothelial cells, proves successful in achieving significant therapeutic efficiency [23]. Meenu et al. [24] study demonstrates the superiority of Nano Sodium Valproate in protecting against seizures and improving cognitive function, along with its antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. This superiority can be attributed to the slow and sustained release of the drug from nanoparticles effectively targeted to the brain, preventing phagocytosis and degradation in circulation. The progressive accumulation of nanoparticles, along with biodegradable, biocompatible, and functionalized properties, including surface modification like coating with polysorbate 80, results in prolonged efficacy of nano sodium valproate at lower doses [24]. \n\nLeyva-G\u00f3mez et al. [25] discovered that Solid Lipid Nanoparticles containing Clozapine (CLZ-SLN) effectively delay seizure onset and inhibit seizures more efficiently compared to conventional Clozapine (CLZ). The enhanced therapeutic effect is attributed to SLN's ability to cross the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) through two main mechanisms: adsorption to capillary walls and adhesion to endothelial cell membranes, facilitating drug release to the brain. The lipid proportion in the SLN formulation also plays a role in the anticonvulsant activity of CLZ by creating synergy. This study highlights the potential of CLZ-SLN in improving anticonvulsant efficacy through enhanced intestinal and BBB crossing [25]. Musumeci et al. [26] demonstrated that intranasal administration of nanoparticles loaded with Oxcarbazepine effectively delays and reduces Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures with neuroprotective effects.",

            "text": "This field has garnered considerable interest, but concerns about long-term effects and potential toxicity linger [97]. Utilizing tailored nanomedicines to improve brain transport by capitalizing on the compromised BBB resulting from brain illnesses, such as neurodevelopmental disorders, presents a promising strategy for medication delivery [98]. \n\nNanoparticles as non-invasive methods for drug delivery across the BBB have gained traction due to their effectiveness and versatility. They can be engineered to enhance the delivery of various therapeutic agents to the brain, overcoming the formidable obstacle presented by the BBB. One mechanism through which nanoparticles facilitate drug delivery is by encapsulating drugs and protecting them from metabolic degradation in the bloodstream, enhancing their half-life and bioavailability. A study by Saraiva et al. (2016) [97] demonstrated the use of multi-functionalized nanoparticles to deliver anti-inflammatory drugs to the brain, showing a reduction in neuroinflammation in a targeted and controlled manner. Additionally, surface modification of nanoparticles has been explored to improve their ability to cross the BBB. Poly (butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles coated with polysorbate 80 can help deliver drugs like dalargin, tubocurarine, and doxorubicin across the BBB effectively [99]. \n\nTargeted delivery is another essential aspect of nanoparticle-based drug delivery, including the development of magnetic nanoparticles, which could be guided to the brain using an external magnetic field, enhancing the site-specific delivery of the encapsulated drugs [100]. Due to their small size and customizable properties, Nanoparticles serve as excellent vehicles for drug delivery. Combined with techniques like FUS, they can be directed precisely, allowing for slow and sustained drug release [101]. \n\nResearch involving the co-delivery of gold nanoparticles and anticancer drugs to glioblastoma cells showcased enhanced cell uptake and increased therapeutic efficiency, owing to the synergistic combination of nanoparticles and FUS [102]. \n\nNanotechnology offers avenues to develop carriers that can transport drugs and respond to external stimuli, such as temperature or magnetic fields, enabling controlled release at target sites [103].",

            "text": "A brain's structure and environment, including the cellular microenvironment, must be tightly controlled for it to properly function [1].The architecture and organisation of brain vasculature are vital to maintaining this microenvironment [2].Numerous major arteries branch out into increasingly smaller blood vessels, ending in a dense network of capillaries.This capillary network accounts for 85% of the surface area between the bloodstream and the brain parenchyma, the latter comprising neurons and glial cells [2,3].Blood flow from these cells is separated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), an efficient and highly selective permeable barrier.Many neurological disorders are caused by dysfunction and breakdown of the BBB [4][5][6].At other times, the selective barrier hampers the delivery of therapeutic drugs into brain parenchyma targets.Therefore, medical researchers are increasingly interested in technologies that help them not only better understand the BBB but also circumvent the BBB to deliver drugs to targeted brain regions [3,[7][8][9].On the topic of circumventing the BBB, recent research has focused on the dynamics regulating the BBB and the effects of its disruption [10,11], where understanding these processes can help identify therapeutic targets.An important finding of this work is that molecular waste compounds across the BBB in many neurodegenerative diseases [12][13][14] and directly contribute to disease progression [15].Conversely, several therapeutic strategies aim to intentionally and temporarily increase BBB permeability to improve drug delivery, since many pharmaceuticals cannot cross an intact BBB [8,16,17].Such strategies often employ chemical methods, such as modifying therapeutic agents' chemical structure to exploit endogenous transport mechanisms or encapsulating them in nanoparticle vehicles to cross the BBB.Despite extensive research on chemical-based approaches, their clinical applications remain limited, with high failure rates in clinical trials [3,14].A promising alternative strategy, however, involves physically altering the BBB's structure and function to temporarily allow larger molecules to pass.",

Generally, 20-100 nm in at least 1D, offer a great improvement in target selectivity of a drug and overall efficacy with reduced off-target effects and toxicity when administered systemically. An engineered nanoparticle is typically composed of a core, membrane shell, and surface ligands. Through rational design, including shape, size, and surface chemistry, nanoparticle-based delivery systems enable more efficient delivery of a drug to its target or even directly to the diseased site. [201] Although there are some common features between nanoparticles designed to restore the BBB or penetrate the BBB, distinctions in design principles reflect their central goals. Nanoparticlebased therapeutics aimed at restoring abnormal BBB integrity only need target the luminal side of brain endothelial cells and do not necessarily need to cross the BBB. In contrast, nanoparticles targeting diseased sites in the brain parenchyma need to overcome the BBB and other barriers in the brain parenchyma. Nonetheless, the central design principle of these nanoparticles is to enhance the specificity to the target sites and minimize typical side effects caused by systemic drug delivery. www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advancedscience.com Table 3.

            "text": "Brain disorders are of significant social and economic concern. Neurological disorders, cerebrovascular diseases, brain infections and inflammatory disorders including brain cancer afflict about 1.5 billion people globally. Overcoming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to enable therapeutic drug concentration in the brain presents the most formidable challenge in effective therapy of such afflictions (Schouten et al., 2002;. Intranasal administration provides a noninvasive approach to bypass of the formidable BBB (Laquintana et al., 2009;Shinde et al., 2011). Enhanced brain uptake of curcumin (CUR) with increased cytotoxicity in astrocytoma-glioblastoma cell line (U-373MG) was demonstrated from a nanostructured lipid carrier (Madane & Mahajan, 2016). Intranasal CUR-loaded PNIPAM nanoparticles showed enhanced bioavailability of curcuminoids in brain as compared to intravenous administration (Ahmad et al., 2014). Intranasal administration of thermosensitive poloxamer hydrogel revealed enhanced CUR targeting to various parts of the brain including the cerebrum, cerebellum, hippocampus and olfactory bulb compared to the intravenous injection (Chen et al., 2013). High targeting efficiency with significantly higher brain/blood ratio was observed from an intranasal microemulsion based in situ ionsensitive gelling system of CUR compared to intravenous administration (Wang et. al., 2012).\n\nMicroemulsions (ME) are promising delivery systems for intranasal delivery with manifold advantages of ease of preparation, high loading of hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, feasibility of sterilization and ease of administration. MEs for enhanced nose to brain delivery are reported for a number of drugs (Zhang et al., 2004;Vyas et al, 2005Vyas et al, , 2006aVyas et al, , 2006bJogani et al., 2008), especially hydrophobic drugs. ME components can play a critical role in enhanced brain uptake Shinde et al. 2011). Mucoadhesive MEs could further enhance nose to brain targeting through improved residence time (Vyas et",

            "text": "To fight against the BBB, a growing number of advanced materials and technologies have been developed for enhanced braintargeted drug delivery in CNS disorder treatment. By using the passive and/or active strategies for BBB regulation and crossing in a controlled and non-invasive manner, various drug delivery systems are engineered to facilitate the brain-targeted delivery of specific therapeutics including small-molecule drugs, proteins, genes, and other biopharmaceutics. Due to the requirement of both delivery efficiency and safety, the majority of drug delivery systems with the ability to cross BBB are designed at a nanoscale level with tailored chemical composition and surface properties (Table 2). [247] Liposomal formulations Liposomes are the first generation of drug delivery systems and have been widely used since their discovery in 1965. 248 They are composed of one or more lipid bilayers and hollow aqueous compartment, which endow them with loading versatility for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic therapeutic agents. 249 Together with high biocompatibility, biodegradability and its intrinsic capability of BBB crossing, liposomes are considered as one of the most successful delivery systems with a great potential in translational medicine. In the past decade, research on liposomes has further substantially increased along with the advance of materials The blood-brain barrier: Structure, regulation and drugy Wu et al. \n\nengineering and nanotechnology. 250 Various types of functionalization strategies have been involved for the development of liposomal delivery system such as brain/tumor-targeting delivery, controlled drug release, imaging-guided delivery, etc. 251 These strategies facilitate the development of liposomal formulations to improve brain-specific delivery. Brain-targeted delivery of the liposomes could be enhanced by modification of targeting ligands including polymers, peptides, antibodies, and aptamers. 252 For example, Zhan et al. functionalized liposomal surface with amyloid-\u03b2-derived peptide which has a highly specific binding affinity towards plasm apolipoproteins, giving a protein corona-modified liposomal system. Significant enhancement of the brain distribution of DOX-loaded liposomes as well as higher anti-tumor efficacy were found. 253",

            "text": "Principal proteins at the BBB transluminal junctions are claudins, occludin, and JAMs. The use of ultrasound and microbubbles has been shown to suppress the expression of these proteins at the translaminar junctions, thereby opening the BBB in a relatively short period of time without causing damage to normal brain tissue [359]. \n\nSince nanoparticle size is in the range of proteins and nucleic acids, they can interact with these biomolecules, amplifying their efficacy. Another property is that biocompatibility is increased by facilitating the transport of therapeutic compounds, which could reduce the dose used in Alzheimer's patients [360,361]. For example, the use of lipid-soluble nanoparticles targeted to endothelial cells would increase the rate of drug transport by increasing its adsorption through endocytosis or through lipophilic transcellular pathways [362,363]. On the other hand, the development of nanoparticles with specific receptors could also improve drug uptake. Thus, the use of nanotechnology in drug delivery systems improves bioavailability and can help to safely deliver drugs to specific molecular targets, thereby reducing adverse effects [363]. \n\nThe transport of nanoparticles across the BBB also depends on their physicochemical properties. Nanoparticles have a limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier on their own and thus gain access to the brain. Therefore, several ways have been explored to enable them to cross the BBB, taking advantage of the various physiological processes for crossing the BBB. Delivery methods that have been investigated include the use of receptor-mediated endocytosis, transcytosis, or transporters, focused ultrasound in synergy with microbubble delivery or by various means of surface modification of nanoparticles and local drug delivery from nanoparticles and another way to deliver nanoparticles to the brain without crossing the BBB is the intranasal route [364][365][366][367].",

Neutral ENPs and low concentrations of anionic ENPs were found to have no effect on BBB integrity, whereas high concentrations of anionic ENPs and cationic ENPs disrupted the BBB structure. Especially cationic NPs displayed an immediate toxic effect. It has been suggested that the   BBB disruption by cationic nanoparticles may be due to opening of inter-endothelial routes, i.e., widening of tight junctions [21]. The structural changes in tight junction may occur without any decrease in the high electrical resistance of the cerebral endothelium. Since cationic nanoparticles are possibly more neurotoxic than other forms, it seems that neutral and low concentrations of anionic nanoparticles are better suited as colloidal drug carriers for enhanced delivery to the brain [26].\n\nKim et al. [27] synthesized silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles containing rhodamine B isothiocyanate within a silica shell of controllable thickness (50 nm). After intraperitoneal administration into mice (10 mg/ kg), ENPs were detected in the mouse brain, indicating a blood-brain barrier penetration without disturbing its function or producing apparent toxicity. In another study they demonstrated that poly(methoxypolyethyleneglycol cyanoacrylate-co-hexadecylcyanoacrylate) (PEG-PHDCA) nanoparticles have the capacity to diffuse through the blood-brain barrier after intravenous administration. The authors suggested that the LDL receptor-mediated pathway was involved in the endocytosis mechanism [28].\n\nIt has to be pointed out, that nanoparticles administered intravenously are rapidly cleared from the blood stream by the mononuclear phagocyte system and mainly accumulate in liver and spleen [29]. Specially prepared ENPs with surface modifications using either PLA, PLGA or PEG, or combinations of all, as well as functionalized pegylated PLA/PLGA nanoparticles seem to offer possibilities for drug delivery to the brain.

            "text": "Neurological disorders, including brain cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and traumatic brain injuries, present significant treatment challenges due to the complex structure and function of the central nervous system (CNS). The primary obstacle is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a highly selective membrane that prevents most therapeutic agents from reaching the brain, severely limiting drug efficacy (Henna et al. 2020a). Traditional treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, are often invasive, nonspecific, and accompanied by severe side effects (Palanisamy, et al. 2023;Ma and Gong 2023;Obrador, et al. 2024). Moreover, many drugs fail to achieve adequate concentrations in the brain, resulting in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes and frequent relapse of conditions (Tzeng and Green 2013). \n\nNanotechnology has become a transformative approach in brain therapy, posing innovative solutions to overcome challenges such as the BBB. Nanomaterials-spanning organic (e.g., liposomes, micelles, hydrogels), inorganic (e.g., metal/metal oxide particles, silica nanoparticles, carbon-based nanomaterials), and biomass-derived types (e.g., exosomes, cells, bacteria)-can cross the BBB due to their nanoscale size (Wu et al. 2023;Upton et al. 2022). These materials provide advantages such as non-invasive delivery, high drug-loading capacity, excellent biocompatibility, prolonged circulation, and precise brain targeting, making them promising for neurological treatments. \n\nCarbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs), including FLG, GO, GQD, SWCNT, MWCNT, CNH, CNDs, and C 60 , hold particular promise due to their unique physicochemical properties, such as high surface area, nanoscale dimensions, and adaptability for surface modifications. These properties allow CNMs to effectively cross the BBB, delivering therapeutic agents directly to the CNS (Mohajeri et al. 2019).",

            "text": "The delivery of therapeutic substances to specific locations inside the brain presents significant difficulties in drug-delivery systems that target the nose-to-brain route. The intricate structure of the brain, characterized by many areas and barriers, requires accurate and focused administration of medication to effectively treat neurological disorders [64]. The delivery of drugs to particular regions of the brain via the nasal route is hindered by challenges associated with the BBB and the complex nature of brain structures. The BBB, while essential for safeguarding the brain, presents a significant obstacle by selectively impeding the entry of substances, including drugs, into the brain tissue. Many drugs have significant difficulties in crossing this barrier, which hinders their capacity to effectively reach specific areas of the brain at therapeutic levels [65]. \n\nMoreover, the successful administration of drugs for particular neurological diseases in the brain necessitates overcoming obstacles that extend beyond the BBB. The presence of variations in brain architecture, diverse neural routes, and the need to access brain areas that are located deep inside the brain add additional layers of complexity. The key problem lies in ensuring that drugs effectively reach the intended areas in enough quantities to have therapeutic effects. To tackle these issues, it is necessary to formulate delivery methods that can circumvent or overcome the obstacles presented by the BBB and accurately focus on specific parts of the brain. Nanoparticles' diminutive dimensions allow for enhanced interactions with the nasal epithelium, resulting in improved medication penetration across mucosal barriers. This increased contact enables a more effective absorption of drugs, boosting their transportation to the brain [1]. Techniques such as surface modifications, nanocarriers with particular ligands, or novel formulations are used to improve the ability of drugs to enter the brain and interact with specific targets. These alterations improve the nanoparticles' attraction to receptors or transporters in the nasal mucosa, making their absorption and subsequent transportation to specific brain regions more efficient [45]. To fully harness the promise of nose-to-brain drug-delivery systems in treating neurological illnesses, it is essential to address and overcome the obstacles associated with delivering medicines accurately to the targeted areas of the brain [65].",

            "text": "The BBB often obstructs the passage of intravenously (i.v.) delivered therapeutics into the cerebral compartment because it expresses efflux pumps, such as Pglycoprotein, which actively removes drugs from the brain [4,5].However, most small particles (mw > 500 Daltons, D), proteins, and peptides do not permeate the BBB.Most chemicals must thus cross the BBB via interacting with particular transporters and/or receptors expressed on the luminal (blood) side of endothelial cells in order to reach the brain [6].A potential approach to overcome these challenges includes the development of suitable novel drug carrier platforms.Recent advancements in nanotechnology have emerged as powerful tools for treating CNS disorders.Nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems provide remarkable opportunities to overcome the Blood-brain barrier (BBB) obstacle for the management of Central Nervous System (CNS) diseases.The brain is one of the susceptible and fragile neuronal organs present in the body.By regulating the intake of chemicals that are required (endogenous nutrients) and the outflow of toxic substances, the CNS barrier ensures brain homeostasis.The brain is mainly composed of BBB and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCFB).By preventing the entry of CNS therapeutics, the BBB limits therapy options for CNS disorders.Nanoparticle drug delivery technologies provide significant benefits in terms of targeted drug delivery.The size of the particle determines the efficiency of the drug delivery system.The efficacy of nanoparticles for appropriate bioavailability and precise intracellular absorption of the active therapeutic moiety in the specified cellular targets is enhanced by their increased surface area and smaller size (nm) [7].\n\nCurrently, drugs that exhibit poor brain distribution can be loaded into nanoparticles to selectively bind to the receptors or transporters expressed at the BBB, resulting in improved CNS selectivity and permeability.Overall, these nanocarriers have resulted in better drug pharmacokinetics, effectiveness, and safety [8].",

Other approaches to improve drug stability, drug release, drug bioavailability, reduced toxicity and enhanced drug targeting efficiency (DTE) were developed by fabricating them with ligand conjugation such as protein/peptides and/or antibodies. \n\nFurther, nanoparticles can establish another level of modification to achieve specific targeted delivery, which involves using certain biomolecules as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), which are short, positively charged sequences and possess the ability to cross biological membranes such as BBB. Hence, CPPs have been known to mediate targeted drug delivery in the brain. Another approach is targeting nanoparticles to the nasal epithelium, including lectinmodified and cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) as surface Ligands specifically designed for targeted delivery [22]. Advanced approaches to enhance the targeting effect include ligands that can potentially bind the specific cell receptor, such as Lactoferrin which belongs to a transferrin family; it binds efficiently to the receptors expressed on the surface of neural cells [22]. Figs. (1 and 2) represents various types of approaches to surface modification. \n\nSimilar approaches have been developed for targeted delivery to the brain, like using glycoproteins such as transferrins, their family member and integrin targeting ligands conjugation. These molecules have been proven to show specific targeted delivery in the brain as receptors of these molecules rise in number in the person suffering through neurological disorder; hence nanoparticles attached with such molecules can easily target the affected region of the brain leading to reduced non-specific binding leading to lesser extrapyramidal side effects.",

The treatment of brain diseases is challenging partly due to the inaccessibility of therapeutic agents to the brain. An increasingly important observation is that the physiology of the brain alters during many brain diseases, and aging adds even more to the complexity of the disease. There is a notion that the permeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) increases with aging or disease, however, the body has a defense mechanism that still retains the separation of the brain from harmful chemicals in the blood. This makes drug delivery to the diseased brain, even more challenging and complex task. Here, the physiological changes to the diseased brain and aged brain are covered in the context of drug delivery to the brain using nanoparticles. Also, recent and novel approaches are discussed for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the diseased brain using nanoparticle based or magnetic resonance imaging guided systems. Furthermore, the complement activation, toxicity, and immunogenicity of brain targeting nanoparticles as well as novel in vitro BBB models are discussed.",

            "text": "The approval rate for drugs to treat central nervous system (CNS) disorders is significantly lower than that for other therapeutic classes. 1 Despite aggressive efforts, many new compounds targeting the CNS are not effective in delivering a safe and efficacious dose to the brain. 1,2 One challenging aspect of CNS drug development is the requirement of the compound to cross the blood\u2212brain barrier (BBB) in sufficient amounts for therapeutic response. The BBB consists of a continuous layer of endothelial cells, surrounded by astrocyte footprocesses, and scattered pericytes. An intact BBB presents a formidable obstacle for the entry of drugs into the brain. The brain microvessel endothelial cells that form the BBB have complex tight junctions, low endocytic activity, and an absence of fenestrations 3 that prevent the passage of most polar and hydrophilic solutes from the blood into the brain. \u221210 Numerous approaches have been examined to enhance drug delivery to the brain. One such method is to chemically modify the drug molecules to reduce their interactions with efflux transporter proteins and, thus, enhance their permeation through the transcellular route. 11 This method had been tested with some chemotherapeutic drugs including paclitaxel. While chemical modification of functional groups has proven beneficial in improving BBB permeability through limiting drug interaction with efflux transporters, 12,13 there are clearly structural limitations to this approach. Another strategy to enhance drug delivery to the brain involves the direct bypassing of the BBB altogether. Two common techniques that utilize this approach include intraventricular infusion of the drug and intracerebral implants containing drug. These techniques have great potential in delivering a high dose of drug locally into the brain without causing systemic side effects; however, when used in clinical settings, the results to date have been disappointing. This may be due to the relatively small surface area of the brain that is in contact with the ventricular compartment and the limited diffusion of the drugs into the brain parenchyma from the infusion site in humans compared to preclinical animal models. 14",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB), mainly composed of brain capillary endothelial cells, tight junctions (TJ), pericytes, basement membrane, and astrocytes foot processes (Liebner et al., 2011), prevents undesirable substances from entering the brain while allowing entry of necessary compounds (Banks, 2009). It is not a passive barrier but can change based on the demands of the central nervous system (CNS). The structure responsible for this plasticity is known as the neurovascular unit (NVU) (Banks and Erickson, 2010). Because of its structure, the BBB impedes the delivery of many macromolecular drugs to the CNS, and experimental protocols for selectively modulating the NVU to allow the delivery of therapeutic drugs through the BBB to treat neurological diseases are being investigated (Neuwelt et al., 2008;Dong, 2018). For example, prodrugs that can passively diffuse into cells through the BBB, drug conjugates for receptormediated transport through the BBB, liposome-mediated brain delivery, brain delivery of nanoparticles, exosome-mediated brain delivery, delivery of viral vectors to the brain (Vykhodtseva et al., 2008;Sahni et al., 2011;Liu et al., 2012;Vieira and Gamarra, 2016) via paracellular pathways through increases in the opening or porosity of tight intercellular junctions, like osmotic delivery (Bellavance et al., 2008) and peptide derivatives that can modulate the TJ of the BBB for a short period (Ulapane et al., 2017) are being studied. However, some of these methods of opening the BBB are challenging, some are difficult to apply in the clinic, and some are still in the experimental stage. Therefore, exploring applicable methods to effectively, non-invasively, and reversibly enhance the permeability of the BBB to facilitate drug delivery to the brain is of great clinical interest and is an important pursuit.",

            "text": "Malignant gliomas are one of the deadliest forms of brain cancer and despite advancements in treatment, patient prognosis remains poor, with an average survival of 15 months. Treatment using conventional chemotherapy does not deliver the required drug dose to the tumour site, owing to insufficient blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration, especially by hydrophilic drugs. Additionally, low molecular weight drugs cannot achieve specific accumulation in cancerous tissues and are characterized by a short circulation half-life. Nanoparticles can be designed to cross the BBB and deliver their drugs within the brain, thus improving their effectiveness for treatment when compared to administration of the free drug. The efficacy of nanoparticles can be enhanced by surface PEGylation to allow more specificity towards tumour receptors. This review will provide an overview of the different therapeutic strategies for the treatment of malignant gliomas, risk factors entailing them as well as the latest developments for brain drug delivery. It will also address the potential of polymeric nanoparticles in the treatment of malignant gliomas, including the importance of their coating and functionalization on their ability to cross the BBB and the chemistry underlying that.",

            "text": "Central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), and other related disorders, are the leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide [1], and have a profound impact on both individuals and society [2]. Neuroinflammation is considered a feature of numerous CNS diseases, in addition to other pathological alterations [3]. \n\nThe overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines activates downstream signaling pathways, culminating in neuronal apoptosis and neurodegeneration [3,4]. Indeed, a variety of anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to ameliorate CNS diseases in animal experiments [5][6][7]. The progression time of CNS diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases, is generally 2 to 9 years. Extended invasive therapy is linked to decreased patient adherence and increased risks of infection. As a result, oral administration is the mainstay of drug delivery in the clinical management of neurological diseases [8]. Although oral administration is considered a simple and safe route, its efficiency in achieving targeted delivery to the brain is relatively low. \n\nThanks to the rapid development of nanotechnology in recent years, it is possible to use nano-targeted drug delivery systems for the treatment of neurological diseases [9]. Among the diverse types of nanoparticles, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have attracted considerable attention for drug delivery to the brain because of their excellent biocompatibility [10][11][12]. LNPs are characterized by a hollow spherical structure and a lipid layer membrane [13][14][15]. LNPs can be specifically modified to overcome various physiological barriers, including the blood-brain barrier, by incorporating targeting ligands or by using surface modifications. These modifications enable the more efficient brain-targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs, ensuring that they reach their intended sites of action in the central nervous system while minimizing off-target effects. The application of LNPs significantly enhances targeted drug delivery and sustained release, improves pharmacokinetic profiles, and reduces systemic adverse effects.",

            "text": "BackgroundDuring the last decade nanoparticles have gained attention as promising drug delivery agents that can transport through the blood brain barrier. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that specifically targeted nanoparticles which carry a large payload of therapeutic agents can effectively enhance therapeutic agent delivery to the brain. However, it is difficult to draw definite design principles across these studies, owing to the differences in material, size, shape and targeting agents of the nanoparticles. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to develop general design principles that link the size of the nanoparticle with the probability to cross the blood brain barrier. Specifically, we investigate the effect of the nanoparticle size on the probability of barbiturate coated GNPs to cross the blood brain barrier by using bEnd.3 brain endothelial cells as an in vitro blood brain barrier model.ResultsThe results show that GNPs of size 70\u00a0nm are optimal for the maximum amount of gold within the brain cells, and that 20\u00a0nm GNPs are the optimal size for maximum free surface area.ConclusionsThese findings can help understand the effect of particle size on the ability to cross the blood brain barrier through the endothelial cell model, and design nanoparticles for brain imaging/therapy contrast agents.",

Additionally, although LMWP functionalization was shown to enhance the passage of coumarin in the systemic circulation, LMWP-NPs could obtain a much higher AUC brain /AUC blood ratio than non-functionalized nanoparticles [cerebrum 3.230 vs. 2.725; cerebellum 2.738 vs. 1.839; olfactory tract 1.751 vs. 1.120; OB 2.226 vs. 1.348], suggesting that the LMWP modification can facilitate direct brain targeting. \n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles have also been modified with CPPs in order to ameliorate their delivery to the brain via the IN route. An example of this approach comes from Rassu et al. [156], who proposed the use of the CPP RVG-9R in combination with chitosan-coated and -uncoated solid lipid nanoparticles for the delivery of a beta secretase BACE1 siRNA, potentially useful in the treatment of AD. \n\nIn vitro studies were performed to evaluate the permeation capacity of the siRNA alone and the siRNA released from chitosan-coated or -uncoated solid lipid nanoparticles using Caco-2 cells as a model for the nasal epithelium. Both formulations had the ability to increase the intracellular transport of the BACE1 siRNA, significantly enhancing the penetration of the siRNA through the model epithelial cells. Chitosan-coated nanoparticles were the most efficient, thereby proving that the developed nanosystem might be useful in the N2B delivery of siRNAs. \n\nFinally, Samaridou and colleagues [157] recently proposed a novel delivery strategy that involved the combination of polymers, CPPs, and fatty acids, with the ultimate intent of overcoming the biological barriers and ensuring the efficient N2B delivery of the RNAs of interest including siRNAs. In particular, their approach involves the formation of electrostatically driven nanocomplexes between the CPP R8, modified with the fatty acid lauric acid (C12), and the RNA of interest.",

            "text": "Under the most pathological circumstances of diseases such as strokes, seizures, multiple sclerosis, AIDS, diabetes, glioma, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is disrupted [103]. An important reason for the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier is the remodeling of the protein complex in intra-endothelial junctions under the pathological conditions [104]. Normally, the blood-brain barrier acts to maintain blood-brain homeostasis by preventing entry of macromolecules and micromolecules from the blood [105]. If a drug crosses the BBB, it restricts accumulation of the drug in the intracerebral region of brain, and bioavailability is reduced, due to which brain diseases cannot be treated [106]. Therefore, the optimal drug delivery system (DDS) is a cell membrane DDS, virus-based DDS, or exosome-based DDS designed for BBB penetrability, lesion-targeting ability, and standard safety [107]. For the cure of brain diseases, the nanocarrier-assisted intranasal drug carriage system is widely used [108]. Now, at the advanced level, drugs poorly distributed to the brain can be loaded into a nanocarrier-based system, which would interact well with the endothelial micro vessel cells at the BBB and nasal mucosa to increase drug absorption time and the olfactory nerve fibers to stimulate straight nose-to-brain delivery [109], thus greater drug absorption in brain parenchyma through the secondary nose-to-blood-to-brain pathway [110]. The current strategies used are viral vectors, nanoparticles, exosomes, brain permeability enhancers, delivery through active transporters in the BBB, alteration of administration route, nanoparticles for the brain, and imaging/diagnostics under diseased conditions [111].",

The first drug that was delivered to the brain using nanoparticles was the hexapeptide dalargin (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg), a Leu-enkephalin analogue with opioid activity. \n\nNanoparticle based delivery methods are proved to be the best methods to transfer drugs across CNS [12]. These strategies require multifunction NPs combining controlled passage across the BBB. These are proved to be the best methods to facilitate the delivery of drugs and biological therapeutics for brain tumors across the BBB [12]. Nanoparticles could easily traverse the BBB and carry drug to targeted locations inside brain and tumor. A better example is HAS (human serum albumin), that is used as nanoparticle. It is well tolerated to the patients and shows no serious side effect. More exceptionally albumin functional groups can be utilized for surface modification of barrier that allows specific cell uptake [165]. It also acts like as a transforming growth factor in microbubble based drug delivery [166]. Further, to enhance the effectiveness of nanoparticles, these are coated with certain biodegradable materials which make them more permeable to cross the blood brain barrier. However, lipid shelled and nonlipid shelled nanoparticles are prepared [169][170][171]. Similarly, biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles [172], transferrin-conjugated, fluorescein-loaded magnetic nanoparticles [173], solid lipid nanoparticles [169], and chitosan based nanoparticles [174] were made for targeted delivery of drugs across the blood brain barrier. Similarly, hydrogel-based ionotropic delivery devices are also developed for transdermal delivery of peptide/protein drugs [175]. Still it is a challenging task for nanotechnology in delivery of imaging preface in biological systems [176].",

The advantages of NPs over plain drugs or microdrug systems are many, including bigger surface area (higher drug loading) and a diverse range of biomaterials, organic (natural or synthetic polymers), and inorganic (metals) compounds for NP production. The interaction between the drug moiety and NPs is diverse. It can be covalent binding, the presence of an ionic surface charge (ionic binding), direct adsorption, or surface binding, and entrapment of the drug. NP surfaces can be modified as well to aid drug binding, such as with PEGylation, which is the process of covalent/noncovalent amalgamation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the surface.

The use of nanoparticles as a delivery system for biomolecules may enhance the drug transport through the BBB in neurodegenerative diseases. Different inorganic nanoparticular carriers have been applied in this field, e.g. iron oxide, cerium oxide, molybdenum, silica or gold nanoparticles [40][41][42][43][44] . Compared to other types of nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles have received considerable interest because of their relative low cytotoxicity, predominant optical properties for imaging, well-established syntheses, and their potential to cross the BBB 14,28,45,46 . \n\nThe penetration mechanism across the BBB depends on the nanoparticle size and composition. Transmembrane diffusion is mostly observed for low molecular weight and high lipid solubility molecules 47 . Some biomolecules, such as transferrin, are able to cross the BBB via a receptor-mediated process 48 . Sela et al. have shown a spontaneous migration of gold nanoparticles with the size 2.5 nm through the blood brain barrier 49 . Betzer et al. synthesized insulin-coated gold nanoparticles with different sizes (20, 50 and 70 nm) and studied the biodistribution and their ability to cross the BBB in Balb/C mice 50 . It was shown that 2 h after injection, 20 nm gold nanoparticles had a broad biodistribution and a considerable accumulation within the brain. The possibility to apply steady and alternating magnetic fields to drive magnetic nanoparticles and liposomes across the BBB was also shown 21,40,51 . \n\nHere, ultrasmall gold nanoparticles were readily taken up by six-cell human brain spheroids.

            "text": "We examined brain cell binding of synthetic AuNPs after surface modification with neuron-targeted exosomes. Our results clearly indicate that the adhesion of modified AuNPs were significantly higher than the unmodified AuNPs. \n\nAnother major challenge is the blood brain barrier, which is formed by the endothelial cells that line cerebral microvessels if the target site is located in the central nervous system (CNS). Unlike blood capillaries elsewhere in the body, the structure of the BBB is characterized by the tight-junctions that are tightly resistant to the exchange of substances between the blood and the nervous tissue 35 . The transport of conventional systemic drugs into the CNS is therefore hindered partially due to the presence of blood brain barrier that acts as a physical and biochemical barrier 36 . In order to overcome this challenge, several strategies have been developed to enhance penetration of drugs into the brain. Of these, the most frequently used is receptor-mediated transcytosis. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) tagged with transferrin or L-DOPA is one of successful examples for brain targeting. The study of Cabezon, I. et al., 2015 reported that the physical modification of AuNPs with an external antibody against transferrin receptor has successfully achieved for brain internalization using ligand-receptor mediated vesicular fusion and rearrangement within few hours after exposure 37 . Similary, our results clearly demonstrate that the transport across BBB of AuNPs after genetically surface modification with RVG-exosome could be enhanced compared to AuNPs coated with unmodified exosomes. A bioluminescence signal was present in the excised brain after the administration of exosome-modified AuNPs, whereas it was not detectable after treatment with the aqueous solution. This result provides confirmation of the efficient passage of AuNPs fabricated with brain-targeting exosomes into the brain.",

            "text": "In order to circumvent the problems associated with these invasive methods, numerous non-invasive methods have been examined. Among them, modifications of conventional drugs have stimulated the recent development of nanotechnology platforms for crossing the BBB to enable drug delivery to the CNS [10]. With the goal of improving blood to brain transport, nanoplatforms have incorporated modifications such as cationization in order to trigger the AMT process, modifications with small nutrients such as amino acids, hexoses, or vitamins to activate CMT, or the incorporation of endogenous large molecules such as transferrin, lactoferrin, neuropeptides, lectins, insulin, or insulin-like growth factor to activate RMT. Although the pore size in the BBB allowing a passive diffusion is usually less than one nanometer, nanoparticles that have a diameter of several nanometers can cross the BBB by means of CMT [53]. \n\nVarious types of nanoparticles (NPs) (liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, solid NPs, micelles, dendrimers) have been examined as drug delivery systems (DDS) for enhancing the efficacy of agents administered to the brain. As a result, there is a now a rich body of literature available concerning recent developments in promising nanotechnological approaches concerning AD [54,55]. Despite the recent European rejection of the drug aducanumab, due to its harmful side effects, the first clinical success of this monoclonal antibody, which removes amyloid plaques in the brain and slows the progression of the disease, paved the way for the development of strategies using dendrimers both as DDS and as drugs per se [53]. \n\nDendrimers are NPs of small size which represent promising candidates for noninvasive approaches and for systemic drug administration and delivery to the brain. Their special characteristics not only enable them to be modified in order to be transported through biological barriers, including the BBB, but also allow them to play a dual role as therapeutic agents and nanocarriers.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an interface between central nervous system (CNS) and blood circulation. It limits exchange of substances between blood circulation and brain tissue to prevent the CNS from the blood-borne toxins but it hinders the systemic delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain. 1,14 Over the last two decades, researchers have developed many methods to improve the brain drug delivery, one of which is to use nanoparticles (NPs) as drug carriers for drug delivery. 6,9,12,32,39 because NPs can be made nontoxic, biodegradable and biocompatible. They can also maintain physical stability in the blood and have relatively long blood circulation time. Most importantly, after being conjugated with specific antibodies or peptides, they have the ability to recognize targeting sites. 28 NPs, made of liposomes, polymers and metals, usually have diameters from 10 to 1000 nm. It has been found that NPs under 200 nm in diameter display a decreased rate of plasma clearance and thus an extended circulation time as compared to those with a larger diameter. 32,37 here are two transport pathways across the BBB, the paracellular and transcellular pathways. 14,29 Water and small hydrophilic solutes cross the BBB through the paracellular pathway, and the large molecules cross the BBB through transcellular pathways. 14,20,25,32,39 revious studies have investigated the transport across the BBB both in vivo and in vitro. By employing intravital and multiphoton microscopy, Yuan 45,46 and Shi et al. 35,36 developed a non-invasive method and quantified the permeability (P) of post-capillary venules either on rat pia mater or in brain parenchyma 100-200 lm below pia mater to various sized solutes and NPs. Meanwhile, in vitro BBB models by monoculturing or co-culturing brain microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) with astrocytes and/or pericytes 14,24 were developed for low cost, high-throughput screening, and easiness to assess compounds as well as to investigate the transport mechanism at molecular levels.",

[12]Moreover, chemical and biochemical approaches, including liposome, nanoparticle, and prodrug formulations, have also shown promise in improving drug stability, solubility, and specificity. [13]These approaches enhance the transport of drugs across the BBB and enable targeted delivery to specific brain regions.Additionally, recent studies have shown that certain immune cells can autonomously penetrate the BBB, particularly in response to brain inflammation. [14]Interestingly, proteins such as CD44 and CD11b on the surface of macrophage membranes (MM) enable their passage across the BBB and accumulation in inflamed brain tissue. [15]Therefore, utilizing macrophage-modified nanoparticles allows active targeting of inflammatory sites within the brain.By employing these innovative strategies, researchers aim to improve drug delivery across the BBB and achieve precise targeting of therapeutic agents to specific brain regions, particularly those affected by inflammation in neurological disorders.\n\nIn recent years, artificial nanomotors have emerged as a promising research area with significant potential in biomedical applications.

            "text": "The shield of the blood brain barrier (BBB) to protect the brain makes it arduous to deliver drugs to the brain. It has been difficult  for drug delivery systems to cross the BBB and ingress into the neural region despite considerable advancement in the field. This makes the treatment of brain diseases very challenging and the success rate with regards to encephalopathy stands very low (Li et al., 2021). RBC membrane cloaking will make it trouble-free for any molecule or nanoparticle to have their way across the BBB as their membrane properties possess the privilege of passing through all the systems of the body. \n\nCurcumin, a multitarget drug, wielded its neuroprotective effects by activating several neurotrophic factors in the brain through various mechanisms. But due to its low water solubility, it has poor bioavailability. The use of curcumin in Alzheimer's disease to make use of its protective effects was achieved by RBCcloaked nanoparticles. PLGA nanoparticles loaded with curcumin was cloaked with RBC membrane and functionalized with DSPE-PEG-T807 with a size of 170 nm which could target at neuronal tau. The RBC protects curcumin by increasing its bioavailability while the T807 helps crossing the BBB with good biocompatibility, and sustained curcumin release (Figure 8B) and prolonged circulation (Figure 10) (Gao et al., 2020a). Another study has been designed with the same nanoparticle for Alzheimer's disease except that human serum albumin was used as a carrier in place of PLGA with a particle size less than 120 nm (Gao et al., 2020b). Both studies have shown good uptakes of the nanoparticles with desired targeting for the treatment of Alzheimer's. Immunotherapeutic effect in glioblastoma therapy was also achieved by using RBC-cloaked nanogels with a size about 131 nm carrying miRNAs. Reinforcement of microglia and macrophages by miRNAs reprograms the immunotherapeutic impact.",

Inspired by the neuroprotective properties of vinpocetine, which regulates cerebral blood flow, we propose a molecular library design centered on this class of cyclic tertiary amine compounds and develop a self-enhanced brain-targeted nucleic acid delivery system. Our findings reveal that: (i) vinpocetine-derived ionizable-lipidoid nanoparticles efficiently breach the blood-brain barrier; (ii) they have high gene-loading capacity, facilitating endosomal escape and intracellular transport; (iii) their administration is safe with minimal immunogenicity even with prolonged use; and (iv) they have potent pharmacologic brain-protective activity and may synergize with treatments for brain disorders as demonstrated in male APP/PS1 mice.",

            "text": "Delivering drugs into the brain: A major challenge in the pharmacologic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is the achievement of efficient drug delivery into the brain. Brain delivery requires that an intravenous drug crosses the blood-brain barrier, which is formed by the endothelial cells of the brain capillary vessels. To protect the brain from toxic substances, the blood-brain barrier contains tight junctions between adjacent cells that ensure a remarkably low permeability to blood molecules (Abbott et al., 2010). Consequently, this essential protective barrier complicates intravenous drugs from reaching the brain. This limitation has been frequently overlooked in drug research for neurodegenerative diseases (Pardridge, 2019). In addition, the P-glycoprotein, an active efflux system of the brain capillary vessels, pumps small molecules out of its endothelial cells, further complicating their crossing of the blood-brain barrier (Pardridge, 2019). Thus, drugs that are P-glycoprotein substrates will face an additional obstacle to their brain delivery. \n\nDrug injection into the cerebrospinal fluid, which surrounds the surface of the brain, allows the drug to reach its surface, but not to achieve a homogeneous distribution throughout this organ (Pardridge, 2019). This goal has been pursued through the exploitation of transport systems of the endothelial cells in the blood-brain barrier. Small molecules failing to diffuse through the membranes of these cells can be engineered to interact with small-molecule transporters on those membranes, including the GLUT1 glucose transporter (Pardridge, 2019;Figure 1B, left). \n\nEndothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier also contain transporters for peptides and proteins, including the insulin receptor (Abbott et al., 2010). They work by forming a vesicle around the protein or peptide and translocating it across the endothelial cell. A therapeutic protein or peptide can be fused to a monoclonal antibody that mimics a substrate of one of these transporters, yielding a molecular Trojan horse (Pardridge, 2019). Alternatively, a gene coding for the therapeutic protein or peptide can be provided through gene therapy.",

            "text": "The development of nanoparticle systems for the delivery of drugs to the brain has emerged as a transformative approach in addressing the limitations associated with conventional drug delivery methods. The primary challenge in treating neurological disorders lies in overcoming the highly selective nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Figure 4), which restricts the passage of most therapeutic agents to the central nervous system (CNS) [210][211][212]. Nanoparticles, owing to their tunable size, surface properties, and biocompatibility, offer a versatile platform to bypass the BBB and enable targeted drug delivery to the brain [213]. Various nanoparticle systems, including polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers, and solid lipid nanoparticles, have demonstrated promising results in preclinical and clinical studies. These systems not only enhance the bioavailability of drugs but also minimize systemic toxicity by providing site-specific delivery [214]. Furthermore, functionalization of nanoparticles with targeting ligands, such as peptides or antibodies, further improves their ability to penetrate the BBB and reach specific neural tissues [215]. This cutting-edge technology has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and brain tumors, by addressing the unmet need for effective therapeutic delivery. (Neurological disorders and drug distribution methods are shown in Table 2  Age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are very common. Although the central nervous system is the part that is most affected, the peripheral nervous system is also affected. The need to manage or control NDs increased the urge to research and create effective alternative techniques because some medications and diagnostics were unavailable [216][217][218]. Sincere attempts are being undertaken to adapt nanotechnology to manage brain cell activity such as deep brain stimulation, implanted stimulation, therapeutic cargo packing, distribution to the brain, and nanomedicine with improved efficacy. These developments can be used to develop treatment plans in the future that take the patient's neurodegenerative condition into account.",

After symbiosis with brain-targeted exosomes, the unique targeting properties of gold nanoparticles were demonstrated by their binding to brain cells under laminar flow conditions and their enhanced transport through the blood-brain barrier. Synthetic surface modification of gold nanoparticles with brain-targeted exosomes represents a very novel and efficient strategy to provide effective brain targeting [71]. \n\nThe dominant effects of exosomes are mainly manifested in many processes, such as cell signaling, tissue transformation and re-differentiation, and regulation of signaling pathways. Exosomes are easily manipulated and target active molecules can be encapsulated during the production of exosomes secreted by parental cells and are able to cross multiple biological barriers (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Exosomes have weak targeting ability. This leads to the waste of exosomes in use and affects therapeutic efficacy. In addition, there is increased aggregation in non-target organs or tissues and toxic side effects. Therefore, improving the targeting ability of exosomes is an obligatory way to achieve a large number of future applications of exosomes.",

Due to its high biological selectivity, it is difficult for ASMs to cross the BBB. To augment the cerebral delivery of ASMs, advanced strategies in nanocarrier design are employed. These include surface modification with substrates of BBB-specific transport proteins, ligandreceptor targeting using specific receptor ligands, incorporation of cell-penetrating peptides, and the inhibition of efflux transporters (Fig. 1).

            "text": "Nanoparticles have emerged as a promising strategy for facilitating the delivery of therapeutic agents, particularly antibodies, across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for the treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders. The BBB poses a significant challenge in neuropharmacology due to its selective permeability, which restricts the entry of most drugs into the brain [52]. Utilizing nanoparticles as carriers can enhance the transport and targeted delivery of antibodies by exploiting receptor-and adsorptive-mediated transcytosis [53]. \n\nFor example, researchers have developed transferrin-modified nanoparticles that target the transferrin receptors abundantly expressed on the BBB. These nanoparticles have been used to deliver anti-beta-amyloid antibodies in Alzheimer's disease models, significantly reducing the amyloid plaque burden and improving cognitive function [54]. Another approach involves using polymeric nanoparticles such as PLGA [poly(lactic-coglycolic acid)] conjugated with glutathione, which resulted in increased brain penetration and the delivery of neuroprotective antibodies in Parkinson's disease models, leading to a reduction in dopaminergic neuron loss and motor function improvement [55]. \n\nLiposomal nanoparticles modified with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) have been successfully employed to deliver antibodies targeting tau proteins, a hallmark of the pathology of Alzheimer's. This system has been demonstrated to promote improved antibody accumulation in the brain and the subsequent inhibition of tau aggregation, resulting in neuroprotection and enhanced cognitive performance in animal models [56]. \n\nRecent studies have also explored the use of exosome-mimicking nanoparticles, which leverage the natural ability of exosomes to cross the BBB. These nanoparticles, loaded with therapeutic antibodies against alpha-synuclein, have shown potential in treating Parkinson's disease through reducing the accumulation of toxic alpha-synuclein aggregates in the brain [57]. \n\nMoreover, the surface modification of nanoparticles with specific ligands, such as the angiopep-2 peptide, has been shown to further enhance BBB penetration and target specificity [55].",

Some authors were able to develop efficient nanosystems for the encapsulation of RES and its delivery to the brain tissue (Hao et al., 2016;Ethemoglu et al., 2017;Trotta et al., 2018). Several studies prove that modification of the surface of the nanosystem can enhance the transport across this barrier (Loureiro et al., 2013aNeves et al., 2016;Shen et al., 2018). The modifications strategies can be based on attaching to the nanomaterial surface different moieties that improve the recognition of the nanoparticle (NP) by the BBB receptors (Loureiro et al., , 2016Li et al., 2017).\n\nAs mentioned above, a growing number of studies have focused on the treatment of several neurological diseases with RES encapsulated in NPs. This review will focus on RES therapeutic mechanisms in the prevention and treatment of glioma tumors, AD and PD, and nanotechnology-based strategies for its use in these diseases.",

For example, polyethyleneimine nanoparticles were used in a study to determine the destination and penetration of such nanoparticles when transiting through the blood brain barrier, and it was shown that a fixed size of nanoparticles (50 nm) promoted penetration of brain endothelial cells. Nanoparticles with different surface modifications interact in different ways with the surface of the brain epithelial cells, and many respond to metabolic inhibitors and endocytosis pathways (different surfaces have different forms of internalization). Consequently, many tests required size and surface morphology for efficient transport of nanoparticles [5]. \n\nGeneralizing, each group of nanoparticles with different sizes, shapes, surfaces, chemical composition, and biopersistence (time a nanoparticle remains within the body) will have different effects on the health of the living. Toxicological studies show that closely similar substances induce substantially different responses. Some groups will be safe, whilst a group with an apparent slight variation may present significant toxic effects. Some ordinary raw materials are poisonous or harmful. However, when these were used to obtain nanoparticles, was the solutions to many medical complications, with minimal adverse effects. In conclusion, it is important to regulate manufacturing, consumption, routes of administration, and so forth especially in light of new developments and gained knowledge [6,7].",

            "text": "One of the main obstacles that inhibit the development of effective medications for the prevention and treatment of AD is the selective nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents brain penetration of a large number of central nervous system (CNS) drugs [14,15,18]. As a consequence, only less than 5% of APIs are able enter the brain by passive diffusion [19]; mainly molecules with low molecular weight (Mw), lipid solubility and a small, positive charge [1,[20][21][22][23][24][25]. The other major obstacle in the systemic treatment of brain diseases is that many CNS drugs have to be administered at high doses to reach satisfactory therapeutic efficacy, which results in severe peripheral side-effects [26,27]. In an attempt to overcome limitations represented by the BBB, various colloidal delivery systems have been developed in the last two decades that exploit the benefits of particle size reduction, such as polymeric NPs, liposomes, metal NP-based carriers, solid-lipid NPs, cubosomes and emulsions [28]. Among these nanocarriers, polymeric nanoparticles (NP) seem to be particularly suitable for the enhancement of drug pharmacokinetics, as they are able to mask the BBB transport limiting physicochemical properties of API molecules [24]. Polymeric nanocarriers are also ideal tools to reduce peripheral side effects, either by facilitating sustained drug discharge [29][30][31] or by enabling controlled API release via the incorporation of stimuli-responsive building blocks [32]. Polymeric carriers can bind drugs either covalently and non-covalently, as well as are able to carry both hydrophilic and hydrophobic therapeutic compounds [33]. Furthermore, polymer-based NPs exhibit an array of additional benefits, such high stability, facile production, high encapsulation efficacy, possibility for sterilization, easy modification with targeting ligands and multifunctional nature [19].",

            "text": "The surface of EVs can be conveniently modified with molecules to enhance their targeting, offering several advantages over modifying donor cells for targeted drug delivery. The chemical and genetic modification of EVs enables highly controlled attachment of ligands, enhancing the precision of drug delivery, which may not be achievable through donor cell modification. Chemical modifications of EVs involve introducing various functional groups or moieties (peptides, proteins, lipids, aptamers, small molecules, and polymers). Chemical modifications are achieved through specific chemical reactions targeting lipids or membrane-bound proteins, or lipid-lipid interactions within the membrane. For genetic modification, ligands or homing peptides are fused with transmembrane proteins expressed on the surface of EVs. Then, donor cells transfected with plasmids encoding these fusion proteins secrete engineered EVs with targeting ligands on their surface. These methods provide a promising avenue for developing targeted therapies with potential applications in personalized medicine. Engineered EVs can facilitate the successful delivery of EV cargo through the blood-brain barrier in a mouse model. For example, multifunctional peptides containing therapeutic Lys-Leu-Ala (KLA) and targeted low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are used to target LDL receptors on glioblastoma cells, amplifying chemotherapy effectiveness in challenging conditions such as glioblastoma (Ye et al. 2018). Chemical modification techniques, such as copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition \"click\" reactions, can be utilized to nonspecifically modify EVs (Ye et al. 2018). This demonstrates the potential of chemically modified EVs for precise drug delivery in glioma treatment. In another study, researchers bioorthogonally conjugated cyclic peptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-(spacer)lysine (c[RGDyK]) to the surface of EVs. This modification resulted in curcumin-carrying c(RGDyK) EVs, which efficiently penetrated the blood-brain barrier.",

Here, we developed a previously unknown class of neurotransmitter\u2013derived lipidoids (NT-lipidoids) as simple and effective carriers for enhanced brain delivery of several BBB-impermeable cargos. Doping the NT-lipidoids into BBB-impermeable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) gave the LNPs the ability to cross the BBB. Using this brain delivery platform, we successfully delivered amphotericin B (AmB), antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against tau, and genome-editing fusion protein (\u221227)GFP-Cre recombinase into the mouse brain via systemic intravenous administration. We demonstrated that the NT-lipidoid formulation not only facilitates cargo crossing of the BBB, but also delivery of the cargo into neuronal cells for functional gene silencing or gene recombination. This class of brain delivery lipid formulations holds great potential in the treatment of central nervous system diseases or as a tool to study the brain function.",

            "text": "Treating neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease remains an ongoing challenge due to the protective blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents most therapeutic agents from crossing into the brain. To overcome this challenge, innovative lipid-based nanoparticles and polymeric scaffolds are being explored as potential solutions for targeted drug delivery to the brain [126][127][128]. These delivery systems are designed to cross the BBB either by exploiting specific transport mechanisms or by modifying their surface properties to enhance permeability. Lipid nanoparticles, such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) or liposomes, have shown promise in delivering neuroprotective agents such as antioxidants, neurotrophic factors, and anti-inflammatory drugs directly to the brain [129][130][131]. These systems can also be engineered to release their payloads in a controlled manner, which improves drug efficacy and minimizes side effects. Research has also focused on the development of polymeric nanoparticles and nanogels that can encapsulate multiple therapeutic agents and release them in a targeted, sustained manner, ensuring that higher concentrations of the drug reach the intended site of action within the brain [132,133]. Advances in polymeric scaffolds have enabled the development of biomaterials that can not only carry drugs to the brain but also serve as structural support for damaged tissues, aiding in neuroregeneration [134,135]. For example, hydrogel-based systems have been developed to deliver nerve growth factors to promote the regeneration of neurons in conditions such as Parkinson's disease [136][137][138]. These systems are designed to interact with specific regions of the brain that are affected by disease, improving the delivery of therapeutic agents and providing more personalized, effective treatment options. Moreover, strategies such as nanoparticle-functionalized antibodies and aptamers are being investigated to enhance targeting specificity, ensuring that drugs reach only the affected areas, thereby minimizing off-target effects [139,140].",

The use of magnetic fields and near-infrared (NIR) radiation with these nanoparticles facilitates improved imaging techniques and the controlled release of drugs across the BBB on demand (Fig. 7(a-c)) [73]. In research -coated magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4@CMC) demonstrate promise for BBB-crossing drug delivery, with proven biocompatibility and controlled release capabilities. In this research, magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4) are coated with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). The CMC coating provides biocompatibility, stability, and functionalization sites for drug loading. This combination aims to enhance the nanoparticles' ability to cross the blood-brain barrier for targeted drug delivery. Their hydrophilic CMC coating prevents agglomeration, enhances dispersion, and facilitates functionalization for targeted therapy, potentially minimizing neurological treatment side effects. These cost-effective, biodegradable nanoparticles offer a targeted approach for efficient brain drug delivery, highlighting their significance in neurotherapeutics [33]. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), particularly when surface-modified (i.e., PEG), offer a promising platform for drug delivery [60,74]. \n\nA diagnostic probe utilizing DNA-modified AuNPs has been developed to detect amyloid-derived diffusible ligands, highlighting their potential in diagnostics [73]. Additionally, AuNPs engineered for theranostic applications have demonstrated the ability to penetrate the BBB and tumors, showing promise for targeted brain drug delivery due to their selectivity and low toxicity [75]. \n\nFunctionalized AuNPs with transferrin (Tf) have shown remarkable penetration into mice, employing the receptor transcytosis pathway [76,77]. AuNPs with a cleavable acid linkage and Tf coating were more effective in brain accumulation than their non-cleavable counterparts due to the cleavable process that allowed for enhanced drug release into the brain.",

Some neurological disorders that are prevalent and remain difficult to treat are glioma, neurodegenerative disease, ischemic stroke, and traumatic brain injury. Subsequently, the therapeutic efficacy of small molecules, proteins, and oligonucleotides remains a challenge due to the presence of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), a highly selective semipermeable membrane. To this end, multifunctional nanomaterials have emerged as promising vehicles for targeted drug delivery to the brain, due to their ability to transport therapeutics across the BBB selectively. The design of advanced nanomaterial\u2010based drug delivery systems capable of overcoming the BBB is influenced by many factors, such as fabrication technique and surface modification. This review explores the diverse range of nanomaterials, including polymer, lipid, gold, magnetic, and carbon\u2010based nanostructures, capable of effectively passing the BBB. These materials cross the BBB via a variety of established transport mechanisms for targeted delivery of therapeutics to the brain. Moreover, the structure and function of the BBB are highlighted and the potential for nanotechnology to aid the treatment of neurological disorders based on their ability to undergo transcytosis into the brain is highlighted.",

Therefore, it is crucial to explore methods that enhance hydrogen delivery to the brain. In this context, liposomes emerge as a promising nanocarrier, offering unique advantages. \n\nLiposomes are nanoscale to microscale vesicles composed of one or more lipid bilayers that surround an aqueous compartment (Sanches et al., 2021). They exhibit excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low immunogenicity, and are capable of encapsulating hydrophilic, lipophilic, and hydrophobic substances, making them ideal carriers for drug delivery (Gu et al., 2019). In the treatment of neurological disorders, the application of liposomes is particularly crucial, as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the entry of many drugs into the brain (Topal et al., 2020). \n\nLiposomes enhance the efficiency of brain-targeted delivery through the synergistic action of multiple mechanisms. Their unique physicochemical properties enable the encapsulation of a variety of drugs, offering excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability. The modification of liposomes with active targeting ligands is of significant importance in enhancing brain-targeted delivery. Studies have shown that liposomes modified with the transferrin receptor antibody OX26 can activate receptor-mediated transcytosis, significantly improving the ability of drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier, thereby achieving sustained therapeutic effects in PD rat models (Xia et al., 2008). In the mechanism of electrostatic adsorption mediated by cationic charges, cationic lipids interact with the negative charges of the blood-brain barrier endothelial cells, facilitating drug delivery.",

Additionally, the in vivo experiment regarding the co-delivery of cisplatin and boldine, an antioxidant agent, using the poly(lactide-co-glycolic) nanocarriers resulted in an effective target-specific delivery for therapeutic use in brain cancer therapy [44]. Furthermore, the use of a positively charged polymer, poly(ethylene imine) [45], and of the poly(ethylene imine)-poly(L-lysine) copolymer [46] as gene delivery vehicles has been reported. To improve the cytocompatibility of poly(ethylene imine), L-glutathione was attached to the backbone of the polymer, which also enhanced the passage through the blood-brain barrier in vitro [45]. Thus, it has been demonstrated the potential of poly(ethylene imine)-based nanoparticles for the delivery of genes for gene therapy in brain cancer [45,46].",

In 5XFAD mice in vivo, the injection of TPP-Ceria NPs significantly restored neuronal activity and maintained the normal crista structure and morphology of mitochondria, suggesting the potential of prevention and early treatment of AD. However, when the antioxidant was used alone, it is not satisfied to eliminate the previous A\u03b2 plaques, which may require combined strategy to fulfill a complement clearance. Overall, the report demonstrated a mitochondrial strategy for treating neuroinflammation, thus providing insights into the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nBBB, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, acts as a barrier between central nervous cells and the peripheral circulatory system, and plays an elaborate protective role in the central nervous system through the diffusion of a harmful substance and the promotion of nutrient transport. But these barriers are also a major challenge for delivering drugs to the nervous system to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the mechanisms by which the blood-brain barrier is crossed is important for improving the effects of antioxidants on the brain. Positively charged carriers, for example, are more likely to penetrate the BBB and enter brain tissue. Carrier surface modification of transporter and receptor binding molecules such as apolipoprotein E3 transferrin or lactoferrin can enhance the targeting of target cells. Currently, non-invasive brain drug delivery materials such as liposomes and polymer nanoparticles have been widely studied for their biocompatibility, low antigenicity, high degradation, and high patient compliance. However, the side effects of various nanoparticles on target cells and other organs, drug loading, and off-target drug interactions with non-specific receptors are problems and challenges in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases using nanodelivery vectors. Future technologies combined with high technology such as implantable devices or store-delivered chips can bring new prospects and promise.",

Nanotechnology has been instrumental in these advancements, enabling the creation of nanomaterials as drug carriers with key advantages such as nanoscale size, high drug-loading capacity, stability, and biocompatibility. Among these, lipid-based and inorganic nanoparticles have emerged as promising tools for crossing the BBB, paving the way for targeted and efficient GBM treatment. These nanoparticles facilitate passive and active drug transport to brain tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme [19]. Passive drug delivery leverages the enhanced penetration and retention (EPR) effect, which involves the movement of molecules of specific sizes across the BBB in tumor regions [20]. However, active transport systems are essential for effective drug delivery in areas where the BBB remains intact. This approach involves designing nanoparticles with surface ligands that target glial tissue or BBB-specific receptors, enabling receptor-mediated or adsorptive endocytosis [19]. The zeta potential of nanoparticles plays a critical role in their interaction with the BBB and distribution within the brain. A moderately positive charge enhances electrostatic interactions with negatively charged endothelial cells, facilitating BBB penetration. However, excessive positive charges can increase aggregation risk and immune activation. On the other hand, neutral or slightly anionic nanoparticles minimize non-specific interactions, extend circulation time, and improve their ability to cross the BBB effectively.",

            "text": "To date, the therapeutic impact of advances in our knowledge of CNS tumors has been significantly hindered by the unique biology which surrounds these tumors, namely the blood-brain barrier, which not only prevents the entry of the vast majority of therapeutics, but actively removes them from the CNS space via the activity of efflux transporters. To overcome the vexing challenges posed by the BBB and increase the CNS tumor therapeutic exposure time, a variety of strategies utilizing nanoparticles have been developed, which enable greater delivery and retention of therapeutics at the site of disease. One such strategy in the CNS targeting nanoparticle space entails the modification of therapeuticcontaining nanoparticles with groups which will induce nanoparticle transport into the CNS via transcytosis. To achieve this, nanoparticles are modified with ligands for receptors highly expressed on CNS endothelial cells which when bound will induce transcytosis. Alternatively, the nanoparticle can be modified with a substrate for a transporter highly expressed on CNS endothelial cells which, when bound, similarly induces transcytosis. Ideally, these receptors/transporters are both highly expressed on the CNS endothelial cells and on the tumor itself, as is the case for transferrin and GLUT1, respectively. Another approach for facilitating nanoparticle BBB circumvention involves hitching a ride with cells which are already able to enter the CNS, and which have innate tumor-tropic active homing ability. Examples of this approach have utilized MSCs and various WBCs, and although-to our knowledge-this strategy has yet to be tested in an animal model with an intact BBB, enhanced accumulation of NPs in the tumor region of orthotopic xenograft glioma mouse models has been demonstrated, indicating significant promise for the approach. \n\nIn addition to strategies which solely rely on the nanoparticle to bypass the BBB, strategies have been devised which make use of nanoparticles in combination with unique delivery methods which are designed to disrupt the BBB or bypass it entirely. These approaches include intranasal delivery, convection-enhanced delivery, and focused ultrasound.",

For example, recent reports introduced the concept of magnetic liposomes as a targeting moiety for delivering of therapeutic molecules International Journal of Nanomedicine 2016:11 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress Dovepress 5386 vieira and Gamarra across the BBB. In one example, one or more drug molecules could be reversibly bound to the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles, and when encapsulated within the core of liposomes, bypassed an established in vitro model of the BBB by action of an external magnetic field. 67 Furthermore, it has been shown that magnetic liposomes can also be taken up into human monocytes, followed by the entry of nonmagnetic monocytes into the brain. 67 Although this approach has not been largely explored for brain delivery, this may become a good strategy for effective drug delivery by stimuli-responsive liposomes.\n\nFurthermore, multifunctional liposomes can be engineered into a single structure, providing a powerful approach to improve disease-specific detection, treatment, and follow-up monitoring. 30 The term \"theranostic\" is used for nanoparticles that incorporate both therapeutic and diagnostic agents onto the same system. 75 One example of theranostic agent for brain delivery was described by Wen et al, 76 using quantum dots and apomorphine liposomally encapsulated for both brain therapy and imaging. The results showed that theranostic liposomes were transported across the BBB, providing a new and exciting strategy for brain-cancer imaging and therapy. 76 It is worth mentioning that various routes of administration have been tested to access the brain for therapeutic purposes. For the delivery of liposomes to the CNS, intravenous injection seems to be the preferred route. The possibility of choosing between alternative routes",

            "text": "Currently, available therapies for neurodegenerative disorders can only control the symptoms rather than treating the root cause of the disease. Failure of the majority of therapies targeted to the brain is at the point of BBB where most of the drugs fail to pass the barrier. BBB is a large complex structure responsible for maintaining a tightly regulated microenvironment inside the brain that blocks substances from passing from the blood into the brain (67). It is made up of the monolayer of endothelial cells, which make up the capillary walls of the brain, joined by tight junctions, which involve cell adhesion molecules like Occludin, Claudin, and other cell adhesion molecules. Other proteins associated with BBB include perivascular macrophages, astrocytes, and pericytes (68). The BBB regulates the active and passive transport-mediated entry of important nutrients and oxygen into the brain and also prevents the entry of neurotoxins, pathogens, and other unwanted substances into the brain (69). The proper operation of BBB is required for maintaining vital functions of the brain because any breach at blood and brain interface can lead to numerous neurological conditions like PD and AD (70). To address this limitations, nanoparticles have emerged as safe and potential molecules to deliver drugs or therapeutic molecules across the BBB (71). Nanoparticles mostly ranging from 1 to 1,000 nm, have the ability to carry high drug concentration, increased drug transmission, low toxicity in the brain along with physical and chemical stability. A variety of natural, synthetic and inorganic nanocarriers such as Polymeric and liposomal particles have been developed for the identifying and managing neurodegenerative diseases (72)(73)(74). Inorganic nanoparticles (Gold, Silver, and Cerium) are most exploited for targeted brain drug delivery and imaging applications across BBB due to their size, stability, surface modification, and functional property (75,76).",

            "text": "Pharmaceutical research aims at identifying new strategies to modify the course of diseases and improve the patient's quality of life. This is certainly an important challenge, especially for therapeutic applications that involve the administration of the drug in specific anatomical sites, such as the central nervous system (CNS). In this region, the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which protects the brain parenchyma from the bloodstream, constitutes a major obstacle that impedes therapeutics to carry out their pharmacological action in situ [1,2]. The most immediate strategy to reach the brain is to physically overcome the BBB through direct intrathecal administration. However, this type of method is certainly invasive, painful, and may produce some unfortunate side effects. The use of biocompatible polymer nanoparticles (NPs) as drug delivery systems is an alternative approach that is gaining growing interest among the possible strategies for the targeted transport of drugs and molecules to the brain for the treatment of all those degenerative diseases involving the CNS [3][4][5]. NPs generally have a diameter between 1 and a few hundred nanometers but NPs with radii of about 100 nm are those with the best pharmacokinetic properties [3,6]. NPs can convey the therapeutic molecule internally (nanocapsules) or by adsorption on their surface (nanospheres). The advantages deriving from the use of nanoparticulate systems concern the possibility of obtaining a controlled and prolonged release of the drug and modifying its distribution and consequent clearance, in order to have, on the one hand, an increase in therapeutic efficacy and on the other hand, a reduction in side effects [3,5]. Moreover, the use of biopolymer-based NPs guarantees, in addition to the specific targeting of the drug or molecule of interest, extremely important peculiarities such as the biocompatibility and biodegradability of the system [3,[7][8][9]. The use of nanocarriers has a very high potential for the administration of therapeutic molecules to the brain as, by virtue of their size, are prone to overcoming anatomical barriers such as BBB.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles have attracted significant nanotechnology attention due to their distinctive properties and extensive potential applications [27]. The extensive research into nanoparticles is primarily driven by their inherent attributes, including heightened stability, precise targeting capabilities, and controlled drug release mechanisms [27,28]. These qualities make nanoparticles exceptionally well-suited for an ideal pharmacotherapeutic approach, particularly in disorders such as epilepsy, where the need for on-demand drug release and effective blood-brain barrier penetration is pronounced [29]. Furthermore, nanoparticles offer a versatile formulation approach, as they can be synthesized from diverse organic and inorganic materials, encompassing lipids, proteins, polymers, and metals [27,30]. \n\nMaximizing the effectiveness and safety of nanoparticles in epilepsy treatment necessitates a holistic evaluation of critical properties. These properties encompass size, shape, surface attributes, core stability, biocompatibility, toxicity, release kinetics, and intricate targeting mechanisms [31,32]. While a universal nanoparticle blueprint remains elusive, specific attributes have emerged as pivotal in aiding these agents to overcome the blood-brain barrier [33,34]. Notably, nanoparticles with dimensions smaller than 200 nm, particularly in the 10 to 100 nm range, exhibit remarkable permeability and optimal performance [35,36]. The sustained release of drugs plays a vital role in epilepsy management, ensuring therapeutic drug levels within the brain, reducing seizures, and minimizing the need for frequent medication administration [37][38][39]. Strategies like pH-responsive polymers and stimuli-responsive systems are employed for controlled and sustained drug release [40]. Additionally, surface modifications, such as attaching targeting ligands and implementing stealth coatings, enhance specificity, stability, and circulation longevity [16,41]. An ideal surface charge for effective brain drug delivery is either positive or neutral, allowing nanoparticles to interact with the blood-brain barrier and cellular receptors [42][43][44]. However, despite extensive research and its significant potential, the availability of nanomedicines for therapeutic purposes remains limited.",

However, poor biocompatibility of INOPs limits their application. To improve the shortcomings, various surface modifications have been developed, including small molecules coatings, polymers coatings, lipid coatings and lipopolymer coatings. These surface modifications facilitate iron nanoparticles to cross the blood-brain-barrier, which is essential for diagnosis and treatments of brain diseases. Here we focus on the characteristics of different coated INOPs and their application in brain disease, particularly gliomas, Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD).

Three main barriers in BBB are positioned in a sequence having the extravascular section, the epithelium, and the glycocalyx go from the bloodstream to the brain in that order. Understanding the composition and operation of these barriers is crucial for developing new medications that can effectively target invasive tumor cells as well as for comprehending the use of optic indicators in brain tumor therapeutics associated with a healthy brain [16,17]. By blocking the entry of medications, inflammatory cells, blood-borne proteins, and other solutes, the BBB secures the sensitive surroundings of the brain. Consequently, this also inhibits the transport of fluorescent markers into the brain, decreasing the efficacy of optical imaging methods [18]. \n\nBy making use of the widely recognized endogenous BBB trafficking channels, a variety of nanoplatforms, including polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, liposomes, protein nanocages, and inorganic nanoparticles, are successful in regional brain tumor administration [19]. Here is a comprehensive introduction of benefits of nanomedicine over conventional therapy include better biocompatibility, multiple drug loading ability, cell or tissue targeting ability, controlled drug release ability, and even the capacity to traverse the BBB [20]. Enhancing the size of the nanoparticle, modulating the shape, varying the ligand density, increasing the lipophilicity, and surface chemical modification can also effectively intensify the amounts of nanoparticles accumulated in the brain and improve the therapeutic effect. The brain-targeted systems that have been investigated the most are nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and liposomes [17]. These systems can regulate the release of encapsulated pharmaceuticals, shield them from biological and chemical deterioration in the bloodstream, allow surface modification with targeted ligands, and facilitate PEGylation or steric stability.",

            "text": "Therefore, it is necessary to protect it against the contamination with environmental and foreign substances which could lead to changes in the inner and outer concentrations of neuronal cells and subsequently to impairments in nerve conduction and dysfunctions in the body control processes [6]. The blood-brain barrier is the structure responsible for the protection of the brain, acting as a local gateway against the circulating toxins and cells [7] through a selective permeability system. Hence, the delivery systems for the treatment of brain diseases should have the capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier without causing immune responses. However, the physiological function of the blood-brain barrier is the key challenge for the delivery of pharmaceutical drugs to the brain, which represents the main reason for complications in the existing treatment strategies and for the numerous research studies focusing on the development of novel drug delivery systems for the treatment of brain-associated diseases [8]. The principal pathways for crossing the blood-brain barrier are through paracellular transport, between endothelial cells, and through transcellular transport, involving passive or active mechanisms, across the luminal side of the endothelial cells, through the cytoplasm, and subsequently across the abluminal side, into the brain interstitium [9]. Although there are multiple crossing pathways, approximately 98% of small molecules and most large molecules are unable to reach the brain through the blood-brain barrier [10]. \n\nNanotechnology, the emerging field that encompasses knowledge from multiple disciplines including chemistry, physics, engineering, and biology, implicates the development and modification of materials within the size range of 1-100 nm in at least one dimension [11][12][13]. Additionally, nanotechnology represents the capacity to understand, manipulate, and control the matter at the level of individual atoms and molecules [14]. Therefore, the implication of nanotechnology for the development of non-invasive drug delivery strategies could lead to the design of novel and improved formulations to enhance the delivery of therapeutic agents across the blood-brain barrier [3,[15][16][17][18].",

Regrettably, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) severely restricts the transport of this potent antioxidant to the brain. Although small lipophilic molecules (MW < 400 kDa) can cross the BBB in pharmacologically significant amounts, effective concentrations of lipid-insoluble drugs (polar molecules and small ions), as well as high molecular weight compounds (peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids), cannot be delivered to the CNS within the limits of clinical toxicity. The inability of most potent therapeutics to cross the BBB following systemic administration necessitates the need to develop unconventional, clinically applicable drug delivery systems for the treatment of brain disorders. Smart, biologically active vehicles are crucial to accomplishing this challenging task.\n\nTo this end, immunocytes that include mononuclear phagocytes (dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages), neutrophils, and lymphocytes can carry nanoformulated drugs as they readily home to disease sites. Using living cells as drug delivery vehicles, takes advantage of their natural carriage, storage, mobility, and secretory capacity. It offers several benefits over common drug administration regimens; these include targeted drug transport to disease sites, prolonged drug half-lives, time-controlled drug release, and diminished drug immunogenicity and cytotoxicity profiles. Thus, a cell-based delivery system to bring nanoformulated catalase to affected brain regions was developed [138,139]. The system rests in the abilities of blood-borne macrophages to carry antioxidant proteins across the BBB to the inflamed tissues. Using inflammatory response cells enables targeted drug transport and prolonged circulation times [140], along with reductions in cell and tissue toxicities. In addition, these cells are capable of cell-to-cell transmission of drug-laden nanoparticles that improves their therapeutic outcomes.\n\nOne of the main obstacles in utilizing these cells is related to the fact that monocytes efficiently disintegrate and digest all entrapped foreign particles. Therefore, it is crucial to protect the activity of the drug inside this cell carrier [141]. To preclude macrophage-mediated",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a challenge for treating brain cancers, since it only permits passage of less than 2% of molecules, including ions, nutrients, specific peptides and proteins, and leukocytes [36]. The barrier consists of endothelial cells joined by tight junctions and enclosed by astrocytic cells, basal lamina, pericytes, and microglia. Current methods for increasing penetration may involve direct introductions into the brain such as intraventricular or intracerebral injection, infusion, and implantation and may increase toxicity risks and non-uniform drug dispersals [11]. \n\nReceptor-mediated endocytosis may be responsible for nanoparticle entry through the blood brain barrier [37]. This method relies on the conjugation of ligands or peptides to receptors that bind nanoparticles to the surface of the endothelial cells [11]. Surfactants such as poloxamer 188 or polysorbate 80 may be used to coat nanoparticles to increase adsorption of serum proteins such as apolipoproteins E or A-I and thus enhance penetration through the BBB [38]. Covalent attachment of apolipoproteins to human serum albumin-coated nanoparticles may also improve their ability to cross the BBB [39]. Use of targeting ligands that bind to receptors on endothelial cells, such as transferrin, lactoferrin, and low-density lipoprotein receptors, may also promote BBB penetration [37,40,41]. \n\nNanoparticle size and charge are essential considerations for passing through the blood brain barrier. One study demonstrated that nanoparticles with diameters of 20-70 nm are preferential for transport [42]. Neutral and anionic nanoparticles were found to result in less neurotoxicity than cationic nanoparticles for an in situ perfusion study of rat brains [43]. \n\nAlthough reaching the brain may be a challenge for nanotherapy targeted for brain cancers, nanomedicines can also unnecessarily accumulate in the brain and cause toxic short-term and long-term effects.",

            "text": "A range of different nanoparticle formulations have been investigated to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs to the brain. The majority of these formulations have utilized polymers that have met the strict requirements needed to be accepted for biological applications [104]. During recent years, nanoparticles for the treatment of CNS diseases such as GBM have received significant attention [105,106]. With systemic administration of free drug, a small percentage of the drug crosses the BBB with non-specific accumulation in off target tissues resulting in serious unwanted side effects. Therefore, the use of nanoparticles for delivery to the brain has the potential to increase the percentage of drug that crosses the BBB while reducing non-specific accumulation in other tissues [107,108]. For example, gadolinium-loaded nanoparticles increased the level of gadolinium 100 fold when compared to free gadolinium [109]. The manufacture of nanoparticles has improved in the last few years with optimization of drug loading, encapsulation efficiency and release profile. Furthermore, improvements in the stealth capabilities of nanoparticles have increased their protection from agglutination with proteins in the blood, enabling them to avoid being cleared from the blood by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Nanoparticles whose surface has been modified with ligands have been used to facilitate imaging of brain tumours nanoparticles [110,111]. PEGylation of nanoparticles has been widely used in drug delivery in order to protect nanoparticles from blood protein interaction and from the RES [112,113]. Dawson et al. demonstrated that the PEGylation of nanoparticles completely prevented their interaction with proteins in the plasma. However, other studies have shown that PEGlylation does not completely prevent the interaction between proteins and nanoparticles in the blood [114]. \n\nNanoparticles offer a non-invasive method for drug delivery to the brain. However, they need to be optimized in relation to size, release kinetics, chemical properties, while modifying their surface could improve their ability to cross the BBB as well as protecting the drug from the biological environment and enhancing drug solubility [115].",

            "text": "Abstract: Nanotechnology is an excellent and evolving technology that can be used in the field of healthcare, engineering, environmental science, etc. There is a protective barrier around the brain called the blood brain barrier (BBB) which prevents the entry of larger molecules inside the brain, maintaining brain homeostasis and this poses as a problem because the drugs implemented during any CNS disorder cannot reach the brain. Nanoparticles are solid particles that range from 1-100nm in diameter and are used as a carrier for drug delivery. Nanoparticles are used because of their various characteristics like biocompatibility, prolonged blood circulation, bioavailability and non-toxicity. The functional characteristics and its size are both suitable for acting as a drug delivery carrier for carrying therapeutic agents to the brain. Nanotechnology is expected to reduce the invasive procedures for delivering therapeutic agents to CNS. Nanoparticles are effective as well as safer for acting as a drug delivery carrier targeting the brain. Some devices like implanted catheters are still needed for effective drug delivery to CNS. Nanoparticles deliver drugs at cellular levels through non-fluidic channels. Nanoparticles can avoid phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system thereby increasing the concentration of drugs. Polymeric nanoparticles are used and are widely in development to effectively deliver drugs across BBB. Polymeric nanoparticles have also shown effectiveness in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and brain cancer. Polymeric nanoparticles provide enhanced drug delivery to the brain, with reduced oxidative stress, inflammation and plaque load through the improved delivery of curcumin for treating Alzheimer\u2019s disease and doxorubicin into the human glioma cells, results in the cytotoxic effect on cancer cells damaging the cancer cells. The use of nanoparticles in the field of healthcare has proved to be very effective, especially in the field of drug delivery.",

Nanosystems act as carriers to deliver drugs in certain cells or target tissues, allowing a higher control of molecules with therapeutic activity. Nanocomplexes or nanosystems are biocompatible structures whose size range between 1 and 100 nm. Due to these characteristics, several studies are focused on the improvement of nanostructures in the field of pharmaceutic nanotechnology, with the aim of ameliorate their drug release profiles and their ability to cross challenging barriers like the BBB (Teleanu et al., 2018). \n\nAs previously stated, one of the factors involved in the low permeability of the BBB is the presence of intercellular cell junction complexes (Ce\u00f1a and J ativa, 2018). To enhance the delivery of molecules to the brain, several strategies to cross the BBB can be used (Fig. 2): chemical modifications of administered drug, temporary disruption of protein junctions, and the use and functionalization of nanoparticles (NPs) targeting the brain; administered to the brain by surgery or by the use of different vehicles and devices (Zhou et al., 2018;Li et al., 2021). \n\nUsually, the first approach to cross the BBB is the chemical modification of the drug itself by variating its polarity or by conjugating it with other molecules. This strategy can be combined, as mentioned above, with temporary disruption of protein junctions to enhance the permeability of the BBB and to improve the entrance of selected APIs. Temporary disruption can be achieved by using drugs, osmotic agents, or Fig. 2. Types of nanoparticles (NPs) and strategies to cross the blood-brain barrier.

            "text": "Nanoparticles have been proposed as a drug delivery system targeting glioblastoma due to their potential to specifically deliver encapsulated drugs to the desired targets by improving efficacy and reducing unwanted biodistribution, as compared to free drugs [1,2]. Most drugs lack the physicochemical properties and specificity to successfully enter the brain from systemic circulation, limiting their ability to reach the glioblastoma tumor. Liposomes have been among the most investigated nanoparticle drug delivery system due to their biocompatibility, low toxicity, ability to load both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, and surface modification. Although great progress has been made, current cancertargeted liposomes in clinical practice have limitations in treating glioblastoma (GBM) [3][4][5]. This is highly unfortunate since GBM is one of the most aggressive types of tumors affecting the brain and an increasing problem globally [6,7]. Although temozolomide was the first substance that, combined with radiotherapy, improved overall survival, the median survival still remains just over one year [8,9]. Treatment limitations for GBM arise from the high genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the tumor, drug resistance, and the tumor's location behind the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [7]. \n\nThe BBB is a critical obstacle of entry to the brain [10,11]. This highly selective neuroprotective barrier protects the central nervous system (CNS) from potentially harmful Pharmaceutics 2022, 14, 1125 2 of 13 pathogens. For the brain to maintain homeostasis, transport of all solutes, synaptic activities, and oxygen delivery are maintained by multiple cell types within the neurovascular unit (NVU), limiting efficient drug delivery [12]. Moreover, the blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB) is a damaged or undeveloped NVU that leads to leakage and pooling of macromolecules. This mechanism has long been one of the major incentives for the benefits of using nanoparticles for drug delivery. However, clinical trials have indicated that the limitations of current approaches remain [3,4,13].",

Amongst various approaches that have been explored to facilitate drug delivery to the CNS, the use of cells that have the intrinsic ability to cross the BBB is relatively unexplored, yet very attractive. This paper presents a first proof\u2010of\u2010concept that demonstrates the feasibility of activated effector/memory CD4+ helper T cells (CD4+ TEM cells) as carriers for the delivery of polymer nanoparticles across the BBB. This study shows that CD4+ TEM cells can be decorated with poly(ethylene glycol)\u2010modified polystyrene nanoparticles using thiol\u2013maleimide coupling chemistry, resulting in the immobilization of \u2248105 nanoparticles per cell as determined by confocal microscopy. The ability of these cells to serve as carriers to transport nanoparticles across the BBB is established in vitro and in vivo. Using in vitro BBB models, CD4+ TEM cells are found to be able to transport nanoparticles across the BBB both under static conditions as well as under physiological flow. Finally, upon systemic administration, nanoparticle\u2010modified T cells are shown to enter the brain parenchyma of mice, demonstrating the brain delivery potential of this T cell subset in allogeneic hosts.",

            "text": "To address these limitations, scientists have altered photosensitiser properties through direct chemical modifications (such as introducing cationic charge) and/or have used nanoparticles as photosensitiser delivery systems. Nanoparticles are between 1 and 100 nm in size and available in a range of shapes, including spherical, rod, square, triangle and star [76]; although, in this review, particles with a size < 1000 nm have been included as nanoparticles. There are many options available for the nanoparticle material in aPDT (see Yin et al. [68]), loosely classified into organic and inorganic, each offering their own advantages and limitations. An advantage shared by all nanoparticles is their high surface area to volume ratio, which allows for high drug (photosensitiser) loading. Their size can create distinctive electronic and optical properties and can be fine-tuned to improve uptake across the cell membrane and the blood-brain barrier. By modifying the nanoparticle material and/or surface, improvements can be made to the bioavailability and biocompatibility of a drug, as well as its selectivity. These surface modifications can involve multiple types of ligands, incorporating different properties, such as targeted photosensitiser delivery. \n\nThe approaches used for nanoparticle-based targeting in aPDT can be split into 'passive' or 'active'. Passive targeting relies on prolonged drug circulation in the body and preferential accumulation of the drug to the infection site over other areas of the body (see Fig. 4-I). Active targeting relies on ligand-receptor selective binding to the target bacterial cell (see Fig. 4-II) [77]. \n\nWith regards to passive targeting, nanoparticles with appropriate size, shape, material, and surface modification are well-documented for their ability to breach leaky vasculature associated with disease and inflammation (known as the 'enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect') and for their potential to prolong drug circulation time in the bloodstream [78]. While healthy vasculature forms an effective barrier, inflammation causes the vasculature surrounding the infection site to become more permeable.",

            "text": "Delivery of therapeutic molecules to the central nervous system (CNS) is severely limited by the blood-brain and blood-spinal cord barriers (BBB and BSCB). These barriers are comprised of tight junctions and efflux pumps that restrict parenchymal penetration of all but a fraction of small, lipophilic molecules. The intranasal route has been proposed to be an alternative to parenteral delivery that could bypass the BBB to enable more direct delivery of molecules to the brain. Many different molecules have been successfully delivered to the CNS through the intranasal route, including proteins, polynucleotides, and small molecule drugs [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Intranasal administration has been shown to have several key advantages over systemic administration, including avoidance of first-pass metabolism and ease of administration [8]. This can enable better drug delivery to the brain, since substances have the potential for more direct access to the CNS than if they had been administered by routes that encounter first-pass metabolism. Several direct nose-to-brain transport routes that bypass the BBB have been proposed [9]. Unsurprisingly, a variety of intranasal therapeutics have been clinically tested or approved for use in humans [10]. \n\nAlthough intranasal drug delivery has been a useful approach for CNS drug delivery, freely administered agents can still encounter pharmacokinetic limitations. Freely administered molecules can sometimes be poorly bioavailable or are cleared rapidly with draining mucous [10]. One solution to this issue is the employment of nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Polymeric nanoparticles are a popular material choice for drug delivery and have been shown to enhance CNS delivery of a drug relative to freely solubilized drug provided by the intranasal route [11,12]. To further enhance brain-specific delivery and reduce off target exposure, several groups have surface-modified nanoparticles with targeting ligands, utilizing receptor mediated transporters to increase CNS-specific delivery of nanoparticles or their encapsulated payloads [13].",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) comprises a specialized network of endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes, acting as a defense mechanism to prevent the extravasation of materials. Tight junctions between adjacent brain endothelial cells limit paracellular transport, restricting the passive entry of molecules to a narrow range of size and lipophilicity. These formidable physical and functional barriers impede the exposure of drugs to intracranial tissues. Tight junctions commonly exclude hydrophilic small molecules from entering the brain, and although many lipophilic drugs can passively diffuse, their penetration into diseased brain tissue is often inefficient. This inefficiency typically necessitates high drug doses, leading to dose-limiting systemic toxicity [105,106]. In light of the numerous challenges associated with the passage of small molecules through the blood-brain barrier, nanoparticles have been investigated as a potential means to enhance drug delivery to brain tissues [107]. Much of the current research has concentrated on improving the passive transport mechanisms of drug-loaded nanoparticles across the BBB. For example, in diseases where the BBB is compromised, such as glioblastoma, nanostructures have been observed to extravasate through leaky vasculature, accumulating at tumor sites. \n\nSimilarly, strategies have been developed to enhance drug delivery across an intact BBB by initially disrupting this barrier [108][109][110][111]. However, such approaches, while allowing unregulated passage across the BBB, may compromise the BBB's homeostatic functions and expose the brain to harmful toxins and pathogens [112]. In contrast, alternative approaches for diseases like SHH subgroup medulloblastoma, where the BBB remains intact, involve the use of nontargeting nanocarriers to prolong the systemic circulation of small-molecule drugs, and over a relatively long time, an appreciable number of drugs would cross the BBB. Nevertheless, this has only partially improved on-target toxicity profiles at high doses [112].",

These nanocarriers can have an organic or inorganic core and a surface coating with organic moieties able to interact with the biological system at a molecular level for crossing the BBB. 31 Modification of nanocarrier surface by adsorption or covalent linking of hydrophilic polymers, such as PEG, polysorbate 80, or polysaccharides, leads to an increase in nanocarrier circulation in the blood, whereas the surface derivatization with molecules that recognize cellular receptors facilitates the penetration of nanoparticles through the BBB. 32 he strategy often termed active targeting involves two types of transports: adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (AMT) and receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT). The AMT has gained considerable attention because several studies assess that this strategy has the possibility to enhance the transport of nanocarriers across the BBB, using cationic proteins or cell-penetrating peptides. 33 However, as AMT is a nonspecific process, conjugation of such cationic proteins will also increase the adsorptive uptake process of nanocarriers in other parts of the body, which may possibly create toxic and immunogenic concerns.",

[215], surface functionalization of PLGA nanoparticles with Polysorbate 80 facilitated crossing the bloodbrain barrier.Their study reported a higher brain concentration of the neuroprotective agent Bacoside-A reaching 23.94 \u00b1 1.74 \u00b5g/g tissue, which was over ten times the pure drug-solution concentration in the brain.In a separate study by Rodriguez et al. [22], surface functionalization of liposomes with transferrin and a cell-penetrating peptide was sufficient to improve the brain permeability of liposomes in mice after a single i.v.administration.They observed the sufficient transport of dual functionalized liposomes in an in vitro BBB model and mice.In both of these studies, improvement in drug accumulation in the brain was attributed to surface functionalization.Surface functionalization can also improve the pharmacokinetic profile of the nanocarrier [216,217].The numerous successful demonstrations of surface modification prove its suitability in enhancing brain delivery of therapeutics.Given that specific regions within the brain either promote or inhibit NH, it is also crucial that nanotherapeutics be functionalized with just the proper ligand to ensure it is directed towards the right structures.",

            "text": "By functionalizing nanoparticles with ligands such as lactoferrin, they are able to utilize receptor-mediated endocytosis. This is a process in which nanoparticles connect to certain receptors on cell surfaces, including the blood-brain barrier (BBB), to facilitate their transportation across biological barriers. The presence of functional groups on the surface of mesoporous silica can augment the solubility and stability of hydrophobic medicines such as resveratrol, hence enhancing their bioavailability and capacity to penetrate target tissues. Functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles have a small particle size of approximately 140 nm and have an optimal surface charge. These characteristics enable them to efficiently cross cellular membranes and biological barriers, hence improving the drug's ability to reach its intended target. Surface changes can be engineered to specifically target particular tissues or cells, hence enhancing the precision and effectiveness of medication delivery. Functional groups that specifically target inflammatory areas can assure the precise accumulation of antioxidant medicines at these locations, therefore boosting their therapeutic effectiveness. \n\nFunctionalized mesoporous silica possesses the ability to enhance the delivery of antioxidant medicines, resulting in enhanced therapeutic effects. Functionalized mesoporous silica enhances the penetration of drugs, allowing higher concentrations of antioxidants to reach target tissues. This enables the antioxidants to exert their effects more efficiently, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, and promoting cellular protection and recovery. \n\nTo summarize, functionalized mesoporous silica presents a viable method for improving the penetration and therapeutic effectiveness of antioxidant medications. The customized alterations to the surface and incorporation of certain functional groups enhance the interaction with biological barriers and target cells, hence optimizing the delivery of medications to their targeted locations of action. Future studies should continue to investigate innovative methods of modifying the properties of antioxidant medications and examine how these modifications affect their ability to penetrate tissues and their effectiveness in treating medical conditions. This will help to improve the practical use of these treatments in clinical settings.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) acts as both a physical and a biochemical barrier to drug delivery into the normal brain; thus, extensive efforts have been aimed at developing methods to modulate or bypass the BBB for the delivery of therapeutics [1]. Unfortunately, these efforts have not led to major changes in the landscape of brain disease therapy. Previous studies have revealed that the function and organization of the BBB is altered under pathological conditions, including stroke and brain cancer [2,3], thus suggesting a potential for drug delivery into the brain. Some studies have found that malignant glioma (MG) induces small disruptions in the integrity of the BBB; however, many parent drugs remain unavailable or are inefficient in crossing the BBB, thus making drug therapy for MG very difficult [4][5][6]. Temozolomide (TMZ), the first-line drug for the treatment of MG, is hindered by the BBB, which significantly weakens its anti-cancer properties and promotes systemic toxicity. Therefore, facilitating the passage of TMZ across the dysfunctional BBB and decreasing systemic toxic effects are goals for treating MG. \n\nRecently, nanoparticles have been demonstrated to have excellent ability to penetrate the dysfunctional BBB and thus might serve as an ideal carrier for delivering drugs into the central nervous system. The BBB is slightly compromised in MG, thereby allowing the passage of nanocarriers smaller than 20 nm [7][8][9]. \n\nLipid-based drug delivery vehicles, including liposomes and micelles, have been intensively studied and widely used for multiple biomedical applications, such as cancer therapy [10][11][12]. As drug carriers, nanoparticles have unique benefits, including protecting drugs against degradation in the circulation and decreasing systemic toxic effects. Moreover, owing to their small diameters, nanoparticles can penetrate through the fissures in intratumor vessels into tumors and remain there 63 because of the obstruction of tumor lymphatic drainage-a phenomenon known as the enhanced permeability and retention effect [13,14].",

            "text": "by macrophages [134]. Several modifications have been made to achieve long circulation times by avoiding RES uptake as discussed for stealth liposomes. SLNs surface can be modified by hydrophilic polymers or copolymers to make the particles stealth toward RES. PEG stearate modified SLNs showed reduced uptake by mouse macrophages after intraperitoneal injection, and the reduction was proportional to the PEG chain length [135].\n\nSLNs are suitable nanocarriers for brain delivery. The brain takes up SLNs probably because of the surface adsorption of blood proteins such as apolipoproteins, which can favor the adherence to endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This effect was studied for the trypanocidal drug diminazene formulated as a lipid-drug conjugate; the drug is hydrophilic and cannot cross the BBB, but the lipid-drug conjugate can cross the barrier thus reducing central nervous system infection of Trypanosoma brucei infected mice [124].\n\nA nanoparticulate system, consisting of lipid nanoparticles coated with chitosan (CS), was developed for the oral administration of peptide drugs [136]. In particular, they investigated the nanoparticle ability to incorporate and deliver the model peptide salmon calcitonin (sCT). The results showed that a CS coating could be formed around the lipid nanoparticles by simple incubation in CS solution. In addition, sCT could be efficiently associated to the nanoparticles. Following an initial burst, the systems provided a continuous and slow release of the associated peptide.\n\nConstantinides et al. [137] developed self-emulsifying water-in-oil microemulsions incorporating medium-chain glycerides. Formulation of calcein (a water-soluble marker molecule), or SK&F 106760 (a water-soluble RGD peptide) resulted in significant bioavailability enhancement in rats relative to their aqueous formulations.",

            "text": "Over the last few decades, studies on nanoparticles are more focused on the development of drug delivery vehicles. These carriers have been investigated in nano-medicine; they not only help in the formulation of drugs but also provide the sustained release of drugs at the targeted sites. For the enhanced delivery of drugs, these nanoparticles are combined with diagnostic probes and designed to target sites which are hard to reach (Xu et al., 2013). Nanoparticles are important in biomedical applications because of their small sizes as the blood-brain barrier prevents crossing of drugs with large sizes such as proteins, chemicals, and peptides. To pass drugs from the blood-brain barrier, nanoparticles and CQDs can be used to deliver drugs in targeted sites, but it is essential to keep the sizes of these nanoparticles less than the size of the capillaries for use in the living body. These nano-sized particles stop the blockage of blood vessels and eliminate them from the body by the reticuloendothelial system. In brain tumors, the delivery of imaging probes to the tumor is difficult because of the blood-brain barrier. It is dependent upon the size of this imaging probe and its topography. According to Li et al., CQDs have been observed in different organs of mice after 6 h of their injection and showed bright fluorescence. Some of them are also observed in the brain, which indicates that CQDs can enter the brain and have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (Li N. et al., 2012). For the in vivo fluorescence imaging, polymer-coated nitrogen-doped CQDs can also be used, and these CQDs have the ability to enter the glioma cells. Because of the presence of hydrophilic polymer coating on the nitrogendoped CQD surface, they have enhanced ability to circulate in the bloodstream and target the site of interest of the cancerous area. This suggests that polymer-coated N-doped CQDs can enhance the blood-brain barrier crossing and then increase their accumulation for glioma imaging .",

            "text": "Using nanoparticles to deliver drugs for specific applications, the promise of tailored, site-specific drug delivery is the most promising. Nanoparticles are the building blocks of bio-nanomaterials, and significant efforts in the design of drug delivery systems are predicated on functionalized nanoparticles. The potential of using nanomaterial-based drug delivery to eradicate a tumorous outgrowth without causing any collateral damage has generated significant interest. They were originally developed as vaccination and anticancer medication carriers. However, by altering the bio-distribution and toxicodynamic of pharmaceuticals, the nanoscale size ranges may greatly improve drug delivery. This can simplify the comparatively simple task of delivering many types of medications that present significant delivery challenges in vivo. One outstanding application of this technology is the modification or functionalization of nanoparticles to target brain tumours with medication delivery through the blood-brain barrier. Doxorubicin, for instance, is not able to pass through the blood-brain barrier, but when combined with polysorbate 80-modified polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles, it can significantly improve brain delivery. Because of their size, structure, and functionality, systems of nanoparticles are essential to the development of DNA delivery vectors. They are effectively absorbed by the cells and have the ability to penetrate deeply into tissues. \n\nOne could consider nanoscale colloidal drug carriers to be an advanced advancement in pharmacotherapy. They may serve as possible carriers for a variety of medication classes, including hormone, anti-cancer, and anti-hypertensive. Submicron colloidal particles have been employed as drug delivery nanoparticles and in medical diagnostic applications. The application of pharmacokinetics for insoluble medicines has been expanded by nanoparticles. For instance, aggregates were generated during the spray drying of the trans-retinoic acid nanoparticle coated with CaCO3, which was created as a novel drug delivery method. It was discovered that the aggregates that had formed would re-disperse in water, which would encourage the islets to secrete insulin. In general, polymeric or inorganic components can make up a nanoparticle.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a dynamic interface between the blood and the brain which plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. The main components of the BBB are the endothelial cells (i.e., astrocytes and pericytes), which form a continuous sheet covering the inner surface of the brain's microvessels. They are interconnected by tight junctions, which are critical to both the control of BBB vascular permeability [1] and to the protection of the brain from various circulating toxins and other harmful molecules [2,3]. Neurons and microglia, which are other neurovascular unit components, play a different role in the BBB [4,5]. \n\nDue to the endothelial cell continuous sheet, 98% of small-molecule drugs and 100% of large-molecule drugs do not pass through the BBB, thus failing to deliver the drugs to the brain tissue [6]. Therefore, in order to develop efficient delivery systems for the treatment of many brain diseases, it is crucial to investigate the carriers' ability of getting through the BBB [7]. \n\nIn the last decade, nanoparticle-based systems have been widely studied as effective therapeutic agents for cancer targeting and therapy. In this context, organic functionalized magnetic iron nanoparticles (MNPs) have drawn a lot of interest since they combine the versatility of the surface functionalization with the magnetic properties and the non-toxic biocompatible nature of their core. MNPs are widely adopted for theranostic applications (diagnostic and therapeutic) such as protein and cell sorting and manipulation [8,9], cell labeling [10,11], magnetically controlled drug delivery [12,13], magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [14,15], and hyperthermia [16][17][18][19]. To be efficiently used for biomedical applications, MNPs should be capable of crossing cell membranes and, in particular, of passing through the various biological barriers. The modification of the MNPs surface with functional molecules has often been used to improve their cell internalization, but in many cases, the crossing of the BBB remains a problem.",

            "text": "Nanotechnology, in current times, has gained a notable interest and is considered a well-known scaffold for the delivery of therapeutics (Usman et al., 2020). It offers multiple advantages such as ease of preparation with designed functionalities, surface modifications to achieve desired targeting, efficacy improvement through altering the pharmacokinetic profile of therapeutics and its ability to penetrate via leaky vasculature of the tumors (Sonali et al., 2018). As discussed earlier, blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the main hurdle in the way therapeutics enter the brain that ultimately leads to therapy failure (Tu et al., 2021). Luckily, nanocarriers especially gold-based and polymers-based nano-materials (GBNs) have solved that issue which loading therapeutic substances and delivering them to specific brain tissues with enhanced stability, solubility, and reduced side effects (Beik et al., 2019). \n\nIn the context of nano-based brain cancer delivery, Ruan et. al., explored doxorubicin-loaded gold nanoparticles using an acid-responsive hydrazine linker. Further, the BBB penetration was mediated through fictionalization with angiopep-2. Both in-vivo and in-vitro results suggested higher delivery efficiency for gold-based nanoparticles as compared to the free drug (Ruan et al., 2015). For glioma treatment, the prepared gold nanoparticles were grafted on gelatin nanoparticles that mimicked the BBB penetration efficacy during therapy (Ruan et al., 2015). Three chemotherapy drugs decitabine, gemcitabine, and temozolomide were loaded on gold nanoparticles via electrostatic interactions and targeted to U87 human malignant Glial cells following the mechanism of cell-mediated transport. This delivery system integrated the synergistic effect of three drugs and showed a significant therapeutic effect on glioma with a reduction in resistance of glioma cells to temozolomide (Sahli et al., 2020). In addition to drugs, genes delivery was also supported through the aid of gold nanoparticles.",

Chai et al. developed DOX-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (average size around 95 nm) coated with erythrocyte membranes surface-modified with CDX peptides for brain targeting. The complex biological functions of erythrocytes were retained in membranes (Chai et al., 2017). This biomimetic delivery system successfully crossed the BBB exhibited improved therapeutic efficacy in glioma treatment and significantly reduced systemic toxicity. Further, based on the advantages of erythrocyte-membrane coating of nanoparticles, this research group developed docetaxel nanocrystals (average size around 70 nm) coated with erythrocyte-membrane surface-modified with c(RGDyK) tumor-targeting ligand. The erythrocyte-membrane coating improved the stability of drug nanocrystal particles (Chai et al., 2019). This delivery strategy is highly biocompatible with decreased side effects. Increased drug accumulation at the glioma site and enhanced treatment efficacy was observed after intravenous administration of the engineered cell membrane coated drug nanocrystal system. \n\nErythrocyte membrane coating can also improve the stability of the nucleic acid drug. In a recent study, Gao et al. designed a miR155-bearing nanogel (average size around 109 nm) with erythrocyte membrane-coating and functional M2pep peptides and HA2 peptides modification to mimic a virus structure. The membrane-coated nanoparticle was stable with prolonged circulation time.",

            "text": "This controlled release mechanism mitigates the risk of adverse reactions due to caffeine overdose and obviates the need for frequent dosing. \n\nMoreover, caffeine liposomes offer improved drug distribution and enhanced selectivity for target tissues. When caffeine is administered orally, the blood-brain barrier plays a crucial role in preventing metabolic waste and toxic substances from entering the central nervous system through blood circulation. Therefore, crossing the blood-brain barrier is a challenge. Previous studies have demonstrated that by binding therapeutic drugs to specific proteins, such as transferrin (Tf), they can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier. The transferrin receptor (TfR) is highly expressed on the blood-brain barrier and has the ability to recognize transferrin carrying iron, thereby facilitating intracerebral transport of iron [18]. This property can be exploited to transport drugs into the brain, and the use of transferrin or TfR as a target for drug delivery to the brain has been validated in animal models. Transferrin's targeting capability allows it to circulate without entering ordinary non-targeted cells, exhibiting high precision in drug delivery. \n\nVarious Nano preparations, such as liposomes and nanoparticles, have been explored to overcome the challenges of crossing the blood-brain barrier. Liposomes and nanoparticles can encapsulate both lipid-soluble and water-soluble drugs, enabling them to reach the surface of cerebral vessels and successfully cross the blood-brain barrier. Depending on factors such as size, surface charge, and attached ligands, liposomes can preferentially accumulate in specific tissues or organs, enabling targeted drug delivery. This approach enhances the efficacy of caffeine while reducing its toxicity. Through a brain-targeted delivery system, specifically transferrinmodified liposomes encapsulating caffeine, it is possible to achieve better effects in enhancing the physical performance of rats.",

            "text": "Unlike tumors of other tissue origins, central nervous system (CNS) tumors have unique resident cell types and vasculature. In addition to universal TME components, specialized cell types such as neurons, microglia, and astrocytes are included in the TME of brain tumors to ensure the normal functional status of all regions of the brain [236]. Moreover, there is a special physiological blood-brain interface between systemic blood circulation and the CNS, which is used to separate other organs from the brain and maintain stability and functional properties within the brain. Depending on their positional distribution and structural composition, these physiological interfaces can be classified into the following categories: the BBB, blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, arachnoid barrier, brain-retinal barrier, and spinal cord barrier [237]. The BBB is considered the most important barrier for exogenous substances to penetrate the brain [224]. It is a physical and functional barrier comprising a high density of microvascular endothelial cells [238]. The BBB, as a physiologic anatomical barrier, limits the passage of substances from the circulatory system into the brain parenchymal tissue and protects the brain from toxins, infection, inflammation, and injury. Studies show that more than 98 % of small-molecule drugs and almost all large-molecule drugs cannot cross the BBB [239]. The BBB, as an active tissue, also expresses a variety of proteins such as receptors and enzymes, and participates in various biological processes, such as the clearance of toxic substances and exchange of substances between the blood and brain [236,237]. Hence, the utilization of an effective brain-targeted carrier system is imperative for facilitating substance delivery. \n\nIn order to overcome the barriers mentioned above and enhance the effectiveness of CNS tumor treatment, the RBCNPs can be modified in the following ways: incorporating therapeutic agents and implementing targeted modifications. The sensitivity of NPs to specific stimulus responses (including pH, ROS, enzymes, light, and heat) can also be exploited to achieve high targeting and penetration as well as maximum accumulation of NPs and loaded cargo in the delivery process [239].",

            "text": "Crossing the BBB remains one of the most challenging tasks for drug delivery to the brain. Different physiological pathways can be employed for crossing the BBB including receptor-mediated transcytosis or adsorptive-mediated transcytosis. To reach this goal, a multitude of nanocarrier systems, such as polymeric, lipid-based or inorganic nanoparticles, have been developed and shown able to cross the BBB owing to their tailored surface properties. In numerous studies, the physical coating of nanoparticles with surfactants and the chemical functionalization with specific ligands have been proven to be successful strategies to enhance the BBB crossing through RMT or AMT. Size and charge of the nanoparticles are also aspects that can influence their penetration into the brain. Smaller nanoparticles are able to cross the BBB more easily and to diffuse better through the brain. However, bigger nanoparticles, if correctly functionalized, are also able to cross the BBB, although to a slightly lower extent. Thus, key to increase the amount of drug delivered to the brain is finding the optimal particle size. Larger particles can be loaded with larger amounts of drugs but will reach the brain in lower concentrations, smaller nanoparticles cannot contain large amounts of API but will reach the brain in higher concentrations. By rationally designing nanoparticle systems, the crossing of the BBB in preclinical studies has been successfully demonstrated repeatedly. However, very few clinical data are available on the efficacy of these strategies in the human body. More efforts should now be taken to accelerate the translation of these results into clinical stages, for instance, by focusing on the behavior of the nanoparticles in human blood and investigating the protein corona forming around them, by investigating the particle-cell interactions or by looking for biomimetic solutions. \n\nFigure 2",

            "text": "Nanoparticles (NP) can be synthesized from different materials and have generated increasing interest in nanomedicine, mostly as drug delivery systems [1,2]. NP capable of delivering drugs exhibit advantages such as drug stability, increased bioavailability and reduced drug concentrations required to reach the target, thus decreasing side effects [3]. Some NP, including gold NP, have the ability to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and reach the central nervous system (CNS), providing promising drug delivery systems (especially for the treatment of CNS diseases [3][4][5][6][7][8]). NP surface modification by adding specific targeting ligands can enhance their BBB penetration and contribute for cellular uptake. NP size, shape, surface, charge and modification with cellpenetration peptides matter for cellular uptake and fate. Commonly, smaller NPs are better internalized with higher percentage of biodistribution [9][10][11] and display more ability for BBB penetration and distribution in the CNS [12,13]. Positively charged NPs are more easily internalized than neutral and negatively NPs [14]. In this sense, NP may serve as an important alternative for invasive CNS procedures such as implantation of catheters, imaging and therapy of brain tumors, and improvement of drug delivery [3,[15][16][17]. \n\nHowever, toxic effects of nanomaterials have been described [1], including induction of oxidative stress, inflammation [18], DNA damage, and alterations in gene expression [19]. We found earlier, for example, that cobalt nanoparticles were able to induce cell transformation, a hallmark of cancer, in contrast to cobalt ions [20]. NP can also promote neurotoxic effects such as neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration [21]. Despite gold NP (Au-NP) being one of the mostly commonly used nanomaterials (due to their versatility in particle size and surface modification) and their biocompatibility for applications such as drug and gene delivery [22], they can induce toxicity in different cellular models [23].",

            "text": "Nanotechnology in drug delivery is categorized into two approaches: direct nanonization of the active pharmaceutical ingredient or the drug itself, and encapsulation of the drug within nanocarriers. Utilizing the ultra-small scale of nanoparticles allows drugs to overcome physiological barriers like the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and nasal transport barriers, offering novel administration routes. Nanocarriers, with their large surface area and ease of surface modification, can be attached with numerous functional groups, facilitating enhanced cellular entry and therapeutic efficacy, thus improving drug delivery efficiency. 91,92 or instance, nasal drug delivery systems utilizing materials such as liposomes and nanoemulsions, enhanced for mucosal penetration, can improve drug adherence and permeation through the nasal epithelial barrier, significantly enhancing mucosal diffusion and absorption, 93 thereby making nasal delivery more efficient as demonstrated in Figure 3A. This innovation provides new pathways and therapeutic methods in clinical medicine.Direct nanonization of drugs typically involves passive diffusion and unsaturated transport primarily through the pores of capillary endothelial cells. In contrast, the application of nanocarriers primarily utilizes receptor-mediated transport and adsorption-mediated transport under electric charge, constituting saturated transport methods to breach the BBB. 94 For example, Sun et al 95 developed butyl cyanoacrylate nanoparticles coated with Polysorbate-80, leveraging the surfactant's adsorption of apolipoproteins for tight binding with apolipoprotein receptors on the BBB. Similarly, Lu et al 96 found that cationized bovine serum albumin nanoparticles exhibited an eightfold increase in BBB permeability compared to their non-cationized counterparts, as depicted in Figure 3B.",

            "text": "Due to BBB, central nervous system disorders are one of the major challenges to treat pharmacologically. Therefore, there is a need to develop novel drug delivery strategies. Hence, surface-modification of nanoparticles are gaining attention and emerging to be a useful approach to overcome the drawbacks faced by conventional nanoparticles not only for neurodegenerative disorders but also for another life-threatening disease. Through surface modification, delivery of poor water-soluble molecules and macromolecular have been made possible without affecting the integrity of loaded drug molecules. Surface modification leads to the generation of desirable characteristics to the nanoparticles, which ease the delivery process, such as crossing BBB in case of brain drug delivery, resulting in more biocompatibility, enhanced drug release and targeted delivery. Various surface modifica-tion methods result in mucoadhesive NPs, mucus penetrating NPs, protein conjugated, and antibody-conjugated nanoparticles. Other approaches have been applied for targeted delivery, such as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), transferrin, lactoferrin and integrin-targeting ligands. CPPs being small and positively charged, are quite favorable for transportation across BBB. Whereas, transferrin and lactoferrin possess unique physiological and biological characteristics, which implies that these can be used in conjugation with the developed nanoparticles for more effective and targeted delivery, especially in the brain region of the affected individual where transferrin and lactoferrin receptors are expressed abundantly. Hence, targeted drug delivery systems could be considered the most promising strategy to deliver across BBB and the brain. \n\nDespite the huge potential of nanocarriers and surfacemodified nanoformulations on drug delivery and treatment of diseases, there are several challenges like in vivo stability, biocompatibility, scale-up of formulations etc. which restrict the clinical translation and commercialization of these nanocarriers and this aspect needs to be addressed and resolved. Some of the basic concerns that need to be addressed are given to signify the superiority of the developed nanomedicines and facilitate the data necessary for further development of a therapeutic product:",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a semipermeable membrane that exhibits high selectivity in allowing materials to pass from the blood to the brain parenchyma. The endothelial cells (ECs) in the brain capillaries form tight junctions that hold the adjacent ECs tightly, thereby greatly reducing paracellular permeability 1 . ECs also express efflux transporters that actively pump certain molecules back into the bloodstream 2 and exhibit minimal pinocytic activity 3 . In addition, the presence of basement membranes, pericytes that wrap around the ECs, and astrocytic end-feet provide further structural support and reinforce the barrier function of the BBB 3 . Approximately 98% of small molecule drugs and nearly 100% of large therapeutic agents fail to cross the BBB 4 . Consequently, the BBB presents a significant obstacle in the delivery of drugs to the central nervous system (CNS) to treat various neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, gliomas and brain metastases. \n\nTo improve drug delivery to the brain, there are conventionally two broad strategies: modifying the drug itself to enhance its ability to cross the BBB or modifying the BBB to temporarily increase its permeability to standard drugs. Modification of drugs in some cases might reduce their biological activity, while invasive alteration of the BBB might cause adverse effects 5,6 . \n\nIn recent years, ultrasound (US) along with microbubbles has shown promise as a novel technology for delivering a drug or a gene locally to a specific region of the brain 7,8 . The microbubbles, which can also carry drugs, are gas-filled microspheres with a lipid shell, which cavitate (expand and contract) under the influence of US. US-targeted microbubble cavitation (UTMC) transiently increases endothelial barrier permeability 9,10 . There are significant benefits to using UTMC to open the BBB: this is a noninvasive technique, the BBB can be opened, and drugs can be delivered to a precise location in the brain by navigation of the US beam.",

            "text": "Nanocarriers demonstrate potential as a drug delivery system for treating brain dysfunction. They possess the ability to resist drug degradation, enhance drug metabolism kinetics, and improve neurovascular pathways. Nevertheless, the blood-brain barrier poses a significant challenge in the therapeutic process by restricting drug transportation into the brain. To overcome this obstacle, nanoparticles are modified to enhance the likelihood and concentration of drug delivery to the ischemic site by crossing the blood-brain barrier. 80 The primary methods for nano-delivery systems to traverse the blood-brain barrier include passive diffusion, adsorption-mediated endocytosis, receptor-mediated transport, and carrier-mediated transport. 81 rombolysis therapy. Encapsulated thrombolytic agents have been developed to deliver the enzyme tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to the target area at a controllable rate. This helps temporarily inhibit tPA activity in the circulation, extending its half-life and improving its contact with the clot. 3][84] Researchers have also developed silicon-coated magnetic nanoparticles (SiO 2 -MNP) as biocompatible carriers for targeted delivery of tPA. 25 In addition, SPIONs stabilized by a dextran shell have been created as a magnetite drug carrier for targeted thrombolysis under an applied magnetic field. 26 Cyclic RGD (cRGD) functionalized liposomes have been employed to encapsulate thrombolytic drugs 27 (Figure 3D). In 2018, Vankayala et al. identified a nanostructured system that consists of vesicles from erythrocytes encapsulated with near-infrared fluorophores (ICGs) and a tPA affixed to the vesicle surface. This system effectively prolongs the half-life of tPA and reduces the risk of bleeding. 85 Xu et al. developed platelet membrane-camouflaged polymeric nanoparticles (nanoplatelets) that deliver tPA to localized thrombus sites. In an animal model of thrombosis, these tailored nanoplatelets aggregated efficiently at the thrombus and demonstrated significantly enhanced thrombolytic activity compared to free rt-PA (Figures 3A and 3B). 28,30",

            "text": "The therapeutic principle for ischemic stroke is to restore blood perfusion in the ischemic penumbra as soon as possible and to effectively inhibit the oxidative stress induced by ROS burst after reperfusion.The aforementioned points are the main pathological mechanisms leading to secondary injury in the ischemic regions of the brain.Thus, the main objective in treating ischemic stroke is to develop antioxidants that can eliminate ROS generated during reperfusion and reduce neuronal injury.The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a distinctive structure within the neurovascular unit, encompassing endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, microglia, and neurons.It serves a critical role in shielding neurons from neurotoxic substances.However, this protective barrier also significantly hampers the delivery of therapeutic drugs to areas of the brain affected by ischemia, presenting a major obstacle in the treatment of ischemic stroke [10].Considering the critical nature of brain function, the development of neuroprotective agents must meet criteria for efficiency, safety, brain accessibility, and sustained antioxidative properties.\n\nThe rapid advancement of nanotechnology has brought new opportunities for the development of innovative drugs that meet the performance requirements of neuroprotective agents (Fig. 3).First, novel mimetic enzymes prepared based on the catalytic activity of nanoparticles and simulated antioxidase activities are expected to solve issues such as the decline in endogenous antioxidase activities; Second, linking functional organic molecules with nanomedicinal formulations can substantially boost the administration efficiency and antioxidative power of natural antioxidants; Third, adjusting the size, morphology, surface charge, and targeted modifications of nanoparticles can improve cellular uptake of nanomedicines and increase their efficacy in penetrating the BBB.Thus, the amalgamation of nanomedicine's ability to penetrate the BBB and efficiently clear ROS holds promise for overcoming the development bottleneck of neuroprotective drugs for ischemic stroke.",

The clinical approval success rate of drugs for brain diseases is one of the lowest compared to other fields (Miller, 2010;Gribkoff & Kaczmarek, 2017). The major difficulties restricting the clinical translation of drugs for brain diseases include the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Stanimirovic et al., 2015;Xie et al., 2019); pharmacokinetic profile alteration (de Lange et al., 2017;Yamamoto et al., 2018); toxicity of drugs (Vuillemenot et al., 2016). The development of drug delivery systems holds great potential to endow BBB penetration ability, change the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of drugs to improve the efficacy while reducing side effects (Reddy et al., 2021). \n\nIn recent years, emerging efforts have been dedicated to developing biomimetic drug \u00c0 delivery systems by using complex natural biological components or mimicking the structure (Parodi et al., 2013;Hu et al., 2015;Fang et al., 2018). For delivery of drugs for brain diseases therapy, biomimetic drug delivery systems may help increase biocompatibility, long \u00c0 term circulation and more importantly, penetrate the BBB to increase drug concentration at the target site (Chen et al., 2020). The most commonly developed cell-based vehicles for biomimetic drug delivery include living cells (Wang et al., 2015), cell membranes (Luk & Zhang, 2015), and nanovesicles (Usman et al., 2018), depending on the target of disease and cargo for delivery. Cell and cell membrane are similar vehicles for drug delivery by direct loading of drugs or coating drug nanoparticles. Cell and cell membrane coating are both effective for biointerfacing (Kroll et al., 2017).

            "text": "Nowadays, several research groups are actively trying to combine a variety of functions into NPs as platforms for targeting different immune and tumoral cells and to develop diverse strategies to modulate specific treatments. A major effort toward successful NP-based therapeutics will be needed to avoid extensive and nonspecific immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive reactions to the nanomaterials, once they have been administered into the body, in order to find a right balance between any remaining potential damage and the health and quality of life of patients. This implies the future development of new or adapted methods appropriate to assess new medicinal tools involving NPs. Although many questions still require extensive investigation, the available data suggest that a variety of NPs can be engineered to become part of the next generation of immunomodulatory platforms and treatments [80]. \n\nNanoparticles exploit biological pathways to achieve payload delivery to cellular and intracellular targets, including transport across the BBB. The central nervous system is protected by this barrier which maintains its homeostasis. However, many potential drugs for the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) cannot reach the brain in high concentrations. This physical barrier limits the brain uptake of the vast majority of neurotherapeutics and neuroimaging contrast agents [7,17]. One possibility to deliver drugs to the CNS is the employment of polymeric nanoparticles. Modification of the nanoparticle surface with covalently attached targeting ligands or by coating with certain surfactants had enabled the adsorption of specific plasma proteins. The ability of these carriers to overcome BBB appears to be receptormediated endocytosis in brain capillary endothelial cells. The possibility to employ nanoparticles for delivery of proteins and other macromolecules across the BBB suggests that this technology holds great promises for noninvasive therapy of the CNS diseases. Recently, some studies have shown the distribution, pharmacokinetics, and drugs delivery into the brain in rodents and found that nanoparticles greater than approximately 100-150 nm in diameter will tend to accumulate in tumors due to their higher extravasation in comparison with normal vasculature [16,162].",

            "text": "Cancer remains a major health problem worldwide. The use of polymeric nanoparticles as drug delivery vehicles for anticancer therapeutics has great potential to revolutionize the future of cancer therapy. However, nanoparticles can be rapidly eliminated/excreted by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system located primarily in the liver and spleen, resulting in a short half-life in the circulation after intravenous administration. 1 Various attempts have been made to achieve a longer circulation time to avoid or reduce the absorption of nanoparticles onto phagocytes. 2 Previous studies have shown that nanoparticles coated with a neutral hydrophilic outer layer can generate stealth particles and decrease phagocytic uptake, and thus significantly increase the blood circulation time with a high level of drug concentration in nonreticuloendothelial organs, such as the intestines and kidney. 3,4 A number of surfactants, such as poloxamines, 4 poloxamers, D-\u03b1-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), 5 polyethylene glycol, 6 and Tween 80 4,7 have been used as coating materials. Importantly, some coating surfactants may help nanoparticles cross the gastrointestinal and blood-brain barriers. 8,9 Systemically administered chemotherapy is often ineffective in the treatment of central nervous system diseases. One reason for this low efficacy is insufficient drug delivery to the brain due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier, which restricts exchange of solutes between the blood and extracellular brain fluid. Tween 80-coated nanoparticles have been reported to have the ability to transport loaded drugs across the blood-brain barrier after intravenous injection. [8][9][10] It has been reported that polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles are able to deliver hexapeptide dalargin, doxorubicin, and other agents which are significantly obstructed by the blood-brain barrier. 11 This may be because the nanoparticles can adsorb apoliproprotein E, which mimics low-density lipoprotein, onto the nanoparticle surface",

            "text": "Cell membrane-modified nanodrugs exhibit dual properties of nano-formulation and biofilm characteristics. Encapsulated within the cell membrane carrier, these drugs can traverse the BBB more effectively, thereby enhancing their brain-targeting efficacy [65]. Macrophages, integral to innate immunity and widely distributed in body tissues, play a pivotal role in the monocyte macrophage system, predominantly governed by microglia in the brain. Monocyte-macrophages possess the capability to alter their morphology and breach the BBB through blood cell exudation, leveraging their inherent ability to cross this barrier. Consequently, drugs engineered with macrophage membrane modifications hold promise for improved efficacy in encephalopathy treatment [66]. Furthermore, during the acute inflammatory phase, monocytes/macrophages exhibit sustained migration toward the ischemic region of the brain [67]. \n\nTianshu Liu et al. [68] developed an innovative delivery system for treating ischemic stroke via nasal administration. Their strategy involved developing a liposomal drug delivery system simultaneously transporting panax notoginseng total saponins (PNSs), and ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3). To enhance targeted delivery to ischemic brain regions, they integrated macrophage membranes onto the liposome surface. Upon administering MM-Lip-Rg3/PNS for 14 days, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats demonstrated notable enhancements in survival rates, body weight, and neurological function scores. Furthermore, reductions in neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory cell infiltration were evident, contributing to the preservation of ischemic brain tissue integrity. In vivo animal experiments validated that MM-Lip-Rg3/PNS treatment mitigated apoptosis, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress by modulating various targets (including AKT1, VEGFA, EGFR, CASP3, STAT3, and MAPK1) and pathways (including PI3K/Rap1/cAMP/IL-17/TNF signaling pathways), thus presenting a promising therapeutic avenue for ischemic stroke.",

            "text": "Proteins and peptides have many biological roles in the brain, such as controlling the internal environment of the brain, including cerebral blood flow, permeability of the BBB to nutrient supply, neurotransmission, neuromodulation, and various roles in the immune system [5], which offers the potential for use as a viable drug carrier for braintargeted drug delivery systems. In addition, the protein-based drug delivery system also has the advantage of biodegradability, biocompatibility, no or low toxicity, and ease of modification [68,69]. Protein nanocarriers are now drawing great interest as drug delivery systems targeting brain tumors [5]. For example, Heng et al. enhanced brain targeting by adding cations or mannose to the surface of albumin nanoparticles [70] while Lu et al. modified folate on the surface of albumin particles [71]. The biodegradable, nonantigenic, and non-toxic characteristics of human serum albumin (has) make it an ideal candidate for tumor targeting [69,72]. However, since albumin is expressed at very low levels in normal BBB vessels, passage of native albumin is difficult [5], and surface modification methods must be combined to enhance its ability to pass through the BBB. Ferritin and lipoprotein not only have good biocompatibility, immunogenicity, and biodegradability of natural proteins, but also exhibit natural targeting properties that albumin does not have [69]. Luciana et al. demonstrated the possibility of using a ferritin-based drug delivery system to deliver toxic molecules to brain tumors, which relies on the ability of H-ferritin (HFT) to carry multiple metals and cross the blood-brain barrier via an endocytic mechanism [73]. Lin Huang et al. demonstrated that E3 recombinant high-density lipoprotein (ApoE-rHDL) is a highly efficient nanoplatform with blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and used it to deliver siRNA to glioblastoma cells for the treatment of brain tumors [74].",

            "text": "The majority of the molecules are prevented from the BBB entry; however, lipophilic compounds (<8 hydrogen bonds and <400 Da) can cross the BBB [41,42]. Since 98% of active drugs formulated with small molecules fail to cross the BBB, almost all drugs fail to reach the brain in a scheduled medication [43]. Of note, the key issue of rapid clearance is swift phagocytosis mediated through opsonization by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) in combination with renal excretion, unspecific biodistribution, and reduced blood circulation time [44]. Several research works have been performed during the last few decades on developing the brain drug delivery system. Particularly, nano-based carriers focus on enhancing the treatment strategies of neurological diseases by facilitating BBB crossing, accurate delivery of cargo into the brain, site-specific interactions, and systemic release [45]. Intravenous administration of brain targeting therapeutics undergoes peripheral circulation before reaching the brain target [44]. Thus, the main requirements for brain targeting nanoparticles might have prolonged circulation, stability, accumulation at the target site, and ensures longer contact time with the target tissue [46]. Among the variety of nanomaterials, liposomes are the sought-after delivery vehicle for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules into the brain. Liposomes can penetrate the brain through several transport routes [28,47]. In general, liposomes cross the BBB through carrier-mediated (cationic or PEGylated liposomes) and receptor-mediated endocytosis [48,49]. The liposome formulations under various phases of clinical trials are represented in Table 1.",

While the BBB serves as a crucial protective barrier, it poses challenges in delivering therapeutic agents to their intended targets within the brain parenchyma. To enhance drug delivery for the treatment of neurological diseases, several delivery technologies to circumvent the BBB have been developed in the last few years. Among them, nanoparticles (NPs) are one of the most versatile and promising tools. Here, we summarize the characteristics of NPs that facilitate BBB penetration, including their size, shape, chemical composition, surface charge, and importantly, their conjugation with various biological or synthetic molecules such as glucose, transferrin, insulin, polyethylene glycol, peptides, and aptamers. Additionally, we discuss the coating of NPs with surfactants. A comprehensive overview of the common in vitro and in vivo models of the BBB for NP penetration studies is also provided. The discussion extends to discussing BBB impairment under pathological conditions and leveraging BBB alterations under pathological conditions to enhance drug delivery. Emphasizing the need for future studies to uncover the inherent therapeutic properties of NPs, the review advocates for their role beyond delivery systems and calls for efforts translating NPs to the clinic as therapeutics. Overall, NPs stand out as a highly promising therapeutic strategy for precise BBB targeting and drug delivery in neurological disorders.",

By harnessing these self-characteristics and employing various modification strategies, these nanoparticles can enhance the penetration ability across the bloodbrain barrier (BBB), facilitate drug delivery to the brain, increase drug concentration in specific areas of the brain, and ultimately improve the effectiveness of AD treatment. \n\nRBC membranes are widely used for nanoparticle encapsulation and are considered one of the most commonly employed cell membranes in this context. An example of such nanoparticles is the PLGA-encapsulated RBC membrane nanoparticles, which were the first reported and most comprehensive cell membrane-based nanoparticles. 92 However, due to the inability of RBCs to cross the BBB, further modifications are required to enhance the targeting capabilities of RBC membrane-encapsulated nanoparticles. CDX, which is derived from candoxin, has a strong binding affinity for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) present on the surface of brain endothelial cells. Chai et al successfully incorporated DCDX peptides onto the surface of RBCNPs using a simple yet effective approach that did not compromise the peptide's ability to target the brain. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated promising brain-targeting efficiency of the resulting DCDX-RBCNPs. 105 Additionally, Yang Han's team developed macrophage (MA) membrane-coated solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) by attaching rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG29) and triphenylphosphine cation (TPP) molecules to the MA membrane surface. This modification aimed to deliver antioxidants specifically to the mitochondria of injured neurons in the brain. In an in vitro BBB model using bEnd.3/HT22 coculture, RVG/TPP-MASLN-Cou6 exhibited the highest BBB permeability among all groups, indicating efficient BBB crossing when employing these dual-modified formulations (Figure 5C). 100 Similar conclusions were reached in experiments involving RBCs. 106",

            "text": "Conventional antidepressant treatments face several limitations, including poor targeting, short in vivo half-life, and susceptibility to adverse side effects. Many approved antidepressant drugs undergo extensive first-pass metabolism, resulting in low oral bioavailability. As a result, it takes a long time for these drugs to reach therapeutic concentrations, leading to delayed onset of effects and reduced efficacy. Furthermore, the low bioavailability often necessitates higher dosages, which increases the risk of toxic side effects over time. Another significant challenge is the limited ability of conventional antidepressants to cross the BBB and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), which restricts their therapeutic potential in treating CNS disorders like depression [117][118][119][120][121]. \n\nIn recent years, nanotechnology has gained significant attention for its potential to overcome many of these limitations [122][123][124]. Nanoparticles offer unique advantages, such as enhanced drug solubility, targeted delivery, and the ability to cross biological barriers more efficiently. However, nanoparticles also face challenges, including instability and a lack of specificity when exposed to the complex biological environment [125][126][127][128][129]. Therefore, it is crucial to modify nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems to enhance their therapeutic efficacy. One promising approach is the surface modification of nanoparticles, which can improve several key factors, including drug specificity, nanoparticle circulation time, biosafety, biocompatibility, and the solubility of hydrophobic drugs [130][131][132]. Many nanoparticles, particularly those made from hydrophobic polymers, are inherently hydrophobic, which limits their effectiveness in aqueous biological environments. Surface modification can address this issue by coating nanoparticles with biopolymers (e.g., polyethylene glycol, PEG) and conjugating them with targeting ligands (e.g., transferrin) that enhance specificity to the target site.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB), a mechanism that stops foreign substances from passing from the blood to the extracellular fluid of the brain, is mostly responsible for controlling the administration of medications to the central nervous system (CNS). Certain medications' physicochemical characteristics prevent them from passing across the blood-brain barrier and from reaching subtherapeutic concentrations in the tissues they are intended to treat [26]. Typically, many therapeutic agents are unable to reach the CNS in modern medicine due to the difficulty of transporting medications over the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [27]. One kind of nanoparticle that has shown promise in medication delivery is carbon dots (CDs). The distinct \"core-shell\" nanostructures of carbon dots are defined by carbon cores that are usually less than 20 nm. These cores show mild graphitization or extremely dehydrated polymer frames that are crosslinked. These cores are surrounded by shells made up of many polymer chains and functional groups. Because of this specific structure, CDs have more functionalization, compatibility, stability, and ease of modification, which opens up a greater range of possible applications in many disciplines [28]. In terms of toxicity, CDs display minimal toxicity or non-toxicity as well as exemplary compatibility with biological systems even with elevated concentration levels [28]. CDs are able to pass right through the BBB. The BBB has been successfully crossed by several CD forms and their conjugates with particular ligands, suggesting that CDs may be used as drug delivery vehicles to treat disorders of the CNS. CDs are adaptable transporters for medicinal chemicals because they have functional groups, such amine and carboxyl groups, on their surface that allow them to bind with a variety of medications [29]. The categorization, characteristics, and uses of CDs are being researched in this field, with an emphasis on how they might be used to treat neurodegenerative illnesses. Additionally, future studies may look into the mechanisms underlying the movement of molecules across this extremely selective barrier as well as the structure of the blood-brain barrier.",

            "text": "Even if a substance is proven effective in treating brain tumors, neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system diseases, to the most important challenge is to deliver it to the brain. Effective therapeutic antibodies are being developed to target brain diseases, however, brain delivery approach for these antibodies while maintaining their shape has yet to be developed. 164 Nanotechnology is potentially used to protect encapsulated substances. Establishing technologies for transporting nanoparticles to the brain is one of the greatest obstacles in the field of nanomedicine. The major obstacle is the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which exists between the central nervous system and the blood, and greatly restricts the transport of substances to the brain. Substances circulating in the bloodstream can only pass through the BBB if these are (1) hydrophobic molecules of weight below 450 Da or (2) transported via endogenous transporters present in the BBB. 165,166 Therefore, regardless of the type of material used to prepare nanoparticles; it is difficult for them to reach the brain by simply injecting them intravenously in their original state. On the other hand, it has been reported that nonionic surfactant (for example, polysorbate 80)-coated nanoparticles with active targeting function could reach the brain; although the detailed mechanism of transport of nanoparticles into the brain by modification with polysorbate 80 is still unclear. The current prevailing theory is that apolipoprotein adsorption at the polysorbate 80 site of surfactant-coated nanoparticles circulating in the bloodstream that crosses the BBB through receptor-mediated transcytosis ( Figure 4C). 167,168 The use of nonionic surfactants such as polysorbate 80 may also help nanoparticles to accumulate in the brain for a long time due to their inhibitory effect on P-glycoprotein (Pgp/ABCB1, a mechanism of foreign body efflux in the brain). 169,170 Other substances that use this mechanism of brain transport are poly (butyl cyanoacrylate) (PBCA) and PLGA. 171 Wilson et al prepared surfactant-coated nanoparticles (rivastigmine-encapsulated",

            "text": "However, inflammation arising in tumors can induce overexpression of cell adhesion molecules on the endothelial surface, allowing interaction between macrophages and endothelial cells, facilitating the initial process of macrophage rolling, strong attachment, and transmigration. As a result of this phenomenon, macrophages can cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the parenchyma of the brain from the peripheral circulation. 95,98 These cells, constituting the largest population of immune cells infiltrating glioblastoma, 99 may become promising carriers for nanoparticle delivery to the brain tumor environment. \n\nDespite many advantages, the use of macrophages as carriers has some limitations that pose a challenge in their further development and clinical translation. One potential limitation is the influence of engulfed drugs on the impairment or disruption of innate cellular functions. The particles should not affect the ability of macrophages to migrate and be efficiently delivered and released at the target site. Therefore, it is essential to define the toxic and destructive effects of the internalized drugs and to confirm their safety both for the cellular carrier and the organs. 100 The challenge is also the lack of control over the loading quantity of payloads and the limited payload of macrophages, which means that they can only uptake a limited number of particles. Another limitation is the unspecified stability of macrophages loaded with fragile, biodegradable drugs that may undergo intracellular biodegradation or inactivation leading to their premature release. The solution to the above problems may be to encapsulate molecules in protective nanocarriers (eg liposomes) and only then load them into macrophages, or to use only macrophage cell membranes to wrap the particles. In turn, it can also be the attachment of such molecules to the surface of macrophages and the simultaneous prevention of their phagocytosis through chemical conjugation or using a \"cellular backpack\". 101 Due to the high heterogeneity among macrophages and sensitivity to local environmental changes, the challenge is to control the behavior of macrophages during the transport of particles, ie changes in their phenotype and activation state.",

In this Review, first we introduce the anatomical structure and physiological functions of the BBB. Second, we present the endogenous and exogenous transport mechanisms by which NPs cross the BBB. We report various forms of nanomaterials, carriers, and their cargos, with their detailed BBB uptake and permeability characteristics. Third, we describe the effect of regulating the size, shape, charge, and surface ligands of NPs that affect their BBB permeability, which can be exploited to enhance and promote neurotheranostics. We classify typical functionalized nanomaterials developed for BBB crossing. Fourth, we provide a comprehensive review of the recent progress in developing functional polymeric nanomaterials for applications in multimodal bioimaging, therapeutics, and drug delivery. Finally, we conclude by discussing existing challenges, directions, and future perspectives in employing functionalized nanomaterials for BBB crossing.",

            "text": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the interface between blood flow and brain parenchyma and acts as an anatomical and physiological barrier to prevent harmful substances from entering the brain or gastrointestinal tract. It also serves as an existing barrier to antitumor drugs, thus limiting the effective delivery of most therapeutic agents to the tumor. This restricted passage of antitumor drugs through the BBB is mainly attributed to active efflux transporters (AETs) [194]. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are the two most common AETs that are associated with drug resistance in multiple tumors and limit the brain penetration of antineoplastic drugs [195]. More than half of the commercially available antitumor drugs are recognized by P-gp, which prevents drug entry into the brain parenchyma via the transcytosis pathway. Although a partial blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB) with increased permeability due to abnormal blood vessel formation is present in brain tumors, the BBTB in most brain tumor areas is closer to the intact BBB [196]. To address the issue of poor drug accessibility in brain tumors, in addition to developing new therapeutic strategies for overcoming BBB/BBTB, the selection of suitable drug delivery vehicles presents a promising approach. Exosomes are rich in membrane proteins and specific lipids that confer their ability to cross biological barriers and have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and gastrointestinal tract for the brain or gastrointestinal delivery of biomolecules or drugs (Fig. 11A, B) [197,198]. The targeting ability of unmodified exosomes is not strong, however, with only approximately 0.5% reaching the brain [29]. However, they have been able to significantly improve the effective concentration and therapeutic efficacy of antitumor drugs at the tumor site [199,200]. Surface modification can also further improve the targeting ability of exosomes. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most difficult and aggressive tumors to treat, with the difficulty of accessing therapeutic agents in the tumor region being one of the primary reasons for poor prognosis and inevitable recurrence.",

            "text": "The BBB is a physiological barrier between the blood and the central nervous system (CNS) that is mainly composed of brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) connected by tight junctions (TJs). The BBB is considered to be the most important safeguard against the passage of molecules and foreign substances through the extensive capillary network to the brain parenchyma. In addition to BCECs, the extracellular basement membrane, adjacent pericytes, astrocytes and microglia are all indispensable components of the BBB, which, together with the surrounding neurons, form a complex functional neurovascular system. The BBB can protect the relative stability of the internal environment of the CNS and prevent damage by harmful substances in the blood, which is highly important for the maintenance of CNS function and the CNS environment. However, for neurological diseases such as AD and PD, the BBB is a major obstacle to drug treatment. In general, most drugs cannot cross the BBB. Only small molecules with high lipid solubility and a relative molecular mass of < 400 can cross the barrier. To facilitate BBB transport, nanoparticles can be modified with targeting moieties so that they preferentially bind to receptors expressed at the BBB. In recent years, the development of nanodelivery technology has provided a series of strategies for the targeted delivery of drugs to the brain. For example, nanodelivery carriers such as liposomes, microemulsions, and micelles, modifiers such as cell transmembrane peptides (CPPs), and membrane transporters such as transferrin and lactoferrin have effectively improved the ability of drugs to reach brain tissue.",

This method exploits endogenous transport mechanisms by attaching ligands or antibodies to nanoparticles that bind to specific receptors on the BBB, such as the transferrin or insulin receptors, facilitating the transport of encapsulated mRNA across the barrier [13]. \n\nThirdly, the development of novel nanoparticle formulations that can naturally cross the BBB is under investigation. For example, nanoparticles can be designed with surface modifications that enhance their ability to traverse the BBB. PEGylation, the attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to nanoparticles, is one such modification that increases the stability and circulation time of nanoparticles, enhancing their chances of crossing the BBB [14]. \n\nAnother approach involves the use of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), which are short peptides that can facilitate the delivery of therapeutic agents across cellular membranes, including the BBB. CPPs can be conjugated to nanoparticles carrying mRNA, improving their delivery efficiency to brain tissues [15]. \n\nAdditionally, ongoing research is focused on utilizing viral vectors that have a natural ability to cross the BBB. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) and lentiviruses are being engineered to deliver mRNA directly to brain cells, taking advantage of their efficient transduction capabilities [16]. \n\nDespite these advancements, ensuring the stability and controlled release of mRNA once it reaches the target site remains a challenge. Novel hydrogel-based delivery systems are being developed to provide sustained release of mRNA, enhancing its therapeutic efficacy while minimizing potential side effects [17].",

            "text": "Brain cancer represents a strong impact on the life of diagnosed patients and it supposes a serious problem for health systems [40]. There are studies where SLNs have proven their capacity to improve the treatment of this disease. One of those studies focused on the use of SLNs to deliver the drug indirubin against a human U87MG glioblastoma-astrocytoma cell line. SLNs increased the cytotoxic effect of the drug (especially in acidic conditions), demonstrating that these nanoparticles have the potential to be applied against brain cancer cells [75].\n\nAs previously mentioned, it is complicated to treat brain tumors because the blood-brain barrier represents a significant obstacle. To enhance drug delivery in these therapies, the surface of SLNs can be modified with molecules that target receptors highly expressed in the blood-brain barrier. For instance, SLNs can be coated with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a molecule specifically recognized by the receptors of low-or very low-density lipoproteins (LDL or VLDL). These receptors are expressed in cells of the blood-brain barrier, and targeting them with ApoE would allow an active cellular uptake of ApoE-SLN. Thus, this approach could increase the accumulation of nanoparticles in the brain [76,77].\n\nSLNs that combine this ApoE surface modification together with the incorporation of the drug methotrexate (as its lipophilic ester didoceylmethotrexate) have proven a reduction capacity of glioblastoma tumors from F98/Fisher rat models. Besides, they exhibited a reduced elimination of the drug from plasma and brain compared to the administration of the compound in free form [76]. It has also been verified that ApoE-modified SLNs enhanced cellular incorporation and transcytosis through the blood-brain barrier. When SLNs were coated with ApoE using DSPE-PEG-avidin or palmitate-avidin as linkers, they were able to increase cellular uptake in a hCMEC/D3 cell monolayer simulating the characteristics of the BBB [77].",

            "text": "Brain disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and tumors (more than 600 pathologies), are a serious health problem, resulting in brain dysfunctions that limit normal activities, with a significant economic impact [1]. The major difficulty for the treatment of brain diseases is the presence of biological barriers (the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier) limiting brain accessibility and reducing the efficacy of therapies, with a number of side effects due to the dispersion of the drugs which fail to enter the central nervous system (CNS) [2,3]. Furthermore, it is important to administer therapeutic agents to the brain lesions present in different regions of the CNS without affecting other normal CNS tissues in order to avoid further damage. In addition, at the cellular level, it is very important that formulations may selectively target the specific brain cells (neuron, microglia, oligodendrocytes or astrocytes) involved in different brain pathologies. \n\nIn this context, the nanobiotechnology approach should offer unique opportunities to (i) improve drug bioavailability (the protection of a drug from degradation); (ii) overcome physiological barriers; (iii) enable targeted delivery and controlled release; and, consequently, (iv) reduce the doses and frequency of administration by limiting potential adverse effects. All of these advantages would allow an increase in the efficacy of therapies for the treatment of brain disorders. Several studies have focused on developing drug delivery systems (DDSs) for the brain, such as nanoparticles, dendrimers, liposomes, vesicles and nanogels [3][4][5][6][7], as a potential approach to contrast NDs. \n\nMoreover, magnetic nanoparticles have received much attention as systems for the treatment of cerebral pathologies. In particular, they have been chosen for their ease of preparation and their advantageous properties such as composition, size, surface morphology, functionalization and ability to cross the BBB, which could be very promising for future clinical applications [8,9]. \n\nRecently, brain delivery systems capable of transporting organelles such as mitochondria have also been designed [10,11].",

            "text": "Unlike polymeric nanoparticles with the potential for surface modifications and functionalization, 12,13 targeted drug delivery with NCs is challenging due to a lack of precision, reducing their efficiency and therapeutic outcome. Further, most approaches to modifying NC surface do not guarantee the preservation of the pharmacokinetic activity of the active compound, as these modifications may potentially alter its chemical structure. 14 Interfacial cohesion and supramolecular assembly with metal-phenolic networks have recently been proposed for NCs' surface engineering, although the stability of the metal\u2212ligand coordination at different pH levels is a main pitfall for this strategy. 15 Hence, surface customization emerges as a promising strategy to enable targeted delivery to specific cells and tissues before dissolution, presenting an intriguing avenue for investigation. \n\nNotably, there is still a lack of successful surface engineering approaches that effectively allow active targeting while suppressing Ostwald ripening phenomena, 4 meaning preserving the integrity of the NCs. In particular, in the context of neurological treatments, the challenges in achieving effective drug delivery are closely linked to the need for selectivity due to the high complexity of the central nervous system (CNS) and the barriers protecting it. Hence, the most simplistic administration approach is the so-called nose-to-brain route, 16 offering a direct path through the olfactory and trigeminal nerves while minimizing side effects related to drug systemic circulation. Nonetheless, precision in targeting is crucial when drugs are transported from the nasal cavity to the brain. Without selectivity, drug delivery efficiency to the brain is significantly reduced. 16 Selectivity is critical in ensuring that the drug reaches the intended brain regions or specific cells, which is particularly challenging when dealing with NCs due to their inherent lack of surface specificity. \n\nPolymer surface chemistry could play a pivotal role in addressing the challenges related to NCs. Tailoring the surface of NCs through polymer chemistry techniques is an entirely unexplored concept that would enable the introduction of specific functional groups, coatings, or modifications for enhanced selectivity. This engineered surface approach will allow precise targeting by facilitating interactions with specific cells, tissues, or organs, influencing drug release kinetics, and improving NC stability. \n\nHerein, we propose for the first time surface-initiated polymerization as an innovative tool for NC engineering.",

            "text": "Glioblastoma is a harmful and often fatal brain malignancy, with approximately 23, 000 cases diagnosed in adults in the US each year [1,2]. Glioblastoma is regarded as a Grade IV tumor by the World Health Organization (WHO) [3,4]. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) provides a uniquely privileged immune environment that remains impenetrable to many small and large molecule therapeutics used for treatment [5]. \n\nLipid-based carriers are within the submicron range in size (i.e., 100-300 nm); therefore, we developed a lipid-based carrier to deliver molecular therapeutics across the BBB to tumors [6,7]. Additionally, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have a solid lipid core that can effectively incorporate hydrophobic drugs. Lipid nanoparticles are non-toxic and biocompatible, with a good loading capacity, resulting in increased solubility and stability of the loaded drugs; sustained delivery of hydrophobic drugs using lipid nanoparticles has been reported [8,9]. We designed surface-modified SLNs, which have been used as a system to successfully deliver drugs across the BBB to tumor tissues with high specificity [10]. \n\nChitosan (CS), a cationic natural polymer, exhibits excellent biomedical properties for the sustained release of therapeutic agents; it is biodegradable, biocompatible, modifiable, and non-toxic [11]. Chitosan, N-deacetylated chitin, can be derivatized by N-methylation to form N, N, N-trimethyl chitosan (TMC). CS has several moieties that can readily be methylated to change its form from a trimethyl group into a polysaccharide backbone, which improves its aqueous solubility over all pH ranges because of its polyelectrolytic cationic nature, whereas CS is most soluble in acidic environments at pH < 6 [12]. TMC also possesses mucoadhesive and absorption-enhancing properties because it can transiently open tight junctions between epithelial cells without cytotoxicity [13].",

Notes: Liposomes can be administered to the central nervous system via systemic delivery (a), intracarotid (b), intracranial (c), intranasal (e), and intraperitoneal (f) injections, or via convection-enhanced delivery (d/n). Liposome-based strategies consist in encapsulating the molecules of interest in liposomes (v). The ability to increase their bloodcirculation time is created with the ligation of polyethylene glycol on the liposome surface (III). Liposomes can also be targeted to cross the blood-brain barrier (I), target the site of disease (IX), or both (II). Surface modification of liposomes can be achieved by covalent ligation of antibodies (IX), RNA aptamers (VI), or peptides (XII). Cationic lipids can be incorporated into the bilayer, facilitating their association with nucleic acids for gene therapy (VIII and XI). This figure also summarizes therapeutic mechanisms, such as hyperthermia (Iv), temperature increase (vII), and ultrasound (X).\n\nInternational Journal of Nanomedicine 2016:11 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com",

            "text": "Despite advancements in imaging techniques and tools, the exact mechanism of nanocrystal transport into the brain remains unclear. However, nanocrystals are believed to be transported via either endocytosis or passive diffusion. Despite the potential use of nanocrystal formulations for other delivery routes, bypassing the BBB and accessing the brain remains a challenge for several drugs. Nanocrystals improve the solubility, dissolution rate and pharmacokinetics of most of the drugs, however these advantageous are often insufficient to achieve BBB permeation. Parental or orally administered brain targeting drugs may aggregate and loose effectiveness at the BBB interface. The optimal formulation necessitates ideal surface modifications, additives or targeting ligands to facilitate transport. However, various alternative invasive and non-invasive methods are available for bypassing the BBB. \n\nInvasive methods: Invasive methods, including intracerebral injection and implantation of drug-eluting devices, can be used to deliver NCs to the brain to improve the permeability of drug compared to macromolecules. Although these methods circumvent the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and provide direct access to the brain they carry a high risk of infection and tissue damage, and may not be appropriate for all individuals, they may be useful in some circumstances. However, nanocrystals showed better permeability in the brain after intraperitoneal and tail vein injections (in vivo studies). Intraperitoneal administration of Px-18 nanocrystals after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion showed the ability to alleviate delayed neuronal death caused by ischemia. Px-18 nanocrystals were formulated as nanosuspensions by highpressure homogenisation. 200 However, these trials should be expanded to the clinical setting. \n\nIntranasal administration (Non-invasive method): The BBB can be bypassed by intracarotid infusion, hyperthermia techniques, transmucosal drug delivery, and intranasal administration. 201",

            "text": "Polymer nanoparticles refer to nano-sized particles composed of natural or synthetic polymer materials. Among them, polylactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer (PLGA) and chitosan are the most widely studied materials and have proven to be effective drug delivery systems (Patel et al., 2012). After loading drugs into nanoparticles, the nanoparticles' surface can be modified and engineered to enhance the targeting property of the NBDDS, increase solubility, extend half-life, reduce immunogenicity, and improve biodistribution. Most studies use PEG coating when using a polymer nanoparticle. The nanoparticles' surface is covered with a PEG lipid layer to reduce nonspecific binding, increase blood half-life, and allow specific ligand binding. Different surface modifications can target the injury site and change the effect based on different treatment purposes. There are many specific receptors expressed in the BBB responsible for transporting large molecules including nutrition transporters, such as insulin receptors, transferrin receptors, low-density lipoprotein receptors, immunoglobulins receptors, and growth factors receptors. Additionally, some molecules are highly expressed in the stroke microenvironment, such as matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and G-protein coupled chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4). These up-regulated receptors or molecules provide the ability for nanoparticle modification and deliver drugs more efficiently across the BBB into ischemic tissue. Chlorotoxin (CTX) is a substrate of the MMP-2, which is upregulated in the ischemic microenvironments in brain tissue (Clark et al., 1997;Chang et al., 2003). Han et al., developed a nano-system in which CTX was coated onto PLGA nanoparticles' surface as a targeting ligand. Lexiscan was encapsulated in the nanoparticles to promote an autocatalysis action of BBB permeability.",

            "text": "Nano-drug delivery systems have emerged as an excellent alternative to conventional delivery systems with several advantages including targeted drug delivery with enhanced efficacy.However, nanoparticulate systems need to be characterized concerning safety and toxicity.In several studies, nanoparticles resulted in uptake by the reticuloendothelial system and resulted in the inflammation of the liver, lung and brain due to the oxidative stress induced by nanoparticles [168].The ability of nanocarriers to cross the blood-brain barrier is beneficial in brain diseases; however, it causes neurotoxicity when the intended site of action is not the brain.In addition, nanoparticles provoke immunomodulatory effects in some cases.This immunomodulatory effect of nanoparticles can be harnessed to target inflammatory monocytes across the blood-brain barrier to prevent the progression of auto-immune disorders (e.g., autoimmune encephalomyelitis) [169].Inorganic mesoporous nanoparticles have gained attention in controlled drug delivery as they comprise ordered mesopores (2-6 nm) and tunable size (50-200 nm) and shape and their easy surface modification makes them ideal for improved targeting and endosomal release of the drugs.To avoid the premature release of drugs through the mesopores, they can be covered with stimuli-responsive polymers, which makes them capable of providing spatio-temporal control during the release of a specific drug into the cytosol of the target cell [170].\n\nOn the other hand, stimuli-responsive delivery systems seem to be a very interesting and useful approach to tune the drug release from outside and from within.However, there is a lot more research needed to improve the accuracy, precision and repeatability of such dosage forms.Sensitivity to the specific stimuli must be higher because delivering a high amount of external stimuli (electric field, magnetic field, light and heat) might cause damage to the healthy tissues.Until now, there are no discrete guidelines for nano-drug delivery and stimuli-responsive and functional biomaterials.There is an urgent need to develop and harmonize the regulatory guidelines on nano-drug delivery systems, stimuliresponsive delivery systems and next-generation biomaterials for drug delivery.",

            "text": "Curing central nervous system diseases represents an important challenge for scientists. Pharmaceutical therapy remains the most reliable method for treatment of these diseases [1][2] . However, the limited ability of macromolecular drugs to cross the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barriers constitutes one of the main problem in this area of medicine. Macromolecular drugs are excluded from the central nervous system by the presence of endothelial cell tight junctions at the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barriers. Numerous studies have reported interesting approaches to identify a better way to enable drug delivery to the central nervous system through crossing the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barriers [3][4][5][6][7][8] . Nanocarriers have been used to increase the stability of administered therapeutic molecules, improve their efficacy, and decrease undesired side effects [9] . Liposomes are well-investigated drug carriers. The plasma membrane presents a formidable barrier to the introduction of macromolecules into cells. Liposomes can diffuse through the endothelial cell membrane and enter the central nervous system passively. Nevertheless, some studies have demonstrated that naive liposomes cannot cross the blood-spinal cord barrier in large amounts to achieve a positive partition coefficient with the concentration administered [10][11] . Transactivating-transduction protein (TAT) is an 11 amino acid portion of the HIV-1 TAT protein that activates transcription of the viral genome [12] . Because traversal through cellular membranes represents a major barrier for efficient delivery of macromolecules into cells, the TAT protein may serve to transport various drugs. It has been widely shown [13][14] that addition of TAT and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the surface of liposomes enhances their ability to be delivered across cellular membranes and also cross the blood-brain barrier. Few studies have focused on the mechanism by which TAT-PEG-modified liposomes cross the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barriers. Fluorescence microscopy is among the most important tools to follow the specific interactions of targeted liposomes with cells and elucidate fine details of their intracellular fate [15] .\n\nTherefore, this study was designed to analyze the delivery of a novel liposome",

In addition, new drugs developed have failed due to unsatisfactory pharmacokinetics, non-specific targeting, and the risk of side effects. Biological barriers such as the BBB, blood-brain-spinal barrier, and Pglycoprotein-induced drug efflux are the primary causes of these difficulties because they block the transport of drugs from the blood to the brain (Ballabh et al., 2004;Bhattacharya et al., 2022). Thus, BBB is a Fig. 3. Diagrammatic representation of types of nanoparticles according to their main constituent. \n\nA.P. Kamath et al. major obstacle in the treatment of neurological diseases, as it impedes the delivery of most therapeutic agents and prevents effective treatment. A major concern in drug intervention is whether and how much drug is delivered across the blood-brain barrier (Song et al., 2023). Nanomedicine seeks to diagnose and treat diseases with nanosized materials. In recent years, nanoscience and pharmaceutical science have been applied together in very promising ways. A wide range of organic, inorganic, polymeric, and metallic nanostructures are employed as targeted and controlled drug delivery vehicles, such as dendrimers, micelles, solid lipid nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes. NPs, which are small, have modifiable surface properties, and have tunable morphology, offer an ideal candidate for overcoming all the hurdles a brain drug delivery system needs to overcome. NPs intrinsically provide inherent value due to their low toxicity, high surface-to-volume ratio, variable degradation rate, and capacity to carry different payloads that can be utilized as drug carriers to facilitate crossing biological barriers and produce more effective therapeutic effects. Sanchez L E.et al.'s, study was aimed to enhance memantine's effectiveness against Alzheimer's, memantine was loaded into biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles synthesized by double emulsion.

The accumulation of therapeutic drugs inside the brain is far from the therapy threshold, which is closely related to the transient circulation time of drugs and their carriers. Herein, a core\u2013shell protein-based long-circulation delivery platform was constructed. Through in situ free radical polymerization, a zwitterionic polymer poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) was modified on the surface to prolong the circulation lifetime with a biomimetic structure induced by a phosphorylcholine (PC) head-group similar to the lipids in the outer membrane of living cells. A cell-penetrating peptide, HIV-1 trans-activating transcriptor (TAT) was conjugated on the surface of the protein-based nanoparticles, endowing the delivery platform with BBB-crossing ability. The BBB-permeability of the nanoparticles was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Encapsulated with zwitterionic polymer PMPC, the nanoparticles showed a long circulation lifetime due to strong resistance to nonspecific adsorption and provided a better chance for BBB penetration. The delivery platform had enhanced permeability for BBB and a longer retention time inside the brain in a healthy mouse model. Overall, the surface modification with zwitterionic polymer PMPC and cell-penetrating peptide TAT changes the circulation modality of the nanoparticles in vivo, and provides a promising pathway for BBB crossing as a potential drug delivery platform for CNS related disease therapy.",

These nanoparticles with a size range of 10 to 1000 nm are composed of microemulsion, polymer, and inorganic materials. In recent years, many drugs have been successfully delivered by nanoparticles to cross the blood-brain barrier, such as 6 peptide dalarginz, 2 peptide kytorphin, slightly camp butyl amine, cylinder sword muscarinic, adriamycin, NMDA receptor antagonists MRZ2/576 and adriamycin. Moreover, various colloidal delivery systems have been tried while various methods have been developed to improve the penetration of BBB, and the mainstream materials for increasing BBB penetration are liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, and solid nanoparticles [52]. The specific condition is shown in Table 3. The ultrasound method was the simple approach to open the blood-brain barrier, however it is quite difficult to avoid damaging the tissue, triggering an excessive immune response, or causing cerebral hemorrhage. The method of prodrug delivery for brain has not yet been used for brain tumor chemotherapeutic drugs. More commonly, chemical modification refers to the process of making an existing drug more lipid-soluble, with the intent of increasing BBB permeability.

Therefore, synaptic proteins are one of the major targets for drugs used as neuro-chemical therapeutics. Unfortunately, the majority of drugs is not able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and is therefore distributed within the CNS parenchyma. Here, we report the development of novel biodegradable Nanoparticles (NPs), made of poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) conjugated with glycopeptides that are able to cross the BBB and deliver for example Zn2+ ions. We also provide a thorough characterization of loaded and unloaded NPs for their stability, cellular uptake, release properties, toxicity, and impact on cell trafficking. Our data reveal that these NPs are biocompatible, and can be used to elevate intracellular levels of Zn2+. Importantly, by engineering the surface of NPs with antibodies against NCAM1 and CD44, we were able to selectively target neurons or glial cells, respectively. Our results indicate that these biodegradable NPs provide a potential new venue for the delivery Zn2+ to the CNS and thus a means to explore the influence of altered zinc levels linked to neuropsychological disorders such as depression.",

            "text": "The pharmaceutical industry, physicians and patients have long desired better pharmaceutical formulations to improve and extend the economic life of proprietary drugs, to reduce the costs of preparation and treatment, and reduce toxicity or even death. Nanotechnology has already made significant inroads into the problems of improving delivery of injectibles, oral formulations, drug device implants, and topical and transdermal delivery of drugs. More is expected from nanotechnology in improving the delivery of drugs to the brain, as many of the formulations aimed at treating diseases of the brain fail to cross the blood-brain barrier. Various methods have been tested for drug delivery. For example, carbon-based materials, nanostructures, silicone-based materials, polymers and liposomes, which are capable of delivering drug molecules directly into cells, tumors and sites of inflammation either actively or passively. There is no question that there are many limitations such as opsonization, problems with encapsulation and leakiness of drug that needs to be tackled. Some of these obstacles have been overcome by the development of agents like \"stealth liposomes\", which escape attack by the immune system. Thus, nanotechnology is expanding our capabilities through promising approaches for delivery of therapeutic agents. \n\nNanosystems and nanoparticles have opened up hitherto unforeseen avenues in diagnostics and therapeutics in medicine, especially in the fields of inflammation and cancer. The previous treatment strategies in the fields of autoimmune diseases and cancer involved non-targeted treatment options with extensive \"collateral damage\". Nanodelivery of drugs is envisioned to reduce this collateral damage, extend a drug's availability and effectiveness at the site, and reduce toxicity, cost and storage. \n\nThe focus of this section is to highlight several nanomedicine applications that have made an immediate major impact in these fields. Biological nanostructures used in drug delivery systems include lipid-, silica-, polymer-, fullerene (carbonbased buckyballs, bucky tubes)-based nanostructures such as liposomes, micelles and nanoparticle systems. \n\nLiposomes have been widely used as drug delivery systems, but current knowledge extends the use of any nanoparticle as an efficient carrier with necessary modifications.",

            "text": "The majority of drugs used as neuro-chemical therapeutics target synaptic proteins. Unfortunately, a high number of drugs are not able to cross through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [1]. The transmissivity of this epithelial structure is restricted by the presence of tight junctions (TJ) that connect the cerebral endothelial and epithelial cells of the choroids plexus. Additionally, glial cells are found surrounding the surface of the capillaries, which cohere the endothelial cells, producing an electrical resistance much higher than that of other systemic endothelia [2]. Recent studies have demonstrated a non-invasive method of drug delivery to the CNS, based on the use of biodegradable Nanoparticles (NPs). Injectable nanoparticulate drug carriers made of poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA), and specifically modified with ligands were shown to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), thus representing an important potential tool for treatment of neurological diseases [3,4]. \n\nIn particular, this new strategy for NPs-brain targeting is based on the surface engineering of NPs, using a glycopeptides (g7)-derived PLGA [3,5,6]. The attachment of ligands for CNS targeting and/or fluorescent markers on the surface of NPs allows evaluating and influencing their properties both in vitro and in vivo. These engineered NPs (BBB-NPs) bear the possibility to deliver different kinds of drugs to the brain with a high rate of efficiency (13-15% of the injected dose) [7]. Thus, by encapsulation of drugs into BBB-NPs a significant improvement of brain delivery can be expected. \n\nIn recent years, there has been mounting evidence that suggests a correlation between zinc deficiency and clinical depression [8,9]. Clinical studies as well as work with animal models indicate that zinc levels and some neuropsychological disorders are functionally linked. Zinc deficiency, for example, has been shown to induce depression-and anxiety-like behaviors, while zinc supplementation has been used to treat depression.",

It is estimated that only 2% of the new central nervous system (CNS) therapeutic compounds can cross the BBB and achieve their therapeutic targets.

            "text": "Efficacious non-invasive treatment of neurological diseases is frequently limited by the poor access of therapeutic agents into the central nervous system (CNS) (Wong et al., 2012). The larger amount of drugs and biotechnological agents are not able to permeate readily into brain parenchyma due to the presence of two anatomical and biochemical dynamic barriers: the BBB and blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). Therefore, one of the most significant challenge for CNS drug development is the availability of effectual brain targeting technology (Patel et al., 2013). Recent advances in nanotechnology have provided promising solutions. \n\nVarious nanocarriers ranging from the more established systems, such as polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles to the newer systems, e.g. dendrimers, nanogels, nanoemulsions and nanosuspensions have been studied for drug delivery into CNS. Many therapeutic agents can be effectively transported across several in vitro and in vivo BBB models by endocytosis and/or transcytosis, thus demonstrating early achievements for the management of CNS conditions e.g. brain tumors, HIV encephalopathy, Alzheimer's disease and acute ischemic stroke. Future development of CNS nanomedicines needs to focus on increasing their drug-trafficking performance and specificity for brain tissue using novel targeting carriers, improving their BBB permeability and reducing their neurotoxicity (Wong et al., 2012). \n\nSLN have been reported as a promising anticancer drug delivery system to the brain, after intravenous injection, due to their ability to cross the barrier and deliver drugs to the brain (Martins et al., 2012). An improved brain accumulation of several compounds, especially anticancer drugs, was demonstrated when these drugs were delivered using SLN by administering them orally, intravenously and/or transdermally. Nanoparticles located in the external environment of a cell can interact with the plasma membrane, which can lead to the uptake of these nanoparticles by the cells through a process called \"endocytosis\" (Martins et al., 2012).",

As a result, protecting polyphenols in vivo and delivery to the nervous system have been challenging and remain to be addressed. [23][24][25][26][27] Studies have shown that mitochondrial abnormalities are the leading cause of ROS accumulation in the nervous system. 28 Further, our recent studies found that HA can reduce ROS and restore neural damage by protecting the mitochondria. 29 In addition, one significant challenge for nanoparticle delivery of polyphenols for AD treatments is the issue associated with the blood-brain barrier (BBB), 30 which is formed as the interface between blood and the brain to protect the brain by restricting the passage or crossing of solutes, such as antibodies and drugs. 2][33] Therefore, polyphenols and HA, along with the B6 peptide, are the rationale for developing or constructing nanoparticles, which can cross the BBB, further scavenge the central nervous ROS, and reduce AD damage. \n\nAs inspired, in the present study, we used HA as the core material, grafted with two polyphenols (RES and OPC) and B6 peptides, to construct nanoparticles and further investigated their potential for ROS scavenging and neuroinflammation inhibition, as well as their ability to cross the BBB. Our innovative design of B6-RES-OPC-HA nanoparticles (B6-RES-OPC-HA NPs) and their strategical delivery into the brain allow for more efficient ROS clearance and neuroinflammation inhibition, thus effectively treating AD in early stages (Scheme 1).",

            "text": "The presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-tumor barrier (BTB) is a major impediment to the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), one of the most aggressive malignant forms of brain cancer. 3,5 The selective permeability of physiological barriers impedes the passage of therapeutic molecules, posing a challenge to delivering drugs to the brain and tumor microenvironment. Large and hydrophilic molecules are unable to cross these barriers, resulting in lower therapeutic concentrations at the site of action and reduced treatment efficacy for patients, ultimately impacting survival rates. 163,164 To improve treatment outcomes in GBM, it is crucial to advance new approaches that can overcome these barriers. \n\nVarious strategies have been explored to overcome the BBB and BTB, and among them, NP-based drug delivery systems have shown great potential. Surface modifications, such as receptor-mediated targeting and adsorptive-mediated transcytosis, have demonstrated enhanced NP transport across the barriers. 15,22 The use of NP-based combination strategies holds immense potential. 165 The use of NPs with ultrasound waves or magnetic fields represents a developed strategy to enhance drug delivery to tumor sites. 115,132 This approach takes advantage of the increased permeability and localized targeting, thereby improving the efficiency and precision of therapeutic agent delivery to the targeted area. Furthermore, the integration of cell-based drug delivery systems with NPs offers a unique approach to enhance drug delivery to GBM. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), monocytes/macrophages, and other immune cells have been explored as carriers for delivering NPs to the tumor site. These cells possess inherent tropism for GBM and can be genetically modified or loaded with NPs to enhance their therapeutic efficacy. 75 he combination of NP-based drug delivery systems with cell-based carriers not only improves the delivery of therapeutic agents but also offers additional advantages such as immunomodulation, tumor targeting, and the potential for personalized medicine. 14 The use of genetically modified cells or the engineering of living cells with functionalized NP provides exciting avenues for tailored and targeted therapies. In recent years, the development of NP based combination therapy approaches has gained significant attention in the treatment of cancer. 16,166",

            "text": "Polysaccharide coatings can help to overcome physical and physiological barriers to drug delivery. These coatings can protect the drug from enzymatic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract when orally administered. They can also enhance drug penetration through biological barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier or mucosal barriers, by modulating the surface properties of the drug delivery system. Polysaccharide coatings can be combined with other drug delivery systems, such as nanoparticles or microparticles, to enhance their properties and functionality. This combination allows for synergistic effects, such as improved stability, controlled release, and targeted delivery. The coating can provide an additional layer of protection and enhance the overall performance of the drug delivery system. Despite these efforts, studies still need to investigate the constraints of thin films, including inadequate drug loading capacity for highly potent drugs administered at elevated doses and their hygroscopic properties that demand careful preservation. \n\nAlso, the biointegration still remains a challenge. Hence, developing new methods to enhance the osseointegration of medical coated devices, including novel macroscopic designs and surface modifications, is crucial. Further research required to enhance the performance of polysaccharide-based coatings, with a focus on improving the bond strength and interface between the coating and surface of medical devices. By manipulating the composition and fabrication methods, polysaccharide-based thin films can be designed to meet specific drug delivery requirements for various applications. It is important to prioritize the development and implementation of specialized coatings that are customized for each patient, as this will ensure the continued success of current commercial products in the long term.",

            "text": "In the field of AD treatment, biomembrane nanoparticles have emerged as promising drug delivery systems, offering distinct advantages over other types of carriers. These nanoparticles are derived from natural biomembranes and possess the ability to mimic components found in vivo. As a result, they exhibit inherent biocompatibility and safety for human use. For instance, liposomes have been shown to enhance drug solubility, permeability, and bioavailability. Similarly, HDL nanoparticles demonstrate excellent biocompatibility. Cell-derived nanoparticles, on the other hand, offer stability, non-toxicity, and the potential for personalization based on the patient's cell membrane source. These unique properties make them highly desirable as drug carriers. This review article aims to provide an overview of the advancements made in the utilization of both synthetic and natural biomembrane nanoparticles, such as liposomes, HDL, cell membranebased nanoparticles, and extracellular vesicles (EVs), as drug carriers for the treatment of AD. By exploring the progress in this field, we aim to shed light on the potential of these nanoparticles for effective drug delivery in AD therapy. \n\nBy encapsulating drugs within their lipid bilayer or phospholipid structure, biomembrane nanoparticles facilitate transport across the BBB and enable targeted drug delivery to the CNS for AD treatment. Some nanoparticles may face challenges related to biosafety, drug-loading capacity, BBB penetration, and targeting ability. These limitations can be addressed through structural adjustments or surface modifications, such as composition ratio tuning, targeting ligand modification, lipid modification, charge modification, magnetic modification, and other strategies. These modified biomembrane nanoparticles can cross the BBB via receptor-mediated transcytosis, carrier-mediated transcytosis, adsorption-mediated transcytosis, etc., delivering drugs to target various AD pathological mechanisms like A\u03b2 amyloid deposition, tau protein phosphorylation, and neurocholinergic disorders. The combination therapy of targeting multiple pathological mechanisms simultaneously shows potential for improving clinical symptoms in AD patients.",

As a pivotal strategy for drug delivery, the development of materials that can penetrate biological barriers and efficiently deliver drugs to the targeted disease site holds significant promise for therapeutic effects. Certain NPHM-based nanoparticles have demonstrated the remarkable ability to penetrate biological barriers, even without requiring the artificial modification of ligands on their surfaces. Concurrently, numerous studies have highlighted the therapeutic benefits of NHMP in addressing a wide range of related conditions, encompassing brain diseases [233] (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, [234] Multiple Sclerosis, [235] Parkinson's disease, [236] Stroke, [237] Gliom [238] ), intestinal diseases [239] (e.g., acute colitis, [240] ulcerative colitis, [162] diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome [157a] ), ophthalmic diseases [241] (e.g., glaucoma [242] ),and others. While the exploration of NPHM selfassembling into supramolecular bioactivities for barrier penetration and disease therapy is still in its nascent stages, this section underscores the immense potential of such materials to emerge as dual-functional entities, capable of both barrier permeation and targeted disease treatment (Figure 13f).",

For example, blood-brain barrier permeability and integrity may differ depending on the drug(s) abused and the duration of drug use [170], generating additional opportunities or barriers for nanomedicine products.\n\nTo move the field forward, more testing and validation is needed using clinically relevant routes of administration (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, intranasal, intrathecal) in sophisticated SUD models (e.g., operant self-administration, reinstatement, behavioral economic procedures). Additionally, SUD researchers should determine what surface modifications to nanoparticles may increase cell type and/or tissue-specific uptake. Such an approach has the potential to limit side effects following systemic administration. As sustained release nanoformulations are a proven strategy to increase compliance and efficacy in SUD patients, researchers should also identify other small moleculesbased therapies that may benefit from nanoparticle delivery systems. Finally, SUD researchers are encouraged to closely examine what nanoparticle delivery strategies have had success in other neurological models and investigate whether similar formulations have potential usefulness in SUD. Continued efforts to address these questions may reveal promising nanotherapeutic avenues for SUD.",

            "text": "Glioma is a common malignant tumor [1]. Unfortunately, due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB), most therapeutic drugs are not able to cross these physiological and metabolic barriers into the brain [2][3][4][5]. Methods that can make drugs enter the brain parenchyma through the BBB in order to reduce the systemic toxicity of drugs and play a therapeutic role need to be further researched [6]. The nano-drug delivery system (NDDS) has several advantages, including prolonging drug circulation time and improving drug-specific distribution. There has been significant progress made in the treatment of cancer, as well as other major diseases, and is one of the most promising areas to emerge in drug discovery [7][8][9]. However, the complexity of the drug loading process and nanomaterial synthesis causes poor stability and reproducibility of NDDS, as well as low drug loading, which is not conducive to the clinical transformation of a nanometer drug delivery system [10]. In addition, some NDDS are able to be easily recognized and cleared via the reticuloendothelial system (RES) of the human immune system after the medication is delivered into the blood. Furthermore, the nonspecific proteins and other biological macromolecules in the body fluid can spontaneously cover the protein crown formed on the surface of nanoparticles, which alters its surface properties, interfere with the interaction between nanoparticles and biological systems, and accelerate the elimination of NDDS from the immune system [11][12][13]. Significant tumor heterogeneity and intratumoral environment greatly impair the ability of nanomedicines to accumulate through the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effects), which further affects the therapeutic efficacy of the nanomedicine delivery systems [14,15]. \n\nIn recent years, researchers have attempted to construct biomimetic drug-delivery systems (BDDSs) that were combined with nanoparticles and biomimetic materials.",

            "text": "Metallic nanoparticles, also known as inorganic nanoparticles, offer several advantages over organic nanoparticles, primarily in terms of superior physical stability. 130 Despite being metal-based, their small size and unique properties make them biocompatible for medical applications in humans. Their nanoscale dimensions also confer hydrophilic characteristics, enhancing solubility in aqueous environments. This increased solubility is primarily due to the large surface area of the nanoparticles, which promotes better interaction with water molecules. 131 Metallic nanoparticles are emerging as highly effective drug delivery systems for brain applications, as their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has become a key focus in cognitive impairment treatments. 132 These nanoparticles not only act as carriers but, in some cases, also provide therapeutic effects due to their metal composition. 131 To date, at least seven types of metals have been successfully developed into metallic nanoparticles for drug delivery aimed at improving cognitive function (Table 3). \n\nEvidence indicates that magnesium and zinc at the nanoscale can effectively serve as drug carriers. 133 Using green synthesis or biogenic methods, these metals can be administered to brain cells while simultaneously delivering Datura alba leaf extract as a therapeutic agent. This combination exhibits a mutualistic relationship: magnesium and zinc nanoparticles enhance the solubility and act as carriers for Datura alba leaves, while the extract provides physical protection to the nanoparticles during delivery, ensuring high bioavailability in the brain and supplying essential minerals for brain cell activity. Similar approaches have been successfully employed by Qiao et al and Baraka et al 134,135 Qiao et al utilized the biogenic method to deliver Lactobacillus casei with selenium nanoparticles, 134 while Baraka et al used cerium oxide nanoparticles for the delivery of Carissa carandas extract. 135 esides biogenic synthesis, metallic nanoparticles can also be produced through wet chemistry methods for phytoconstituent delivery. This approach typically follows a bottom-up strategy, where nanoparticle components are first synthesized at the molecular scale. 143 After all components interact at this level, physical treatments are applied to form nanoparticles composed of these molecular structures.",

The BBB is essential to maintain the microenvironment necessary for a suitable neuronal function. To this aim, the BBB is formed by the microvascular endothelium of the brain whose functions, together with some cells such as astrocytes, generate a barrier that separates circulating blood from brain nervous tissue [40].\n\nThe improvement of drug delivery to the brain through SLNs is based in the ability of these nanoparticles to stabilize molecules and to increase their bioavailability and permeability. In treatments targeting the central nervous system, the stability of a compound in plasma is essential to maintain an acceptable concentration in order to achieve the desired pharmacological effect. SLNs improve drug bioavailability, allowing the dose that reaches the brain to be higher in comparison to the administration of the free drug. SLNs can also act as vehicles that interact with the barrier, therefore favoring the penetration of drugs that initially could not cross it [41].\n\nAlthough SLNs enhance drug delivery through the BBB, other strategies based on these nanoparticles could bypass this barrier. This could be achieved by drug administration via nasal or intranasal route, exploiting a nose-to-brain drug delivery path. Nasal administration is a simple method, which would not cause as much disturbs on patients as, for instance, the parenteral route. The optimum nose-to-brain transport occurs through the olfactory epithelium, reaching the olfactory bulb and then the central nervous system [42], and there is evidence reporting that SLNs properly carry out this transport [43].\n\nFinally, there are also barriers against the systemic use of SLNs themselves. For instance, the reticuloendothelial system represents a significant limitation for nanocarriers, since it implies their elimination from blood circulation. The mechanism consists of coating the nanoparticles by plasma components such as albumin or immunoglobulin G, leading to their fast elimination",

            "text": "Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and fatal brain cancer, characterized by a high growth rate, invasiveness, and treatment resistance. The presence of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and blood\u2013brain tumor barrier (BBTB) poses a challenging task for chemotherapeutics, resulting in low efficacy, bioavailability, and increased dose-associated side effects. Despite the rigorous treatment strategies, including surgical resection, radiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide, overall survival remains poor. The failure of current chemotherapeutics and other treatment regimens in glioblastoma necessitates the development of new drug delivery methodologies to precisely and efficiently target glioblastoma. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems offer a better therapeutic option in glioblastoma, considering their small size, ease of diffusion, and ability to cross the BBB. Liposomes are a specific category of nanoparticles made up of fatty acids. Furthermore, liposomes can be surface-modified to target a particular receptor and are nontoxic. This review discusses various methods of liposome modification for active/directed targeting and various liposome-based therapeutic approaches in the delivery of current chemotherapeutic drugs and nucleic acids in targeting the glioblastoma and tumor microenvironment.",

            "text": "SLM also acts on the CNS by suppressing neuroinflammation, attenuating brain damage, and ameliorating cognitive deficits in various models of neurological disorders [19][20][21]. Despite sharing the immense neurotherapeutic potential of SLM, its clinical applicability has been limited due to poor aqueous solubility (0.04 mg/mL) and oral bioavailability (23-47%) [22]. In addition, SLM suffers from first-pass metabolism. In the past two decades, the nanotechnology approach has been extensively used to increase the drugs' solubility and permeability. Furthermore, it was reported that nanotechnology has no effect on the inherent properties of medicinal compounds. The current study was designed to develop micro-SLM formulations in order to enhance the therapeutic potential of the drug. \n\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) continues to be the most difficult barrier to cross for brain medication bioavailability. Efflux transporters, like P-glycoprotein (P-gp), are found in the endothelial cells that make up the BBB. This means that many lipophilic compounds, like potential therapeutic agents, cannot pass through the BBB. Due to the critical importance of effective drug delivery to the brain, a variety of approaches have been evaluated to minimize the effects of the BBB, including the use of prodrugs, inhibiting efflux transporters, disrupting the endothelial tight junctions that, along with the cell membrane, form the physical barrier, and nasal administration. \n\nThe high permeability of nasal mucosa and broad surface area allows for a quick onset of the therapeutic effect of the drug. The low metabolic milieu of the snout has the ability to overcome the constraints of the oral route and emulate the advantages of intravenous administration. Furthermore, nasal administration reduces the lag time associated with oral drug delivery and has the fewest negative systemic effects. The ability to target the central nervous system without passing through the BBB is an intriguing advantage of nasal medication administration.",

This phenomenon of BBB is a major limiting factor of the absorption of drugs within the brain tissue.

Furthermore, the presence of surfactant over nanoparticles has also demonstrated increased uptake of the drugs. Polysorbate 80 coated solid lipid nanoparticles have shown significantly better uptake of drugs compared with other formulation. Pharmacokinetic parameters like increased values of AUC and MRT have highlighted the important of surfactant coating over nanoparticle surface. The concentration of drug in the brain was significantly higher in case of polysorbate-80 coated nanoparticles as compared to TMZ solution & simple TMZ SLNs.

Therefore, employing NCs for encapsulation facilitates the traversal across the plasma membrane, 139,140 reaching intracellular target sites. \n\n3][144] This modification significantly extends the drug's half-life in the blood. The primary intracellular barrier during delivery is the endosome/lysosome system. Functionally modified nanocarriers utilize mechanisms like the proton sponge effect to disrupt, destabilize, or fuse with the lysosomal membrane, thereby preventing drug degradation or inactivation in the presence of various enzymes and acidic conditions, as shown in Figure 9. \n\nMore fragile or functionally critical organs often develop specific barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) safeguarding the central nervous system, the blood-testis barrier, and the placental barrier, as depicted in Figure 10. The BBB, in particular, poses a significant challenge due to its highly selective nature. The tight junctions of its endothelial cells, reinforced by the actions of astrocytes and pericytes, greatly hinder the delivery of pharmaceuticals to the central nervous system. 145 However, effective strategies can circumvent the BBB, such as surface modifications designed based on the transference of transferrin (Tf) across the BBB. 146,147 Studies indicate that carbon-based nanomaterials (NMs) can cross the BBB through the facilitative actions of the olfactory mucosa and nerves, but this comes with a concomitant increase in potential risks. 148",

            "text": "][13][14] The human brain is protected by a network of capillaries and tissues forming the BBB, which protects the brain from harmful endogenous and exogenous substances or bacteria. Substances that need to enter the brain should be hydrophobic with a molecular size of ,400 Da or be able to enter via active efflux transporters. 15 Permeability through the BBB relies on drug hydrophobicity. There is a direct relation with lipid solubility and BBB permeability for parameters such as increased logarithm of octanol/water partition coefficient. Another way for passing into the brain is via delivery systems that enhance drug passage through the blood-central nervous system barrier. Recently, amphiphilic block copolymers gained significant importance in this way due to their characteristics as stable, self-assembled, and nano-range-sized structures. 7][18] Studies have shown improved BBB penetration with a reduction in nanoparticle size. 17,19,20 n addition, shape, charge (zeta potential), and surface modified ligands and PEGylation (steric stabilization) can have a significant effect in crossing BBB. 16,21,22 PMs showed the ability to improve BBB permeability through copolymer interaction with cell membranes that enhance membrane fluidity, inhibit P-glycoprotein and multidrug efflux transporters, deplete cellular ATP, and enhance insulin receptormediated transport. 23,24 sing a PMs formula, the aim of this study was to improve DPX bioavailability and brain delivery in order to enhance the convenience for patients and reduce the medication dependence of patients. A DPX-loaded PM formulation was prepared and evaluated for particle size measurement, morphological characterization using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and performance of an ex vivo diffusion study. In addition, determination of pharmacokinetic parameters in plasma and brain tissues in animal models has been compared with commercial DPX tablets (reference formula). This work is the first step in the development of a DPX PM preparation for improving DPX efficacy.",

            "text": "Even though more than 30 phase-III trials proceeded with the strategy of lowering the A\u03b2 level, none showcased cognitive benefit to AD patients or were harmful to the patients' post clearance of amyloid plaques [9,10]. \n\nDrugs that target AD or PD are needed to deliver across the bloodbrain barrier (BBB) [11,12], which prevents 98% of neuropharmaceuticals from accessing the brain [13]. BBB contains brain capillary endothelial cells connected through tight junctions, which restricts paracellular transport and prevents the brain from harmful stimuli [14,15,16]. The degradative enzymes present in the BBB can destroy the molecules attempting to cross the layer [17,18]. Non-invasive and bio-compatible treatment strategies are needed to cross BBB and target brain cells, where liposomes are suitable materials due to customized surface functionalization and sustained and targeted delivery [19,20]. The nanomaterial surface modified with brain targeting ligands with rabies virus glycoprotein peptide (RVG) exhibits promising brain targeting to treat PD, AD, and malignancy [21,22,23]. \n\nLiposomes are natural carriers explored for the last three decades for various diseases, including malignancies. The core materials used for liposome fabrication possess the properties such as bio-compatibility, bio-degradability, and low toxicity [24,25]. Liposomes have recently been recognized as carriers to reach the central nervous system (CNS), though their therapeutic potential was proved in 1961 [26]. As a brain targeting and drug delivery system, liposomes provide several advantages, including biocompatibility, highly stable, enhanced peripheral circulation, and easy to attach ligands on the surface of liposomes for receptor-mediated drug delivery system. PEGylation of liposomes enhances the efficacy of encapsulated molecules by reducing the opsonization and RES clearance in vivo. This not only slows drug removal by extending blood circulation and allowing therapeutics to accumulate at the required site, and decreases side effects.",

Nanoparticles differ in physicochemical properties such as their surface morphology (uniform or irregular surface variations), some are amorphous or crystalline with loose or agglomerated features which are either single or multi crystal solids [37]. Nanoparticles have the ability to cross the brain barriers especially the blood brain barrier thereby shielding the encapsulated therapeutic agent and efficiently delivering them to the targeted areas, thus, it is considered suitable for drug delivery systems for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [38]. Nanomaterials are indeed very effective and have potential abilities to alter and modify a drug's mechanisms of action, bone reinforcement, DNA structure probes, tissue engineering, drug and gene delivery, protein detection and tumor destruction, molecular imaging, diagnostics, regenerative medicine, pharmaceutical sciences, engineering and industrial chemistry [39].",

            "text": "In contrast, the distribution of free POH to organs such as the lungs, kidneys, liver, and spleen was more pronounced, indicating that NLCs displayed enhanced selectivity for brain delivery. This was evidenced by the AUC results (Table 4), where NLCs exhibited a higher accumulation of the drug in the brain while the free drug showed higher distribution to nontarget tissues, such as liver, lungs, kidneys, and spleen. Furthermore, the plasma and brain half-life (T 1  2 ) was prolonged in animals treated with NLCs, reinforcing the notion of sustained release mediated by these nanostructures and suggesting a prolonged therapeutic effect. These findings underscore the advantageous characteristics of NLCs in terms of improved tissue selectivity, extended drug release, and potential for enhanced therapeutic outcomes. \n\nThe precise mechanism underlying the transport of drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) mediated by nanoparticles remains to be fully elucidated. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed to account for this phenomenon. These include the small size of nanoparticles, which provides a large surface area, as well as the lipophilic nature of NLCs. These factors enhance the interaction and prolonged contact time between the particles and the BBB, facilitating the transport of drugs to the brain by establishing a concentration gradient. The lipophilic properties of lipid nanoparticles enable their passage across the BBB through various transport pathways, such as paracellular, transcellular, transcytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis [51,52]. Further investigations are needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the intricate mechanisms involved in lipid nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery to the brain. \n\nSeveral studies have highlighted the role of polysorbate-80 in brain targeting, as it exerts specific effects on membrane fluidity, enhances interaction with the BBB, and inhibits efflux pumps like P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expressed in brain endothelial cells. These actions contribute to increased brain delivery of nanoparticles. Another significant mechanism involves the covalent association of polysorbate-80 with apolipoprotein E in the bloodstream.",

As results showed from the systemic circulation, the introduction of FR\u03b1 and FA to the surface of nanoparticles promote brain accumulation. \n\nMembrane coating for brain targeting Recently, cell membranes as a new root of materials have gained wide focus. They have unique characteristics coming from their parent cells, including the natural functionalities and transmitting information networks that could conquer many obstacles confronted in vivo. 23 ][194] Red blood cells, or erythrocytes, have been exploited as delivery systems due to the advantages of prolonging the life span of drugs in circulation and preventing drugs from immune clearance for many years. 195 They are easy to obtain and have uniformed size and shape. CD47 proteins rich on the red cell membrane ensure red cell membrane-coated systems can circulate almost 100-120 days without being cleared by macrophages. 196 Lu et al. used a facile method of avidin-biotin chemistry to modify the red blood cell membrane with CDX peptide, which shows high bond towards nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. 197 They demonstrated successful preparation of the modified blood cell membranecoated systems and loading of DOX. And they verified the red cell membrane coating could improve the circulation time of the systems and locate them close to tumor vessels. Both targeting and therapeutic efficiency studies in cells and in animals illustrated that red blood cell membrane-peptide-coated systems not only had the capability to traverse the BBB, displaying exceptional brain targeting effect, but also could release DOX and prolong the survival of mice. Shi's group developed a biomimetic nanoparticles by modifying angiopep-2 to the surface of red blood cell membranes to camouflage polymer which was pHsensitive and coload with anti-cancer drug DOX and BBB regulator lexiscan (Fig. 4b-d). 198 The system with low immunogenicity and systemic toxicity improved blood cycle time and tumor accumulation in U87MG glioblastoma tumor-bearing nude mice. \n\nBrain tumor cell membrane, originated from brain tumor cells, tend to have homotypic targeting, long-time circulation, and BBB crossing abilities. 199",

These modifications enhance the targeting of particles to specific cells, 1478 increasing cellular uptake and, consequently, drug efficacy, as illustrated in Figure 3C. There are primarily two methods for active targeting modifications: one involves the direct modification by covalently bonding ligands to drug carriers with active functional groups; 97 the other uses an indirect modification method where positively charged ligands are inserted into the membrane, 98 as shown in Figure 3D. \n\nLi et al 99 modified poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers with transferrin and tamoxifen for the treatment of gliomas. The transferrin ligand enables the drug delivery system to cross the blood-brain barrier, while the tamoxifen ligand, targeting modifications, allows the delivery system to further accumulate in the tumor region once inside the brain. This dual-targeting approach not only improves drug efficacy but also reduces toxicity to normal cells, as depicted in Figure 3E. Zhao et al 100 designed dendritic poly-L-lysine (DGL) nanoparticles modified with placental-like chondroitin sulfate A-binding peptides (plCSA-BP) to deliver HDZK-BYSB107 and Lingzhi red pigment (DGL/CSA-PNPs). The plCSA-BP specifically binds to chondroitin sulfate A, highly expressed in the trophoblast of the placenta, enabling DGL/CSA-PNPs to accumulate in choriocarcinoma tissues, thereby achieving effective tumor suppression.",

            "text": "Advances in treatment of neurodegenerative disease have been greatly hindered due to the crucial, but obstructive, blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents majority of therapeutic drugs from entering the brain parenchyma through systemic circulation 1 . Current methods of drug delivery to the brain, such as direct injection, convection-enhanced delivery and osmotic BBB disruption, are targeted but highly invasive, making them non-ideal for chronic administration 2 . Noninvasive techniques such as molecular modification of drugs and formulation of brain-penetrating nanoparticles offer a safer alternative, but do not provide a targeted effect within the brain 3,4 . One such noninvasive drug delivery technique that has gained attention is intranasal (IN) delivery 5 . \n\nIN administration of drugs for systemic delivery has been used successfully in many clinical applications, such as influenza vaccine delivery 6 , but recently has generated interest for delivery to the central nervous system (CNS). IN delivery has been shown capable of allowing molecules direct and fast access to the brain, circumventing the BBB 7 . Once absorbed across the nasal epithelium, IN delivered drugs are transported along the olfactory and trigeminal nerves, which innervate the olfactory bulb and the brainstem, respectively 8 . Distribution of molecules to the rest of the CNS is transported along the cerebral perivascular space via convective transport such as bulk flow, through a phenomenon known as the \"perivascular pump\" 9,10 . IN delivery offers a simple, fast, and noninvasive drug delivery method that can be easily implemented and applied for chronic administration. Nevertheless, IN delivery has its own shortcomings including low delivery efficiency due to mucosal clearance and nasal absorption, and rapid widespread distribution throughout the brain, resulting in non-focal delivery 11,12 . \n\nTo overcome the shortcomings of IN delivery, some groups have focused on enhancing delivery efficiency across the nasal epithelium. The use of nanoparticles 13 , cell-penetrating peptides 14 , and gels 15 has been investigated as formulations to carry biologics of interest for increased drug uptake and decreased mucosal clearance in the nasal passages.",

In the current world, nanoparticles have gained attention due to their effective use in the field of medicine, specifically in therapeutics and diagnosis [93]. A broad range of materials can be used to synthesize nanoparticles including metals, polymers, or carbon sources. The high effectiveness of nanoparticles is associated with their size, surface-tovolume ratio, and shape. Moreover, these properties can be enhanced by attaching various capping and stabilizing molecules to the surface of nanoparticles [94]. \n\nCurrently, nanomaterials including quantum dots, nanotubes, nanoparticles, and nanofibrils have broad-spectrum applications in the field of medicine such as in bioimaging, drug delivery, and biosensors. Neuro-nanomedicine is a newly emerging field in nanotechnology in which nanoparticles are engineered to treat neurodegenerative diseases [95,96]. Nanotechnology aims to engineer nanoparticles in such a way that they act as nanoscale devices to interact with biological entities at a molecular state. The engineered nanodevices aim to interact, trigger and generate a response from the target cells or tissues having the least side effects. The major hurdle in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease is that some drugs cannot penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which affects the efficacy of drugs; therefore, some nanoparticles are designed in such a way that they can easily cross the blood-brain barrier to reach the specific target site in the cells [97,98]. Presently, the major focus is on the development of nanoparticles that are easily localized intracellularly or outreach to target extracellular molecules such as amyloid-beta plaques in AD [99]. \n\nSome of the nanoparticles used in the treatment of autoimmune neurodegenerative diseases are mentioned below",

CSNPs in oral delivery systems can impact drugs' distributions through various mechanisms, enhancing their effectiveness at the target site while minimizing exposure to non-target tissues [106]. \n\nOne mechanism by which CSNPs improve drug distribution is through their ability to encapsulate drugs and protect them from degradation [100]. By encapsulating drugs within NPs, the stability of the drug is increased, preventing premature degradation in the GI tract. This protection ensures that a higher concentration of the active drug reaches the systemic circulation, allowing for improved distribution to target tissues [23,106]. \n\nMoreover, CSNPs can be designed to exhibit specific surface properties that promote targeted delivery to desired sites within the body. Surface modifications and functionalization of NPs enable active targeting, allowing them to selectively accumulate in specific tissues or cells. Ligands or targeting moieties can be attached to the nanoparticle surface, which interacts with specific receptors or markers present in the target tissues. This active targeting approach enhances drug distribution to the desired site, maximizing the drug's therapeutic effect while reducing exposure to non-target tissues. This targeted drug delivery strategy improves drug distribution efficiency and can potentially enhance treatment outcomes [36]. \n\nCSNPs offer passive targeting capabilities in addition to active targeting. Their small size enables effective tissue penetration, reaching sites inaccessible to larger drug molecules. The positively charged surfaces of CSNPs interact with cell membranes or extracellular matrices, facilitating accumulation in specific tissues or cells. This passive targeting mechanism improves drug distribution and concentration at the target site, enhancing therapeutic efficacy [81,82,100].",

            "text": "The other examined approach is focused on enhancing the bioavailability of therapeutics in the brain tissue by facilitating their way through the blood-brain barrier. Those include increasing compounds liposolubility by liposome encapsulation and modulating the blood-brain barrier itself by inhibiting efflux pumps, increasing blood-brain permeability with bradykinin receptors adenosine receptors activation, treating tight junctions physically, for example, with ultrasounds or osmotic agents [53][54][55]. Currently, engineered nanomaterials can encapsulate therapeutic compounds in a shell with programmable size, charge, and surface biochemistry, which allows for exploiting blood-brain barrier transportation pathways [56]. A variety of nanocarriers, such as polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, dendrimers, or inorganic nanoparticles, have been formulated to overcome BBB and subjected to clinical trials [57]. Also, molecular carriers like cryptands, calixarenes, cyclophanes, spherands, cyclodextrins, and crown ethers, which can form intermolecular interactions with small molecules based on the \"host-guest\" relation, have been investigated as potential devices allowing for effective drug delivery [58]. Those types of supramolecular structures based on cyclodextrin cages, with the proven ability to cross the BBB, could be utilized as potential carriers of new aziridine-hydrazide hydrazone derivatives (ARA12 and ARA13) [59]. Presented compounds have the right substituents and are the appropriate size to form hydrogen bonds and adapt to such molecular carriers. An alternative option is linking the tested compounds to BBB-penetrating peptide shuttles so as to create peptide-drug conjugates able to get through the BBB by using the peptides with BBB-penetrating properties as vectors to deliver small therapeutic molecules to brain parenchyma [60]. This approach will require the use of a suitable ester linker but is still possible. \n\nAdditionally, the carriers can be modified to selectively target tumoral cells in order to minimize the undesired side effects of injuring the non-neoplastic microenvironment.",

            "text": "This is basically an extremely selective structural and biochemical barrier that preserves the intracerebral environment supplying blood (nutrients) to the brain and protecting against the environment [18]. It plays a crucial role in protecting the brain parenchyma and provides a significant hindrance to the entry of exogenous compounds into the CNS [19]. The presence of the BBB protects the brain, maintains neuronal activity and protects the brain's homeostasis, but simultaneously poses a challenge for drug distribution across this barrier. Many traditional neurotherapeutic agents are unable to cross the BBB in appreciable concentrations, thus limiting the brain's uptake [20]. There are several strategies such as chemical modifications of the drugs (for improving their lipophilicity), use of molecular tools to bind the drugs to small immunoglobulins, and nanotechnology using vesicles, liposomes and micelles are employed to deliver drugs to the brain. More research has been conducted to develop novel therapeutics for the effective treatment of diseases affecting the CNS [21]. Recently, lipid-based nanocarriers have been used in key strategies for CNS drug delivery. These types of delivery systems improve the permeability of active agents with enhanced half-lives and stability by maintaining the required drug levels in the systemic circulation. Additionally, these systems can either trigger or control the rate of release of therapeutic ingredients in the blood by attaining the requirement of the patients. \n\nThe burgeoning application of lipid-based nanocarriers in pharmaceutical formulations for the delivery of diversified therapeutic agents is gaining momentum over the last decades [22]. They have the capability of permeating the therapeutic loads through the skin as well as the BBB owing to their lipophilic nature. These nanocarriers significantly augment the solubility (lipophilic as well as hydrophilic agents) and permeability, and hence the bioavailability of the loaded agents. Nanocarriers, owing to their small particle size, high surface-volume ratio, unique physicochemical properties and capability to cross different biological barriers, are gaining considerable interest in pharmaceutical research [23,24].",

Other than improving the aqueous solubility and bioavailability of drugs, a nanoparticle-based delivery system also may overcome physiological barriers [94,95]. Polyphenols have low bioavailability in the brain due to their limited capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier. Hence, the use of polymeric-based nanotechnology to deliver natural polyphenolic compounds across the blood-brain barrier seems to be a promising strategy for neurodegenerative diseases' prevention and treatment. \n\nStudies have demonstrated that curcumin-loaded nanoparticles were an effective and attractive treatment for brain diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cancer. Szymusiak et al. [96] proved that the incorporation of highly hydrophobic curcumin into stable polymeric nanoparticles, PLGA could enhance its oral absorption. Pharmacokinetic analysis after oral delivery of nano-curcumin demonstrated that the dose requirement was reduced approximately 2-fold to achieve comparable plasma and central nervous system tissue concentrations in mice when compared to non-encapsulated curcumin. \n\nMore recently, the effect of PLGA nanoparticles loaded with curcumin on neuronal differentiation and neuronal stem cells' proliferation were explored in a study by Tiwari et al. [97]. Curcumin-encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles were shown to potently induce neuronal stem cells' proliferation and neuronal differentiation in vitro and in adult rats' hippopocampus and subventricular zone, as compared to uncoated curcumin. Based on transmission electron microscopy analysis, the PLGA-nanoencapsulated form of curcumin induced neurogenesis by internalization into the hippocampus.",

            "text": "Many therapeutic drugs are excluded from entering the brain, due to their lack of transport through the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) [115]. The development of new strategies for enhancing drug delivery to the brain is fundamental in diagnostics and therapeutics of central nervous diseases (CNS). Most strategies to transport drugs inside the CNS cause disruption of the anatomical texture of the BBB, therefore impairing its natural function; as a consequence, effective delivery approaches should be cautiously assessed considering their impact on the overall protective function of the BBB [116]. Targeted delivery of a therapeutic cargo to the intended site of action in the brain appears to be one of the most promising non-invasive approach to overcome the BBB, combining the advantages of brain targeting, high incorporation capacity, reduction of side effects and circumvention of the multidrug efflux system [117][118][119][120].\n\nPolystyrene nanoparticles (NPs) decorated on their surface by gH625 showed that the uptake of NPs with gH625 by brain endothelial cells was greater than that of the NPs without the peptide and functionalized NPs were free to move intracellularly [62]. Most importantly, gH625 decreased NP intracellular accumulation as large aggregates and enhanced the NP BBB crossing. The surface functionalization with gH625 may change NPs fate and provides a good strategy for the design of promising carriers to deliver drugs across the BBB for the treatment of brain diseases.\n\nWhether multifunctional nanosystems, designed and tested in vitro, are able to properly work in vivo into mammalian hosts, is not fully granted. To address this issue, in vivo studies are necessary, thus validating design strategies and facilitating optimization and further functionalization. Although numerous studies showed that gH625 is an efficient carrier for bioactive cargoes in vitro [121], these results did not guarantee that it can be developed into a useful pharmaceutical delivery platform. The ability of gH625 to cross the BBB in vivo was also recently evaluated [122]. gH625 was administered in vivo to rats and its presence in the liver and in the brain was detected. Within 3.5 h from its i.v. administration, gH625",

Therapeutic (macro)molecules are not able to transit through the BBB in their free form. This limitation is bypassed by apolipoprotein E (ApoE)\u2010functionalized polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) that are able to transport drugs (e.g., dalargin, loperamide, doxorubicin, and nerve growth factor) across the BBB via low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor\u2010mediated transcytosis. Coating with polysorbate 80 or poloxamer 188 facilitates ApoE adsorption onto polymeric NPs enabling recognition by LDL receptors of brain endothelial cells. This effect is even enhanced when NPs are directly coated with ApoE without surfactant anchor. Similarly, covalent coupling of ApoE to NPs that bear reactive groups on their surface leads to significantly improved brain uptake while avoiding the use of surfactants.

            "text": "Due to their biocompatibility, nontoxicity, and surface conjugation properties, nanomaterials are effective nanocarriers capable of encapsulating chemotherapeutic drugs and facilitating targeted delivery across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Although research on nanoparticles for brain cancer treatment is still in its early stages, these systems hold great potential to revolutionize drug delivery. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common and lethal brain tumors, and its heterogeneous and aggressive nature complicates current treatments, which primarily rely on surgery. One of the significant obstacles to effective treatment is the poor penetration of drugs across the BBB. Moreover, GBM is often referred to as a \u201ccold\u201d tumor, characterized by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and minimal immune cell infiltration, which limits the effectiveness of immunotherapies. Therefore, developing novel, more effective treatments is critical to improving the survival rate of GBM patients. Current strategies for enhancing treatment outcomes focus on the controlled, targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to GBM cells across the BBB using nanoparticles. These therapies must be designed to engage specialized transport systems, allowing for efficient BBB penetration, improved therapeutic efficacy, and reduced systemic toxicity and drug degradation. Lipid and inorganic nanoparticles can enhance brain delivery while minimizing side effects. These formulations may include epitopes\u2014small antigen fragments that bind directly to free antibodies, B cell receptors, or T cell receptors\u2014that interact with transport systems and enable BBB crossing, thereby boosting therapeutic efficacy. Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs), such as liposomes, niosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), are among the most promising delivery systems due to their unique properties, including their size, surface modification capabilities, and proven biosafety.

            "text": "Nanotechnology can provide many advantages to modern medicine. This includes highly specific targeted drug delivery, better biocompatibility, increased therapeutic efficacy, reduced toxicity, multi-functionalization, long circulation time, and controlled drug release at the targeted site (Choi and Han, 2018;Padmanabhan et al., 2020). Possible approaches to treating PD can be through inhibition of \u03b1-syn expression, inhibition of aggregation process, immunotherapy, and the promotion of \u03b1-syn degradation. Table 1 lists the different nanocarriermediated strategies of targeting PD.\n\nA major challenge in designing a therapeutic strategy for the brain is the crossing of blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is a semi-permeable membrane that selectively restricts the diffusion of foreign materials from the peripheral blood to the CNS (Daneman and Prat, 2015). Many drugs have shown promise in PD treatment but failed to cross the BBB. The inability to cross BBB prevents the drugs from reaching their target sites and an adequate accumulation of drugs at the sites to exert significant therapeutic effect. The development of nanocarriers may help in overcoming this challenge. Nanocarriers can be functionalized to cross the BBB, target desired cells, and allow a sustained release of therapeutics to specific brain targets . Moreover, nanocarriers can protect encapsulated drugs from premature degradation to maximize the drug therapeutic efficacy. Hence, an increasing number of nanocarriers have been approved for clinical uses (Anselmo and Mitragotri, 2019). Several studies have successfully used nanocarriers to improve the delivery of PD therapeutic drugs and dopamine across BBB (Barcia et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2018;Jahansooz et al., 2020). The use of nanocarriers was reported to not only help improve the therapeutic efficacy, but also reduce drug side effects. Although these results are commendable, delivery of PD drugs and dopamine only work to relieve PD symptoms but do not resolve \u03b1-syn aggregation. Considering this, recent studies have turned to the employment of nanocarriers to deliver antioxidants that are capable of inhibiting \u03b1-syn fibrillation and reducing inflammation in the brain.

SLN offers high capacity to the drugs and at the same time avoids drug degradation and releases the impassive drug within tumor cells which is due to the lipid components used for surface coating. Though nanotechnology gained momentum in targeting drugs to brain, several formulations showed reduced presence of drugs in brain which is attributed to swift clearance from reticuloendothelial system. This clearance from reticuloendothelial system consists of opsonization, phagocytosis and reuptake. This could be overtaken by inserting hydrophilic groups at the surface of particles. Such modifications in the formulations of SLN for targeting brain tumor aided to deliver drugs including peptides, cytokines, antibodies and ferromagnetic agents.",

It allows for a targeted drug delivery that improves drug utilization efficiency and reduces adverse drug reactions. Functionalized nanoparticles can also change the mechanism of membrane transport. It can promote the penetration of drugs to biofilm and biological barriers in vivo. Here is described the methods of surface modification/functionalization for targeted delivery and improved penetration. \n\nTargeted delivery is especially an important aspect of using nanoparticles for a drug delivery system. There are two kinds of delivery methods to target particular sites; passive and active [132]. In passive targeting, the designed nanoparticle circulates through the bloodstream and binds to the target site by affinity or is influenced by the environment such as pH, temperature, molecular size and shape [1]. For instance, passive targeting works through the increased permeability and retention effect, promoting the probability for tumor cells to absorb the carrier nanoparticles [133,134]. On the other hand, active targeting has moieties like antibodies and peptides on the surface of nanoparticles to anchor them to the receptor structures expressed at the target site. Ligand-attached nanoparticles have been used to target specific cancer cell lines and deliver anti-cancer agents [135]. For example, hyaluronic acid has been used as a ligand conjugated in several nanocarriers, demonstrated to increase antitumor action against melanoma stem-like cells [136]. \n\nAlso to be considered to promote the efficacy of drug delivery are a number of physiological barriers that limit the delivery of nanoparticles to the desired location. These biological barriers are innately designed to act on the body's defense system, which limits the penetration of foreign materials. The first barrier is the reticuloendothelial system comprised of the liver and spleen that clear particles from the circulation when the nanoparticles are intravenously administrated [137]. The endothelium of the blood vessels into target tissues is another barrier that larger nanoparticles cannot cross under normal healthy conditions.",

            "text": "The penetration of most therapeutics, especially large biomolecules, into the brain is actively blocked by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), making pharmaceutical treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders difficult [1]. Nanoparticles (NPs) are promising tools to solve these unmet therapeutic needs. Drugs encapsulated in nanovesicles, like liposomes, are already used clinically to treat systemic diseases, especially tumors [2]. However, in the case of the CNS, there are not yet NP-formulated drugs available [3]. NPs enhance the crossing of drug molecules through biological barriers while decreasing unwanted side effects via entrapment of the active agent. It needs to be highlighted that encapsulation of drugs by nanoparticles alone is not sufficient for CNS delivery; decoration of the surface of NPs with targeting ligands is necessary. Targeting BBB transporters is a successful strategy to increase brain penetration of biomolecules [4]. A large number of transporters are expressed on the plasma membrane of brain endothelial cells, which exhibit an expression pattern specific for the BBB [5][6][7], and are potential candidates as BBB-targeting ligands for NPs. Tripeptide glutathione (GSH) is one of the most successful BBB-targeting ligands, although its transporter has not been identified. Liposomes targeted with GSH and loaded with doxorubicin cargo were effective in inhibiting tumor growth in a mouse glioma model [8], and these NPs were also investigated in phase I/II clinical trials [9]. \n\nThe biggest superfamily of transporters on brain endothelial cells is that of solute carriers (SLC), which provide nutrients to brain cells [10]. SLCs actively transport well-known therapeutic drugs across the BBB; for example, in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, the LAT1/SLC7A5 transporter carries L-DOPA to the brain [4].",

            "text": "Effective targeting requires primarily an understanding of the physiology and anatomy of the blood-brain barrier. One of the approaches is to modify the surface of the drug-loaded nanoparticle by conjugating it with an antibody that is particularly specific for the brain, eg, the OX26 antibody and the transferrin receptor. The antibody-drug conjugate recognizes a specific ligand (the transferrin receptor in this case) and crosses the blood-brain barrier by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Unfortunately, it is hard to identify specific ligands relative to a target tissue. 132 Antibodies are most promising tools for blood-brain barrier targeting because of their capacity for specific binding. For instance, antibodies targeted to transferrin and insulin receptors can act as transporters across the blood-brain barrier and deposit the drug molecules via receptor-mediated endocytosis. According to the published data, chemotherapeutic drugs like methotrexate and proteins like basic fibroblast growth factor, nerve growth factor, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, are successfully transported into the brain upon conjugation with the transferrin receptor antibody. 133 Several other therapeutics, like nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, are also transported across the blood-brain barrier upon binding with the transferrin receptor antibody. 134,135 Similarly, megalin ligands patented by Starr et al are specific to the brain and can be used for successful delivery of therapeutics upon surface modification. 136 Another instance of surface modification being used for delivery of radiopharmaceuticals is [ 125 I]-A\u03b2  , the uptake of which is significantly increased upon conjugation with a monoclonal antibody against the human insulin receptor following intravenous administration. 137   peptide specific to the brain invented by Forni et al can also be suitably modified for conjugating with nanodelivery systems and achieving brain-specific delivery. 138 A specific method for delivery of this peptide conjugate was developed by Roberts et al, 139 whereby the peptide intended for delivery was conjugated with a nonpeptide water-soluble polymer.",

            "text": "A good example of such systems is provided by a microfluidic model of the vascular endothelium established by using rat brain endothelial (RBE4) cells to examine cellular adhesion and internalization of different nanoparticle shapes [73]. By flowing spherical and rod-shaped nanoparticles (Fig. 2c) coated with anti-intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-mAb) antibody or immunoglobulin G antibody (IgG) over the surface of the RBE4 monolayers, this study showed enhanced targeting and stronger attachment of nanorods to the endothelium compared to the spherical particles, highlighting the potential of unconventional nanoparticle shapes for more efficient and target-specific drug delivery. \n\nLastly, based on a growing body of evidence showing significant effects of surface chemistry on the behavior of nanoparticles [74,75], microengineers have also begun to explore the use of organ-chips for studying how surface functionalization can be leveraged as a means to enhance nanoparticle delivery. Much of the work in this space has focused on looking into the penetration of nanoparticle drugs across the blood brain barrier (BBB). In one study, Papademetriou et al. created a BBB model by culturing brain microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3) in a microdevice consisting of two overlapping microchannels separated by a porous membrane (Fig. 2d) [76]. This system was used to model transport of liposomal drug nanocarriers engineered with a peptide ligand Angiopep-2 (Ang-2). Interestingly, when liposomes were introduced into the device maintained in static culture conditions, Ang-2-functionalized nanocarriers showed a significantly higher degree of binding to the apical surface of the brain endothelial cells compared to non-functionalized control (Fig. 2d). Under flow conditions, Ang-2 conjugation enhanced the ability of the nanoparticles to penetrate the endothelial monolayer without affecting barrier function. These results were consistent with the previously demonstrated ability of Ang-2 to facilitate delivery of anticancer drugs across the BBB [77,78].",

            "text": "Brain cancer is one of the common types of human cancers, which is known by being a fatal and non-curable disease with poor outcomes. There are various brain tumor treatment options, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. However, these therapies do not have a high survival rate due to drug resistance and the high protection advantage by the blood brain barrier (BBB). BBB is characterized by a very low permeability for biomolecules required to regulate metabolism of the brain due to the presence of tight junctions, efflux transporters, and low enzymatic activity. Although these properties protect the CNS from the bloodstream components, they also limit most effective drugs reaching the CNS, thereby raising challenges of finding drugs and drug delivery systems that can cross the BBB. Nanomedicine can provide fertile grounds for the development of passive and active drug delivery systems that can reach the brain. In nanomedicine, different types of organic and inorganic nanoparticles such as lipid, polymeric, micelles, and metallic nanoparticles could be used for diagnosis, and the delivery of anticancer agents to the brain. In this context, lipid nanoparticles are the most successful drug delivery systems, and are in clinical use due to properties including biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity, and acceptable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties. Indeed, several studies provided proof-of-concept for the ability of lipid nanocarriers to cross the BBB in vivo, thereby confirming the important value of nanomedicine as a treatment strategy for brain cancer.\n\nDespite the potent applications of lipid nanocarriers to reach the brain through crossing the BBB, the strategies and protocols require careful optimization to reach an optimal therapeutic index. First, materials used in formulating lipid nanoparticles should be selected based on the high biocompatibility and low toxicity; thereby not harming normal tissues and the integrity of BBB. Second, lipid nanocarriers should be stable for enough time in the bloodstream to achieve the required task properly. Third, functionalizing the surface of lipid nanoparticles to cross the BBB and reach the brain should be investigated to limit accumulation of",

The CNS is one of the most delicate and sensitive micro environments of the body. It is protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) regulating its homeostasis. Many strategies are currently being required to enhance the delivery of drugs and molecules across the BBB. Generally, the size ranges of nanoparticle which are from 10 to 1000 nm (50-300 nm generally). The use of small particles as drug carriers for targeted delivery has been studied over a long time. Polymeric Nanoparticles have been shown to be promising carrier for the delivery of drugs in the CNS because of their potential both in encapsulating drugs, hence it protects them from excretion and metabolism, and in delivering active agents across the BBB without producing any damage to the barrier. Various polymers have been used and different strategies like surface modification have been used to increase the retention time of nanoparticles. The use of biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) for controlled drug-delivery has shown significant therapeutic potential. The development of other useful polymeric NPs to deliver a spectrum of chemotherapeuticdiagnostic-imaging agents for various applications. Polymeric nanoparticles signify one of the most motivating challenges for the technical world being investigated as drug delivery systems for effective complete -local delivery of therapeutics molecule to the central nervous system.

Lipids are able to cross the blood-brain barrier, and their levels in the brain have been linked with dietary intake. Lipids consumed are bioavailable for cerebral tissue [16]. In neuropharmacology, the bioavailability of drugs is one of the main obstacles identified that needs to be overcome for new drug development [16,62]. \n\nSolid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) are one of the emerging lipid-based drug delivery systems fabricated specifically to target and address the issues with traditional drug delivery systems, such as poor water solubility and bioavailability [63]. This form of delivery system can be modified to target various diseases whilst preserving the active drugs' specificity and potency, using surface modifications and attachment of ligands [7].",

BBB is critical in protecting brain cells from the vascular contents to maintain homeostasis; in contrast, it represents an intense challenge in drug delivery applications. The permeability modulations of BBB can be graded by light-laser intensity [32]. The permeability of BBB is entirely reversible and involves increased paracellular diffusion or opening at the delivered sites without leading to a significant disruption in the structure of neurovascular units of the brain. This strategy allows the delivery and entry of multiple therapeutic agents, such as immunoglobulins and viral gene therapy vectors, cargo-laden liposomes, functionalized nanomaterials, peptide conjugates, and nanomaterials with small molecules [33]. We anticipate this theranostic nanotechnology development might be helpful in tissue regions accessible to novel imaging applications and open novel venues in screening and therapeutic interventions in CNS diseases.",

Surface functionalization of CDs with targeted ligands such as antibodies (site-specific drug delivery) will enable specific recognition and binding to the targeted cells. The ability of CDs to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) of the human body by passive diffusion is utilized in the application of this nano-particle in the case of drug delivery modifications [147].

The use of minute particles as drug carriers for targeted treatment has been studied over a long period of time. A selective accumulation of active substances in target tissues has been demonstrated for certain so-called nanocarrier systems that are administered bound to pharmaceutical drugs. Great expectations are placed on nanocarrier systems that can overcome natural barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and transport the medication directly to the desired tissue and thus heal neurological diseases that were formerly incurable. Polymeric Nanoparticle have been shown to be promising carriers for CNS drug delivery due to their potential both in encapsulating drugs, hence protecting them from excretion and metabolism, and in delivering active agents across the blood \u0096 brain barrier without inflicting any damage to the barrier. Different polymers have been used and different strategies like surface modification have been done to increase the retention time of nanoparticles.

It is composed of tight junctions in brain capillary endothelial cells, which restrict the penetration of compounds into the brain (188). The effectiveness of treatments for various brain-related conditions, such as glioblastoma, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, is reduced by the hindrance due to BBB (93). The size of nanoparticles hinders their passage through the tight junctions between the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus. Later, the surface charge of particles selectively increases the affinity for binding more strongly to negatively charged components on cell membranes and thereby, increasing their uptake and passage through BBB. Also, the presence of efflux pumps on the Blood-Cerebrospinal Fluid Barrier actively pump the drugs and nanoparticles back into the bloodstream or out of the CSF. The Blood-Cerebrospinal Fluid Barrier also regulates the immunological response occuring due to the activation of complement system that prematurely phagocytose the drug before its therapeutic activation precedes in the system. \n\nThe challenge of achieving adequate BBB penetration is particularly significant in the context of treating brain tumors, where the BBB and the blood-tumor barrier (BTB) restrict drug delivery to the tumor site (189). Researchers have been exploring various strategies to enhance BBB penetration for targeted therapeutics distribution in the brain. For instance, the development of engineered extracellular vesicles with specific protein expressions has shown promise in facilitating the delivery of therapeutic agents across the BBB (190). Additionally, the use of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) has been investigated to enhance the passage of drugs through the BBB. These peptides possess the ability to facilitate the penetration of nanocarriers loaded with therapeutic cargo, offering a potential solution to the challenge of limited drug passage across the BBB (191). In the realm of nanomedicine, nanoparticles have emerged as promising carriers for enhancing BBB penetration and improving targeted drug distribution to the brain.",

Lipoproteins enter the blood-brain barrier endothelium through endocytosis via lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and are transcytosed to the brain [120]. Neves et al. prepared resveratrol-loaded SLNs with cetyl palmitate as lipid phase and polysorbate 80 as surfactant and functionalized them with apolipoprotein E (Apo-E) in order to mimic lipoproteins [121]. The functionalization was performed by addition of avidin onto the surface of SLNs, allowing the noncovalent interaction between avidin and biotinylated Apo-E. The results showed a significant increase of resveratrol permeability in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) when encapsulated in functionalized SLNs, suggesting that these nanosystems can be used for the efficient brain delivery of resveratrol [121].",

            "text": "Surface modification of nanoparticles with ligands is widely exploited to target a variety of disorders [36,37] Targeting the brain for treatment of neurological disorders is challenging through the common routes of administration (i.v. and oral) [38,39]. This is owing to the tight structural integrity of the BBB's architectural cells (astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelia). There is an abundant amount of literature that indicates that administration through the intranasal route can bypass the BBB, due to the olfactory and trigeminal nerves, which connect the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity to the brain [40]. In addition to this, the intranasal route is known to be safe and non-invasive compared to other approaches to target the brain such as intracranial injection [41]. Further, most of the pharmaceutical bioactive agents (due to their pharmacokinetic properties) cannot cross the blood barrier by themselves, causing the unmet need for brain targeted delivery systems. Currently, the only approved protein or ligand for brain delivery is the adeno associated virus-based gene therapy for infantile spinal muscular atrophy with single i.v. administration [42]. The success achieved so far marks a path for the development of more effective delivery systems with high efficiency for delivering neurotherapeutics (both drugs and gene) to the brain. Ligand-receptor-based approaches have been explored extensively for effective drug and gene delivery to the brain through BBB [15,43].",

Protein NP were suggested to overcome the limitations of free low-molecular-weight drugs and to cross systemic, microenvironmental and cellular barriers. \n\nAlthough the majority of large blood molecules were prevented from penetration into the brain by the tight junctions in the BBB, the specific and, nonspecific transcytotic mechanisms exist to transport large molecules and complexes across the BBB. The passive penetrations in brains inside leukocytes and the transcellular lipophilic pathway common for lipid agents could be excluded from mechanisms of RhoB-BSA NP localization in the brain. Mechanisms of active NP uptake such as tight junction modifications and modulation, carrier-mediated transcytosis and receptor-mediated transcytosis seem unlikely. Consequently, the protein NP adsorption and unspecific endocytosis with subsequent transcytosis may be responsible for the RhoB-BSA NP distribution in different parts of mouse and rabbit brains (Figures 4 and 5). \n\nNanocarriers can favour the delivery of chemotherapeutics to brain tumours owing to different strategies, including chemical stabilization of the drug in the bloodstream; passive targeting (because of the leaky vascularization at the tumour site); inhibition of drug efflux mechanisms in endothelial and cancer cells; and active targeting by exploiting carriers and receptors overexpressed at the blood-brain tumour barrier. Within this concern, a suitable nanomedicine-based therapy for gliomas should not be limited to cytotoxic agents, but also target the most important pathogenetic mechanisms, including cell differentiation pathways and angiogenesis. Moreover, the combinatorial approach of cell therapy plus nanomedicine strategies can open new therapeutical opportunities.",

            "text": "They have been used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a contrast agent [32,33], cell labeling, tissue repair, gene and drug delivery, hyperthermia [34], and nano-sensors [35]. One of the most promising biomedical applications of SPIONs is drug delivery, thanks to the magnetic response of the iron oxide allowing magnetic targeting, which makes the retention of nanoparticles in the target tissue longer [36]. The most challenging targets for SPIONs are in the brain because of the presence of the BBB, a natural boundary between the neural tissue and the blood circulation, which limits the entrance of most drugs intended for the central nervous system (CNS). Many kinds of nanoparticles, polymeric and inorganic, have been studied for drug delivery across the BBB, however, the advantage of using inorganic nanoparticles (silica, gold, SPIONs, etc.) is the facility in modulating them in terms of shape, size, and surface modification [37]. The surface modification of nanoparticles increases their ability to cross this barrier. Indeed, unlike bare SPIONs, it has been reported that ligand-coated SPIONs or BBB disruption (BBB-targeting peptides, curcumin, polyethylene glycol (PEG)/chitosan, etc.) make them capable of crossing the BBB because they facilitate SPIONs uptake by the endothelial cells via specific receptors [38]. Moreover, the magnetic targeting of SPIONs not only enhances their penetration in brain cells, as has been proved by Chertok et al. on glioma cells [39,40], but also can transiently increase the BBB permeability following from magnetic heating (hyperthermia), as was proved by Tabatabaei et al. for rat brains [41]. The percentage of SPIONs that reach the CNS via the bloodstream has varied from 17 to 30% according to rodent studies [42]. \n\nHerein, we studied the surface modification of SPIONs with a derivative molecule of RSV, used as a therapeutic molecule, for further application in neurodegenerative diseases.",

Since endothelial cells from various locations in the body exhibit unique phenotypes we quantitatively examined the amount of different sized poly(2-hydroxypropylmethacrylamide)-coated gold nanoparticles internalized into primary human dermal endothelial cells or human brain endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and visualized the nanoparticles using light and electron microscopy. Poly(2-hydroxypropylmethacrylamide)-coated gold nanoparticles exhibited high uptake into brain endothelial cells and were used to examine transport mechanisms across the blood-brain barrier using a well-established in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier. Our results demonstrate that 35 nm-sized gold nanoparticles were internalized best into human brain endothelial cells by a flotillin-dependent endocytotic pathway. The uptake into the cells is not correlated with transport across the blood-brain barrier. We demonstrated that the surface modification of gold nanoparticles impacts the internalization process in different cells. In addition, to evaluating toxicity and uptake potential of nanoparticles into cells, the transport properties across cell barriers are important criteria to classify nanoparticle properties regarding targeted delivery of drugs.",

Despite intensive translational research in the last decades, scarce advances in outcome improvement have been achieved up to the present (2,3). Surely many factors associated with the very complex pathophysiology of TBI may have contributed to this lack of success (4,5). However, as for many other neurological diseases, the presence of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) constitutes a major limiting factor (6). The high efficiency of this barrier, required to maintain the homeostasis of the neural tissue and its microenvironment, as well as to protect it against exogenous noxa, makes the BBB an insurmountable obstacle for numerous pharmaceuticals to penetrate the brain parenchyma, thus preventing sufficient drug concentrations reaching the central nervous system (CNS). As a consequence, highly promising agents to treat CNS conditions often fail to show the expected successful outcomes (7)(8)(9). Even though it is well-known that TBI induces BBB disruptions, previous studies have clearly demonstrated that during the evolution of secondary trauma-associated injury mechanisms, BBB dysfunction with increased permeability occurs in phases, alternating with periods in which the BBB permeability remains intact (10)(11)(12). Therefore, it is probable that only drugs with the capability to overcome the BBB and act in both open and closed states of the BBB may provide effective results in the treatment of TBI. \n\nAn innovative and promising strategy to overcome the BBB obstacle has become the use of nanoparticles (NPs) specifically functionalized to cross the barrier and act as drug carriers into the CNS by introducing modifications of their physicochemical surface properties via adsorption or covalent linkage with surfaceactive substances (8,13,14).",

Dendrimer-based nanoparticles, post combination with anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil, gradually release free 5-fluorouracil, 95 reducing adverse drug reactions and presenting broad application prospects as novel nanomaterials. \n\nAddressing the characteristic challenges of poorly soluble drugs, our analysis of nanonization techniques, surface modification technologies, and carrier-mediated tactics concludes that NDDS can precisely enhance the solubility of these drugs. Nanonization techniques break through biological barriers like the blood-brain barrier and nasal transport barriers, thereby improving drug delivery efficiency 101,102 and introducing new administration routes. Surface modification, altering the physicochemical properties of nanoparticle surfaces, enhances cellular targeting and consequently drug utilization. 110 Carrier-mediated technology involves encapsulating poorly soluble substances within high-solubility carriers, leading to cellular uptake via passive diffusion, membrane fusion, and endocytosis. 117 dditionally, NDDS enhance cellular uptake, promote intracellular release, and prevent premature drug metabolism, thus improving bioavailability. Despite challenges in production costs and safety, [119][120][121] nanomaterials possess unique advantageous properties not shared by the majority of other drug delivery materials, 124 promising to overcome the limitations of traditional delivery methods and materials. Notably, NDDS have recently garnered increasing research attention in the medical field. \n\nTraditional drug delivery methods often require frequent or high dosage administration to achieve therapeutic effects, leading to decreased overall efficacy and patient compliance. In contrast, the application of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems is increasingly favored and researched. Studies suggest that controlling the particle size and modifying components within nanoscale drug delivery systems can increase drug solubility, control drug release, prolong circulation time, reduce drug clearance rates, selectively enhance cellular uptake, and minimize adverse reactions, thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes. 181 n terms of drug particle size, the efficiency of drug delivery can be enhanced by controlling the size of the nanoparticles.",

            "text": "There are a number of alterations that may be required for the nanodelivery systems to be more effective. The zeta surface charge is an important parameter for nanoparticle delivery through the BBB, as a study showed that highly positive surface charged nanovehicles might cause toxicity to the BBB [44]. Gao et al. [45] and Jallouli et al. [46] showed efficient drug delivery of positively surface charged (above 15 mV) vehicles across the BBB. These results are significant, as brain drug delivery is regulated by multiple factors, including size, shape, hydrophobicity, and surface charge. Having control over these features can help permeate through the BBB and help improve the therapeutic agent's stability when in circulation [47][48][49]. In addition, the alteration of the size of the nanoparticles is essential in order to infiltrate the blood-brain barrier; this can be achieved through the potential modification of chitosan or polypyrrole. Several studies have shown an inverse correlation between the nanoparticle size and the BBB penetration [50][51][52]. The smaller the nanoparticles, the higher the penetration of the nanovehicle through the BBB. Furthermore, the shape of the nanovehicles influences the body distribution and cellular uptake [53]. \n\nOver the years, DLCs have been known to accumulate selectively at a higher rate in tumour cells [15] because mitochondria of tumour cells present a higher transmembrane potential than healthy ones. The positive surface charge of DLCs in combination with their lipophilicity allows for diffusion of DLCs at a higher rate into cancer cells. This can be favourably used to promote the selective accumulation of therapeutic amounts of boron into cancer cells [22].",

            "text": "Current and emerging delivery strategies to enhance antibody penetration in the brain. The blood-brain barrier (BBB), composed of endothelial cells (BECs), the acellular basement membrane, pericytes and astrocytic end-feet, shields the brain microenvironment from foreign materials in the blood, including administered biotherapeutics. Strategies to overcome the BBB and enhance the delivery of biotherapeutics, particularly mAbs, include: (1) Bi-specific antibodies. Conjugation of a therapeutic antibody to an antibody or ligand specific to an RMT receptor (e.g., transferrin receptor (TfR) or insulin receptor (IR)) results in endocytosis, allowing the antibody to traverse across the BBB and then engage its CNS target within the brain parenchyma. (2) Focused ultrasound in combination with the intravenous injection of gas-filled lipid shell microbubbles (MBs) imparts a mechanical force upon the brain endothelium, inducing increased vesicle formation within BECs and disruption of tight junctions between BECs, allowing peripherally administered antibodies to cross the BBB through vesicle-mediated transcytosis and paracellular transport, respectively. (3) Nanoparticles describe a range of nanoscale drug delivery vehicles including liposomes (20-1000 nm), gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) (1-150 nm) and dendrimers (2-10 nm). Antibodies can be conjugated to the outer surface of the nanoparticle. In addition, nanoparticles can be conjugated with targeting ligands and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to mediate efficient transcytosis across the BBB and site-specific targeting. These nanoparticles have been demonstrated to cross the BBB via receptor-mediated transcytosis, transmembrane diffusion, and carrier-mediated transport. (4) Exosomes can be loaded with proteins and have been shown to cross the BBB through its interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the surface of BECs, resulting in endocytosis and subsequent transcytosis across the BBB.",

The surface modification of dendrimers can reduce their innate toxicity problems and increase the therapeutic efficacy of brain disorders. This review article is an attempt to update on the potential of dendrimers explored in the past five years as a drug delivery avenue that can be considered as a promising solution in the management of a wide range of disorders affecting the central nervous system, including neoplastic, degenerative, and ischemic conditions.

By conjugating medications to ligands that attach to certain receptors on Blood\u2013Brain Barrier endothelial cells, receptor-mediated transport strategies facilitate active transport across the barrier. Cell-penetrating peptides are short peptides that have been utilised to deliver a variety of medicinal substances because they can pass through cell membranes. When combined with microbubbles, focused ultrasounds can momentarily breach the Blood Brain Barrier, enabling tailored medication administration without the need for invasive procedures. In addition, sophisticated carrier designs like dendrimers and mesoporous silica nanoparticles enhance drug stability and provide prolonged release.

Areas covered: Recent research showed that biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles possessing tailored surface properties can enable a delivery of drugs and specifically of macromolecules across the blood-brain barrier by using carrier systems of the brain capillary endothelium (Trojan Horse strategy). In the present review, the state-of-art of nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery of different macromolecular substances into the brain following intravenous injection is summarized, and different nanomedicines that are used to enable the transport of neurotrophic factors and enzymes across the blood-brain barrier into the CNS are critically analyzed.

Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with tunable size and surface properties are promising vehicles for crossing the BBB. In this study, we explored the potential applications of the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model in combination with nanotherapeutics. We synthesized \u223c25 nm MSNs and RITC-conjugated MSNs (RMSNs) with short PEG chains and varying amounts of positively charged molecules, specifically tertiary amine (polyethylenimine, PEI) or quaternary amine (trimethylammonium, TA), to investigate the positive charge effects on BBB penetration. Strongly positively charged TA-modified RMSNs (s-RMSN@PEG/TA, where s denotes strongly positively charged) effectively crossed the chick embryo BBB, whereas PEI-modified RMSNs did not. Although the weakly positively charged formulation (w-MSN@PEG/TA, where w denotes weakly positively charged) exhibited higher Dox loading capacity and a faster release rate, s-MSN@PEG/TA demonstrated superior BBB penetration and drug permeability. Consistent with chick CAM results, RMSN@PEG/TA also penetrated the BBB in mice. Long-chain PEG-modified RMSN@PEG/TA (RMSN@PEG(L)/TA, where L denotes long-chain PEG) showed reduced BBB penetration due to steric hindrance, possibly shielding TA molecules. This study highlights the effectiveness of optimizing short PEG chain density and TA modification for MSN-based BBB crossing without additional biological ligands.

Recent progress in nanotechnological fields, paved the way for the formulation of variety of drug carriers. The brain disorders such as ischemic stroke, brain cancer, and CNS disorders were poorly treated due to the presence of blood brain barrier that hinders the passage of drugs to the brain. Hence, the formulated drugs should have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for ischemic stroke treatment. In the present work, we have synthesized PLGA functionalized magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticle (MNP) with L-carnosine peptide (LMNP) composite loaded with dexamethasone (dm@LMNP) and demonstrated as efficient drug delivery platform for simultaneous BBB crossing and treatment of ischemic stroke. The surface morphology, particles size and zeta potential of the prepared material was studied from SEM, PSD, PDI and TEM analyses. The drug loading of dexamethasone in LMNP (dm@LMNP) vesicles was found to be 95.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2%. The in vitro drug release kinetics displayed that prepared composited LMNP material provides controlled and sustainable releasing efficiency at pH 7.4 and 5.8 when compared to the PLGA NPs and free dexamethasone drug molecules. The cytotoxicity and the biocompatibility test results were found to be satisfactory. The L-carnosine loaded nano-formulation has been greatly leads to effective BBB crossing to access the brain tissues. These results showed that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles/PLGA polymer can be used as an effective drug carrier for the treatment of stroke and simultaneous blood brain barrier crossing.",

The brain disorders such as ischemic stroke, brain cancer, and CNS disorders were poorly treated due to the presence of blood brain barrier that hinders the passage of drugs to the brain. Hence, the formulated drugs should have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for ischemic stroke treatment. In the present work, we have synthesized PLGA functionalized magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticle (MNP) with L-carnosine peptide (LMNP) composite loaded with dexamethasone (dm@LMNP) and demonstrated as efficient drug delivery platform for simultaneous BBB crossing and treatment of ischemic stroke. The surface morphology, particles size and zeta potential of the prepared material was studied from SEM, PSD, PDI and TEM analyses. The drug loading of dexamethasone in LMNP (dm@LMNP) vesicles was found to be 95.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2%. The in vitro drug release kinetics displayed that prepared composited LMNP material provides controlled and sustainable releasing efficiency at pH 7.4 and 5.8 when compared to the PLGA NPs and free dexamethasone drug molecules. The cytotoxicity and the biocompatibility test results were found to be satisfactory. The L-carnosine loaded nano-formulation has been greatly leads to effective BBB crossing to access the brain tissues. These results showed that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles/PLGA polymer can be used as an effective drug carrier for the treatment of stroke and simultaneous blood brain barrier crossing.",

This study aimed to develop simple surface modifications of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) without external stimuli or receptor protein conjugation, which exhibited a critical surface charge and size allowing them to cross the BBB. A series of MSNs with various charges and two different sizes of 50 and 200 nm were synthesized, which showed a uniform mesoporous structure with various surface zeta potentials ranging from +42.3 to \u221251.6 mV. Confocal microscopic results showed that 50 nm of strongly negatively charged N4-RMSN50@PEG/THPMP (\u223c\u221240 mV) could be significantly observed outside blood vessels of the brain in Tg(zfli1:EGFP) transgenic zebrafish embryos superior to the other negatively charged MSNs. However, very few positively charged MSNs were found in the brain, indicating that negatively charged MSNs could successfully penetrate the BBB. The data were confirmed by high-resolution images of 3D deconvoluted confocal microscopy and two-photon microscopy and zebrafish brain tissue sections. In addition, while increasing the size to 200 nm but maintaining the similar negative charge (\u223c40 mV), MSNs could not be detected in the brain of zebrafish, suggesting that transport across the BBB based on MSNs occurred in charge- and size-dependent manners. No obvious cytotoxicity was observed in the CTX-TNA2 astrocyte cell line and U87-MG glioma cell line treated with MSNs. After doxorubicin (Dox) loading, N4-RMSN50@PEG/THPMP/Dox enabled drug delivery and pH-responsive release.

Flow cytometry demonstrated N4-RMSN50@PEG/THPMP had few cellular uptakes. Protein corona analysis revealed three transporter proteins, such as afamin, apolipoprotein E, and basigin, could contribute to BBB penetration, validating the possible mechanism of N4-RMSN50@PEG/THPMP crossing the BBB.

Unlike blood capillaries elsewhere in the body, the structure of the BBB is characterized by the tight-junctions that are tightly resistant to the exchange of substances between the blood and the nervous tissue (Wilhelm et al., 2014)...In order to overcome this challenge, several strategies have been developed to enhance penetration of drugs into the brain. Of these, the most frequently used is receptor-mediated transcytosis. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) tagged with transferrin or L-DOPA is one of successful examples for brain targeting. The study of Cabezon, I. et al., 2015 reported that the physical modification of AuNPs with an external antibody against transferrin receptor has successfully achieved for brain internalization using ligand-receptor mediated vesicular fusion and rearrangement within few hours after exposure 37. Similary, our results clearly demonstrate that the transport across BBB of AuNPs after genetically surface modification with RVG-exosome could be enhanced compared to AuNPs coated with unmodified exosomes.",

Therefore, adequate in vitro models need to be developed in order to characterize the penetration properties of drug candidates into the central nervous system. This review article summarizes the presently used and the most promising in vitro BBB models based on the culture of brain endothelial cells. Robust models can be obtained using primary porcine brain endothelial cells and rodent coculture models, which have low paracellular permeability and express functional efflux transporters, showing good correlation of drug penetration data with in vivo results. Models mimicking the in vivo anatomophysiological complexity of the BBB are also available, including triple coculture (culture of brain endothelial cells in the presence of pericytes and astrocytes), dynamic, and microfluidic models; however, these are not suitable for rapid, high throughput studies. Potent human cell lines would be needed for easily available and reproducible models which avoid interspecies differences.",
                    "[21284359 | Cabezon et al. | 2015 | Citations: 73]": "Receptor-mediated transcytosis has been widely studied as a possible strategy to transport neurotherapeutics across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Monoclonal antibodies directed against the transferrin receptor (TfR) have been proposed as potential carrier candidates. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in their cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking is required and could critically contribute to the improvement of delivery methods. Accordingly, we studied here the trafficking of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with the 8D3 anti-transferrin receptor antibody at the mouse BBB. 8D3-AuNPs were intravenously administered to mice and allowed to recirculate for a range of times, from 10 min to 24 h, before brain extraction and analysis by transmission electron microscope techniques. Our results indicated a TfR-mediated and clathrin-dependent internalization process by which 8D3-AuNPs internalize individually in vesicles. These vesicles then follow at least two different routes. On one hand, most vesicles enter intracellular processes of vesicular fusion and rearrangement in which the AuNPs end up accumulating in late endosomes, multivesicular bodies or lysosomes, which present a high AuNP content. On the other hand, a small percentage of the vesicles follow a different route in which they fuse with the abluminal membrane and open to the basal membrane. In these cases, the 8D3-AuNPs remain attached to the abluminal membrane, which suggests an endosomal escape, but not dissociation from TfR. Altogether, although receptor-mediated transport continues to be one of the most promising strategies to overcome the BBB, different optimization approaches need to be developed for efficient drug delivery."

Of these, the most frequently used is receptor-mediated transcytosis. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) tagged with transferrin or L-DOPA is one of successful examples for brain targeting. The study of Cabezon, I. et al., 2015 reported that the physical modification of AuNPs with an external antibody against transferrin receptor has successfully achieved for brain internalization using ligand-receptor mediated vesicular fusion and rearrangement within few hours after exposure 37. Similary, our results clearly demonstrate that the transport across BBB of AuNPs after genetically surface modification with RVG-exosome could be enhanced compared to AuNPs coated with unmodified exosomes."

Nanoparticles (NPs) have previously shown great promise in taking advantage of this increased vascular permeability in other cancers, which results in increased accumulation in these cancers over time due to the accompanying loss of an effective lymph system. NPs have therefore attracted increased attention for treating brain cancer. While this research is just beginning, there have been many successes demonstrated thus far in both the laboratory and clinical setting. This review serves to present the reader with an overview of NPs for treating brain cancer and to provide an outlook on what may come in the future.

Despite numerous advances, the success of nanoparticle\u2010based technologies in treating brain diseases has been limited. Translational hurdles of nanoparticle therapies are attributed primarily to their limited ability to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), which is one of the body's most exclusive barriers. Several efforts have been focused on developing affinity\u2010based agents and using them to increase nanoparticle accumulation at the brain endothelium. Very little is known about the role of fundamental physical parameters of nanoparticles such as size, shape, and flexibility in determining their interactions with and penetration across the BBB. Using a three\u2010dimensional human BBB microfluidic model (\u03bcHuB), we investigate the impact of these physical parameters on nanoparticle penetration across the BBB. To gain insights into the dependence of transport on nanoparticle properties, two separate parameters were measured: the number of nanoparticles that fully cross the BBB and the number that remain associated with the endothelium. Association of nanoparticles with the brain endothelium was substantially impacted by their physical characteristics. Hard particles associate more with the endothelium compared to soft particles, as do small particles compared to large particles, and spherical particles compared to rod\u2010shaped particles. Transport across the BBB also exhibited a dependence on nanoparticle properties. A nonmonotonic dependence on size was observed, where 200\u2009nm particles exhibited higher BBB transport compared to 100 and 500\u2009nm spheres. Rod\u2010shaped particles exhibited higher BBB transport when normalized by endothelial association and soft particles exhibited comparable transport to hard particles when normalized by endothelial association. Tuning nanoparticles' physical parameters could potentially enhance their ability to cross the BBB for therapeutic applications."

                "snippets": "There are a number of alterations that may be required for the nanodelivery systems to be more effective. The zeta surface charge is an important parameter for nanoparticle delivery through the BBB, as a study showed that highly positive surface charged nanovehicles might cause toxicity to the BBB [44]. Gao et al. (Gao et al., 2014) and Jallouli et al. (Jallouli et al., 2007) showed efficient drug delivery of positively surface charged (above 15 mV) vehicles across the BBB. These results are significant, as brain drug delivery is regulated by multiple factors, including size, shape, hydrophobicity, and surface charge. Having control over these features can help permeate through the BBB and help improve the therapeutic agent's stability when in circulation (Goldsmith et al., 2014)[48](Lockman et al., 2002). In addition, the alteration of the size of the nanoparticles is essential in order to infiltrate the blood-brain barrier; this can be achieved through the potential modification of chitosan or polypyrrole. Several studies have shown an inverse correlation between the nanoparticle size and the BBB penetration (Etame et al., 2011)(Hanada et al., 2014)(Sonavane et al., 2008). The smaller the nanoparticles, the higher the penetration of the nanovehicle through the BBB. Furthermore, the shape of the nanovehicles influences the body distribution and cellular uptake (Decuzzi et al., 2010).",

Recent reports showed that in animal models, nanoparticles (NPs) passed through the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). For the safe use of NPs, it is imperative to evaluate the permeability of NPs through the BBB. Here we used a commercially available in vitro BBB model to evaluate the permeability of NPs for a rapid, easy and reproducible assay. The model is reconstructed by culturing both primary rat brain endothelial cells and pericytes to support the tight junctions of endothelial cells. We used the permeability coefficient (Papp) to determine the permeability of NPs. The size dependency results, using fluorescent silica NPs (30, 100, and 400 nm), revealed that the Papp for the 30 nm NPs was higher than those of the larger silica. The surface charge dependency results using Qdots\u00ae (amino-, carboxyl-, and PEGylated-Qdots), showed that more amino-Qdots passed through the model than the other Qdots. Usage of serum-containing buffer in the model resulted in an overall reduction of permeability. In conclusion, although additional developments are desired to elucidate the NPs transportation, we showed that the BBB model could be useful as a tool to test the permeability of nanoparticles.",

Recent work indicated that BBB permeability can be up-regulated by activating A2A adenosine receptor (AR), which temporarily increases intercellular spaces between the brain capillary endothelial cells. However, due to transient circulation lifetime of adenosine-based agonists, their capability to enhance brain delivery of drugs, especially macromolecular drugs, is limited. In this work, a series of nanoagonists (NAs) were developed by labeling different copies of A2A AR activating ligands on dendrimers. In vitro transendothelial electrical resistance measurements demonstrated that the NAs increased permeability of the endothelial cell monolayer by compromising the tightness of tight junctions, the key structure that restricts the entry of blood-borne molecules into the brain. In vivo imaging studies indicated the remarkably up-regulated brain uptake of a macromolecular model drug (45 kDa) after intravenous injection of NAs. Autoradiographic imaging showed that the BBB opening time-window can be tuned in a range of 0.5-2.0 h by the NAs labeled with different numbers of AR-activating ligands. By choosing a suitable NA, it is possible to maximize brain drug delivery and minimize the uncontrollable BBB leakage by matching the BBB opening time-window with the pharmacokinetics of a therapeutic agent. The NA-mediated brain drug delivery strategy holds promise for the treatment of CNS diseases with improved therapeutic efficiency and reduced side-effects.",

As a result, at most, a small percentage of a drug that is administered systemically will reach the central nervous system in its active form. Currently, research in the field focuses on developing safer and more effective approaches to deliver peptides and proteins into the central nervous system. Multiple strategies have been developed for this purpose. However, noninvasive approaches, such as nanostructured protein delivery carriers and intranasal administration, seem to be the most promising strategies for the treatment of chronic diseases, which require long-term interventions. These approaches are both target-specific and able to rapidly bypass the blood-brain barrier. In this Perspective, we detail some of these strategies and discuss some of the potential pitfalls and opportunities in this field. The next generation strategies will most likely be more cell-type-specific. Devising these strategies to target the brain may ultimately become a novel therapeutic modality to treat neurodegenerative diseases."

The zeta surface charge is an important parameter for nanoparticle delivery through the BBB, as a study showed that highly positive surface charged nanovehicles might cause toxicity to the BBB [44]. Gao et al. (Gao et al., 2014) and Jallouli et al. (Jallouli et al., 2007) showed efficient drug delivery of positively surface charged (above 15 mV) vehicles across the BBB. These results are significant, as brain drug delivery is regulated by multiple factors, including size, shape, hydrophobicity, and surface charge. Having control over these features can help permeate through the BBB and help improve the therapeutic agent's stability when in circulation (Goldsmith et al., 2014)[48](Lockman et al., 2002). In addition, the alteration of the size of the nanoparticles is essential in order to infiltrate the blood-brain barrier; this can be achieved through the potential modification of chitosan or polypyrrole. Several studies have shown an inverse correlation between the nanoparticle size and the BBB penetration (Etame et al., 2011)(Hanada et al., 2014)(Sonavane et al., 2008). The smaller the nanoparticles, the higher the penetration of the nanovehicle through the BBB. Furthermore, the shape of the nanovehicles influences the body distribution and cellular uptake (Decuzzi et al., 2010)."

In this study, the unique functionalities of exosome-derived membranes were combined with synthetic AuNPs for targeted delivery to brain cells. Here, we report the surface modification of AuNPs with brain-targeted exosomes derived from genetically engineered mammalian cells by using the mechanical method or extrusion to create these novel nanomaterials. The unique targeting properties of the AuNPs after fabrication with the brain-targeted exosomes was demonstrated by their binding to brain cells under laminar flow conditions as well as their enhanced transport across the blood brain barrier. In a further demonstration of their ability to target brain cells, in vivo bioluminescence imaging revealed that targeted-exosome coated AuNPs accumulated in the mouse brain after intravenous injection. The surface modification of synthetic AuNPs with the brain-targeted exosome demonstrated in this work represents a highly novel and effective strategy to provide efficient brain targeting and shows promise for the future in using modified AuNPs to penetrate the brain.",

Although there are currently several drugs marketed for its treatment, none are capable of slowing down or stopping the progression of AD. The role of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a key role in the design of a successful treatment for this neurodegenerative disease. Nanosized particles have been proposed as suitable drug delivery systems to overcome BBB with the purpose of increasing bioavailability of drugs in the brain. Biodegradable poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) have been particularly regarded as promising drug delivery systems as they can be surface-tailored with functionalized molecules for site-specific targeting. In this review, a thorough discussion about the most recent functionalization strategies based on PLGA-NPs for AD and their mechanisms of action is provided, together with a description of AD pathogenesis and the role of the BBB in brain targeting."

A brain-targeted gene delivery system based on a transferrin (Tf) and cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) dual-functionalized liposome, CPP-Tf-liposome, was designed and investigated for crossing BBB and permeating into the brain. We selected three sequences of CPPs [melittin, Kaposi fibroblast growth factor (kFGF), and penetration accelerating sequence\u2013R8] and compared their ability to internalize into the cells and, subsequently, improve the transfection efficiency. Study of intracellular uptake indicated that liposomal penetration into bEnd.3 cells, primary astrocytes, and primary neurons occurred through multiple endocytosis pathways and surface modification with Tf and CPP enhanced the transfection efficiency of the nanoparticles. A coculture in vitro BBB model reproducing the in vivo anatomophysiological complexity of the biologic barrier was developed to characterize the penetrating properties of these designed liposomes. The dual-functionalized liposomes effectively crossed the in vitro barrier model followed by transfecting primary neurons. Liposome tissue distribution in vivo indicated superior ability of kFGF-Tf-liposomes to overcome BBB and reach brain of the mice after single intravenous administration. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using strategically designed liposomes by combining Tf receptor targeting with enhanced cell penetration as a potential brain gene delivery vector. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Rational synthesis of efficient brain-targeted gene carrier included modification of liposomes with a target-specific ligand, transferrin, and with cell-penetrating peptide to enhance cellular internalization. Our study used an in vitro triple coculture blood-brain barrier (BBB) model as a tool to characterize the permeability across BBB and functionality of designed liposomes prior to in vivo biodistribution studies. Our study demonstrated that rational design and characterization of BBB permeability are efficient strategies for development of brain-targeted gene carriers."

Current FDA-approved treatments include surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy, while hyperthermia, immunotherapy, and most relevantly, nanoparticle (NP)-mediated delivery systems or combinations thereof have shown promise in preclinical studies. Drug-carrying NPs are a promising approach to brain delivery as a result of their potential to facilitate the crossing of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) via two main types of transcytosis mechanisms: adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (AMT) and receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT). Their ability to accumulate in the brain can thus provide local sustained release of tumoricidal drugs at or near the site of GBM tumors. NP-based drug delivery has the potential to significantly reduce drug-related toxicity, increase specificity, and consequently improve the lifespan and quality of life of patients with GBM. Due to significant advances in the understanding of the molecular etiology and pathology of GBM, the efficacy of drugs loaded into vectors targeting this disease has increased in both preclinical and clinical settings. Multitargeting NPs, such as those incorporating multiple specific targeting ligands, are an innovative technology that can lead to decreased off-target effects while simultaneously having increased accumulation and action specifically at the tumor site. Targeting ligands can include antibodies, or fragments thereof, and peptides or small molecules, which can result in a more controlled drug delivery system compared to conventional drug treatments. This review focuses on GBM treatment strategies, summarizing current options and providing a detailed account of preclinical findings with prospective NP-based approaches aimed at improving tumor targeting and enhancing therapeutic outcomes for GBM patients.",

Nanoparticle-based drugs are one of the emerging therapies and have shown great promise to treat brain diseases. Modifications on particle size and surface charge are two efficient ways to increase the transport efficiency of nanoparticles through brain-blood barrier; however, partly due to the high complexity of brain microstructure and limited visibility of Nanoparticles (NPs), our understanding of how these two modifications can affect the transport of NPs in the brain is insufficient. In this study, a framework, which contains a stochastic geometric model of brain white matter (WM) and a mathematical particle tracing model, was developed to investigate the relationship between particle size/surface charge of the NPs and their effective diffusion coefficients (D) in WM. The predictive capabilities of this method have been validated using published experimental tests. For negatively charged NPs, both particle size and surface charge are positively correlated with D before reaching a size threshold. When Zeta potential (Zp) is less negative than -10 mV, the difference between NPs\u2019 D in WM and pure interstitial fluid (IF) is limited. A deeper understanding on the relationships between particle size/surface charge of NPs and their D in WM has been obtained. The results from this study and the developed modelling framework provide important tools for the development of nano-drugs and nano-carriers to cure brain diseases.",

Here, we design a double targeting nanoparticle carrying lamotrigine (LTG) to cross the BBB and further concentrate at the neurons. We prepare the nanoparticles on a microfluidic chip by encapsulating LTG in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to form a core (PL) and capping the core with a shell of lipids conjugated with the D-T7 peptide (targeting the BBB) and Tet1 peptide (targeting the neuron) to form D-T7/Tet1-lipids@PL nanoparticles (NPs). In vitro and in vivo experiments show that D-T7/Tet1-lipids@PL NPs have excellent neuron targeting, antiepileptic, and protecting effects. Our approach provides a new strategy for improving the therapeutic efficacy of existing antiepileptic drugs."

The presence of functional groups on the surface of mesoporous silica can augment the solubility and stability of hydrophobic medicines such as resveratrol, hence enhancing their bioavailability and capacity to penetrate target tissues. Functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles have a small particle size of approximately 140 nm and have an optimal surface charge. These characteristics enable them to efficiently cross cellular membranes and biological barriers, hence improving the drug's ability to reach its intended target.

Multicellular 3D spheroids display reproducible BBB features and functions. The spheroids used here were composed of six brain cell types: Astrocytes, pericytes, endothelial cells, microglia cells, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. They form an in vitro BBB that regulates the transport of compounds into the spheroid. The penetration of fluorescent ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (core diameter 2 nm; hydrodynamic diameter 3\u20134 nm) across the BBB was studied as a function of time by confocal laser scanning microscopy, with the dissolved fluorescent dye (FAM-alkyne) as a control. The nanoparticles readily entered the interior of the spheroid, whereas the dissolved dye alone did not penetrate the BBB. We present a model that is based on a time-dependent opening of the BBB for nanoparticles, followed by a rapid diffusion into the center of the spheroid. After the spheroids underwent hypoxia (0.1% O2; 24 h), the BBB was more permeable, permitting the uptake of more nanoparticles and also of dissolved dye molecules. Together with our previous observations that such nanoparticles can easily enter cells and even the cell nucleus, these data provide evidence that ultrasmall nanoparticle can cross the blood brain barrier.",

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with transferrin-like peptides show promise in overcoming these challenges, enhancing drug delivery to the brain, and reducing chemotherapy resistance. Objective The primary goal of this study is to establish a detailed protocol for synthesizing and stabilizing AuNPs, functionalizing them with de novo\u2013engineered transferrin-like peptides, and conjugating them with the chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide. This strategy aims to improve drug delivery across the BBB and circumvent chemotherapy resistance. The secondary objective includes an assessment of the safety and potential for in vivo use of the synthesized nanoparticle complex. Methods The proposal involves multiple steps with rigorous quality control of AuNP synthesis, stabilization with surfactants, and polyethylene glycol coating. The engineered transferrin-like peptides will be synthesized and attached to the AuNPs\u2019 surface, followed by the attachment of temozolomide and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. The resulting complex will undergo in vitro testing to assess BBB penetration, efficacy against GBM cells, and potential toxicity. Results Initial preliminary experiments and simulations suggest successful synthesis and stabilization of AuNPs and effective attachment of transferrin-like peptides. We propose peptide attachment verification using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance. Additionally, we will conduct pH stability tests to ensure our functionalized AuNPs retain their properties in acidic brain tumor microenvironments. Conclusions The proposed functionalization of AuNPs with de novo\u2013engineered transferrin-like peptides represents a novel approach to GBM treatment. Our strategy opens new avenues for drug delivery across the BBB and chemotherapy resistance reduction. While we primarily focus on in vitro studies and computational modeling at this stage, successful completion will lead to further development, including in vivo studies and nanoparticle design optimization. This proposal anticipates inspiring future research and funding in neuro-oncology, presenting a potentially innovative and effective treatment option for GBM.

The presence of various physiological barriers, primarily the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) limits the accessibility of the brain and hinders the efficacy of various drug therapies. Hence, drug targeting to the brain, particularly to the diseased cells by circumventing the physiological barriers is essential to develop a promising therapy for the treatment of brain disorders. Presently, the investigations emphasize the role of different nanocarrier systems or surface modified target specific novel carrier system to improve the efficiency and reduce the side effects of the brain therapeutics. Such approaches supposed to circumvent the BBB or have the ability to cross the barrier function and thus increases the drug concentration in the brain. Although the efficacy of novel carrier system depends upon various physiological factors like active efflux transport, protein corona of the brain, stability, and toxicity of the nanocarrier, physicochemical properties, patient-related factors and many more. Hence, to develop a promising carrier system, it is essential to understand the physiology of the brain and BBB and also the other associated factors. Along with this, some alternative route like direct nose-to-brain drug delivery can also offer a better means to access the brain without exposure of the BBB. In this review, we have discussed the role of various physiological barriers including the BBB and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) on the drug therapy and the mechanism of drug transport across the BBB. Further, we discussed different novel strategies for brain targeting of drug including, polymeric nanoparticles, lipidic nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, liposomes, nanogels, nanoemulsions, dendrimers, quantum dots, etc. along with the intranasal drug delivery to the brain. We have also illustrated various factors affecting the drug targeting efficiency of the developed novel carrier system.",

However, FUS-induced inertial cavitation of microbubbles can also result in erythrocyte extravasations. Here we investigated whether induction of submicron bubbles to oscillate at their resonant frequency would reduce inertial cavitation during BBB-opening and thereby eliminate erythrocyte extravasations in a rat brain model. FUS was delivered with acoustic pressures of 0.1\u20134.5 MPa using either in-house manufactured submicron bubbles or standard SonoVue microbubbles. Wideband and subharmonic emissions from bubbles were used to quantify inertial and stable cavitation, respectively. Erythrocyte extravasations were evaluated by in vivo post-treatment magnetic resonance susceptibility-weighted imaging, and finally by histological confirmation. We found that excitation of submicron bubbles with resonant frequency-matched FUS (10 MHz) can greatly limit inertial cavitation while enhancing stable cavitation. The BBB-opening was mainly caused by stable cavitation, whereas the erythrocyte extravasation was closely correlated with inertial cavitation. Our technique allows extensive reduction of inertial cavitation to induce safe BBB-opening. Furthermore, the safety issue of BBB-opening was not compromised by prolonging FUS exposure time, and the local drug concentrations in the brain tissues were significantly improved to 60 times (BCNU; 18.6 \u00b5g versus 0.3 \u00b5g) by using chemotherapeutic agent-loaded submicron bubbles with FUS. This study provides important information towards the goal of successfully translating FUS brain drug delivery into clinical use."

These delivery systems are designed to cross the BBB either by exploiting specific transport mechanisms or by modifying their surface properties to enhance permeability. Lipid nanoparticles, such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) or liposomes, have shown promise in delivering neuroprotective agents such as antioxidants, neurotrophic factors, and anti-inflammatory drugs directly to the brain (Mohi-ud-din et al., 2021)(Panghal et al., 2024)(Mottaqi et al., 2024). These systems can also be engineered to release their payloads in a controlled manner, which improves drug efficacy and minimizes side effects. Research has also focused on the development of polymeric nanoparticles and nanogels that can encapsulate multiple therapeutic agents and release them in a targeted, sustained manner, ensuring that higher concentrations of the drug reach the intended site of action within the brain [132,(Manimaran et al., 2023). Advances in polymeric scaffolds have enabled the development of biomaterials that can not only carry drugs to the brain but also serve as structural support for damaged tissues, aiding in neuroregeneration (Collins et al., 2022)(Malviya et al., 2022). For example, hydrogel-based systems have been developed to deliver nerve growth factors to promote the regeneration of neurons in conditions such as Parkinson's disease (Li et al., 2022)(Nguyen et al., 2022)(Pal et al., 2024). These systems are designed to interact with specific regions of the brain that are affected by disease, improving the delivery of therapeutic agents and providing more personalized, effective treatment options.

Although numerous therapeutics have been developed for the effective treatment of MS and a few have been approved in recent decades, complete remission and treatment of MS remain a matter of concern. Nanotechnology is a potential approach for manipulating the properties of materials at the molecular level to attain desired properties. This approach is effective in the treatment of several CNS disorders by enhancing drug delivery, bioavailability and efficacy. We have briefly discussed the neuroimmunological disorders with a particular emphasis on MS. We also explored nanoengineered drug delivery systems, describing several nano-formulations for the treatment of MS, challenges and future of nanotechnology."

These delivery systems are designed to cross the BBB either by exploiting specific transport mechanisms or by modifying their surface properties to enhance permeability. Lipid nanoparticles, such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) or liposomes, have shown promise in delivering neuroprotective agents such as antioxidants, neurotrophic factors, and anti-inflammatory drugs directly to the brain (Mohi-ud-din et al., 2021)(Panghal et al., 2024)(Mottaqi et al., 2024). These systems can also be engineered to release their payloads in a controlled manner, which improves drug efficacy and minimizes side effects. Research has also focused on the development of polymeric nanoparticles and nanogels that can encapsulate multiple therapeutic agents and release them in a targeted, sustained manner, ensuring that higher concentrations of the drug reach the intended site of action within the brain [132,(Manimaran et al., 2023). Advances in polymeric scaffolds have enabled the development of biomaterials that can not only carry drugs to the brain but also serve as structural support for damaged tissues, aiding in neuroregeneration (Collins et al., 2022)(Malviya et al., 2022). For example, hydrogel-based systems have been developed to deliver nerve growth factors to promote the regeneration of neurons in conditions such as Parkinson's disease (Li et al., 2022)(Nguyen et al., 2022)(Pal et al., 2024). These systems are designed to interact with specific regions of the brain that are affected by disease, improving the delivery of therapeutic agents and providing more personalized, effective treatment options. Moreover, strategies such as nanoparticle-functionalized antibodies and aptamers are being investigated to enhance targeting specificity, ensuring that drugs reach only the affected areas, thereby minimizing off-target effects [139]140]."

Kreuter found that nanoparticles coated with polysorbate-80 transported drugs through the barrier with a 20-fold improvement over the uncoated nanoparticles (Kreuter, 2001).

Central analgesia was measured by the hot plate test in mice. The antidepressant amitriptyline, which normally penetrates the BBB, was used to examine the versatility of the NP method. The concentration of amitriptyline in serum and brain of mice was determined by a gas chromatographic method. Furthermore, NPs were fabricated with different stabilizers. After the adsorption of the peptides on polysorbate 85-stabilized NPs, analgesia was noted after intravenous application when NPs were not coated.

Later work by Schroeder et al., proposed that these coatings help bind nanoparticles to the lining of the capillaries such that they induce a large concentration gradient which facilitates diffusion or purposefully induce phagocytosis processes in the epithelial cells (Schroeder et al., 1998). Kreuter found that nanoparticles coated with polysorbate-80 transported drugs through the barrier with a 20-fold improvement over the uncoated nanoparticles (Kreuter, 2001). However, he concluded that it is because the polysorbate-80 coating attracts apolipoprotein E from the blood to the surface [62]."

This will help set the context for the specific surface modifications discussed later.\n\nNext, I should categorize the various surface modification approaches. Based on the quotes, I can see several major categories:\n\n1. Surfactant coatings - There's significant information about polysorbate 80, poloxamer 188, and other surfactants that enhance BBB penetration.\n\n2. Polymer modifications - PEGylation appears frequently as a key surface modification strategy.\n\n3. Ligand/receptor-mediated targeting - Many quotes discuss attaching specific ligands to target receptors on the BBB.\n\n4. Charge modifications - Several quotes mention the importance of surface charge in BBB penetration.\n\n5. Cell-penetrating peptides - Several quotes mention peptides like TAT that can facilitate BBB crossing.\n\n6. Other specialized coatings - There are mentions of lipid coatings, biomimetic coatings, and other unique approaches.\n\n7. Mechanisms of BBB crossing - Understanding how these modifications actually work to enhance BBB crossing is important.\n\nFor each dimension, I'll need to decide whether a list or synthesis format is most appropriate:\n\n\"Introduction/Background\" should be a synthesis to provide a coherent explanation of the BBB challenge and why surface modifications are important.\n\n\"Surfactant coatings\" would work well as a synthesis since there are several quotes discussing specific surfactants and their mechanisms.\n\n\"Polymer modifications\" has several quotes about PEGylation and other polymers, making a synthesis appropriate.\n\n\"Ligand/receptor-mediated targeting\" has numerous examples that would be best presented as a synthesis explaining the general approach with specific examples.\n\n\"Charge modifications\" has multiple quotes discussing how surface charge affects BBB penetration, making a synthesis appropriate.\n\n\"Cell-penetrating peptides\" would work well as a synthesis since there are several mentions of specific peptides and their mechanisms.\n\n\"Other specialized coatings\" could be a list as it encompasses diverse approaches that might be better presented as discrete options.\n\n\"Mechanisms of BBB crossing\" should be a synthesis to coherently explain how these modifications actually enhance BBB penetration.",

Surface modifications of nanoparticles offer promising strategies to enhance BBB penetration through various mechanisms including receptor-mediated transcytosis, size optimization, and charge alterations.

                "text": "\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents one of the most formidable obstacles in delivering therapeutics to the central nervous system (CNS). Unlike blood capillaries elsewhere in the body, the BBB is characterized by tight junctions between endothelial cells that line cerebral microvessels, creating a highly selective barrier that restricts the exchange of substances between the blood and nervous tissue <Paper corpusId=\"174798792\" paperTitle=\"(Khongkow et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"20863171\" paperTitle=\"(Wilhelm et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This protective mechanism, while essential for normal brain function, significantly limits the effectiveness of conventional drug delivery approaches targeting neurological conditions.\n\nNanotechnology has emerged as a promising solution to overcome the BBB challenge, with various nanoparticle platforms including polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, hydrogels, and dendrimers showing potential for enhanced brain delivery <Paper corpusId=\"229241129\" paperTitle=\"(Liao et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"277084247\" paperTitle=\"(El-Tanani et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. The effectiveness of nanoparticles in crossing the BBB is influenced by several key parameters: (i) size, with generally an inverse correlation between nanoparticle size and BBB penetration; (ii) shape, which affects body distribution and cellular uptake; (iii) the type of targeting ligands attached; and (iv) surface charge or zeta potential <Paper corpusId=\"214787055\" paperTitle=\"(Saint-Pol et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSurface modification has proven to be a particularly effective strategy for enhancing nanoparticle transport across the BBB <Paper corpusId=\"270043887\" paperTitle=\"(Cai et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. These modifications can take various forms, including physical coating with surfactants, chemical functionalization with specific ligands, alteration of surface charge, and optimization of size <Paper corpusId=\"219332656\" paperTitle=\"(Lombardo et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"267137806\" paperTitle=\"(Selvin, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. For instance, coating nanoparticles with biopolymers like polyethylene glycol (PEG) can increase systemic circulation time by reducing interactions that lead to clearance and opsonization <Paper corpusId=\"229241129\" paperTitle=\"(Liao et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"277910377\" paperTitle=\"(Jiang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nOne of the most frequently employed strategies is receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT), which exploits specific receptors expressed on the BBB. Gold nanoparticles tagged with transferrin or antibodies against transferrin receptors have successfully achieved brain internalization through this mechanism <Paper corpusId=\"174798792\" paperTitle=\"(Khongkow et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"21284359\" paperTitle=\"(Cabezon et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach has shown that nanoparticles can internalize individually in vesicles through a TfR-mediated and clathrin-dependent process, although optimization is still needed for efficient drug delivery as many particles end up in endosomes or lysosomes rather than crossing completely into the brain parenchyma <Paper corpusId=\"21284359\" paperTitle=\"(Cabezon et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe physical characteristics of nanoparticles significantly influence their BBB transport capabilities. Studies using three-dimensional human BBB microfluidic models have demonstrated that parameters such as size, shape, and flexibility impact both nanoparticle association with the brain endothelium and their transport across the BBB <Paper corpusId=\"229241129\" paperTitle=\"(Liao et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"213670058\" paperTitle=\"(Nowak et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Interestingly, BBB transport exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on size, with medium-sized particles (around 200 nm) sometimes showing better penetration than both smaller and larger ones <Paper corpusId=\"213670058\" paperTitle=\"(Nowak et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

Unlike blood capillaries elsewhere in the body, the structure of the BBB is characterized by the tight-junctions that are tightly resistant to the exchange of substances between the blood and the nervous tissue (Wilhelm et al., 2014)",

Of these, the most frequently used is receptor-mediated transcytosis. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) tagged with transferrin or L-DOPA is one of successful examples for brain targeting. The study of Cabezon, I. et al., 2015 reported that the physical modification of AuNPs with an external antibody against transferrin receptor has successfully achieved for brain internalization using ligand-receptor mediated vesicular fusion and rearrangement within few hours after exposure 37. Similary, our results clearly demonstrate that the transport across BBB of AuNPs after genetically surface modification with RVG-exosome could be enhanced compared to AuNPs coated with unmodified exosomes."

Therefore, adequate in vitro models need to be developed in order to characterize the penetration properties of drug candidates into the central nervous system. This review article summarizes the presently used and the most promising in vitro BBB models based on the culture of brain endothelial cells. Robust models can be obtained using primary porcine brain endothelial cells and rodent coculture models, which have low paracellular permeability and express functional efflux transporters, showing good correlation of drug penetration data with in vivo results. Models mimicking the in vivo anatomophysiological complexity of the BBB are also available, including triple coculture (culture of brain endothelial cells in the presence of pericytes and astrocytes), dynamic, and microfluidic models; however, these are not suitable for rapid, high throughput studies. Potent human cell lines would be needed for easily available and reproducible models which avoid interspecies differences."

There are a wide variety of nanoparticle platforms used for therapeutic delivery to the brain, including polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, hydrogels, and dendrimers. Polymeric nanoparticles can provide controlled drug release, targeting capabilities, and prolonged drug action by protection from proteases, and have been shown to cross an intact or impaired BBB. (Dziubla et al., 2005)83 Nanoparticle size, shape, flexibility, and surface charge can be tailored to overcome steric clearance and non-specific binding to alter pharmacokinetics and improve brain accumulation.

                            "To overcome this challenge, innovative lipid-based nanoparticles and polymeric scaffolds are being explored as potential solutions for targeted drug delivery to the brain (Filipczak et al., 2021)(Maher et al., 2023)[128]. These delivery systems are designed to cross the BBB either by exploiting specific transport mechanisms or by modifying their surface properties to enhance permeability. Lipid nanoparticles, such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) or liposomes, have shown promise in delivering neuroprotective agents such as antioxidants, neurotrophic factors, and anti-inflammatory drugs directly to the brain (Mohi-ud-din et al., 2021)(Panghal et al., 2024)(Mottaqi et al., 2024). These systems can also be engineered to release their payloads in a controlled manner, which improves drug efficacy and minimizes side effects. Research has also focused on the development of polymeric nanoparticles and nanogels that can encapsulate multiple therapeutic agents and release them in a targeted, sustained manner, ensuring that higher concentrations of the drug reach the intended site of action within the brain [132,(Manimaran et al., 2023). Advances in polymeric scaffolds have enabled the development of biomaterials that can not only carry drugs to the brain but also serve as structural support for damaged tissues, aiding in neuroregeneration (Collins et al., 2022)(Malviya et al., 2022). For example, hydrogel-based systems have been developed to deliver nerve growth factors to promote the regeneration of neurons in conditions such as Parkinson's disease (Li et al., 2022)(Nguyen et al., 2022)(Pal et al., 2024). These systems are designed to interact with specific regions of the brain that are affected by disease, improving the delivery of therapeutic agents and providing more personalized, effective treatment options. Moreover, strategies such as nanoparticle-functionalized antibodies and aptamers are being investigated to enhance targeting specificity, ensuring that drugs reach only the affected areas, thereby minimizing off-target effects [139]140]."

                            "Receptor-mediated transcytosis has been widely studied as a possible strategy to transport neurotherapeutics across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Monoclonal antibodies directed against the transferrin receptor (TfR) have been proposed as potential carrier candidates. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in their cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking is required and could critically contribute to the improvement of delivery methods. Accordingly, we studied here the trafficking of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with the 8D3 anti-transferrin receptor antibody at the mouse BBB. 8D3-AuNPs were intravenously administered to mice and allowed to recirculate for a range of times, from 10 min to 24 h, before brain extraction and analysis by transmission electron microscope techniques. Our results indicated a TfR-mediated and clathrin-dependent internalization process by which 8D3-AuNPs internalize individually in vesicles. These vesicles then follow at least two different routes. On one hand, most vesicles enter intracellular processes of vesicular fusion and rearrangement in which the AuNPs end up accumulating in late endosomes, multivesicular bodies or lysosomes, which present a high AuNP content. On the other hand, a small percentage of the vesicles follow a different route in which they fuse with the abluminal membrane and open to the basal membrane. In these cases, the 8D3-AuNPs remain attached to the abluminal membrane, which suggests an endosomal escape, but not dissociation from TfR. Altogether, although receptor-mediated transport continues to be one of the most promising strategies to overcome the BBB, different optimization approaches need to be developed for efficient drug delivery."

                            "Abstract Nanoparticle\u2010based therapeutic formulations are being increasingly explored for the treatment of various ailments. Despite numerous advances, the success of nanoparticle\u2010based technologies in treating brain diseases has been limited. Translational hurdles of nanoparticle therapies are attributed primarily to their limited ability to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), which is one of the body's most exclusive barriers. Several efforts have been focused on developing affinity\u2010based agents and using them to increase nanoparticle accumulation at the brain endothelium. Very little is known about the role of fundamental physical parameters of nanoparticles such as size, shape, and flexibility in determining their interactions with and penetration across the BBB. Using a three\u2010dimensional human BBB microfluidic model (\u03bcHuB), we investigate the impact of these physical parameters on nanoparticle penetration across the BBB. To gain insights into the dependence of transport on nanoparticle properties, two separate parameters were measured: the number of nanoparticles that fully cross the BBB and the number that remain associated with the endothelium. Association of nanoparticles with the brain endothelium was substantially impacted by their physical characteristics. Hard particles associate more with the endothelium compared to soft particles, as do small particles compared to large particles, and spherical particles compared to rod\u2010shaped particles. Transport across the BBB also exhibited a dependence on nanoparticle properties. A nonmonotonic dependence on size was observed, where 200\u2009nm particles exhibited higher BBB transport compared to 100 and 500\u2009nm spheres. Rod\u2010shaped particles exhibited higher BBB transport when normalized by endothelial association and soft particles exhibited comparable transport to hard particles when normalized by endothelial association. Tuning nanoparticles' physical parameters could potentially enhance their ability to cross the BBB for therapeutic applications."

                "text": "\nSurfactant coatings represent one of the most effective approaches for enhancing nanoparticle transport across the blood-brain barrier. Polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) has emerged as a particularly valuable surfactant for this purpose, with numerous studies demonstrating its ability to dramatically improve brain-specific delivery of therapeutic agents. When applied to polybutylcyanoacrylate (PBCA) nanoparticles, polysorbate 80 coating has enabled successful brain delivery of various drugs including dalargin, tubocurarine, and doxorubicin that otherwise cannot cross the BBB effectively <Paper corpusId=\"265073990\" paperTitle=\"(Niazi, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe mechanism behind polysorbate 80's effectiveness involves its ability to adsorb plasma apolipoproteins, particularly apolipoprotein E (ApoE), onto the nanoparticle surface. This modification essentially allows the nanoparticles to mimic low-density lipoproteins (LDL), enabling recognition by LDL receptors expressed on brain endothelial cells and subsequent transport across the BBB via receptor-mediated endocytosis <Paper corpusId=\"268928188\" paperTitle=\"(Narsinh et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"10445103\" paperTitle=\"(Kanwar et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. Studies have reported remarkable improvements in BBB penetration, with Kreuter finding that polysorbate 80-coated nanoparticles transported drugs through the barrier with a 20-fold improvement over uncoated nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"5143982\" paperTitle=\"(Parratt et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAnother surfactant demonstrating significant BBB-crossing enhancement is poloxamer 188 (F68), which has been shown to increase the delivery of drug-loaded PBCA and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles to the brain in rats <Paper corpusId=\"10445103\" paperTitle=\"(Kanwar et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. Like polysorbate 80, poloxamer 188 facilitates ApoE adsorption onto polymeric nanoparticles, enabling recognition by LDL receptors on brain endothelial cells <Paper corpusId=\"225464702\" paperTitle=\"(Hartl et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe effectiveness of surfactant-based modifications has been demonstrated in multiple studies. Lamptey and colleagues reported that surface functionalization of PLGA nanoparticles with polysorbate 80 increased brain concentration of the neuroprotective agent Bacoside-A to 23.94 \u00b1 1.74 \u00b5g/g tissue, over ten times higher than the concentration achieved with pure drug solution <Paper corpusId=\"256288184\" paperTitle=\"(Lamptey et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, polysorbate 80-coated doxorubicin-loaded and gemcitabine-loaded PBCA nanoparticles showed enhanced brain specificity and efficacy compared to unmodified nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"10445103\" paperTitle=\"(Kanwar et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nBeyond facilitating receptor-mediated transcytosis, surfactant coatings appear to enhance BBB permeation through additional mechanisms. They may inhibit the efflux action of P-glycoprotein and solubilize cell membrane lipids of brain endothelial cells to facilitate entry <Paper corpusId=\"10445103\" paperTitle=\"(Kanwar et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"52036623\" paperTitle=\"(Carvalho et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper>. Some researchers have also suggested that surfactant coatings help bind nanoparticles to capillary linings, creating concentration gradients that facilitate diffusion or induce phagocytosis processes in epithelial cells <Paper corpusId=\"5143982\" paperTitle=\"(Parratt et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"30272015\" paperTitle=\"(Schroeder et al., 1998)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nOther surfactants that have shown promise include polysorbate 85, dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline, and cholesterol-based lipid bilayers. Studies have found that charged nanoparticles coated with dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline and cholesterol-based lipid bilayer showed three to four times increased penetration across the BBB <Paper corpusId=\"56080588\" paperTitle=\"(Kiani et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.

However, targeting specificity will primarily depend on the physicochemical and biochemical properties of the surfactant. Previous reports underscore the importance of polysorbate 80-coated nanoparticles for brain-specific delivery. Polysorbate 80 surface-modified doxorubicin-loaded and gemcitabine-loaded polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles showed enhanced brain specificity and efficacy compared with unmodified nanoparticles, highlighting the importance of surface modification by surfactants. (Steiniger et al., 2004)(Wang et al., 2009) Another surfactant reported to have the ability to enhance brain permeability is poloxamer 188 (F68) which was found to increase the delivery of drug-loaded polybutylcyanoacrylate and poly(lactide-coglycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles to the brain in rats.

                "text": "\nPolymer-based surface modifications represent a cornerstone strategy for enhancing nanoparticle transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Among these, PEGylation\u2014the process of covalent or non-covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to nanoparticle surfaces\u2014has emerged as the most extensively employed approach <Paper corpusId=\"199545358\" paperTitle=\"(Tiwari et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"277910377\" paperTitle=\"(Jiang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. The primary advantage of PEGylation is its ability to significantly increase nanoparticles' systemic circulation time by reducing interactions that lead to clearance and opsonization <Paper corpusId=\"229241129\" paperTitle=\"(Liao et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This extended circulation provides nanoparticles with more opportunities to interact with and potentially cross the BBB.\n\nMultiple studies have reported that PEGylated nanoparticles cross the BBB more efficiently than nanoparticles with various other surface modifications, although the precise mechanism behind this enhanced penetration remains not fully elucidated <Paper corpusId=\"227044620\" paperTitle=\"(Vani et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. The efficacy of PEGylation appears to be related to its ability to enhance stability in biological environments, improve pharmacokinetics, and protect the encapsulated drug from degradation <Paper corpusId=\"210827082\" paperTitle=\"(Mahmoud et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"10196151\" paperTitle=\"(Meyers et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, PEGylation can improve drug specificity and increase the solubility of hydrophobic drugs, making it a versatile modification approach <Paper corpusId=\"277910377\" paperTitle=\"(Jiang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAn important aspect of PEGylation is the ability to control the coating density. Research has shown that densely PEG-coated nanoparticles up to 114 nm in size are capable of both diffusive and convective transport through the brain parenchyma <Paper corpusId=\"229241129\" paperTitle=\"(Liao et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This represents a significant advantage for therapeutic delivery beyond the BBB, as it allows nanoparticles to penetrate deeper into brain tissue after crossing the endothelial barrier.\n\nBeyond PEGylation, researchers are exploring combinations of polymer modifications with other targeting strategies. For instance, PEGylated nanoparticles can be further decorated with targeting ligands like transferrin to enhance specificity to target sites in the brain <Paper corpusId=\"277910377\" paperTitle=\"(Jiang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. This combinatorial approach leverages both the enhanced circulation provided by the polymer coating and the targeting capability of the attached ligands.\n\nThe physical characteristics of polymer-coated nanoparticles, including size, shape, and flexibility, also significantly influence their BBB penetration capabilities. Studies using three-dimensional human BBB microfluidic models have demonstrated that these parameters impact both nanoparticle association with the brain endothelium and their transport across the BBB <Paper corpusId=\"229241129\" paperTitle=\"(Liao et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"213670058\" paperTitle=\"(Nowak et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. Interestingly, a nonmonotonic dependence on size has been observed, where medium-sized particles (around 200 nm) exhibited higher BBB transport compared to both smaller (100 nm) and larger (500 nm) spheres <Paper corpusId=\"213670058\" paperTitle=\"(Nowak et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPolymer surface modifications are also being explored in conjunction with stimuli-responsive features, creating \"smart\" nanoparticles that can release drugs in response to specific stimuli such as pH changes or the presence of reactive oxygen species <Paper corpusId=\"278496075\" paperTitle=\"(Wu et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. These advanced functionalization approaches, which include both PEGylation and ligand conjugation, have shown promise for enhancing BBB transport and improving drug bioavailability <Paper corpusId=\"278899041\" paperTitle=\"(Narayan et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, polymer-modified nanoparticles can be designed to work synergistically with other BBB-crossing strategies, such as those using cell-penetrating peptides, to further improve delivery efficiency to brain tissues <Paper corpusId=\"272783721\" paperTitle=\"(Strika et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"201204343\" paperTitle=\"(Alexander et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

NPs can be modified and imbued with unique physicochemical properties, ie, the addition of metal or electrical attributes, like MENPs, which facilitates drug transport across the BBB, on demand with the introduction of externally applied electric or magnetic fields, increasing the drug delivery severalfold. NPs can have their surface charges altered to interact with the BBB (negatively charged), hence introducing ionic interaction or pull toward the BBB. This charge alteration increases the drug-loading capacity of NPs and aids in on-demand release of the drugs."

                            "Nanotechnology holds promise to both maintain therapeutic stability and overcome the barriers to brain delivery. There are a wide variety of nanoparticle platforms used for therapeutic delivery to the brain, including polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, hydrogels, and dendrimers. Polymeric nanoparticles can provide controlled drug release, targeting capabilities, and prolonged drug action by protection from proteases, and have been shown to cross an intact or impaired BBB. (Dziubla et al., 2005)83 Nanoparticle size, shape, flexibility, and surface charge can be tailored to overcome steric clearance and non-specific binding to alter pharmacokinetics and improve brain accumulation. (Blanco et al., 2015)(Nowak et al., 2019)(Yellepeddi et al., 2019) With a dense poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) coating, nanoparticles exhibit increased systemic circulation time by reducing interactions that lead to clearance and opsonization. (Nance et al., 2014) Densely-PEG coated nanoparticles up to 114 nm are also capable of diffusive and convective transport through the brain parenchyma. (Zhang et al., 2017)(Nance et al., 2012)",

Nanoparticles (NPs) have previously shown great promise in taking advantage of this increased vascular permeability in other cancers, which results in increased accumulation in these cancers over time due to the accompanying loss of an effective lymph system. NPs have therefore attracted increased attention for treating brain cancer. While this research is just beginning, there have been many successes demonstrated thus far in both the laboratory and clinical setting. This review serves to present the reader with an overview of NPs for treating brain cancer and to provide an outlook on what may come in the future.

                            "Abstract Nanoparticle\u2010based therapeutic formulations are being increasingly explored for the treatment of various ailments. Despite numerous advances, the success of nanoparticle\u2010based technologies in treating brain diseases has been limited. Translational hurdles of nanoparticle therapies are attributed primarily to their limited ability to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), which is one of the body's most exclusive barriers. Several efforts have been focused on developing affinity\u2010based agents and using them to increase nanoparticle accumulation at the brain endothelium. Very little is known about the role of fundamental physical parameters of nanoparticles such as size, shape, and flexibility in determining their interactions with and penetration across the BBB. Using a three\u2010dimensional human BBB microfluidic model (\u03bcHuB), we investigate the impact of these physical parameters on nanoparticle penetration across the BBB. To gain insights into the dependence of transport on nanoparticle properties, two separate parameters were measured: the number of nanoparticles that fully cross the BBB and the number that remain associated with the endothelium. Association of nanoparticles with the brain endothelium was substantially impacted by their physical characteristics. Hard particles associate more with the endothelium compared to soft particles, as do small particles compared to large particles, and spherical particles compared to rod\u2010shaped particles. Transport across the BBB also exhibited a dependence on nanoparticle properties. A nonmonotonic dependence on size was observed, where 200\u2009nm particles exhibited higher BBB transport compared to 100 and 500\u2009nm spheres. Rod\u2010shaped particles exhibited higher BBB transport when normalized by endothelial association and soft particles exhibited comparable transport to hard particles when normalized by endothelial association. Tuning nanoparticles' physical parameters could potentially enhance their ability to cross the BBB for therapeutic applications."

                            "Abstract The treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders always remains a challenge for the researchers. The presence of various physiological barriers, primarily the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) limits the accessibility of the brain and hinders the efficacy of various drug therapies. Hence, drug targeting to the brain, particularly to the diseased cells by circumventing the physiological barriers is essential to develop a promising therapy for the treatment of brain disorders. Presently, the investigations emphasize the role of different nanocarrier systems or surface modified target specific novel carrier system to improve the efficiency and reduce the side effects of the brain therapeutics. Such approaches supposed to circumvent the BBB or have the ability to cross the barrier function and thus increases the drug concentration in the brain. Although the efficacy of novel carrier system depends upon various physiological factors like active efflux transport, protein corona of the brain, stability, and toxicity of the nanocarrier, physicochemical properties, patient-related factors and many more. Hence, to develop a promising carrier system, it is essential to understand the physiology of the brain and BBB and also the other associated factors. Along with this, some alternative route like direct nose-to-brain drug delivery can also offer a better means to access the brain without exposure of the BBB. In this review, we have discussed the role of various physiological barriers including the BBB and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) on the drug therapy and the mechanism of drug transport across the BBB. Further, we discussed different novel strategies for brain targeting of drug including, polymeric nanoparticles, lipidic nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, liposomes, nanogels, nanoemulsions, dendrimers, quantum dots, etc. along with the intranasal drug delivery to the brain. We have also illustrated various factors affecting the drug targeting efficiency of the developed novel carrier system."

Lactoferrin-modified nanoparticles have demonstrated enhanced brain targeting capabilities <Paper corpusId=\"271654496\" paperTitle=\"(Budiman et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

One study revealed that nanoparticles labeled with three different ligands targeting multiple transporters of brain endothelial cells promoted improved transfer and delivery of molecules across the BBB <Paper corpusId=\"245622624\" paperTitle=\"(Veszelka et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "Receptor-mediated transcytosis has been widely studied as a possible strategy to transport neurotherapeutics across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Monoclonal antibodies directed against the transferrin receptor (TfR) have been proposed as potential carrier candidates. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in their cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking is required and could critically contribute to the improvement of delivery methods. Accordingly, we studied here the trafficking of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with the 8D3 anti-transferrin receptor antibody at the mouse BBB. 8D3-AuNPs were intravenously administered to mice and allowed to recirculate for a range of times, from 10 min to 24 h, before brain extraction and analysis by transmission electron microscope techniques. Our results indicated a TfR-mediated and clathrin-dependent internalization process by which 8D3-AuNPs internalize individually in vesicles. These vesicles then follow at least two different routes. On one hand, most vesicles enter intracellular processes of vesicular fusion and rearrangement in which the AuNPs end up accumulating in late endosomes, multivesicular bodies or lysosomes, which present a high AuNP content. On the other hand, a small percentage of the vesicles follow a different route in which they fuse with the abluminal membrane and open to the basal membrane. In these cases, the 8D3-AuNPs remain attached to the abluminal membrane, which suggests an endosomal escape, but not dissociation from TfR. Altogether, although receptor-mediated transport continues to be one of the most promising strategies to overcome the BBB, different optimization approaches need to be developed for efficient drug delivery."

Various mesoporous biomaterials are exploited and applied as efficient nanocarriers to loading drugs by virtue of their large surface area, high porosity, and prominent biocompatibility. Nanosized mesoporous nanocarriers show great potential in biomedical research, and it has become the research hotspot in the interdisciplinary field. Herein, recent progress and assembly mechanisms on mesoporous inorganic biomaterials (e.g., silica, carbon, metal oxide) are summarized systematically, and typical functionalization methods (i.e., hybridization, polymerization, and doping) for nanocarriers are also discussed in depth. Particularly, structure\u2013activity relationship and the effect of physicochemical parameters of mesoporous biomaterials, including morphologies (e.g., hollow, core\u2013shell), pore textures (e.g., pore size, pore volume), and surface features (e.g., roughness and hydrophilic/hydrophobic) in DDS application are overviewed and elucidated in detail. As one of the important development directions, advanced stimuli\u2010responsive DDSs (e.g., pH, temperature, redox, ultrasound, light, magnetic field) are highlighted. Finally, the prospect of mesoporous biomaterials in disease therapeutics is stated, and it will open a new spring for the development of mesoporous nanocarriers."

This is a process in which nanoparticles connect to certain receptors on cell surfaces, including the blood-brain barrier (BBB), to facilitate their transportation across biological barriers. The presence of functional groups on the surface of mesoporous silica can augment the solubility and stability of hydrophobic medicines such as resveratrol, hence enhancing their bioavailability and capacity to penetrate target tissues. Functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles have a small particle size of approximately 140 nm and have an optimal surface charge. These characteristics enable them to efficiently cross cellular membranes and biological barriers, hence improving the drug's ability to reach its intended target. Surface changes can be engineered to specifically target particular tissues or cells, hence enhancing the precision and effectiveness of medication delivery."

This delivery system specifically degrades and releases the drug in ischemic brain regions, significantly reducing infarction, improving neurological function, and inhibiting apoptosis [82]. Qi et al. created a dual-modified liposome using lactoferrin and musk, which effectively crossed the BBB and enhanced the brain-targeting efficacy of docetaxel, resulting in more potent glioma treatment (Qi et al., 2022).

                            "Abstract Glioma is one of the most aggressive malignant diseases for human health. It is difficult to resect completely due to their invasiveness. The targeted delivery, as a noninvasive approach, is a major strategy for the development of treatments for brain tumors. Lactoferrin (Lf) receptors are over\u2010expressed in both brain endothelial cells and glioma cells. Macromolecular Lf modified nanoparticles have been shown to enhance the brain targeting. Muscone is a \"guide\" drug that have been demonstrated to promote liposomes into the brain by modification. To further enhance the brain\u2010targeting efficacy of Lf modified carriers, we designed that Lf and muscone dual\u2010modified liposomes cross blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and target to brain for enhanced docetaxel (DTX) brain delivery. The results showed that we successfully prepared Lf and muscone dual\u2010modified liposomes (Lf\u2010LP\u2010Mu\u2010DTX), the number of Lf molecules connected to the surface of per liposome was 28. Lf\u2010LP\u2010Mu\u2010DTX increased uptake in both U87\u2010MG cells and hCMEC/D3 cells, enhanced penetration of U87\u2010MG tumor spheroid and in vitro BBB model, had better in vitro and in vivo anti\u2010tumor effects. In conclusion, \"guide\" of muscone modification enhanced brain\u2010targeting efficacy of Lf modified liposomes, Lf and muscone dual\u2010modified docetaxel loaded liposomes present a potential brain\u2010targeting drug delivery system for use in the future treatment of gliomas."

This system was used to model transport of liposomal drug nanocarriers engineered with a peptide ligand Angiopep-2 (Ang-2). Interestingly, when liposomes were introduced into the device maintained in static culture conditions, Ang-2-functionalized nanocarriers showed a significantly higher degree of binding to the apical surface of the brain endothelial cells compared to non-functionalized control (Fig. 2d). Under flow conditions, Ang-2 conjugation enhanced the ability of the nanoparticles to penetrate the endothelial monolayer without affecting barrier function. These results were consistent with the previously demonstrated ability of Ang-2 to facilitate delivery of anticancer drugs across the BBB [77]78]."

While positive charges enhance BBB interactions, excessive positive charges may cause toxicity to the barrier <Paper corpusId=\"244168314\" paperTitle=\"(Daou et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

NPs can be modified and imbued with unique physicochemical properties, ie, the addition of metal or electrical attributes, like MENPs, which facilitates drug transport across the BBB, on demand with the introduction of externally applied electric or magnetic fields, increasing the drug delivery severalfold. NPs can have their surface charges altered to interact with the BBB (negatively charged), hence introducing ionic interaction or pull toward the BBB. This charge alteration increases the drug-loading capacity of NPs and aids in on-demand release of the drugs."

                            "There are a number of alterations that may be required for the nanodelivery systems to be more effective. The zeta surface charge is an important parameter for nanoparticle delivery through the BBB, as a study showed that highly positive surface charged nanovehicles might cause toxicity to the BBB [44]. Gao et al. (Gao et al., 2014) and Jallouli et al. (Jallouli et al., 2007) showed efficient drug delivery of positively surface charged (above 15 mV) vehicles across the BBB. These results are significant, as brain drug delivery is regulated by multiple factors, including size, shape, hydrophobicity, and surface charge. Having control over these features can help permeate through the BBB and help improve the therapeutic agent's stability when in circulation (Goldsmith et al., 2014)[48](Lockman et al., 2002). In addition, the alteration of the size of the nanoparticles is essential in order to infiltrate the blood-brain barrier; this can be achieved through the potential modification of chitosan or polypyrrole. Several studies have shown an inverse correlation between the nanoparticle size and the BBB penetration (Etame et al., 2011)(Hanada et al., 2014)(Sonavane et al., 2008). The smaller the nanoparticles, the higher the penetration of the nanovehicle through the BBB. Furthermore, the shape of the nanovehicles influences the body distribution and cellular uptake (Decuzzi et al., 2010)."

                            "The extremely low permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses the greatest impediment in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Recent work indicated that BBB permeability can be up-regulated by activating A2A adenosine receptor (AR), which temporarily increases intercellular spaces between the brain capillary endothelial cells. However, due to transient circulation lifetime of adenosine-based agonists, their capability to enhance brain delivery of drugs, especially macromolecular drugs, is limited. In this work, a series of nanoagonists (NAs) were developed by labeling different copies of A2A AR activating ligands on dendrimers. In vitro transendothelial electrical resistance measurements demonstrated that the NAs increased permeability of the endothelial cell monolayer by compromising the tightness of tight junctions, the key structure that restricts the entry of blood-borne molecules into the brain. In vivo imaging studies indicated the remarkably up-regulated brain uptake of a macromolecular model drug (45 kDa) after intravenous injection of NAs. Autoradiographic imaging showed that the BBB opening time-window can be tuned in a range of 0.5-2.0 h by the NAs labeled with different numbers of AR-activating ligands. By choosing a suitable NA, it is possible to maximize brain drug delivery and minimize the uncontrollable BBB leakage by matching the BBB opening time-window with the pharmacokinetics of a therapeutic agent. The NA-mediated brain drug delivery strategy holds promise for the treatment of CNS diseases with improved therapeutic efficiency and reduced side-effects."

                            "The possibility of nanoparticle (NP) uptake to the human central nervous system is a major concern. Recent reports showed that in animal models, nanoparticles (NPs) passed through the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). For the safe use of NPs, it is imperative to evaluate the permeability of NPs through the BBB. Here we used a commercially available in vitro BBB model to evaluate the permeability of NPs for a rapid, easy and reproducible assay. The model is reconstructed by culturing both primary rat brain endothelial cells and pericytes to support the tight junctions of endothelial cells. We used the permeability coefficient (Papp) to determine the permeability of NPs. The size dependency results, using fluorescent silica NPs (30, 100, and 400 nm), revealed that the Papp for the 30 nm NPs was higher than those of the larger silica. The surface charge dependency results using Qdots\u00ae (amino-, carboxyl-, and PEGylated-Qdots), showed that more amino-Qdots passed through the model than the other Qdots. Usage of serum-containing buffer in the model resulted in an overall reduction of permeability. In conclusion, although additional developments are desired to elucidate the NPs transportation, we showed that the BBB model could be useful as a tool to test the permeability of nanoparticles."

                            "Brain disorders have become a serious problem for healthcare worldwide. Nanoparticle-based drugs are one of the emerging therapies and have shown great promise to treat brain diseases. Modifications on particle size and surface charge are two efficient ways to increase the transport efficiency of nanoparticles through brain-blood barrier; however, partly due to the high complexity of brain microstructure and limited visibility of Nanoparticles (NPs), our understanding of how these two modifications can affect the transport of NPs in the brain is insufficient. In this study, a framework, which contains a stochastic geometric model of brain white matter (WM) and a mathematical particle tracing model, was developed to investigate the relationship between particle size/surface charge of the NPs and their effective diffusion coefficients (D) in WM. The predictive capabilities of this method have been validated using published experimental tests. For negatively charged NPs, both particle size and surface charge are positively correlated with D before reaching a size threshold. When Zeta potential (Zp) is less negative than -10 mV, the difference between NPs\u2019 D in WM and pure interstitial fluid (IF) is limited. A deeper understanding on the relationships between particle size/surface charge of NPs and their D in WM has been obtained. The results from this study and the developed modelling framework provide important tools for the development of nano-drugs and nano-carriers to cure brain diseases."

                            "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive type of malignant brain tumor. Current FDA-approved treatments include surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy, while hyperthermia, immunotherapy, and most relevantly, nanoparticle (NP)-mediated delivery systems or combinations thereof have shown promise in preclinical studies. Drug-carrying NPs are a promising approach to brain delivery as a result of their potential to facilitate the crossing of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) via two main types of transcytosis mechanisms: adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (AMT) and receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT). Their ability to accumulate in the brain can thus provide local sustained release of tumoricidal drugs at or near the site of GBM tumors. NP-based drug delivery has the potential to significantly reduce drug-related toxicity, increase specificity, and consequently improve the lifespan and quality of life of patients with GBM. Due to significant advances in the understanding of the molecular etiology and pathology of GBM, the efficacy of drugs loaded into vectors targeting this disease has increased in both preclinical and clinical settings. Multitargeting NPs, such as those incorporating multiple specific targeting ligands, are an innovative technology that can lead to decreased off-target effects while simultaneously having increased accumulation and action specifically at the tumor site. Targeting ligands can include antibodies, or fragments thereof, and peptides or small molecules, which can result in a more controlled drug delivery system compared to conventional drug treatments.

                "text": "\nCell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) represent a powerful class of surface modifications that can significantly enhance nanoparticle transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These peptides are particularly effective due to their small size and positive charge characteristics, which make them highly favorable for transportation across the BBB <Paper corpusId=\"250336023\" paperTitle=\"(Sharma et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. The positive charge of CPPs facilitates interaction with the negatively charged cell membranes of the BBB, promoting cellular uptake through various mechanisms.\n\nAmong the various CPPs, the HIV-1 trans-activating transcriptor (TAT) peptide has emerged as one of the most extensively studied for BBB applications. Nanoparticles modified with TAT have demonstrated remarkable ability to penetrate the BBB and accumulate in brain tissue. This effect is further enhanced when TAT modification is combined with polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating, creating a dual-modified nanoparticle system that shows higher BBB penetration and improved brain accumulation <Paper corpusId=\"21892073\" paperTitle=\"(Parodi et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. The synergistic effect of these modifications\u2014with TAT providing the cell-penetrating capability and PEG increasing circulation time\u2014creates nanoparticles with optimized properties for brain drug delivery.\n\nResearch has shown that TAT-modified nanoparticles can be particularly useful for treating severe brain conditions such as brain tumors. While TAT modification alone does not provide specific targeting to nervous tissue, these particles can effectively accumulate in abnormal tumor vasculature, making them valuable for brain cancer therapy <Paper corpusId=\"21892073\" paperTitle=\"(Parodi et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach leverages the enhanced permeability and retention effect commonly observed in tumor tissues.\n\nAdvanced approaches have been developed to further enhance the BBB-crossing capabilities of CPP-modified nanoparticles. For instance, Wang and colleagues demonstrated that conjugating TAT peptides to protein-based nanoparticles encapsulated with the zwitterionic polymer PMPC created a delivery platform with exceptional properties for CNS applications. This dual-modified system showed strong resistance to nonspecific adsorption (due to the PMPC coating), resulting in extended circulation lifetime, enhanced BBB permeability, and longer retention time inside the brain in mouse models <Paper corpusId=\"99491642\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe versatility of CPPs extends beyond traditional nanoparticle formulations. Recent developments have explored the use of CPPs conjugated to nanoparticles carrying messenger RNA (mRNA), significantly improving their delivery efficiency to brain tissues <Paper corpusId=\"272783721\" paperTitle=\"(Strika et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"9416016\" paperTitle=\"(Fan et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach shows particular promise for gene therapy applications targeting neurological disorders.\n\nWhen considering the broader landscape of brain-targeting modifications, CPPs can be integrated with other targeting strategies such as transferrin and lactoferrin conjugation. These protein-based modifications target specific receptors abundantly expressed in the brain region, creating multi-functional nanoparticles with enhanced BBB penetration capabilities <Paper corpusId=\"250336023\" paperTitle=\"(Sharma et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This combinatorial approach allows researchers to leverage multiple transport mechanisms simultaneously, potentially overcoming the limitations of single-modification strategies.",

Various surface modifica-tion methods result in mucoadhesive NPs, mucus penetrating NPs, protein conjugated, and antibody-conjugated nanoparticles. Other approaches have been applied for targeted delivery, such as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), transferrin, lactoferrin and integrin-targeting ligands. CPPs being small and positively charged, are quite favorable for transportation across BBB. Whereas, transferrin and lactoferrin possess unique physiological and biological characteristics, which implies that these can be used in conjugation with the developed nanoparticles for more effective and targeted delivery, especially in the brain region of the affected individual where transferrin and lactoferrin receptors are expressed abundantly."

                            "The use of focused ultrasound (FUS) with microbubbles has been proven to induce transient blood\u2013brain barrier opening (BBB-opening). However, FUS-induced inertial cavitation of microbubbles can also result in erythrocyte extravasations. Here we investigated whether induction of submicron bubbles to oscillate at their resonant frequency would reduce inertial cavitation during BBB-opening and thereby eliminate erythrocyte extravasations in a rat brain model. FUS was delivered with acoustic pressures of 0.1\u20134.5 MPa using either in-house manufactured submicron bubbles or standard SonoVue microbubbles. Wideband and subharmonic emissions from bubbles were used to quantify inertial and stable cavitation, respectively. Erythrocyte extravasations were evaluated by in vivo post-treatment magnetic resonance susceptibility-weighted imaging, and finally by histological confirmation. We found that excitation of submicron bubbles with resonant frequency-matched FUS (10 MHz) can greatly limit inertial cavitation while enhancing stable cavitation. The BBB-opening was mainly caused by stable cavitation, whereas the erythrocyte extravasation was closely correlated with inertial cavitation. Our technique allows extensive reduction of inertial cavitation to induce safe BBB-opening. Furthermore, the safety issue of BBB-opening was not compromised by prolonging FUS exposure time, and the local drug concentrations in the brain tissues were significantly improved to 60 times (BCNU; 18.6 \u00b5g versus 0.3 \u00b5g) by using chemotherapeutic agent-loaded submicron bubbles with FUS. This study provides important information towards the goal of successfully translating FUS brain drug delivery into clinical use."

The spheroids used here were composed of six brain cell types: Astrocytes, pericytes, endothelial cells, microglia cells, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. They form an in vitro BBB that regulates the transport of compounds into the spheroid. The penetration of fluorescent ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (core diameter 2 nm; hydrodynamic diameter 3\u20134 nm) across the BBB was studied as a function of time by confocal laser scanning microscopy, with the dissolved fluorescent dye (FAM-alkyne) as a control. The nanoparticles readily entered the interior of the spheroid, whereas the dissolved dye alone did not penetrate the BBB. We present a model that is based on a time-dependent opening of the BBB for nanoparticles, followed by a rapid diffusion into the center of the spheroid. After the spheroids underwent hypoxia (0.1% O2; 24 h), the BBB was more permeable, permitting the uptake of more nanoparticles and also of dissolved dye molecules. Together with our previous observations that such nanoparticles can easily enter cells and even the cell nucleus, these data provide evidence that ultrasmall nanoparticle can cross the blood brain barrier."

                            "Infectious or immune diseases have caused serious threat to human health due to their complexity and specificity, and emerging drug delivery systems (DDSs) have evolved into the most promising therapeutic strategy for drug\u2010targeted therapy. Various mesoporous biomaterials are exploited and applied as efficient nanocarriers to loading drugs by virtue of their large surface area, high porosity, and prominent biocompatibility. Nanosized mesoporous nanocarriers show great potential in biomedical research, and it has become the research hotspot in the interdisciplinary field. Herein, recent progress and assembly mechanisms on mesoporous inorganic biomaterials (e.g., silica, carbon, metal oxide) are summarized systematically, and typical functionalization methods (i.e., hybridization, polymerization, and doping) for nanocarriers are also discussed in depth. Particularly, structure\u2013activity relationship and the effect of physicochemical parameters of mesoporous biomaterials, including morphologies (e.g., hollow, core\u2013shell), pore textures (e.g., pore size, pore volume), and surface features (e.g., roughness and hydrophilic/hydrophobic) in DDS application are overviewed and elucidated in detail. As one of the important development directions, advanced stimuli\u2010responsive DDSs (e.g., pH, temperature, redox, ultrasound, light, magnetic field) are highlighted. Finally, the prospect of mesoporous biomaterials in disease therapeutics is stated, and it will open a new spring for the development of mesoporous nanocarriers."

A drug-carrying nanoparticle based on pterostilbene (Pte) and black phosphorus (BP) was developed by Yin et al. Polydopamine (PDA) was applied to modify it, resulting in the formation of the BP-Pte@PDA delivery system. This delivery system specifically degrades and releases the drug in ischemic brain regions, significantly reducing infarction, improving neurological function, and inhibiting apoptosis [82]. Qi et al. created a dual-modified liposome using lactoferrin and musk, which effectively crossed the BBB and enhanced the brain-targeting efficacy of docetaxel, resulting in more potent glioma treatment (Qi et al., 2022). Wiwatchaitawee et al. coupled polyethylene glycol (PEG) with PAMAM or PEI, which could mitigate their toxicity, and then evaluated biodistribution in a healthy mouse model, which was measured to be highly active and safe (0)."

                            "Abstract Glioma is one of the most aggressive malignant diseases for human health. It is difficult to resect completely due to their invasiveness. The targeted delivery, as a noninvasive approach, is a major strategy for the development of treatments for brain tumors. Lactoferrin (Lf) receptors are over\u2010expressed in both brain endothelial cells and glioma cells. Macromolecular Lf modified nanoparticles have been shown to enhance the brain targeting. Muscone is a \"guide\" drug that have been demonstrated to promote liposomes into the brain by modification. To further enhance the brain\u2010targeting efficacy of Lf modified carriers, we designed that Lf and muscone dual\u2010modified liposomes cross blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and target to brain for enhanced docetaxel (DTX) brain delivery. The results showed that we successfully prepared Lf and muscone dual\u2010modified liposomes (Lf\u2010LP\u2010Mu\u2010DTX), the number of Lf molecules connected to the surface of per liposome was 28. Lf\u2010LP\u2010Mu\u2010DTX increased uptake in both U87\u2010MG cells and hCMEC/D3 cells, enhanced penetration of U87\u2010MG tumor spheroid and in vitro BBB model, had better in vitro and in vivo anti\u2010tumor effects. In conclusion, \"guide\" of muscone modification enhanced brain\u2010targeting efficacy of Lf modified liposomes, Lf and muscone dual\u2010modified docetaxel loaded liposomes present a potential brain\u2010targeting drug delivery system for use in the future treatment of gliomas."

The most effective surface modifications typically engage multiple mechanisms simultaneously, with receptor-mediated pathways particularly enhancing specificity and efficacy. (10 sources)",
                "text": "\nUnderstanding the mechanisms by which surface-modified nanoparticles cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is essential for designing effective drug delivery systems. Among these mechanisms, receptor-mediated transcytosis represents one of the most frequently employed and successful strategies. This process involves nanoparticles binding to specific receptors on brain endothelial cells, triggering internalization through receptor-mediated vesicular fusion and rearrangement <Paper corpusId=\"174798792\" paperTitle=\"(Khongkow et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"20863171\" paperTitle=\"(Wilhelm et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>. Gold nanoparticles tagged with transferrin or antibodies against transferrin receptors utilize this pathway to achieve brain internalization through a TfR-mediated and clathrin-dependent process <Paper corpusId=\"174798792\" paperTitle=\"(Khongkow et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"21284359\" paperTitle=\"(Cabezon et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nApolipoprotein-mediated transport represents another crucial mechanism for BBB penetration. Surfactant coatings such as polysorbate 80 and poloxamer 188 facilitate this process by enabling the adsorption of plasma apolipoproteins, particularly apolipoprotein E (ApoE), onto the nanoparticle surface. This modification essentially mimics low-density lipoproteins (LDL), allowing recognition by LDL receptors expressed on brain endothelial cells and subsequent transport via receptor-mediated endocytosis <Paper corpusId=\"225464702\" paperTitle=\"(Hartl et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"268928188\" paperTitle=\"(Narsinh et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Studies have shown that direct coating with ApoE without a surfactant anchor or covalent coupling of ApoE to nanoparticles leads to significantly improved brain uptake compared to surfactant-mediated approaches <Paper corpusId=\"225464702\" paperTitle=\"(Hartl et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSurface modifications can also enhance BBB penetration by altering membrane interactions. Targeted nanoparticles have been shown to elevate plasma membrane fluidity, indicating the fusion of nanovesicles with endothelial cell membranes <Paper corpusId=\"245622624\" paperTitle=\"(Veszelka et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This mechanism appears particularly effective when multiple targeting ligands are employed simultaneously. Research has demonstrated that nanoparticles labeled with three different ligands targeting multiple transporters of brain endothelial cells promote improved transfer and delivery of molecules across the BBB <Paper corpusId=\"245622624\" paperTitle=\"(Veszelka et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nInhibition of efflux transporters represents another significant mechanism for enhanced BBB penetration. Surfactants such as polysorbate 80 and PEG-D-\u03b1-tocopheryl can enhance BBB permeation by inhibiting the efflux action of P-glycoprotein and solubilizing cell membrane lipids of brain endothelial cells <Paper corpusId=\"10445103\" paperTitle=\"(Kanwar et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. This dual action\u2014inhibiting efflux pumps while facilitating membrane permeation\u2014significantly improves the ability of nanoparticles to deliver their therapeutic payload across the BBB.\n\nThe creation of concentration gradients represents a less-studied but potentially important mechanism. Some researchers have suggested that surfactant coatings help bind nanoparticles to capillary linings, creating concentration gradients that facilitate diffusion <Paper corpusId=\"5143982\" paperTitle=\"(Parratt et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"30272015\" paperTitle=\"(Schroeder et al., 1998)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, these coatings may purposefully induce phagocytosis processes in epithelial cells, providing another route for BBB penetration <Paper corpusId=\"5143982\" paperTitle=\"(Parratt et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSurface charge modifications also significantly impact BBB penetration mechanisms. For instance, cationized bovine serum albumin nanoparticles have demonstrated an eightfold increase in BBB permeability compared to their non-cationized counterparts <Paper corpusId=\"269512854\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This enhancement likely occurs through adsorptive-mediated transcytosis, where positively charged nanoparticles interact with the negatively charged cell membrane, facilitating internalization.\n\nThe most effective surface modifications typically engage multiple mechanisms simultaneously. For example, polysorbate 80-coated polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles not only facilitate apolipoprotein adsorption for receptor-mediated transcytosis but also inhibit P-glycoprotein efflux and potentially increase membrane fluidity <Paper corpusId=\"10445103\" paperTitle=\"(Kanwar et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>. This multi-mechanism approach explains why certain surface modifications, such as polysorbate 80 coating, have demonstrated as much as 20-fold improvement in drug transport across the BBB compared to unmodified nanoparticles <Paper corpusId=\"5143982\" paperTitle=\"(Parratt et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

Unlike blood capillaries elsewhere in the body, the structure of the BBB is characterized by the tight-junctions that are tightly resistant to the exchange of substances between the blood and the nervous tissue (Wilhelm et al., 2014)",
                            "In order to overcome this challenge, several strategies have been developed to enhance penetration of drugs into the brain. Of these, the most frequently used is receptor-mediated transcytosis. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) tagged with transferrin or L-DOPA is one of successful examples for brain targeting. The study of Cabezon, I. et al., 2015 reported that the physical modification of AuNPs with an external antibody against transferrin receptor has successfully achieved for brain internalization using ligand-receptor mediated vesicular fusion and rearrangement within few hours after exposure 37. Similary, our results clearly demonstrate that the transport across BBB of AuNPs after genetically surface modification with RVG-exosome could be enhanced compared to AuNPs coated with unmodified exosomes."

Therefore, adequate in vitro models need to be developed in order to characterize the penetration properties of drug candidates into the central nervous system. This review article summarizes the presently used and the most promising in vitro BBB models based on the culture of brain endothelial cells. Robust models can be obtained using primary porcine brain endothelial cells and rodent coculture models, which have low paracellular permeability and express functional efflux transporters, showing good correlation of drug penetration data with in vivo results. Models mimicking the in vivo anatomophysiological complexity of the BBB are also available, including triple coculture (culture of brain endothelial cells in the presence of pericytes and astrocytes), dynamic, and microfluidic models; however, these are not suitable for rapid, high throughput studies. Potent human cell lines would be needed for easily available and reproducible models which avoid interspecies differences."

                            "Receptor-mediated transcytosis has been widely studied as a possible strategy to transport neurotherapeutics across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Monoclonal antibodies directed against the transferrin receptor (TfR) have been proposed as potential carrier candidates. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in their cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking is required and could critically contribute to the improvement of delivery methods. Accordingly, we studied here the trafficking of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with the 8D3 anti-transferrin receptor antibody at the mouse BBB. 8D3-AuNPs were intravenously administered to mice and allowed to recirculate for a range of times, from 10 min to 24 h, before brain extraction and analysis by transmission electron microscope techniques. Our results indicated a TfR-mediated and clathrin-dependent internalization process by which 8D3-AuNPs internalize individually in vesicles. These vesicles then follow at least two different routes. On one hand, most vesicles enter intracellular processes of vesicular fusion and rearrangement in which the AuNPs end up accumulating in late endosomes, multivesicular bodies or lysosomes, which present a high AuNP content. On the other hand, a small percentage of the vesicles follow a different route in which they fuse with the abluminal membrane and open to the basal membrane. In these cases, the 8D3-AuNPs remain attached to the abluminal membrane, which suggests an endosomal escape, but not dissociation from TfR. Altogether, although receptor-mediated transport continues to be one of the most promising strategies to overcome the BBB, different optimization approaches need to be developed for efficient drug delivery."

                            "Bioadhesive surfactants, such as PEG-D-\u03b1-tocopheryl, polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate or polyvinyl alcohol can certainly enhance adhesion and adsorption by intestinal cells, while masking efflux mechanisms. However, targeting specificity will primarily depend on the physicochemical and biochemical properties of the surfactant. Previous reports underscore the importance of polysorbate 80-coated nanoparticles for brain-specific delivery. Polysorbate 80 surface-modified doxorubicin-loaded and gemcitabine-loaded polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles showed enhanced brain specificity and efficacy compared with unmodified nanoparticles, highlighting the importance of surface modification by surfactants. (Steiniger et al., 2004)(Wang et al., 2009) Another surfactant reported to have the ability to enhance brain permeability is poloxamer 188 (F68) which was found to increase the delivery of drug-loaded polybutylcyanoacrylate and poly(lactide-coglycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles to the brain in rats. (Petri et al., 2007)(Gelperina et al., 2010)",
                            "The plausible mechanism behind enhanced brain permeation by these surfactants is that they inhibit the efflux action of P-glycoprotein and solubilize the cell membrane lipids of brain endothelial cells for entry. 146 Also, polysorbate 80 and F68 surface-modified nanoparticles adsorb apolipoprotein E, apolipoprotein B, or both, mimic low-density lipoproteins, and enter the brain via receptor-mediated endocyto sis."

                            "Nanoparticles coated with polysorbate-80 and polysorbate-85 were found to effectively transport drugs through the barrier (Couto et al., 2009). Later work by Schroeder et al., proposed that these coatings help bind nanoparticles to the lining of the capillaries such that they induce a large concentration gradient which facilitates diffusion or purposefully induce phagocytosis processes in the epithelial cells (Schroeder et al., 1998). Kreuter found that nanoparticles coated with polysorbate-80 transported drugs through the barrier with a 20-fold improvement over the uncoated nanoparticles (Kreuter, 2001). However, he concluded that it is because the polysorbate-80 coating attracts apolipoprotein E from the blood to the surface [62]."

To transport these neuropeptides across the BBB they were adsorbed onto the surface of poly(butylcyanoacrylate) nanoparticles (NPs) and the NPs were coated with polysorbate 80. Central analgesia was measured by the hot plate test in mice. The antidepressant amitriptyline, which normally penetrates the BBB, was used to examine the versatility of the NP method. The concentration of amitriptyline in serum and brain of mice was determined by a gas chromatographic method. Furthermore, NPs were fabricated with different stabilizers. After the adsorption of the peptides on polysorbate 85-stabilized NPs, analgesia was noted after intravenous application when NPs were not coated. The amitriptyline level was significantly enhanced in brain when the substance was adsorbed onto the NP and coated or when the particles were stabilized with polysorbate 85."
