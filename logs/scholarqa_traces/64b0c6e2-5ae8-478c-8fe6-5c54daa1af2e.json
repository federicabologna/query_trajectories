The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in neo-angiogenic tumor tissue enables the transport of therapeutic molecules from the circulation into the tumor, but studies show that further diffusion of these agents is often not sufficient for efficient tumor eradication.

                    "text": "The hypoxic and acidotic condition in tumor tissue further create a hostile microenvironment which impairs the tumoricidal activities of anticancer drugs and immune cells. Aside from these architectural defects, a lot of inflammatory molecules and cytokines, such as VEGF, HIF-1alpha, nitric oxide, bradykinin and proteases, are involved and orchestrate the campaign of nutrients and oxygen supply for aggressive tumor growth and metastasis [1][2][3]. \n\nMaeda and his graduate student Matsumura found that many proteins show the unique behavior of progressive accumulation in tumor tissues during 19 to 72 h. In contrast, small molecules did not achieve such tumoritropic accumulation. They coined the term of the enhanced permeability and retention effect (the EPR effect) to describe this unique functional phenomenon, and advocated a new concept for macromolecular therapeutics in cancer chemotherapy in 1986 [4]. \n\nSince the concept was introduced to the field of cancer chemotherapy, it became one of the most cited principles for nanomedicine drug development [5]. However, the clinical therapeutic benefits are insufficient, the inadequate of the EPR effect was questioned [6,7]. \n\nHuang and his colleagues did a comprehensive and thorough review on the EPR effect and its related tumor vasculature and microenvironment [8]. They uphold the concept of the EPR effects with extensive evidence from literature. They summarized the factors involving the EPR effect in various tumor models and clinical applications. Several attempts at enhancing the EPR effect for improving the delivery efficacies of nanodrug delivery systems were also discussed. \n\nThe key to improving the perfusion and extravasation of anticancer nanodrugs into tumor tissue is to improve the blood flow into tumor tissues. Vascular normalization is one of the hypotheses trying to address the issue of poor blood perfusion into tumor tissues [9]. It is believed that the drugs and oxygen cannot be pumped into tumor tissue if the tumor vasculature is abnormal, thus, temporarily normalizing the tumor vasculature for facilitating drug delivery to become a rational temptation.",

It is also an essential concept for designing anticancer drugs that can be selectively delivered into tumor tissue via the unique extravasation and retention mechanism for macromolecular drugs. As tumor vasculature is highly heterogeneous, the intensities of the EPR effect vary according to the types and locations of solid tumors in different species. However, the EPR effect is universally observed in a broad spectrum of solid tumors in human cancer as well as experimental animal tumor models. The matter is how to utilize the EPR effect for drug design and clinical application. Many hypotheses were proposed and tested to enhance the EPR effect in solid tumors in order to increase the efficacy of drug delivery. However, we should focus on increasing the blood flow in tumors so that more drugs can be perfused and accumulated inside tumor tissue and execute anticancer activities. Angiotensin II co-administration and the approach of intratumor arterial infusion should be considered to achieve selective tumor tissue perfusion for nanodrugs.\n## body\nThe hypoxic and acidotic condition in tumor tissue further create a hostile microenvironment which impairs the tumoricidal activities of anticancer drugs and immune cells. Aside from these architectural defects, a lot of inflammatory molecules and cytokines, such as VEGF, HIF-1alpha, nitric oxide, bradykinin and proteases, are involved and orchestrate the campaign of nutrients and oxygen supply for aggressive tumor growth and metastasis [1][2][3]. \n\nMaeda and his graduate student Matsumura found that many proteins show the unique behavior of progressive accumulation in tumor tissues during 19 to 72 h. In contrast, small molecules did not achieve such tumoritropic accumulation. They coined the term of the enhanced permeability and retention effect (the EPR effect) to describe this unique functional phenomenon, and advocated a new concept for macromolecular therapeutics in cancer chemotherapy in 1986 [4]. \n\nSince the concept was introduced to the field of cancer chemotherapy, it became one of the most cited principles for nanomedicine drug development [5]. However, the clinical therapeutic benefits are insufficient, the inadequate of the EPR effect was questioned [6,7]. \n\nHuang and his colleagues did a comprehensive and thorough review on the EPR effect and its related tumor vasculature and microenvironment [8]. They uphold the concept of the EPR effects with extensive evidence from literature. They summarized the factors involving the EPR effect in various tumor models and clinical applications. Several attempts at enhancing the EPR effect for improving the delivery efficacies of nanodrug delivery systems were also discussed. \n\nThe key to improving the perfusion and extravasation of anticancer nanodrugs into tumor tissue is to improve the blood flow into tumor tissues. Vascular normalization is one of the hypotheses trying to address the issue of poor blood perfusion into tumor tissues [9]. It is believed that the drugs and oxygen cannot be pumped into tumor tissue if the tumor vasculature is abnormal, thus, temporarily normalizing the tumor vasculature for facilitating drug delivery to become a rational temptation.",

            "abstract": "Simple Summary Traditional cancer therapeutics suffer from off-target toxicity, limiting their effective dose and preventing patients\u2019 tumors from being sufficiently treated by chemotherapeutics alone. Nanomedicine is an emerging class of therapeutics in which a drug is packaged into a nanoparticle that promotes uptake of the drug at a tumor site, shielding it from uptake by peripheral organs and enabling the safe delivery of chemotherapeutics that have poor aqueous solubility, short plasma half-life, narrow therapeutic window, and toxic side effects. Despite the advantages of nanomedicines for cancer, there remains significant challenges to improve uptake at the tumor and prevent premature clearance from the body. In this review, we summarize the effects of first-pass metabolism on a nanoparticle\u2019s journey to a tumor and outline future steps that we believe will improve the efficacy of cancer nanomedicines. Abstract Nanomedicines represent the cutting edge of today\u2019s cancer therapeutics. Seminal research decades ago has begun to pay dividends in the clinic, allowing for the delivery of cancer drugs with enhanced systemic circulation while also minimizing off-target toxicity. Despite the advantages of delivering cancer drugs using nanoparticles, micelles, or other nanostructures, only a small fraction of the injected dose reaches the tumor, creating a narrow therapeutic window for an otherwise potent drug. First-pass metabolism of nanoparticles by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) has been identified as a major culprit for the depletion of nanoparticles in circulation before they reach the tumor site. To overcome this, new strategies, materials, and functionalization with stealth polymers have been developed to improve nanoparticle circulation and uptake at the tumor site. This review summarizes the strategies undertaken to evade RES uptake of nanomedicines and improve the passive and active targeting of nanoparticle drugs to solid tumors. We also outline the limitations of current strategies and the future directions we believe will be explored to yield significant benefits to patients and make nanomedicine a promising treatment modality for cancer.",

As tumorigenesis occurs, the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) induces the formation of a disordered, complex vascular network feeding tumor cells as they proliferate. High expression of VEGF in tumor tissue has been implicated in the formation of abnormal vascular wall morphology, where the endothelium lining the blood vessels contains large gaps-or \"leaky\" junctions-allowing for enhanced permeability of small particles and cells across the vascular wall. It is this enhanced permeability that is a double-edged sword for cancer: on the one hand, it is believed to enhance tumor metastasis by allowing the escape of tumor cells into the infiltrating vessels, which circulate them across the body to distant metastatic sites [38]; on the other hand, the leaky vasculature unique to the tumor microenvironment promotes the accumulation of systemically circulating nanoparticles at the tumor site, a phenomenon that should enhance the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle drugs against solid tumors. Despite the premise of the EPR effect to preferentially enhance the uptake of nanoparticles in tumors, the challenges we have outlined above clearly indicate there remains significant room for improving nanoparticle delivery. Uptake into tumor tissue via the EPR effect alone has been found to result in a mere 2-fold increase in accumulation of systemically injected drugs [39]. While drugs piggybacking on the EPR effect have excelled in preclinical models, they have yet to find clinical success in humans [40]. For many anti-cancer drugs, such as chemotherapeutics that are inherently toxic, systemic injection of even nanoparticle formulations must be done at very high doses to achieve significant drug accumulation via the EPR effect; this occurs, however, at the cost of off-target toxicity that limits the administered dose and therefore, the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs [39].",

Saha\n## Abstract\nSimple Summary Traditional cancer therapeutics suffer from off-target toxicity, limiting their effective dose and preventing patients\u2019 tumors from being sufficiently treated by chemotherapeutics alone. Nanomedicine is an emerging class of therapeutics in which a drug is packaged into a nanoparticle that promotes uptake of the drug at a tumor site, shielding it from uptake by peripheral organs and enabling the safe delivery of chemotherapeutics that have poor aqueous solubility, short plasma half-life, narrow therapeutic window, and toxic side effects. Despite the advantages of nanomedicines for cancer, there remains significant challenges to improve uptake at the tumor and prevent premature clearance from the body. In this review, we summarize the effects of first-pass metabolism on a nanoparticle\u2019s journey to a tumor and outline future steps that we believe will improve the efficacy of cancer nanomedicines. Abstract Nanomedicines represent the cutting edge of today\u2019s cancer therapeutics. Seminal research decades ago has begun to pay dividends in the clinic, allowing for the delivery of cancer drugs with enhanced systemic circulation while also minimizing off-target toxicity. Despite the advantages of delivering cancer drugs using nanoparticles, micelles, or other nanostructures, only a small fraction of the injected dose reaches the tumor, creating a narrow therapeutic window for an otherwise potent drug. First-pass metabolism of nanoparticles by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) has been identified as a major culprit for the depletion of nanoparticles in circulation before they reach the tumor site. To overcome this, new strategies, materials, and functionalization with stealth polymers have been developed to improve nanoparticle circulation and uptake at the tumor site. This review summarizes the strategies undertaken to evade RES uptake of nanomedicines and improve the passive and active targeting of nanoparticle drugs to solid tumors. We also outline the limitations of current strategies and the future directions we believe will be explored to yield significant benefits to patients and make nanomedicine a promising treatment modality for cancer.\n## The Never-Ending Controversy of the EPR Effect\nThe enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is historically one of the most frequently cited advantages of nanoparticle cancer therapeutics [37]. As tumorigenesis occurs, the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) induces the formation of a disordered, complex vascular network feeding tumor cells as they proliferate. High expression of VEGF in tumor tissue has been implicated in the formation of abnormal vascular wall morphology, where the endothelium lining the blood vessels contains large gaps-or \"leaky\" junctions-allowing for enhanced permeability of small particles and cells across the vascular wall. It is this enhanced permeability that is a double-edged sword for cancer: on the one hand, it is believed to enhance tumor metastasis by allowing the escape of tumor cells into the infiltrating vessels, which circulate them across the body to distant metastatic sites [38]; on the other hand, the leaky vasculature unique to the tumor microenvironment promotes the accumulation of systemically circulating nanoparticles at the tumor site, a phenomenon that should enhance the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle drugs against solid tumors. Despite the premise of the EPR effect to preferentially enhance the uptake of nanoparticles in tumors, the challenges we have outlined above clearly indicate there remains significant room for improving nanoparticle delivery. Uptake into tumor tissue via the Cellular internalization of nanoparticles is achieved either passively or actively, although the lines between these two methods of internalization have been somewhat blurred as researchers continue to develop new methods of characterizing and enhancing nanoparticle uptake by tumor cells. Santi\u00e0 et al. reviewed various methods of nanoparticle surface functionalization and found that methods such as PEGylation enhance the passive internalization of nanoparticles [36]. Analytical methods such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been used to visualize accumulation of passively internalized nanoparticles in endosomes, and continued functionalization of nanoparticle coronas with ligands such as cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have further enhanced nanoparticle uptake into tumor cells.\n...\nThe enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is historically one of the most frequently cited advantages of nanoparticle cancer therapeutics [37].

Despite the premise of the EPR effect to preferentially enhance the uptake of nanoparticles in tumors, the challenges we have outlined above clearly indicate there remains significant room for improving nanoparticle delivery. Uptake into tumor tissue via the EPR effect alone has been found to result in a mere 2-fold increase in accumulation of systemically injected drugs [39]. While drugs piggybacking on the EPR effect have excelled in preclinical models, they have yet to find clinical success in humans [40]. For many anti-cancer drugs, such as chemotherapeutics that are inherently toxic, systemic injection of even nanoparticle formulations must be done at very high doses to achieve significant drug accumulation via the EPR effect; this occurs, however, at the cost of off-target toxicity that limits the administered dose and therefore, the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs [39].",

Although passive targeting does not involve specific ligand-receptor interactions, it allows for the preferential concentration of nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment, thereby increasing the local concentration of the drug and enhancing its efficacy. \n\nWhile passive targeting is inherently less selective than active targeting, it plays a crucial role in delivering nanoparticles to solid tumors, including CRC. The EPR effect is particularly effective for larger nanoparticles, such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, which can accumulate in tumor tissues more readily than smaller particles. However, the effectiveness of the EPR effect can vary significantly between patients and tumor types, leading to variability in therapeutic outcomes. For example, tumors with dense stromal tissue or poor vasculature may exhibit a reduced EPR effect, limiting the accumulation of nanoparticles. \n\nTo address these limitations, combining passive and active targeting strategies has been proposed as a synergistic approach that can enhance the specificity and efficacy of nanoparticlebased drug delivery systems. For instance, nanoparticles that initially accumulate in the tumor via the EPR effect can be further targeted to specific cancer cells using surface ligands, thus providing a dual-targeting approach that maximizes drug delivery and minimizes off-target effects. This dual-targeting strategy has been shown to improve therapeutic outcomes in preclinical models of CRC by ensuring that the drug is delivered directly to the tumor cells, even in heterogeneous tumor environments. \n\nOverall, the integration of active and passive targeting strategies represents a promising approach for improving the precision and effectiveness of nanoparticle-based therapies for CRC. As research continues to advance, the development of more sophisticated targeting mechanisms will likely lead to even greater improvements in the treatment of this challenging disease.",

Burton\n## Abstract\nColorectal cancer (CRC) continues to be a significant global health burden, prompting the need for more effective and targeted therapeutic strategies. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have emerged as a promising approach to address the limitations of conventional chemotherapy, offering enhanced specificity, reduced systemic toxicity, and improved therapeutic outcomes. This paper provides an in-depth review of the current advancements in the application of nanoparticles as vehicles for targeted drug delivery in CRC therapy. It covers a variety of nanoparticle types, including liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), with a focus on their design, functionalization, and mechanisms of action. This review also examines the challenges associated with the clinical translation of these technologies and explores future directions, emphasizing the potential of nanoparticle-based systems to revolutionize CRC treatment.\n## Passive Targeting\nPassive targeting is another important strategy that exploits the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, a phenomenon whereby nanoparticles preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues due to the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage that are characteristic of solid tumors. Although passive targeting does not involve specific ligand-receptor interactions, it allows for the preferential concentration of nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment, thereby increasing the local concentration of the drug and enhancing its efficacy. \n\nWhile passive targeting is inherently less selective than active targeting, it plays a crucial role in delivering nanoparticles to solid tumors, including CRC. The EPR effect is particularly effective for larger nanoparticles, such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, which can accumulate in tumor tissues more readily than smaller particles. However, the effectiveness of the EPR effect can vary significantly between patients and tumor types, leading to variability in therapeutic outcomes. For example, tumors with dense stromal tissue or poor vasculature may exhibit a reduced EPR effect, limiting the accumulation of nanoparticles. \n\nTo address these limitations, combining passive and active targeting strategies has been proposed as a synergistic approach that can enhance the specificity and efficacy of nanoparticlebased drug delivery systems. For instance, nanoparticles that initially accumulate in the tumor via the EPR effect can be further targeted to specific cancer cells using surface ligands, thus providing a dual-targeting approach that maximizes drug delivery and minimizes off-target effects. This dual-targeting strategy has been shown to improve therapeutic outcomes in preclinical models of CRC by ensuring that the drug is delivered directly to the tumor cells, even in heterogeneous tumor environments. \n\nOverall, the integration of active and passive targeting strategies represents a promising approach for improving the precision and effectiveness of nanoparticle-based therapies for CRC. As research continues to advance, the development of more sophisticated targeting mechanisms will likely lead to even greater improvements in the treatment of this challenging disease.",

                    "text": "The discovery of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in solid tumors has led to the development of a wide range of nanomedicines, including liposomes, for cancer therapy [1]. The EPR effect describes the preferential accumulation of nanoparticles at tumor sites due to leaky vasculature (i.e. enhanced permeation) and impaired lymphatic drainage (i.e. enhanced retention), in comparison to normal tissue. Nano-sized delivery systems have been shown to result in significant increases in tumor accumulation of drugs in comparison to that achieved following administration of free drug [2]. Yet, despite demonstrating substantial accumulation of drug in many pre-clinical and human tumors [2][3][4], clinically approved liposome formulations, such as DoxilH/CaelyxH (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) and MyocetH (unpegylated liposomal doxorubicin), have only resulted in a modest increase in anti-tumor efficacy relative to the standard of care [5][6][7][8][9]. Major limitations of liposome-based drug delivery are: \n\n(1) variability in the EPR effect and therefore, total tumor accumulation [4]; (2) limited tumor penetration [10]; and (3) slow or limited release of hydrophilic/amphiphilic drugs [11,12]. While it is clear that the poor performance has been linked to a number of factors, one of the most significant is the inability to achieve consistent inter-subject and intra-tumoral accumulation of liposomes [4,10,13,14]. \n\nHeterogeneity in liposome accumulation implies the presence of inter-subject and intra-tumoral variations in the EPR effect.",

Stapleton, M. Milosevic, C. Allen, Jinzi Zheng, M. Dunne, I. Yeung, D. Jaffray\n## Abstract\nThe discovery of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect has resulted in the development of nanomedicines, including liposome-based formulations of drugs, as cancer therapies. The use of liposomes has resulted in substantial increases in accumulation of drugs in solid tumors; yet, significant improvements in therapeutic efficacy have yet to be achieved. Imaging of the tumor accumulation of liposomes has revealed that this poor or variable performance is in part due to heterogeneous inter-subject and intra-tumoral liposome accumulation, which occurs as a result of an abnormal transport microenvironment. A mathematical model that relates liposome accumulation to the underlying transport properties in solid tumors could provide insight into inter and intra-tumoral variations in the EPR effect. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework to describe liposome transport in solid tumors. The mathematical model is based on biophysical transport equations that describe pressure driven fluid flow across blood vessels and through the tumor interstitium. The model was validated by direct comparison with computed tomography measurements of tumor accumulation of liposomes in three preclinical tumor models. The mathematical model was fit to liposome accumulation curves producing predictions of transport parameters that reflect the tumor microenvironment. Notably, all fits had a high coefficient of determination and predictions of interstitial fluid pressure agreed with previously published independent measurements made in the same tumor type. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the model attributed inter-subject heterogeneity in liposome accumulation to variations in peak interstitial fluid pressure. These findings highlight the relationship between transvascular and interstitial flow dynamics and variations in the EPR effect. In conclusion, we have presented a theoretical framework that predicts inter-subject and intra-tumoral variations in the EPR effect based on fundamental properties of the tumor microenvironment and forms the basis for transport modeling of liposome drug delivery.\n## Introduction\nThe discovery of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in solid tumors has led to the development of a wide range of nanomedicines, including liposomes, for cancer therapy [1]. The EPR effect describes the preferential accumulation of nanoparticles at tumor sites due to leaky vasculature (i.e. enhanced permeation) and impaired lymphatic drainage (i.e. enhanced retention), in comparison to normal tissue. Nano-sized delivery systems have been shown to result in significant increases in tumor accumulation of drugs in comparison to that achieved following administration of free drug [2]. Yet, despite demonstrating substantial accumulation of drug in many pre-clinical and human tumors [2][3][4], clinically approved liposome formulations, such as DoxilH/CaelyxH (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) and MyocetH (unpegylated liposomal doxorubicin), have only resulted in a modest increase in anti-tumor efficacy relative to the standard of care [5][6][7][8][9]. Major limitations of liposome-based drug delivery are: \n\n(1) variability in the EPR effect and therefore, total tumor accumulation [4]; (2) limited tumor penetration [10]; and (3) slow or limited release of hydrophilic/amphiphilic drugs [11,12]. While it is clear that the poor performance has been linked to a number of factors, one of the most significant is the inability to achieve consistent inter-subject and intra-tumoral accumulation of liposomes [4,10,13,14]. \n\nHeterogeneity in liposome accumulation implies the presence of inter-subject and intra-tumoral variations in the EPR effect.",

Despite the discovery and synthesis of hundreds of thousands of anticancer compounds targeting various crucial units in cancer cell proliferation and metabolism, the fundamental problem is the lack of targeting delivery of these compounds selectively into solid tumor tissue to maintain an effective concentration level for a certain length of time for drug-tumor interaction to execute anticancer activities. The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) describes a universal pathophysiological phenomenon and mechanism in which macromolecular compounds such as albumin and other polymer-conjugated drugs beyond certain sizes (above 40 kDa) can progressively accumulate in the tumor vascularized area and thus achieve targeting delivery and retention of anticancer compounds into solid tumor tissue. Targeting therapy via the EPR effect in clinical practice is not always successful since the strength of the EPR effect varies depending on the type and location of tumors, status of blood perfusion in tumors, and the physical-chemical properties of macromolecular anticancer agents. This review highlights the significance of the concept and mechanism of the EPR effect and discusses methods for better utilizing the EPR effect in developing smarter macromolecular nanomedicine to achieve a satisfactory outcome in clinical applications.",

This review highlights the significance of the concept and mechanism of the EPR effect and discusses methods for better utilizing the EPR effect in developing smarter macromolecular nanomedicine to achieve a satisfactory outcome in clinical applications.\n## Introduction\nIt is crucial to understand the pathophysiological characteristics of solid tumor growth, especially the compound transportation regulation of the tumor vasculature, in order to achieve selective drug delivery and therapeutic effects for cancer chemotherapy.It has been well observed that tumor vessels are highly permeable to macromolecular compounds.After entering tumor tissue, these macromolecular compounds are trapped inside the tumor tissue for a prolonged period of time.In 1986, Hiroshi Maeda and his colleagues from Kumamoto University School of Medicine coined the term enhanced permeability and retention effect (the EPR effect) to describe the unique pathophysiological phenomenon of the solid tumor vasculature [1].Since this theory is very important for understanding tumor vessel transportation regulation, the EPR effect has been well accepted as one of the universal pathophysiological characteristics of solid tumors, and acts as a fundamental principle for designing and developing tumor-targeting delivery of anticancer drugs [2,3].However, the development of nanomedicine has been frustrated for decades in achieving satisfactory therapeutic benefits in clinical practice.Therefore, the existence and intensity of the EPR effect in human solid tumor circumstances has been debated [4,5].For example, it is considered that the EPR effect is more significant in experimental small animal tumor models than in human tumors.The delivery efficiency of nanoparticles into human tumor tissue is very low compared to that in animal tumor models.The extravasation mechanism for nanoparticles into tumors is not only via the gaps between endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature, but also via the transcellular pathways by vesiculo-vacuolar organelles (VVOs) [6].Therefore, it is crucial to recognize the significance of the EPR effects, its pathophysiological mechanism, its pitfalls, and strategies for better harnessing this concept in drug development and clinical application.\n\n## Conclusions\nThe EPR effect is the fundamental pathophysiological phenomenon of solid tumors universally observed in solid tumors in rodents and humans, as well as in other mam-malian species.It is also the guiding principle for developing nanomedicine (including polymer-conjugated macromolecular anticancer drugs) aimed at passive and progressive drug delivery and retention inside the tumor tissue to achieve selective and highly efficient anticancer outcomes.However due to the heterogeneous strength in various microenvironment situations, the EPR effect has been challenged for its existence and importance in nanomedicine design and application.As a matter of fact, the EPR effect has been observed in human tumor tissues for various macromolecular compounds.When discussing the heterogeneity of the EPR effect, it should be clear that the heterogeneity is confined to the strength of the accumulation and retention of the EPR effect that varies in different types of solid tumors under various tissue environments.\n\nThe real challenge is how to utilize the EPR effect in designing and improving the therapeutic efficacy of nanomedicine.There are several enhancing strategies to improve delivery and accumulation efficacies, such as optimal size and surface charge, smarter mechanism for drug release and administration kinetics.Due to their rigid structure property, the accumulation performance of nanoparticles in tumor tissues may not necessarily be the same as with other macromolecules such as linear polymers and biological macromolecules such as albumins.Therefore, further modification of nanoparticles with polymers to improve the affinity of the nanoparticles with tumor related endothelial cells may be necessary.\n\nBlood flow plays a critical role in delivering nanomedicines into tumor tissues.Arterial infusion via a tumor-feeding artery, and the timing of using tumor blood flow enhancers or EPR effect modulators should be applied to nanomedicine to achieve better therapeutic effects.As the strength of the EPR effect is quite different between small animal tumor models and human tumors, the selection of big animal models is also critical for guiding the design of nanomedicine by properly estimating the efficacy of tumor-targeting delivery via the EPR effect.Companion animal tumor models such as canine cancer should be utilized to guide the development of nanomedicine.",

When SMANCS was administered to mice, drug accumulation in tumors was markedly increased compared with accumulation of the parental drug NCS. This momentous result led to discovery of the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) in 1986. Later, the EPR effect became known worldwide, especially in nanomedicine, and is still believed to be a universal mechanism for tumor-selective accumulation of nanomedicines. Some research groups recently characterized the EPR effect as a controversial concept and stated that it has not been fully demonstrated in clinical settings, but this erroneous belief is due to non-standard drug design and use of inappropriate tumor models in investigations. Many research groups recently provided solid evidence of the EPR effect in human cancers (e.g., renal and breast), with significant diversity and heterogeneity in various patients. In this review, we focus on the dynamics of the EPR effect and restoring tumor blood flow by using EPR effect enhancers. We also discuss new applications of EPR-based nanomedicine in boron neutron capture therapy and photodynamic therapy for solid tumors.",

                    "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is a property of macromolecules larger than 40 kDa or even 800 kDa (even as large as bacteria); these macromolecules include proteins such as albumin and immunoglobulin-G (IgG), polymer conjugates, liposomes, micellar drugs, nanoparticles, and other biocompatible macromolecular compounds [1][2][3][4][5]. The macromolecules tend to accumulate in tumor tissues much more than in normal tissues [1][2][3][4][5]. In 1986, Matsumura and Maeda found that the underlying mechanism of tumor-selective drug targeting is based on the unique characteristics of tumor blood vessels [6]. The causes of the EPR effect are (i) defective tumor blood vessels; (ii) various vascular effectors including nitric oxide (NO), bradykinin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), carbon monoxide (CO) produced by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and prostaglandins (e.g., prostaglandin E 2 , prostaglandin I 2 ) that facilitate extravasation; and (iii) impaired lymphatic clearance, so that macromolecular drugs remain in tumor tissues for extended periods [1,4,[7][8][9][10]. The EPR effect occurs not only in primary cancers but also in metastatic cancers including lymphatic, liver, and lung metastases and in inflamed tissues [4,[10][11][12]. Different researchers throughout the world have extensively verified the EPR effect in different tumor models as well as in cancer patients [2,[13][14][15]. \n\nThe heterogeneity of tumor tissues is another important issue because the EPR effect depends on tumor blood flow: no blood flow suggests a poor EPR effect or no EPR effect at all [10,11,16,17].",

Niidome, T. Sawa\n## Abstract\nIn 1979, development of the first polymer drug SMANCS [styrene-co-maleic acid (SMA) copolymer conjugated to neocarzinostatin (NCS)] by Maeda and colleagues was a breakthrough in the cancer field. When SMANCS was administered to mice, drug accumulation in tumors was markedly increased compared with accumulation of the parental drug NCS. This momentous result led to discovery of the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) in 1986. Later, the EPR effect became known worldwide, especially in nanomedicine, and is still believed to be a universal mechanism for tumor-selective accumulation of nanomedicines. Some research groups recently characterized the EPR effect as a controversial concept and stated that it has not been fully demonstrated in clinical settings, but this erroneous belief is due to non-standard drug design and use of inappropriate tumor models in investigations. Many research groups recently provided solid evidence of the EPR effect in human cancers (e.g., renal and breast), with significant diversity and heterogeneity in various patients. In this review, we focus on the dynamics of the EPR effect and restoring tumor blood flow by using EPR effect enhancers. We also discuss new applications of EPR-based nanomedicine in boron neutron capture therapy and photodynamic therapy for solid tumors.\n## Introduction\nThe enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is a property of macromolecules larger than 40 kDa or even 800 kDa (even as large as bacteria); these macromolecules include proteins such as albumin and immunoglobulin-G (IgG), polymer conjugates, liposomes, micellar drugs, nanoparticles, and other biocompatible macromolecular compounds [1][2][3][4][5]. The macromolecules tend to accumulate in tumor tissues much more than in normal tissues [1][2][3][4][5]. In 1986, Matsumura and Maeda found that the underlying mechanism of tumor-selective drug targeting is based on the unique characteristics of tumor blood vessels [6]. The causes of the EPR effect are (i) defective tumor blood vessels; (ii) various vascular effectors including nitric oxide (NO), bradykinin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), carbon monoxide (CO) produced by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and prostaglandins (e.g., prostaglandin E 2 , prostaglandin I 2 ) that facilitate extravasation; and (iii) impaired lymphatic clearance, so that macromolecular drugs remain in tumor tissues for extended periods [1,4,[7][8][9][10]. The EPR effect occurs not only in primary cancers but also in metastatic cancers including lymphatic, liver, and lung metastases and in inflamed tissues [4,[10][11][12]. Different researchers throughout the world have extensively verified the EPR effect in different tumor models as well as in cancer patients [2,[13][14][15]. \n\nThe heterogeneity of tumor tissues is another important issue because the EPR effect depends on tumor blood flow: no blood flow suggests a poor EPR effect or no EPR effect at all [10,11,16,17].",

By contrast, several phytochemicals that were found to be effective in cultured cancer cells and animal studies have not shown significant efficacy in humans due to poor bioavailability and absorption, rapid clearance, resistance, and toxicity. Research to overcome these drawbacks by using phytochemical NPs remains in the early stages of clinical translation. Thus, in the current review, we discuss the progress in nanotechnology, research milestones, the molecular mechanisms of phytochemicals encapsulated in NPs, and clinical implications. Several challenges that must be overcome and future research perspectives are also described.",

EPR effect is usually induced by a leaky tumor vasculature by the accelerated angiogenesis and impaired lymphatic drainage by the disorganized growth of tumors [104,105]. In details, NPs with appropriate sizes can evade the tumor capillaries and be retained in the tumor tissues for days due to the lack of lymphatic drainage. Additionally, particles with high positive charges can bind non-specifically to the negatively charged luminal surface due to the presence of sulfate and carboxylate sugar moieties [106]. It is noteworthy that nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins, and bradykinin, which act as vasodilators, can enhance the EPR effect in tumors by increasing their vascular permeability [107]. Furthermore, some nanomedicine formulations are effective in the treatment of multidrug resistance (MDR) [108]. In contrast, Jain et al. [109] claimed that elevated interstitial fluid pressure and heterogeneous blood supply limit macromolecular delivery to tumors. Furthermore, a key challenge is the promotion of the EPR effect in patients with EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes since the EPR-insensitive phenotype is known to have smaller endothelial fenestrations, heterogeneously high or low pericyte coverage, more developed and branched vasculatures, a relatively dense ECR, and more developed immune profiles compared to EPR sensitive phenotypes [105]. Thus, the role of EPR is still in question in terms of clinical translation and different human tumor types due to their heterogeneity [105,110]. Among the three major targeted drug delivery methods, namely, passive targeting, active targeting, and physical targeting; passive targeting acts via the EPR effect, by which tumor cells preferentially absorb NPs [111].",

Sim, W. Park, B. Shim, Sung-Hoon Kim\n## Abstract\nBiocompatible nanoparticles (NPs) containing polymers, lipids (liposomes and micelles), dendrimers, ferritin, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, ceramic, magnetic materials, and gold/silver have contributed to imaging diagnosis and targeted cancer therapy. However, only some NP drugs, including Doxil\u00ae (liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin), Abraxane\u00ae (albumin-bound paclitaxel), and Oncaspar\u00ae (PEG-Asparaginase), have emerged on the pharmaceutical market to date. By contrast, several phytochemicals that were found to be effective in cultured cancer cells and animal studies have not shown significant efficacy in humans due to poor bioavailability and absorption, rapid clearance, resistance, and toxicity. Research to overcome these drawbacks by using phytochemical NPs remains in the early stages of clinical translation. Thus, in the current review, we discuss the progress in nanotechnology, research milestones, the molecular mechanisms of phytochemicals encapsulated in NPs, and clinical implications. Several challenges that must be overcome and future research perspectives are also described.\n## The Enhanced Permeability and Retention Effect\nThe enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect first coined by Matsumura and Maeda [16] is defined the phenomenon of macromolecules or high molecular weight drug and nanomedicine accumulation inside solid tumor models compared to healthy tissue counterparts [4]. EPR effect is usually induced by a leaky tumor vasculature by the accelerated angiogenesis and impaired lymphatic drainage by the disorganized growth of tumors [104,105]. In details, NPs with appropriate sizes can evade the tumor capillaries and be retained in the tumor tissues for days due to the lack of lymphatic drainage. Additionally, particles with high positive charges can bind non-specifically to the negatively charged luminal surface due to the presence of sulfate and carboxylate sugar moieties [106]. It is noteworthy that nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins, and bradykinin, which act as vasodilators, can enhance the EPR effect in tumors by increasing their vascular permeability [107]. Furthermore, some nanomedicine formulations are effective in the treatment of multidrug resistance (MDR) [108]. In contrast, Jain et al. [109] claimed that elevated interstitial fluid pressure and heterogeneous blood supply limit macromolecular delivery to tumors. Furthermore, a key challenge is the promotion of the EPR effect in patients with EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes since the EPR-insensitive phenotype is known to have smaller endothelial fenestrations, heterogeneously high or low pericyte coverage, more developed and branched vasculatures, a relatively dense ECR, and more developed immune profiles compared to EPR sensitive phenotypes [105]. Thus, the role of EPR is still in question in terms of clinical translation and different human tumor types due to their heterogeneity [105,110]. Among the three major targeted drug delivery methods, namely, passive targeting, active targeting, and physical targeting; passive targeting acts via the EPR effect, by which tumor cells preferentially absorb NPs [111].",

Fu, J. Xiang\n## Abstract\nUsing nanoparticles to carry and delivery anticancer drugs holds much promise in cancer therapy, but nanoparticles per se are lacking specificity. Active targeting, that is, using specific ligands to functionalize nanoparticles, is attracting much attention in recent years. Aptamers, with their several favorable features like high specificity and affinity, small size, very low immunogenicity, relatively low cost for production, and easiness to store, are one of the best candidates for the specific ligands of nanoparticle functionalization. This review discusses the benefits and challenges of using aptamers to functionalize nanoparticles for active targeting and especially presents nearly all of the published works that address the topic of using aptamers to functionalize nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery and cancer therapy.\n## Passive vs. Active Targeting of Nanoparticles\nPassive targeting of nanoparticles refers to the passive accumulation of nanoparticles in the tumor tissue, which is generally attributed to the enhanced permeability and retention effect.The concept of EPR was first introduced more than 30 years ago when Maeda and colleagues found that certain macromolecules accumulate preferentially in the tumor tissue [4].EPR is mainly the result of leakiness of the discontinuous endothelium of angiogenic tumor vasculature combined with defective lymphatic drainage of the tumor matrix, which facilitates the extravasation and accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor.It has been shown that the number of nanoparticles accumulated in tumor tissue may be 10-200 times higher than in normal tissue as a result of EPR.The EPR effect is considered to be the primary element to improve the efficacy and safety of nanotherapeutics.In fact, most of the nanomedicines marketed thus far base their increased therapeutic index mainly on the EPR effect [5].\n\nNevertheless, the EPR effect alone is insufficient for adequate nanoparticle accumulation, particularly in some circumstances.The EPR effect is not effective for some cancers because of tumor heterogeneity and cancer stage, is even not applicable to some types of cancers, and it is not effective in some patients because of individual differences.A survey of the literature in this area from 2005 to 2015 that included 232 data sets showed that only a median of 0.7% of the systemically administered nanoparticle dose could reach the solid tumor in mouse models [6]; multivariate analysis of the pertinent parameters indicated that tumor type, tumor model, and nanomaterial properties are the major factors to affect the delivery efficiency of the nanoparticles.Research also found that the high interstitial fluid pressure of tumor tissue impedes the extravasation of nanoparticles [7]; some particles that have entered the tumor intercellular space via EPR effect may be forced back into the blood circulation because of the high fluid pressure within the tumor interstitium.It is manifest that blood cancers, very early stage tumors, and small metastasized cancers do not have or have only insignificant EPR effect.",

Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery are the conventional treatments, which have increased the survival for cancer patients. However, the complexity of this disease together with the persistent problems due to tumor progression and recurrence, drug resistance, or side effects of therapy make it necessary to explore new strategies that address the challenges to obtain a positive response. One important point is that tumor cells can interact with the microenvironment, promoting proliferation, dissemination, and immune evasion. Therefore, immunotherapy has emerged as a novel therapy based on the modulation of the immune system for combating cancer, as reflected in the promising results both in preclinical studies and clinical trials obtained. In order to enhance the immune response, the combination of immunotherapy with nanoparticles has been conducted, improving the access of immune cells to the tumor, antigen presentation, as well as the induction of persistent immune responses. Therefore, nanomedicine holds an enormous potential to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Here, we review the most recent advances in specific molecular and cellular immunotherapy and in nano-immunotherapy against cancer in the light of the latest published preclinical studies and clinical trials.",

The main mechanism of tumor targeting of anticancer nanomedicines is based on the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, first described by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 [112] as a passive yet powerful targeting strategy. They showed that tumor tissues had defective blood vessels with aberrant branching and large openings between endothelial cells of around 400 nm due to their rapid proliferation and decreased number of pericytes. This unique characteristic helps macromolecules, such as nanocarriers, easily move into tumor tissues after crossing the endothelium barrier. Furthermore, solid tumors have a poor lymphatic drainage system, leading to extended retention times of nanocarriers in the tumor extracellular matrix. \n\nAlthough the EPR effect has allowed the successful development of some anticancer nanomedicines with a passive tumor-targeting mechanism [99], many well-designed drug delivery systems fail when tested in patients. Over the last years, the role of the EPR effect has been investigated, focusing on the influence of the TME, heterogeneity of human tumors, and differences between animal models and actual patients [104,113,114]. These factors may contribute to the observed limited penetration of nanomedicines in human tumors, highlighting the need for further refinement of passive targeting strategies.",

Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery are the conventional treatments, which have increased the survival for cancer patients. However, the complexity of this disease together with the persistent problems due to tumor progression and recurrence, drug resistance, or side effects of therapy make it necessary to explore new strategies that address the challenges to obtain a positive response. One important point is that tumor cells can interact with the microenvironment, promoting proliferation, dissemination, and immune evasion. Therefore, immunotherapy has emerged as a novel therapy based on the modulation of the immune system for combating cancer, as reflected in the promising results both in preclinical studies and clinical trials obtained. In order to enhance the immune response, the combination of immunotherapy with nanoparticles has been conducted, improving the access of immune cells to the tumor, antigen presentation, as well as the induction of persistent immune responses. Therefore, nanomedicine holds an enormous potential to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Here, we review the most recent advances in specific molecular and cellular immunotherapy and in nano-immunotherapy against cancer in the light of the latest published preclinical studies and clinical trials.\n## Passive Targeting for Cancer Treatment\nDrug targeting strives for selective and effective localization of the active drug at the specific target organ, tissue, or cell where a specific pharmacological impact is required while restricting its access to untargeted normal cells, thus minimizing toxic effects. The main mechanism of tumor targeting of anticancer nanomedicines is based on the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, first described by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 [112] as a passive yet powerful targeting strategy. They showed that tumor tissues had defective blood vessels with aberrant branching and large openings between endothelial cells of around 400 nm due to their rapid proliferation and decreased number of pericytes. This unique characteristic helps macromolecules, such as nanocarriers, easily move into tumor tissues after crossing the endothelium barrier. Furthermore, solid tumors have a poor lymphatic drainage system, leading to extended retention times of nanocarriers in the tumor extracellular matrix. \n\nAlthough the EPR effect has allowed the successful development of some anticancer nanomedicines with a passive tumor-targeting mechanism [99], many well-designed drug delivery systems fail when tested in patients. Over the last years, the role of the EPR effect has been investigated, focusing on the influence of the TME, heterogeneity of human tumors, and differences between animal models and actual patients [104,113,114]. These factors may contribute to the observed limited penetration of nanomedicines in human tumors, highlighting the need for further refinement of passive targeting strategies.",

Flexible regulation of the molecular structure and architecture of polymers, as well as the modification of nanoparticles with vector molecules, allows one to construct carrier particles for the development of nanoformulations for active agents of various nature.

NPs loaded with the drug are transported in the body by two mechanisms: passive and active targeting. Passive targeting to solid tumors can be achieved through the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect), as first described in the 1980s [13,14]. Pathological, pharmacological, and biochemical studies have shown that a solid tumor usually has such pathophysiological characteristics as hypervascularization, incomplete vascular architecture, and secretion of vascular permeability factors that stimulate extravasation and immaturity of lymphatic capillaries [15]. The tumor vasculature is characterized by a high proportion of proliferating endothelial cells, increased tortuosity, pericyte deficiency, and the formation of an atypical membrane. All this leads to rapid vascularization of the tumor, which is necessary to provide it with oxygen and nutrients and further proliferation. These characteristics make tumor blood vessels permeable to macromolecules. In addition, the lymphatic drainage system of the tumor functions ineffectively due to immature lymphatic capillaries; thus, nanocarriers are selectively preserved for a long period in the interstitial tissue of the tumor [15]. Numerous studies have shown that the EPR effect induces passive accumulation of macromolecules and micelles in solid tumors, enhancing the therapeutic effect while reducing side effects. It was also found that in most human tumors the effective pore size in the vasculature ranges from 200 to 600 nm in diameter, which allows passive targeting of tumors [16]. It was noted that the secretion of various factors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and the main growth factor of fibroblasts in tumor tissues and overexpression of genes (such as vascular permeability factor or vascular endothelial growth factor) cause hyperpermeability of tumor microvessels. However, let us note that vascular permeability in the tumor changes with its progression and depends on the type of tumor and its anatomical location.",

Chvalun\n## Abstract\nModern pharmaceutics are actively developing towards the design of targeted drugs. The development of selectively acting formulations requires the creation of smart delivery systems based on carriers that would first find the target cells and enter them and then release the active substance locally. Nanoparticles of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers can be effectively used as such carriers. Flexible regulation of the molecular structure and architecture of polymers, as well as the modification of nanoparticles with vector molecules, allows one to construct carrier particles for the development of nanoformulations for active agents of various nature. This review presents the main approaches to the design of nanoformulations for targeted delivery, describes the methods for the preparation and study of nanoparticles based on hydrophobic and amphiphilic biodegradable lactide polymers, and discusses the effect of the molecular structure and preparation conditions on the characteristics of nanoparticles in detail. Some results of research in this area of the Kurchatov complex of NBI\u0421S nature-like technologies are also presented.\n## Active and Passive Targeting for Delivery to Malignant Tumor\nDelivery of anticancer drugs to the target tissue is one of the main tasks to be solved. NPs loaded with the drug are transported in the body by two mechanisms: passive and active targeting. Passive targeting to solid tumors can be achieved through the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect), as first described in the 1980s [13,14]. Pathological, pharmacological, and biochemical studies have shown that a solid tumor usually has such pathophysiological characteristics as hypervascularization, incomplete vascular architecture, and secretion of vascular permeability factors that stimulate extravasation and immaturity of lymphatic capillaries [15]. The tumor vasculature is characterized by a high proportion of proliferating endothelial cells, increased tortuosity, pericyte deficiency, and the formation of an atypical membrane. All this leads to rapid vascularization of the tumor, which is necessary to provide it with oxygen and nutrients and further proliferation. These characteristics make tumor blood vessels permeable to macromolecules. In addition, the lymphatic drainage system of the tumor functions ineffectively due to immature lymphatic capillaries; thus, nanocarriers are selectively preserved for a long period in the interstitial tissue of the tumor [15]. Numerous studies have shown that the EPR effect induces passive accumulation of macromolecules and micelles in solid tumors, enhancing the therapeutic effect while reducing side effects. It was also found that in most human tumors the effective pore size in the vasculature ranges from 200 to 600 nm in diameter, which allows passive targeting of tumors [16]. It was noted that the secretion of various factors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and the main growth factor of fibroblasts in tumor tissues and overexpression of genes (such as vascular permeability factor or vascular endothelial growth factor) cause hyperpermeability of tumor microvessels. However, let us note that vascular permeability in the tumor changes with its progression and depends on the type of tumor and its anatomical location.",

The EPR effect is known as the \"royal gate\" (Danhier et al., 2010) and is the gold standard for the design of antitumour drugs and the physiological basis for the entry and accumulation of macromolecules and small particles in tumours. The presence of NPs can not only reduce the toxic side effects of chemotherapy drugs but also enhance the EPR effect and improve the targeting ability and efficacy of drugs (Torchilin, 2007a). For example, Doxil (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) has a drug concentration that is 10 times higher than that of free doxorubicin at the tumour site (Torchilin, 2007b).\n\nExcept for tumours with blood vessels, such as prostate cancer or pancreatic cancer, almost all fast-growing tumours exhibit the EPR effect Din et al., 2017;Fang et al., 2020a). NPs must be of a certain size to exploit the EPR effect. The size of the drug in blood circulation must be larger than the renal clearance threshold to ensure long-term circulation. Therefore, the size of the NPs must be greater than 10 nm (Maeda et al., 2009;Maeda et al., 2013). Second, the size of NPs should be smaller than the lumen size of the vasculature at the tumour site; therefore, they need to be smaller than 100 nm (Noguchi et al., 1998;Liu et al., 2018a). In-depth studies have found that NPs that are approximately 50 nm have the highest efficacy on primary and metastatic tumours (Tang et al., 2014a). In addition to size, other NP properties, such as biocompatibility and surface charge, impact the EPR effect (Kobayashi et al., 2014",

In this regard, the use of nanoparticles able to encapsulate and release therapeutic agents has attracted growing attention. In this sense, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have been widely employed as drug carriers owing to their exquisite physico-chemical properties. Because MSNs present a surface full of silanol groups, they can be easily functionalized to endow the nanoparticles with many different functionalities, including the introduction of moieties with affinity for the cell membrane or relevant compartments within the cell, thus increasing the efficacy of the treatments. This review manuscript will provide the state-of-the-art on MSNs functionalized for targeting subcellular compartments, focusing on the cytoplasm, the mitochondria, and the nucleus.\n## Targeting Tumor Tissues\nThe rationale for using nanoparticles (of any type) in cancer treatment relies on the Enhanced Permeability and Retention effect (EPR effect). It was first reported by Maeda and coworkers and, indeed, it is the basis of some commercialized nanomedicines [26]. According to Maeda et al., the EPR effect promotes the passive accumulation of nanoparticles in a tumor as a consequence of the poor lymphatic drainage, enhanced permeability, and the hypervasculature characteristic of many solid tumors [27]. \n\nSuch passive accumulation of nanoparticles is greatly affected by features such as their size and surface chemistry. Regarding size, nanoparticles will avoid renal clearance if they are at least 10 nm in diameter, and will extravasate to the tumor if they are smaller than 400 nm. Nonetheless, this is still a controversial issue regarding the size that maximizes extravasation and subsequent cancer cell uptake. In this sense, some authors consider a size of ca. 300 nm as the most effective [28], while others propose a size of ca. 100 nm or below [29].

That non-universal passive accumulation has boosted the development of active strategies to enhance the delivery of nanocarriers.

            "abstract": "Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases of our time, affecting millions of people worldwide. Despite the significant progress made in cancer treatment over the past few decades, conventional cancer therapies such as chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery have their limitations, including toxicity, drug resistance, and damage to healthy cells and tissues. Therefore, researchers are constantly exploring new avenues for cancer treatment that are safer, more effective, and less invasive. One such avenue is the use of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology involves the manipulation and control of matter at the nanoscale, which is approximately one billionth of a meter. This technology has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment by offering more targeted and precise therapy. Nanoparticles, for instance, can be engineered to target cancer cells specifically and deliver drugs or other therapeutic agents directly to them, minimizing damage to healthy cells. In this research, we aim to explore the current state of nanotechnology in modern oncology, its potential applications, and its limitations. We review the recent advancements in nanotechnology-based cancer therapy, including the development of targeted nanoparticles for drug delivery, imaging, and theranostics. One of the main advantages of using nanotechnology for cancer treatment is its ability to bypass the blood-brain barrier, allowing for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. This opens up new avenues for the treatment of brain tumors, which are notoriously difficult to treat due to the barrier. Another potential application of nanotechnology in cancer treatment is the use of nanorobots that can be programmed to seek out and destroy cancer cells. These nanorobots can be designed to carry payloads of therapeutic agents or deliver hyperthermia to destroy cancer cells. Despite the many advantages of nanotechnology in cancer treatment, there are also challenges and limitations that need to be addressed. For instance, the toxicity and biocompatibility of nanoparticles need to be carefully evaluated to minimize potential harm to healthy cells and tissues.In conclusion, the role of nanotechnology in modern oncology has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment. It offers more targeted and precise therapy, and can potentially overcome the limitations of conventional cancer therapies. However, further research is needed to fully explore the potential of nanotechnology in cancer treatment and to address the challenges and limitations associated with it.\nIn conclusion, the role of nanotechnology in modern oncology has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment.

                    "text": "The Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect is a phenomenon that occurs in solid tumors, allowing certain nanoparticles to preferentially accumulate and remain within the tumor tissue. It is an important concept in the field of nanoparticle-based drug delivery for cancer treatment. The EPR effect arises from the unique characteristics of tumor blood vessels and the tumor microenvironment. Compared to normal blood vessels, tumor blood vessels are often leaky, irregularly shaped, and have poor lymphatic drainage. These abnormal blood vessels result from the rapid and disorganized growth of tumor cells, leading to incomplete and insufficient vascular networks within the tumor tissue. The leaky blood vessels in tumors allow nanoparticles to extravasate or \"leak out\" into the tumor interstitial space more easily than in healthy tissues. Furthermore, due to the lack of functional lymphatic vessels, the clearance of these extravasated nanoparticles from the tumor tissue is limited. As a result, the nanoparticles can accumulate and persist in the tumor for an extended period, providing an opportunity for effective drug delivery. The EPR effect is size-dependent, with nanoparticles in the range of tens to hundreds of nanometers exhibiting the highest accumulation in tumor tissues. These nanoparticles can passively extravasate through the enlarged pores in tumor Shaily Tyagi, Ashish Kumar, Anurag Chourasia, Saket Saini, Deeksha, and Anjali Dixit International Journal of Research -GRANTHAALAYAH 7 blood vessels, allowing them to reach the tumor interstitial space. However, larger nanoparticles may face difficulties penetrating deeper into the tumor due to increased interstitial pressure.The EPR effect has been utilized in the design of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems. Nanoparticles can be engineered to carry anticancer drugs, imaging agents, or therapeutic agents specifically to the tumor site, taking advantage of the EPR effect. By encapsulating drugs within these nanoparticles, they can be protected from premature degradation, improve their stability, and allow for sustained release at the tumor site. This targeted delivery approach aims to enhance treatment efficacy while reducing the systemic toxicity associated with conventional chemotherapy.",

Saini, Deeksha, Anjali Dixit\n## Abstract\nCancer is one of the deadliest diseases of our time, affecting millions of people worldwide. Despite the significant progress made in cancer treatment over the past few decades, conventional cancer therapies such as chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery have their limitations, including toxicity, drug resistance, and damage to healthy cells and tissues. Therefore, researchers are constantly exploring new avenues for cancer treatment that are safer, more effective, and less invasive. One such avenue is the use of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology involves the manipulation and control of matter at the nanoscale, which is approximately one billionth of a meter. This technology has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment by offering more targeted and precise therapy. Nanoparticles, for instance, can be engineered to target cancer cells specifically and deliver drugs or other therapeutic agents directly to them, minimizing damage to healthy cells. In this research, we aim to explore the current state of nanotechnology in modern oncology, its potential applications, and its limitations. We review the recent advancements in nanotechnology-based cancer therapy, including the development of targeted nanoparticles for drug delivery, imaging, and theranostics. One of the main advantages of using nanotechnology for cancer treatment is its ability to bypass the blood-brain barrier, allowing for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. This opens up new avenues for the treatment of brain tumors, which are notoriously difficult to treat due to the barrier. Another potential application of nanotechnology in cancer treatment is the use of nanorobots that can be programmed to seek out and destroy cancer cells. These nanorobots can be designed to carry payloads of therapeutic agents or deliver hyperthermia to destroy cancer cells. Despite the many advantages of nanotechnology in cancer treatment, there are also challenges and limitations that need to be addressed. For instance, the toxicity and biocompatibility of nanoparticles need to be carefully evaluated to minimize potential harm to healthy cells and tissues.In conclusion, the role of nanotechnology in modern oncology has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment. It offers more targeted and precise therapy, and can potentially overcome the limitations of conventional cancer therapies. However, further research is needed to fully explore the potential of nanotechnology in cancer treatment and to address the challenges and limitations associated with it.\nIn conclusion, the role of nanotechnology in modern oncology has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment.

It is an important concept in the field of nanoparticle-based drug delivery for cancer treatment. The EPR effect arises from the unique characteristics of tumor blood vessels and the tumor microenvironment. Compared to normal blood vessels, tumor blood vessels are often leaky, irregularly shaped, and have poor lymphatic drainage. These abnormal blood vessels result from the rapid and disorganized growth of tumor cells, leading to incomplete and insufficient vascular networks within the tumor tissue. The leaky blood vessels in tumors allow nanoparticles to extravasate or \"leak out\" into the tumor interstitial space more easily than in healthy tissues. Furthermore, due to the lack of functional lymphatic vessels, the clearance of these extravasated nanoparticles from the tumor tissue is limited. As a result, the nanoparticles can accumulate and persist in the tumor for an extended period, providing an opportunity for effective drug delivery. The EPR effect is size-dependent, with nanoparticles in the range of tens to hundreds of nanometers exhibiting the highest accumulation in tumor tissues. These nanoparticles can passively extravasate through the enlarged pores in tumor Shaily Tyagi, Ashish Kumar, Anurag Chourasia, Saket Saini, Deeksha, and Anjali Dixit International Journal of Research -GRANTHAALAYAH 7 blood vessels, allowing them to reach the tumor interstitial space. However, larger nanoparticles may face difficulties penetrating deeper into the tumor due to increased interstitial pressure.The EPR effect has been utilized in the design of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems. Nanoparticles can be engineered to carry anticancer drugs, imaging agents, or therapeutic agents specifically to the tumor site, taking advantage of the EPR effect. By encapsulating drugs within these nanoparticles, they can be protected from premature degradation, improve their stability, and allow for sustained release at the tumor site. This targeted delivery approach aims to enhance treatment efficacy while reducing the systemic toxicity associated with conventional chemotherapy.",

Passively targeted nanoparticles enter through leaky vasculature of the solid tumors and are retained in the tumor tissue for extended periods of time due to impaired lymphatic flow. This unique microphysiology of tumors is exploited by many FDA-approved nanoformulations such as Doxil and Abraxane. In solid tumors, such as lung cancer, the EPR effect plays an important role in determining the efficacy of the nanoparticle-based drug delivery system [72]. The presence of a highly fenestrated blood vasculature in the tumor facilitates the EPR effect allowing the enhanced entry of colloidal nanoparticles into the tumor (Figure 2). Additionally, the poor lymphatic flow in the tumor tissue adds to this effect and results in enhanced retention of nanoparticles within the tumor site. In contrast to tumor tissues, the blood vasculature in normal tissues is intact and less permeable attenuating the uptake of nanoparticles by normal tissues. Furthermore, the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles are critically important for passive targeting of solid tumors. The EPR effect usually applies to particles that are less than 200 nm in size. However, particles less than 50 nm in size frequently undergo extravasation from the tumor through the fenestrations and are thus less likely to be retained in the tumor tissue for extended periods of time. Moreover, active targeting of nanoparticles is accomplished by decorating the surface of the nanoparticle with specific ligands to promote the binding and interaction with overexpressed protein receptors on cancer cell surfaces. This approach leads to preferential binding, uptake, and intracellular accumulation of the drug or gene in the targeted cells. However, the overall tumor accumulation and therapeutic effect of targeted nanoparticles may be principally controlled by the EPR effect [73]. \n\nFabrication of polymeric nanoparticles with uniform and sub-200 nm size requires critical control over each and every step in the synthesis procedure, which is always challenging.",

In solid tumors, such as lung cancer, the EPR effect plays an important role in determining the efficacy of the nanoparticle-based drug delivery system [72]. The presence of a highly fenestrated blood vasculature in the tumor facilitates the EPR effect allowing the enhanced entry of colloidal nanoparticles into the tumor (Figure 2). Additionally, the poor lymphatic flow in the tumor tissue adds to this effect and results in enhanced retention of nanoparticles within the tumor site. In contrast to tumor tissues, the blood vasculature in normal tissues is intact and less permeable attenuating the uptake of nanoparticles by normal tissues. Furthermore, the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles are critically important for passive targeting of solid tumors. The EPR effect usually applies to particles that are less than 200 nm in size. However, particles less than 50 nm in size frequently undergo extravasation from the tumor through the fenestrations and are thus less likely to be retained in the tumor tissue for extended periods of time. Moreover, active targeting of nanoparticles is accomplished by decorating the surface of the nanoparticle with specific ligands to promote the binding and interaction with overexpressed protein receptors on cancer cell surfaces. This approach leads to preferential binding, uptake, and intracellular accumulation of the drug or gene in the targeted cells. However, the overall tumor accumulation and therapeutic effect of targeted nanoparticles may be principally controlled by the EPR effect [73]. \n\nFabrication of polymeric nanoparticles with uniform and sub-200 nm size requires critical control over each and every step in the synthesis procedure, which is always challenging.",

Fisusi, S. Adesina\n## Abstract\nPassive targeting is the foremost mechanism by which nanocarriers and drug-bearing macromolecules deliver their payload selectively to solid tumors. An important driver of passive targeting is the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is the cornerstone of most carrier-based tumor-targeted drug delivery efforts. Despite the huge number of publications showcasing successes in preclinical animal models, translation to the clinic has been poor, with only a few nano-based drugs currently being used for the treatment of cancers. Several barriers and factors have been adduced for the low delivery efficiency to solid tumors and poor clinical translation, including the characteristics of the nanocarriers and macromolecules, vascular and physiological barriers, the heterogeneity of tumor blood supply which affects the homogenous distribution of nanocarriers within tumors, and the transport and penetration depth of macromolecules and nanoparticles in the tumor matrix. To address the challenges associated with poor tumor targeting and therapeutic efficacy in humans, the identified barriers that affect the efficiency of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect for macromolecular therapeutics and nanoparticle delivery systems need to be overcome. In this review, approaches to facilitate improved EPR delivery outcomes and the clinical translation of novel macromolecular therapeutics and nanoparticle drug delivery systems are discussed.\n## Introduction\nWhile this may appear to be low, nanomedicines have demonstrated substantially higher delivery efficiencies than most conventional chemotherapeutic formulations in relative terms [7,8]. It has been reported that the dense extracellular matrix, high interstitial fluid pressure, and non-uniform blood perfusion limit nanoparticle accumulation in solid tumors [7,9].

However, the efficiency of EPR-targeted nanodrugs is not always pleasing as it is strongly prejudiced by the heterogeneity of the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). Targeting the dynamics of the EPR effect and improvement of the therapeutic effects of nanotherapeutics by using EPR enhancers is a vital approach to developing cancer therapy. Inadequate data on the efficacy of EPR in humans hampers the clinical translation of cancer drugs. Molecular targeting, physical amendment, or physiological renovation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) are crucial approaches for improving the EPR effect. Advanced imaging technologies for the visualization of EPR-induced nanomedicine distribution in tumors, and the use of better animal models, are necessary to enhance the EPR effect. This review discusses strategies to enhance EPR effect-based drug delivery approaches for cancer therapy and imaging technologies for the diagnosis of EPR effects. The effort of studying the EPR effect is beneficial, as some of the advanced nanomedicine-based EPR-enhancing approaches are currently undergoing clinical trials, which may be helpful to improve EPR-induced drug delivery and translation to clinics.",

                    "text": "The field of nanomedicine is rapidly gaining interest due to its application in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, especially the treatment of cancer. The promise of nanomedicine is in the tumor microenvironment. This microenvironment allows the nanoparticles to penetrate from the blood vessels into the interstitial space of the tumor and retain the particles in the tumor. This phenomenon, referred to as the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR), is used to deliver large drug loads or imaging agents to the tumor site better than small molecules. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect describes the preferential accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors due to their leaky vascular system and poor lymphatic drainage [151]. The EPR generated great enthusiasm for the development of nanoparticle therapy as an anticancer therapy. However, the results of preclinical studies assessing the EPR effect were inconclusive. Some reports confirm the preferential accumulation of nanodrugs in the tumor via EPR, while others show that the effect of EPR is strongly dependent on the tumor model. Today, the EPR remains a controversial topic in nanomedicine [152]. Hansen et al., using canine spontaneous tumors that closely mimic the human condition and 64Cu-labeled liposomes that can be imaged with positron emission tomography, showed that rapidly growing tumors such as carcinomas are highly vascularized and therefore have more porous and leaky blood vessels, while slow-growing tumors, such as sarcomas, are not very vascularized [153]. The main conclusion from this, and other EPR studies, is that the clinical application of EPR-enhancing agents, in combination with nanomedicine, requires preclinical studies con-ducted in appropriate models, the combination of nanomedicine with the EPR-enhancing strategy must be designed for a certain type of cancer, and side effects of EPR enhancing agents must be taken into consideration [154]. \n\nMany current cancer drug delivery systems attempt to go further than simply ensuring tumor accumulation. Attempts are being made to combine cancer cell-specific targeting with EPR-based accumulation.",

For such tumors, the improvement of EPR-based drug delivery is necessary by modifying tumor blood vessels, angiogenesis, a vascular edifice, blood flow, etc. The EPR effect can be enhanced by modifying vascular intermediaries such as angiotensin II, nitroglycerin or NO, CO, and enzyme inhibitors [7][8][9][10].

Parveen, Nina Filipczak, Satya Siva Kishan Yalamarty, V. Torchilin\n## Abstract\nThe innovative development of nanomedicine has promised effective treatment options compared to the standard therapeutics for cancer therapy. However, the efficiency of EPR-targeted nanodrugs is not always pleasing as it is strongly prejudiced by the heterogeneity of the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). Targeting the dynamics of the EPR effect and improvement of the therapeutic effects of nanotherapeutics by using EPR enhancers is a vital approach to developing cancer therapy. Inadequate data on the efficacy of EPR in humans hampers the clinical translation of cancer drugs. Molecular targeting, physical amendment, or physiological renovation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) are crucial approaches for improving the EPR effect. Advanced imaging technologies for the visualization of EPR-induced nanomedicine distribution in tumors, and the use of better animal models, are necessary to enhance the EPR effect. This review discusses strategies to enhance EPR effect-based drug delivery approaches for cancer therapy and imaging technologies for the diagnosis of EPR effects. The effort of studying the EPR effect is beneficial, as some of the advanced nanomedicine-based EPR-enhancing approaches are currently undergoing clinical trials, which may be helpful to improve EPR-induced drug delivery and translation to clinics.\n## Introduction\nTherefore, tumor blood vessels are leaky compared to normal blood vessels due to the defective endothelial cells and more vascular permeability, as well as vastly expressed vascular mediators including bradykinin, NO, and VEGF, resulting in selective accumulation of nanodrugs into tumor tissues with little or no distribution in normal cells [4]. Among others, the most prominent pathophysiological factors contributing to EPR-targeted passive tumor targeting include active transcytosis across the blood vessel wall for NPs extravasation and phagocytic uptake by TAMs as a mechanism of NPs retention [2]. \n\nIn EPR-based passive targeting, TME plays a vital role. One of the crucial metabolic features of fast-proliferating tumor cells is glycolysis, which is the key energy source of cell division and transforms the neighboring milieu into an acidic. This decreased pH of TME can be utilized to deliver pH-responsive NPs to release drugs at a low pH [1,5,6]. \n\nThe EPR effect is dynamic and a phenomenon of tumor blood vessels, which is mostly dependent on blood flow. Animal models of solid tumors rich in blood flow demonstrated enhanced EPR effects. However, many clinical cancers such as late-stage tumors and refractory tumors are associated with poor blood flow due to the coagulation and thrombi formation exhibiting poor EPR effect [7][8][9][10][11][12]. For such tumors, the improvement of EPR-based drug delivery is necessary by modifying tumor blood vessels, angiogenesis, a vascular edifice, blood flow, etc. The EPR effect can be enhanced by modifying vascular intermediaries such as angiotensin II, nitroglycerin or NO, CO, and enzyme inhibitors [7][8][9][10]. An integration of vascular mediators with a nanodrug may be an important strategy for an enhanced EPR effect. Further, targeting tumor stroma and extracellular matrix, and controlling tumor vessels, may improve EPR-targeted drug delivery to tumors [4]. \n\nTumor blood flow and vascular permeability fluctuate significantly, and blood flow is commonly blocked as the tumor size rises.\n\n## Clinical Trials of Nanoparticles with EPR Enhancers and Their Clinical Translation\nThe field of nanomedicine is rapidly gaining interest due to its application in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, especially the treatment of cancer. The promise of nanomedicine is in the tumor microenvironment. This microenvironment allows the nanoparticles to penetrate from the blood vessels into the interstitial space of the tumor and retain the particles in the tumor. This phenomenon, referred to as the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR), is used to deliver large drug loads or imaging agents to the tumor site better than small molecules. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect describes the preferential accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors due to their leaky vascular system and poor lymphatic drainage [151]. The EPR generated great enthusiasm for the development of nanoparticle therapy as an anticancer therapy. However, the results of preclinical studies assessing the EPR effect were inconclusive. Some reports confirm the preferential accumulation of nanodrugs in the tumor via EPR, while others show that the effect of EPR is strongly dependent on the tumor model. Today, the EPR remains a controversial topic in nanomedicine [152]. Hansen et al., using canine spontaneous tumors that closely mimic the human condition and 64Cu-labeled liposomes that can be imaged with positron emission tomography, showed that rapidly growing tumors such as carcinomas are highly vascularized and therefore have more porous and leaky blood vessels, while slow-growing tumors, such as sarcomas, are not very vascularized [153]. The main conclusion from this, and other EPR studies, is that the clinical application of EPR-enhancing agents, in combination with nanomedicine, requires preclinical studies con-ducted in appropriate models, the combination of nanomedicine with the EPR-enhancing strategy must be designed for a certain type of cancer, and side effects of EPR enhancing agents must be taken into consideration [154]. \n\nMany current cancer drug delivery systems attempt to go further than simply ensuring tumor accumulation. Attempts are being made to combine cancer cell-specific targeting with EPR-based accumulation.",

Countermeasures to each resistance mechanism are being investigated. This review focuses on barriers that impede the delivery of Ab drugs due to features of the solid tumor microenvironment. Unlike hematological malignancies, in which the target tumor cells are in blood vessels, clinical solid tumors contain cancer stroma, which interferes with the delivery of Ab drugs. In addition, the cancer mass itself interferes with the penetration of Ab drugs. In this article, I will consider the etiology of cancer stroma and propose a new Ab drug development strategy for solid cancer treatment centering on cancer stromal targeting (CAST) therapy using anti\u2010insoluble fibrin Ab\u2010drug conjugate (ADC), which can overcome the cancer stroma barrier. The recent success of ADCs, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR\u2010Ts), and Bi\u2010specific Abs is changing the category of Ab drugs from molecular\u2010targeted drugs based on growth signal inhibition to cancer\u2010specific targeted therapies. Therefore, at the end of this review, I argue that it is time to reorient the concept of Ab drug development.",

Taking advantage of the pressure gradient and leaky vessels at the tumor site, the nanoparticle-based drug accumulates at the tumor site, extravasates into the tumor microenvironment, and prolongs the release of therapeutic agents within the tumor with a resultant improvement in the treatment outcome. This emerged a land slide achievement in the field of nanomedicine and widened the scope of nanoparticle-based drug delivery via passive targeting such that new nanodrug formulations received approval for the treatment of other disease conditions such as fungal infection, hepatitis A, multiple sclerosis and end stage renal disease [67]. However, in order to maximize the advantages offered by EPR in the passive delivery of drugs, the size and surface properties of the nanocarrier must be controlled to avoid uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) as previously described. The ideal size range to benefit from the EPR effect is between 10 to 200 nm as particles that are too small would be cleared by the kidneys, preventing accumulation into the tumor site, and particles that are too large will not adequately penetrate the tumor vasculature and interstitial space.",

Taking advantage of the pressure gradient and leaky vessels at the tumor site, the nanoparticle-based drug accumulates at the tumor site, extravasates into the tumor microenvironment, and prolongs the release of therapeutic agents within the tumor with a resultant improvement in the treatment outcome. This emerged a land slide achievement in the field of nanomedicine and widened the scope of nanoparticle-based drug delivery via passive targeting such that new nanodrug formulations received approval for the treatment of other disease conditions such as fungal infection, hepatitis A, multiple sclerosis and end stage renal disease [67]. However, in order to maximize the advantages offered by EPR in the passive delivery of drugs, the size and surface properties of the nanocarrier must be controlled to avoid uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) as previously described. The ideal size range to benefit from the EPR effect is between 10 to 200 nm as particles that are too small would be cleared by the kidneys, preventing accumulation into the tumor site, and particles that are too large will not adequately penetrate the tumor vasculature and interstitial space.",

            "abstract": "Simple Summary Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts for 90% of pancreatic cancers. It is considered one of the deadliest cancers due to its high metastatic potential and drug resistance. This review discusses various targets and nanoparticle-based delivery systems developed, tested, and approved for the effective diagnosis and targeted treatment of PDAC. Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest cancers, presents significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to its aggressive, metastatic nature and lack of early detection methods. A key obstacle in PDAC treatment is the highly complex tumor environment characterized by dense stroma surrounding the tumor, which hinders effective drug delivery. Nanotechnology can offer innovative solutions to these challenges, particularly in creating novel drug delivery systems for existing anticancer drugs for PDAC, such as gemcitabine and paclitaxel. By using customization methods such as incorporating conjugated targeting ligands, tumor-penetrating peptides, and therapeutic nucleic acids, these nanoparticle-based systems enhance drug solubility, extend circulation time, improve tumor targeting, and control drug release, thereby minimizing side effects and toxicity in healthy tissues. Moreover, nanoparticles have also shown potential in precise diagnostic methods for PDAC. This literature review will delve into targeted mechanisms, pathways, and approaches in treating pancreatic cancer. Additional emphasis is placed on the study of nanoparticle-based delivery systems, with a brief mention of those in clinical trials. Overall, the overview illustrates the significant advances in nanomedicine, underscoring its role in transcending the constraints of conventional PDAC therapies and diagnostics.",

The EPR effect is a phenomenon that occurs when the blood vessels surrounding a relatively large tumor become highly permeable while there is minimal lymphatic drainage from the tumor (Figure 7). This combination results in increased penetration of nanoparticles into the tumor and insufficient washing away of them by lymph. As a result, the particles accumulate and get retained in the tumor. As substances with high molecular weight, nanoparticles are naturally susceptible to this effect and, therefore, will passively accumulate in solid tumors. However, it has been observed that the use of enhanced EPR effects to transport nanomedicines to tumor sites is not consistently effective and is instead dependent on specific characteristics of the tumor and its physiological conditions [217]. Factors such as the degree of angiogenesis and lymphatic development, the amount of pericyte coverage in the tumor vasculature, the density of the tumor stroma, and intratumoral pressure are principal contributors to the variability in EPR effects. Understanding these aspects resulted in the creation of active targeting approaches, which currently represent the mainstream in cancer-targeted drug delivery under development and clinical trials. \n\nCancers 2024, 16, 1589 29 of 51 to this effect and, therefore, will passively accumulate in solid tumors.

It is considered one of the deadliest cancers due to its high metastatic potential and drug resistance. This review discusses various targets and nanoparticle-based delivery systems developed, tested, and approved for the effective diagnosis and targeted treatment of PDAC. Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest cancers, presents significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to its aggressive, metastatic nature and lack of early detection methods. A key obstacle in PDAC treatment is the highly complex tumor environment characterized by dense stroma surrounding the tumor, which hinders effective drug delivery. Nanotechnology can offer innovative solutions to these challenges, particularly in creating novel drug delivery systems for existing anticancer drugs for PDAC, such as gemcitabine and paclitaxel. By using customization methods such as incorporating conjugated targeting ligands, tumor-penetrating peptides, and therapeutic nucleic acids, these nanoparticle-based systems enhance drug solubility, extend circulation time, improve tumor targeting, and control drug release, thereby minimizing side effects and toxicity in healthy tissues. Moreover, nanoparticles have also shown potential in precise diagnostic methods for PDAC. This literature review will delve into targeted mechanisms, pathways, and approaches in treating pancreatic cancer. Additional emphasis is placed on the study of nanoparticle-based delivery systems, with a brief mention of those in clinical trials. Overall, the overview illustrates the significant advances in nanomedicine, underscoring its role in transcending the constraints of conventional PDAC therapies and diagnostics.\n## Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) Effect\nEnhanced accumulation of macromolecules in solid tumors and its mechanisms were first reported by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 and termed the \"Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect\" [216]. The EPR effect is a phenomenon that occurs when the blood vessels surrounding a relatively large tumor become highly permeable while there is minimal lymphatic drainage from the tumor (Figure 7). This combination results in increased penetration of nanoparticles into the tumor and insufficient washing away of them by lymph. As a result, the particles accumulate and get retained in the tumor. As substances with high molecular weight, nanoparticles are naturally susceptible to this effect and, therefore, will passively accumulate in solid tumors. However, it has been observed that the use of enhanced EPR effects to transport nanomedicines to tumor sites is not consistently effective and is instead dependent on specific characteristics of the tumor and its physiological conditions [217]. Factors such as the degree of angiogenesis and lymphatic development, the amount of pericyte coverage in the tumor vasculature, the density of the tumor stroma, and intratumoral pressure are principal contributors to the variability in EPR effects. Understanding these aspects resulted in the creation of active targeting approaches, which currently represent the mainstream in cancer-targeted drug delivery under development and clinical trials. \n\nCancers 2024, 16, 1589 29 of 51 to this effect and, therefore, will passively accumulate in solid tumors.

Compared to normal blood vessels, tumor blood vessels are very leaky due to the defected architecture of endothelial cells and high vascular permeability due to the highly expressed vascular mediators such as bradykinin (BK), nitric oxide (NO), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), by which the accumulation of macromolecules (i.e., larger than 40 kDa) selectively into tumor tissues could be achieved with very little distribution in normal tissues [1,2]. This unique phenomenon is coined the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and it was first recovered by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 [1], which is a landmark principle in the development of targeted anticancer drugs. \n\nBased on the concept of the EPR effect, macromolecular anticancer strategy, i.e., nanomedicine, has been developed. Tumor-targeted drug delivery systems using nanoplatforms including liposome, polymeric micelles, polymer conjugate, and nanoparticles have become a promising fusion area for nanotechnology and medicine. In the past two decades, many researchers have been working on EPR effect-based nanomedicine, taking an enormous step forward. In 1980s, the founder of EPR effect, Professor Maeda, developed styrene maleic acid copolymer conjugated neocarzinostatin (SMANCS), which was approved in Japan in 1990s [1]. Recently, more nanomedicines have been used in clinic, for example, Doxil is an FDA approved liposomal drug for the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma and other cancers.",

Compared to normal blood vessels, tumor blood vessels are very leaky due to the defected architecture of endothelial cells and high vascular permeability due to the highly expressed vascular mediators such as bradykinin (BK), nitric oxide (NO), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), by which the accumulation of macromolecules (i.e., larger than 40 kDa) selectively into tumor tissues could be achieved with very little distribution in normal tissues [1,2]. This unique phenomenon is coined the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and it was first recovered by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 [1], which is a landmark principle in the development of targeted anticancer drugs. \n\nBased on the concept of the EPR effect, macromolecular anticancer strategy, i.e., nanomedicine, has been developed. Tumor-targeted drug delivery systems using nanoplatforms including liposome, polymeric micelles, polymer conjugate, and nanoparticles have become a promising fusion area for nanotechnology and medicine. In the past two decades, many researchers have been working on EPR effect-based nanomedicine, taking an enormous step forward. In 1980s, the founder of EPR effect, Professor Maeda, developed styrene maleic acid copolymer conjugated neocarzinostatin (SMANCS), which was approved in Japan in 1990s [1]. Recently, more nanomedicines have been used in clinic, for example, Doxil is an FDA approved liposomal drug for the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma and other cancers.",

This allows for the preferential permeation and retention of macromolecular drugs within solid tumors following systemic administration. The validity of the EPR effect has been established not only in experimental animal models but also in humans, including cases of liver, renal, and metastatic breast cancers [13][14][15]. Recent studies examining human renal tumors and metastatic breast cancers have demonstrated a significant EPR effect in more than 87% of samples, highlighting the pivotal role of this effect in the advancement of anti-cancer nanomedicines [13,14]. Based on the EPR effect, nanomedicines exhibit many beneficial features for targeted cancer therapy, in contrast to those of conventional small molecular anti-cancer drugs, which tend to spread indiscriminately in normal tissues and organs, thus leading to systemic adverse effects [7,8,10]. Nanomedicines, therefore, offer promise in terms of improved treatment options. In the 1990s, the first polymer-conjugated nanomedicine, SMANCS (styrene maleic acid polymer-conjugated neocarzinostatin), was approved in Japan, marking a significant milestone in the development of anti-cancer nanomedicine [15]. Over the past two decades, the field of anti-cancer nanomedicine has experienced substantial growth and advancement [16][17][18]. Many nanomedicines are currently being utilized in clinical settings, with numerous others undergoing clinical trials (see Table 1). \n\nIn recent years, numerous nanomedicines have been designed and developed for advanced, less-invasive cancer therapy. Examples include nanoprobe-based photodynamic therapy [12,19] and boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) [20,21], as well as magnetic hyperthermia therapy using magnetite [12,19], all of which demonstrate promising therapeutic potential. Additionally, the application of nanomedicine in cutting-edge biomedical fields such as immunotherapy, gene therapy, and preventive medicine has garnered sig-nificant attention.",

This has facilitated major advancements in targeted drug delivery, imaging, and individualized therapy through the integration of nanotechnology principles into medicine. Numerous nanomedicines have been developed and applied for disease treatment, with a particular focus on cancer therapy. Recently, nanomedicine has been utilized in various advanced fields, including diagnosis, vaccines, immunotherapy, gene delivery, and tissue engineering. Multifunctional nanomedicines facilitate concurrent medication delivery, therapeutic monitoring, and imaging, allowing for immediate responses and personalized treatment plans. This review concerns the major advancement of nanomaterials and their potential applications in the biological and medical fields. Along with this, we also mention the various clinical translations of nanomedicine and the major challenges that nanomedicine is currently facing to overcome the clinical translation barrier.\n## Introduction\nIn essence, the EPR effect refers to the phenomenon of selective accumulation of macromolecular agents in tumor tissues, facilitated by the unique anatomical and pathophysiological characteristics of tumor blood vessels. This allows for the preferential permeation and retention of macromolecular drugs within solid tumors following systemic administration. The validity of the EPR effect has been established not only in experimental animal models but also in humans, including cases of liver, renal, and metastatic breast cancers [13][14][15]. Recent studies examining human renal tumors and metastatic breast cancers have demonstrated a significant EPR effect in more than 87% of samples, highlighting the pivotal role of this effect in the advancement of anti-cancer nanomedicines [13,14]. Based on the EPR effect, nanomedicines exhibit many beneficial features for targeted cancer therapy, in contrast to those of conventional small molecular anti-cancer drugs, which tend to spread indiscriminately in normal tissues and organs, thus leading to systemic adverse effects [7,8,10]. Nanomedicines, therefore, offer promise in terms of improved treatment options. In the 1990s, the first polymer-conjugated nanomedicine, SMANCS (styrene maleic acid polymer-conjugated neocarzinostatin), was approved in Japan, marking a significant milestone in the development of anti-cancer nanomedicine [15]. Over the past two decades, the field of anti-cancer nanomedicine has experienced substantial growth and advancement [16][17][18]. Many nanomedicines are currently being utilized in clinical settings, with numerous others undergoing clinical trials (see Table 1). \n\nIn recent years, numerous nanomedicines have been designed and developed for advanced, less-invasive cancer therapy. Examples include nanoprobe-based photodynamic therapy [12,19] and boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) [20,21], as well as magnetic hyperthermia therapy using magnetite [12,19], all of which demonstrate promising therapeutic potential. Additionally, the application of nanomedicine in cutting-edge biomedical fields such as immunotherapy, gene therapy, and preventive medicine has garnered sig-nificant attention.",

            "abstract": "For more than three decades, enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)-effect-based nanomedicines have received considerable attention for tumor-selective treatment of solid tumors. However, treatment of advanced cancers remains a huge challenge in clinical situations because of occluded or embolized tumor blood vessels, which lead to so-called heterogeneity of the EPR effect. We previously developed a method to restore impaired blood flow in blood vessels by using nitric oxide donors and other agents called EPR-effect enhancers. Here, we show that two novel EPR-effect enhancers\u2014isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN, Nitrol\u00ae) and sildenafil citrate\u2014strongly potentiated delivery of three macromolecular drugs to tumors: a complex of poly(styrene-co-maleic acid) (SMA) and cisplatin, named Smaplatin\u00ae (chemotherapy); poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) polymer-conjugated zinc protoporphyrin (photodynamic therapy and imaging); and SMA glucosamine-conjugated boric acid complex (boron neutron capture therapy). We tested these nanodrugs in mice with advanced C26 tumors. When these nanomedicines were administered together with ISDN or sildenafil, tumor delivery and thus positive therapeutic results increased two- to four-fold in tumors with diameters of 15 mm or more. These results confirmed the rationale for using EPR-effect enhancers to restore tumor blood flow. In conclusion, all EPR-effect enhancers tested showed great potential for application in cancer therapy.",

                    "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is believed to be a universal mechanism occurring in most solid tumors and a key issue for selective delivery of nanomedicines to tumors [1][2][3][4][5][6]. Suppressed blood flow or obstructed blood vessels in advanced cancers lead to heterogeneity of the EPR effect [7][8][9][10][11][12]. Criticisms of the EPR effect were recently raised [13,14], probably because of inaccurate understanding of the EPR effect together with the use of inappropriate nanomedicines, particularly those lacking good stability in vivo and those with an inadequate or poor experimental design [7][8][9]. For instance, if the release of active pharmaceutical ingredients from liposomes is too slow because the complexes are very stable, even though they accumulates in tumors by EPR effect, the therapeutic outcome is poor [7][8][9][10][11][12]15]. \n\nThe EPR effect was first demonstrated in mouse tumor models in which the tumor size was usually smaller than 10 mm and the tumors were highly vasculated; nanomedicines thus had high permeability. In contrast, human tumors diagnosed in clinical situations are frequently larger than 3 mm and up to 10 cm or more. In such large tumors, blood flow is often suppressed or blood vessels are occluded because of the formation of vascular clots or thrombi [9][10][11][12][15][16][17][18]. This blood-flow suppression thus results in little or no drug delivery and, therefore, a highly limited EPR effect [9,12,[15][16][17][18]. However, Ding et al. observed that more than 87% of human renal tumors manifested a considerable EPR effect with significant diversity and heterogeneity in different patients [19]. Also, Lee et al. reported that nanoparticles conjugated with positron-emitting radionuclei such as 64 Cu resulted the EPR effect in breast cancer, including metastatic cancer [20].",

Harada, K. Ono, Jun Fang, T. Niidome, T. Sawa, H. Maeda\n## Abstract\nFor more than three decades, enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)-effect-based nanomedicines have received considerable attention for tumor-selective treatment of solid tumors. However, treatment of advanced cancers remains a huge challenge in clinical situations because of occluded or embolized tumor blood vessels, which lead to so-called heterogeneity of the EPR effect. We previously developed a method to restore impaired blood flow in blood vessels by using nitric oxide donors and other agents called EPR-effect enhancers. Here, we show that two novel EPR-effect enhancers\u2014isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN, Nitrol\u00ae) and sildenafil citrate\u2014strongly potentiated delivery of three macromolecular drugs to tumors: a complex of poly(styrene-co-maleic acid) (SMA) and cisplatin, named Smaplatin\u00ae (chemotherapy); poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) polymer-conjugated zinc protoporphyrin (photodynamic therapy and imaging); and SMA glucosamine-conjugated boric acid complex (boron neutron capture therapy). We tested these nanodrugs in mice with advanced C26 tumors. When these nanomedicines were administered together with ISDN or sildenafil, tumor delivery and thus positive therapeutic results increased two- to four-fold in tumors with diameters of 15 mm or more. These results confirmed the rationale for using EPR-effect enhancers to restore tumor blood flow. In conclusion, all EPR-effect enhancers tested showed great potential for application in cancer therapy.\n## Introduction\nThe enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is believed to be a universal mechanism occurring in most solid tumors and a key issue for selective delivery of nanomedicines to tumors [1][2][3][4][5][6]. Suppressed blood flow or obstructed blood vessels in advanced cancers lead to heterogeneity of the EPR effect [7][8][9][10][11][12]. Criticisms of the EPR effect were recently raised [13,14], probably because of inaccurate understanding of the EPR effect together with the use of inappropriate nanomedicines, particularly those lacking good stability in vivo and those with an inadequate or poor experimental design [7][8][9]. For instance, if the release of active pharmaceutical ingredients from liposomes is too slow because the complexes are very stable, even though they accumulates in tumors by EPR effect, the therapeutic outcome is poor [7][8][9][10][11][12]15]. \n\nThe EPR effect was first demonstrated in mouse tumor models in which the tumor size was usually smaller than 10 mm and the tumors were highly vasculated; nanomedicines thus had high permeability. In contrast, human tumors diagnosed in clinical situations are frequently larger than 3 mm and up to 10 cm or more. In such large tumors, blood flow is often suppressed or blood vessels are occluded because of the formation of vascular clots or thrombi [9][10][11][12][15][16][17][18]. This blood-flow suppression thus results in little or no drug delivery and, therefore, a highly limited EPR effect [9,12,[15][16][17][18]. However, Ding et al. observed that more than 87% of human renal tumors manifested a considerable EPR effect with significant diversity and heterogeneity in different patients [19]. Also, Lee et al. reported that nanoparticles conjugated with positron-emitting radionuclei such as 64 Cu resulted the EPR effect in breast cancer, including metastatic cancer [20].",

            "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is fast becoming a global menace and it is projected to be the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which develop in the pancreas\u2019 exocrine region, are the predominant type of pancreatic cancer, representing about 95% of total pancreatic tumors. The malignancy progresses asymptomatically, making early diagnosis difficult. It is characterized by excessive production of fibrotic stroma known as desmoplasia, which aids tumor growth and metastatic spread by remodeling the extracellular matrix and releasing tumor growth factors. For decades, immense efforts have been harnessed toward developing more effective drug delivery systems for pancreatic cancer treatment leveraging nanotechnology, immunotherapy, drug conjugates, and combinations of these approaches. However, despite the reported preclinical success of these approaches, no substantial progress has been made clinically and the prognosis for pancreatic cancer is worsening. This review provides insights into challenges associated with the delivery of therapeutics for pancreatic cancer treatment and discusses drug delivery strategies to minimize adverse effects associated with current chemotherapy options and to improve the efficiency of drug treatment.",

                    "text": "Enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) in cancer therapy leverages the structural and functional abnormalities of solid tumors [66,67]. Blood vessels in tumors form quickly and poorly as a result of an increased rate of angiogenesis to meet the increased demands for nutrients and oxygen [68]. The newly-formed blood vessels are distorted and the endothelial cells are poorly aligned with large openings [69]. The tumor's vascular wall also exhibits substantial structural abnormalities due to the absence of perivascular cells and smooth muscle layers [68,69]. The tumor's leaky vasculature facilitates the transport of macromolecules and nanoparticles into the tumor tissue while the complementary poor lymphatic drainage prevents clearance of the macromolecules and nanoparticles, leading to their accumulation within the tumor tissue [51,68,70]. Thus, the differences in the blood vessels of tumors and healthy tissues make targeting possible [70,71]. This phenomenon and passive tumor targeting is referred to as the EPR effect [68,69]. \n\nVarious studies have exploited the EPR effect in the delivery of macromolecular therapeutics and nanoformulations; however, the therapeutic effects vary depending on the tumor type, size, origin, and location [72,73]. Blood vessels in pancreatic adenocarcinoma may collapse or become clogged because of the dense stroma (Figure 2) and various extracellular components which induce stress and constriction, affecting the extravasation of macromolecules and particles into tumor tissues [67,[74][75][76]. This may explain why nanotherapeutics have not demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, other studies have reported that the EPR effect in cancer is not based only on the \"leakiness\" of the vasculature because rigid tumors such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer exhibit EPR [72,73,77,78].",

Olajubutu, Omotola D Ogundipe, A. Adebayo, S. Adesina\n## Abstract\nPancreatic cancer is fast becoming a global menace and it is projected to be the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which develop in the pancreas\u2019 exocrine region, are the predominant type of pancreatic cancer, representing about 95% of total pancreatic tumors. The malignancy progresses asymptomatically, making early diagnosis difficult. It is characterized by excessive production of fibrotic stroma known as desmoplasia, which aids tumor growth and metastatic spread by remodeling the extracellular matrix and releasing tumor growth factors. For decades, immense efforts have been harnessed toward developing more effective drug delivery systems for pancreatic cancer treatment leveraging nanotechnology, immunotherapy, drug conjugates, and combinations of these approaches. However, despite the reported preclinical success of these approaches, no substantial progress has been made clinically and the prognosis for pancreatic cancer is worsening. This review provides insights into challenges associated with the delivery of therapeutics for pancreatic cancer treatment and discusses drug delivery strategies to minimize adverse effects associated with current chemotherapy options and to improve the efficiency of drug treatment.\n## The Enhanced Permeability and Retention Effect in Pancreatic Cancer\nEnhanced permeability and retention (EPR) in cancer therapy leverages the structural and functional abnormalities of solid tumors [66,67]. Blood vessels in tumors form quickly and poorly as a result of an increased rate of angiogenesis to meet the increased demands for nutrients and oxygen [68]. The newly-formed blood vessels are distorted and the endothelial cells are poorly aligned with large openings [69]. The tumor's vascular wall also exhibits substantial structural abnormalities due to the absence of perivascular cells and smooth muscle layers [68,69]. The tumor's leaky vasculature facilitates the transport of macromolecules and nanoparticles into the tumor tissue while the complementary poor lymphatic drainage prevents clearance of the macromolecules and nanoparticles, leading to their accumulation within the tumor tissue [51,68,70]. Thus, the differences in the blood vessels of tumors and healthy tissues make targeting possible [70,71]. This phenomenon and passive tumor targeting is referred to as the EPR effect [68,69]. \n\nVarious studies have exploited the EPR effect in the delivery of macromolecular therapeutics and nanoformulations; however, the therapeutic effects vary depending on the tumor type, size, origin, and location [72,73]. Blood vessels in pancreatic adenocarcinoma may collapse or become clogged because of the dense stroma (Figure 2) and various extracellular components which induce stress and constriction, affecting the extravasation of macromolecules and particles into tumor tissues [67,[74][75][76]. This may explain why nanotherapeutics have not demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, other studies have reported that the EPR effect in cancer is not based only on the \"leakiness\" of the vasculature because rigid tumors such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer exhibit EPR [72,73,77,78].",

Various studies have demonstrated that different metal oxide NPs show cytotoxic effects by inducing apoptosis in cancerous cells and do not have any toxic impact on normal cells. The mechanism of cytotoxicity is shown through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by (MONPs) in the cancerous cell. In vitro and in vivo studies reveal that in some cases metal oxide NPs are used alone and somewhere these NPs are used in combination with other therapies such as photodynamic therapy and with anticancer nanomedicines as drug carriers or drug conjugates.

Finally, we also provide a simple and comparative analysis of the major apoptosis pathways proposed to increase beginner understanding of anti-cancer nanomaterials.

Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is one of the primary treatment strategies for unresectable HCC. However, the therapeutic effect is still unsatisfactory due to the insufficient distribution of antineoplastic drugs in tumor tissues and the worsened post-embolization tumor microenvironment (TME, e.g., hypoxia and reduced pH). Recently, using nanomaterials as a drug delivery platform for TACE therapy of HCC has been a research hotspot. With the development of nanotechnology, multifunctional nanoplatforms have been developed to embolize the tumor vasculature, creating conditions for improving the distribution and bioavailability of drugs in tumor tissues. Currently, the researchers are focusing on functionalizing nanomaterials to achieve high drug loading efficacy, thorough vascular embolization, tumor targeting, controlled sustained release of drugs, and real-time imaging in the TACE process to facilitate precise embolization and enable therapeutic procedures follow-up imaging of tumor lesions. Herein, we summarized the recent advances and applications of functionalized nanomaterials based on TACE against HCC, believing that developing these functionalized nanoplatforms may be a promising approach for improving the TACE therapeutic effect of HCC.",

The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect plays a vital role in passive targeting, which mainly relies on the anatomical and pathophysiological characteristics of solid tumors and their microenvironments, such as high vascular density in tumor tissue based on angiogenesis, intermittent tumor vasculature with leaky effects and poor drainage of tumor lymphatic system [119,120]. As shown in Fig. 3A, due to the EPR effect, nanoformulations in circulation can enter tumor tissues through the gaps between endothelial cells in tumor blood vessels [121]. This effect further enhances the preferential accumulation of nanocarriers within tumor tissues and accelerates intracellular delivery including endocytosis, lysosomal fusion, escape, cytoplasmic release, and combining the target organelle (Fig. 3B) [46,119,122]. These properties of tumors provide favorable conditions for designing tumor-targeted antitumor NPs. Drug-carrying NPs can increase the accumulation of chemotherapy drugs in tumor tissues through EPR effect, improve therapeutic effects and reduce toxic and side effects by reducing unnecessary release in normal tissues [123,124]. This unique passive targeting effect of nanomaterials on tumor tissue is highly beneficial for developing multifunctional nanoplatforms for TACE therapy of HCC, as it synergically enhances the safety of the transarterial administration and promotes more efficient drug absorption by the tumor.",

Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is one of the primary treatment strategies for unresectable HCC. However, the therapeutic effect is still unsatisfactory due to the insufficient distribution of antineoplastic drugs in tumor tissues and the worsened post-embolization tumor microenvironment (TME, e.g., hypoxia and reduced pH). Recently, using nanomaterials as a drug delivery platform for TACE therapy of HCC has been a research hotspot. With the development of nanotechnology, multifunctional nanoplatforms have been developed to embolize the tumor vasculature, creating conditions for improving the distribution and bioavailability of drugs in tumor tissues. Currently, the researchers are focusing on functionalizing nanomaterials to achieve high drug loading efficacy, thorough vascular embolization, tumor targeting, controlled sustained release of drugs, and real-time imaging in the TACE process to facilitate precise embolization and enable therapeutic procedures follow-up imaging of tumor lesions. Herein, we summarized the recent advances and applications of functionalized nanomaterials based on TACE against HCC, believing that developing these functionalized nanoplatforms may be a promising approach for improving the TACE therapeutic effect of HCC.\n## Passive targeting\nUnlike the above active targeting strategies, passive targeting serves as a basis for developing macromolecular anticancer therapy. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect plays a vital role in passive targeting, which mainly relies on the anatomical and pathophysiological characteristics of solid tumors and their microenvironments, such as high vascular density in tumor tissue based on angiogenesis, intermittent tumor vasculature with leaky effects and poor drainage of tumor lymphatic system [119,120]. As shown in Fig. 3A, due to the EPR effect, nanoformulations in circulation can enter tumor tissues through the gaps between endothelial cells in tumor blood vessels [121]. This effect further enhances the preferential accumulation of nanocarriers within tumor tissues and accelerates intracellular delivery including endocytosis, lysosomal fusion, escape, cytoplasmic release, and combining the target organelle (Fig. 3B) [46,119,122]. These properties of tumors provide favorable conditions for designing tumor-targeted antitumor NPs. Drug-carrying NPs can increase the accumulation of chemotherapy drugs in tumor tissues through EPR effect, improve therapeutic effects and reduce toxic and side effects by reducing unnecessary release in normal tissues [123,124]. This unique passive targeting effect of nanomaterials on tumor tissue is highly beneficial for developing multifunctional nanoplatforms for TACE therapy of HCC, as it synergically enhances the safety of the transarterial administration and promotes more efficient drug absorption by the tumor.",

                    "text": "To ensure their preferential accumulation in targeted tumours some anticancer drugs can be modified. We proposed to subdivide different approaches to targeting of anticancer and other drugs specifically to the site of action into two big clusters: passive and active targeting [67]. Active targeting is usually achieved when the drug is conjugated to a carrier together with a targeting component that redirects the carrier and associated drug to the specific cells. For a preferential accumulation of the modified drug specifically in the tumour or tumour environment, passive targeting includes modifications of drug or drug formulations other than using targeting moieties. \n\nThe oldest and most known approach for a passive targeting of anti-cancer drugs to tumours is the use of enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). The EPR effect was first described by Maeda and co-workers. The EPR effect is the result of the increased permeability of the tumour vascular endothelium to circulating macromolecules combined with limited lymphatic drainage from the tumour interstitium. High molecular weight substances or low molecular drugs coupled with high molecular weight carriers penetrate highly vascularized tumour tissues, are inefficiently removed by lymphatic drainage and therefore accumulate in tumours. The existence of the EPR effect was experimentally confirmed for many types of macromolecular anticancer drug delivery systems [68]. Despite the simplicity of the approach it has serious disadvantages. The accumulation of high molecular weight substances occurs only to solid tumours with developed vascularization, high tumour mass and poor lymphatic drainage. However, these types of solid tumours can be relatively easy removed by surgery. The efficiency of this type of passive targeting is low for multifocal metastatic tumours that cannot be removed using surgical procedures and requires chemotherapy. Consequently, the EPR effect cannot be effectively used for overcoming drug resistance in most tumours that badly require it. \n\nSeveral other approaches have been proposed for a passive targeting of anticancer drugs specifically to tumour cells. Most of them use specific tumour conditions to release anticancer drugs from the delivery system specifically to the tumour environment or in tumour cells [69,70].",

Karthikeyan\n## Abstract\nAn evolving form of treatment which emphases on alternative drug delivery is nanomedicine. It reduces unfavourable side effects to normal tissues and progresses the efficacy of treatment. Resistance towards cancer drug treatment is a complicated process that comprises of numerous mechanisms. To overcome these treatment complications and the major forms of drug resistance these nanomedicine provides new possibilities. These novel nanomedicines have a fast drug design, flexible and production based on genetic profiles of tumour. To overcome various forms of multi-drug resistance different nano drugs looks hopeful. As well as new prospects for cancer treatment alternative mechanisms of drug delivery and advanced designs are to proven to be worth full in overcoming, production based on genetic profiles of tumour. For overcoming cancer drug resistance, the current study aims to show the lead of nanomedicine in the medical science arena.\n## Passive targeting:\nTo ensure their preferential accumulation in targeted tumours some anticancer drugs can be modified. We proposed to subdivide different approaches to targeting of anticancer and other drugs specifically to the site of action into two big clusters: passive and active targeting [67]. Active targeting is usually achieved when the drug is conjugated to a carrier together with a targeting component that redirects the carrier and associated drug to the specific cells. For a preferential accumulation of the modified drug specifically in the tumour or tumour environment, passive targeting includes modifications of drug or drug formulations other than using targeting moieties. \n\nThe oldest and most known approach for a passive targeting of anti-cancer drugs to tumours is the use of enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). The EPR effect was first described by Maeda and co-workers. The EPR effect is the result of the increased permeability of the tumour vascular endothelium to circulating macromolecules combined with limited lymphatic drainage from the tumour interstitium. High molecular weight substances or low molecular drugs coupled with high molecular weight carriers penetrate highly vascularized tumour tissues, are inefficiently removed by lymphatic drainage and therefore accumulate in tumours. The existence of the EPR effect was experimentally confirmed for many types of macromolecular anticancer drug delivery systems [68]. Despite the simplicity of the approach it has serious disadvantages. The accumulation of high molecular weight substances occurs only to solid tumours with developed vascularization, high tumour mass and poor lymphatic drainage. However, these types of solid tumours can be relatively easy removed by surgery. The efficiency of this type of passive targeting is low for multifocal metastatic tumours that cannot be removed using surgical procedures and requires chemotherapy. Consequently, the EPR effect cannot be effectively used for overcoming drug resistance in most tumours that badly require it. \n\nSeveral other approaches have been proposed for a passive targeting of anticancer drugs specifically to tumour cells. Most of them use specific tumour conditions to release anticancer drugs from the delivery system specifically to the tumour environment or in tumour cells [69,70].",

            "abstract": "Photoimmunotherapy (PIT) is an upcoming potential cancer treatment modality, the effect of which is improved in combination with chemotherapy. PIT causes a super-enhanced permeability and retention (SUPR) effect. Here, we quantitatively evaluated the SUPR effect using radiolabeled drugs of varying molecular weights (18F-5FU, 111In-DTPA, 99mTc-HSA-D, and 111In-IgG) to determine the appropriate drug size. PIT was conducted with an indocyanine green-labeled anti-HER2 antibody and an 808 nm laser irradiation. Mice were subcutaneously inoculated with HER2-positive cells in both hindlimbs. The tumor on one side was treated with PIT, and the contralateral side was not treated. The differences between tumor accumulations were evaluated using positron emission tomography or single-photon emission computed tomography. Imaging studies found increased tumor accumulation of agents after PIT. PIT-treated tumors showed significantly increased uptake of 18F-5FU (p < 0.001) and 99mTc-HSA-D (p < 0.001). A tendency toward increased accumulation of 111In-DTPA and 111In-IgG was observed. These findings suggest that some low- and medium-molecular-weight agents are promising candidates for combined PIT, as are macromolecules; hence, administration after PIT could enhance their efficacy. Our findings encourage further preclinical and clinical studies to develop a combination therapy of PIT with conventional anticancer drugs.",

Currently, first-line cancer treatment regimens include one or more modalities, such as surgery, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Therefore, imaging/therapeutic/theranostic agent delivery remains an important issue in cancer management. Generally, these agents can be passively distributed to target cancer cells in tumors, and passive targeting relies mostly on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect derived from the leaky nature of tumor vasculature [2]. The basic pathophysiological phenomenon of EPR is hyperpermeable tumor vasculature combined with impaired lymphatic drainage, resulting in enhanced permeability and retention of molecules [3,4]. Although the conventional EPR effect results in improved delivery to tumors compared with normal tissue, some tumors do not exhibit the EPR effect and the permeability of vessels may not be the same throughout a single tumor [5,6]. Moreover, the rapid proliferation of cancer cells around the vessels may impede therapeu-tic molecule penetration [7]. Therefore, the killing of perivascular cancer cells will help improve the EPR effect. Treatments that induce apoptosis or necrosis in perivascular tumor sheaths can enhance the delivery of therapeutic molecules to solid tumors [8]. Several approaches are being explored to enhance vascular permeability and augment drug delivery within tumors, such as radiotherapy [9,10], hyperthermia [11], and photoimmunotherapy (PIT) [12]. \n\nRecently, PIT using a photosensitizer-conjugated antibody against tumor-associated antigens accompanied with exposure to light of a specific wavelength has been attracting attention as a new type of therapeutic modality for cancer [12,13]. The photosensitizerantibody conjugates strongly bind to cells in the immediate perivascular space, and thus PIT rapidly induces necrotic cell death, especially in the perivascular space, leading to a dramatic increase in tumor vascular permeability.",

Tsuji, Aya Sugyo, Masayuki Fujinaga, Ming-Rong Zhang, T. Higashi\n## Abstract\nPhotoimmunotherapy (PIT) is an upcoming potential cancer treatment modality, the effect of which is improved in combination with chemotherapy. PIT causes a super-enhanced permeability and retention (SUPR) effect. Here, we quantitatively evaluated the SUPR effect using radiolabeled drugs of varying molecular weights (18F-5FU, 111In-DTPA, 99mTc-HSA-D, and 111In-IgG) to determine the appropriate drug size. PIT was conducted with an indocyanine green-labeled anti-HER2 antibody and an 808 nm laser irradiation. Mice were subcutaneously inoculated with HER2-positive cells in both hindlimbs. The tumor on one side was treated with PIT, and the contralateral side was not treated. The differences between tumor accumulations were evaluated using positron emission tomography or single-photon emission computed tomography. Imaging studies found increased tumor accumulation of agents after PIT. PIT-treated tumors showed significantly increased uptake of 18F-5FU (p < 0.001) and 99mTc-HSA-D (p < 0.001). A tendency toward increased accumulation of 111In-DTPA and 111In-IgG was observed. These findings suggest that some low- and medium-molecular-weight agents are promising candidates for combined PIT, as are macromolecules; hence, administration after PIT could enhance their efficacy. Our findings encourage further preclinical and clinical studies to develop a combination therapy of PIT with conventional anticancer drugs.\n## Introduction\nCancer remains one of the most devastating diseases, with 18.1 million new cases and 9.6 million deaths worldwide in 2018 alone [1]. Currently, first-line cancer treatment regimens include one or more modalities, such as surgery, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Therefore, imaging/therapeutic/theranostic agent delivery remains an important issue in cancer management. Generally, these agents can be passively distributed to target cancer cells in tumors, and passive targeting relies mostly on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect derived from the leaky nature of tumor vasculature [2]. The basic pathophysiological phenomenon of EPR is hyperpermeable tumor vasculature combined with impaired lymphatic drainage, resulting in enhanced permeability and retention of molecules [3,4]. Although the conventional EPR effect results in improved delivery to tumors compared with normal tissue, some tumors do not exhibit the EPR effect and the permeability of vessels may not be the same throughout a single tumor [5,6]. Moreover, the rapid proliferation of cancer cells around the vessels may impede therapeu-tic molecule penetration [7]. Therefore, the killing of perivascular cancer cells will help improve the EPR effect. Treatments that induce apoptosis or necrosis in perivascular tumor sheaths can enhance the delivery of therapeutic molecules to solid tumors [8]. Several approaches are being explored to enhance vascular permeability and augment drug delivery within tumors, such as radiotherapy [9,10], hyperthermia [11], and photoimmunotherapy (PIT) [12]. \n\nRecently, PIT using a photosensitizer-conjugated antibody against tumor-associated antigens accompanied with exposure to light of a specific wavelength has been attracting attention as a new type of therapeutic modality for cancer [12,13]. The photosensitizerantibody conjugates strongly bind to cells in the immediate perivascular space, and thus PIT rapidly induces necrotic cell death, especially in the perivascular space, leading to a dramatic increase in tumor vascular permeability.",

            "text": "The field of nanomedicine is rapidly gaining interest due to its application in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, especially the treatment of cancer. The promise of nanomedicine is in the tumor microenvironment. This microenvironment allows the nanoparticles to penetrate from the blood vessels into the interstitial space of the tumor and retain the particles in the tumor. This phenomenon, referred to as the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR), is used to deliver large drug loads or imaging agents to the tumor site better than small molecules. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect describes the preferential accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors due to their leaky vascular system and poor lymphatic drainage [151]. The EPR generated great enthusiasm for the development of nanoparticle therapy as an anticancer therapy. However, the results of preclinical studies assessing the EPR effect were inconclusive. Some reports confirm the preferential accumulation of nanodrugs in the tumor via EPR, while others show that the effect of EPR is strongly dependent on the tumor model. Today, the EPR remains a controversial topic in nanomedicine [152]. Hansen et al., using canine spontaneous tumors that closely mimic the human condition and 64Cu-labeled liposomes that can be imaged with positron emission tomography, showed that rapidly growing tumors such as carcinomas are highly vascularized and therefore have more porous and leaky blood vessels, while slow-growing tumors, such as sarcomas, are not very vascularized [153]. The main conclusion from this, and other EPR studies, is that the clinical application of EPR-enhancing agents, in combination with nanomedicine, requires preclinical studies con-ducted in appropriate models, the combination of nanomedicine with the EPR-enhancing strategy must be designed for a certain type of cancer, and side effects of EPR enhancing agents must be taken into consideration [154]. \n\nMany current cancer drug delivery systems attempt to go further than simply ensuring tumor accumulation. Attempts are being made to combine cancer cell-specific targeting with EPR-based accumulation.",

            "text": "Simple Summary One of the important efforts in the treatment of cancers is to achieve targeted drug delivery by nanocarriers to be more effective and reduce adverse effects. However, due to the adverse responses of nanocarriers in clinical trials due to the very weak EPR effects, doubts have been raised in this regard. In this study, an attempt has been made to take a critical look at EPR approaches to enable the convergence of previous papers and the EPR critics to reach an appropriate therapeutic path. Although the effectiveness of EPR is highly variable due to the complex microenvironment of the tumor, there is high hope for cancer treatment by describing new strategies to overcome the challenges of EPR effect. Furthermore, in this paper an attempt was made to provide a reliable path for future to develop cancer therapeutics based on EPR effect. Abstract The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in cancer treatment is one of the key mechanisms that enables drug accumulation at the tumor site. However, despite a plethora of virus/inorganic/organic-based nanocarriers designed to rely on the EPR effect to effectively target tumors, most have failed in the clinic. It seems that the non-compliance of research activities with clinical trials, goals unrelated to the EPR effect, and lack of awareness of the impact of solid tumor structure and interactions on the performance of drug nanocarriers have intensified this dissatisfaction. As such, the asymmetric growth and structural complexity of solid tumors, physicochemical properties of drug nanocarriers, EPR analytical combination tools, and EPR description goals should be considered to improve EPR-based cancer therapeutics. This review provides valuable insights into the limitations of the EPR effect in therapeutic efficacy and reports crucial perspectives on how the EPR effect can be modulated to improve the therapeutic effects of nanomedicine.",

It is also an essential concept for designing anticancer drugs that can be selectively delivered into tumor tissue via the unique extravasation and retention mechanism for macromolecular drugs. As tumor vasculature is highly heterogeneous, the intensities of the EPR effect vary according to the types and locations of solid tumors in different species. However, the EPR effect is universally observed in a broad spectrum of solid tumors in human cancer as well as experimental animal tumor models. The matter is how to utilize the EPR effect for drug design and clinical application. Many hypotheses were proposed and tested to enhance the EPR effect in solid tumors in order to increase the efficacy of drug delivery. However, we should focus on increasing the blood flow in tumors so that more drugs can be perfused and accumulated inside tumor tissue and execute anticancer activities. Angiotensin II co-administration and the approach of intratumor arterial infusion should be considered to achieve selective tumor tissue perfusion for nanodrugs.",

The EPR effect is a phenomenon that occurs when the blood vessels surrounding a relatively large tumor become highly permeable while there is minimal lymphatic drainage from the tumor (Figure 7). This combination results in increased penetration of nanoparticles into the tumor and insufficient washing away of them by lymph. As a result, the particles accumulate and get retained in the tumor. As substances with high molecular weight, nanoparticles are naturally susceptible to this effect and, therefore, will passively accumulate in solid tumors. However, it has been observed that the use of enhanced EPR effects to transport nanomedicines to tumor sites is not consistently effective and is instead dependent on specific characteristics of the tumor and its physiological conditions [217]. Factors such as the degree of angiogenesis and lymphatic development, the amount of pericyte coverage in the tumor vasculature, the density of the tumor stroma, and intratumoral pressure are principal contributors to the variability in EPR effects. Understanding these aspects resulted in the creation of active targeting approaches, which currently represent the mainstream in cancer-targeted drug delivery under development and clinical trials. \n\nCancers 2024, 16, 1589 29 of 51 to this effect and, therefore, will passively accumulate in solid tumors.

            "text": "This invited editorial article aims at reporting progress about the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR for short), starting from a recent Special Issue in the Journal of Personalized Medicine (namely, \"EPR Effect-Based Tumor Targeted Nanomedicine\") and focusing specifically on one of these contributing articles, a review from Jun Wu entitled \"The Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) Effect: The Significance of the Concept and Methods to Enhance Its Application\", which has recently acquired the rank of a highly cited paper [1]. \n\nThe year 2021 was the 35th anniversary of the EPR effect's discovery when the first original paper of Matsumura and Maeda in Cancer Research was published in 1986 [2]. The EPR effect is a universal patho-physiological phenomenon and mechanism in which macromolecular compounds beyond a specific size can progressively accumulate in the tumor vascularized area and, in this way, carry out targeted delivery and retention of anticancer compounds in the solid tumor tissue [3]. It is believed that the EPR is an effective modality for cancer targeted delivery of a number of macromolecular compounds and drug-loaded nanocarriers [4]. In fact, it has been shown that tumor vessels are highly permeable to macromolecular compounds. After entering tumor tissue, these compounds are entrapped inside the tumor tissue for a prolonged period. Unfortunately, the development of nanomedicine has been hampered for decades in achieving therapeutic advantages in clinical practice. Actually, the existence and intensity of the EPR effect in human solid tumor circumstances have hardly been discussed [5,6]. The EPR effect has also been reported in solid tumors of animals and human patients [1][2][3]5]. The delivery efficiency of nanoparticles into human tumor tissue is very low compared to that in the animal tumor mode. Moreover, the extravasation mechanism for nanoparticles into tumors occurs through tumor vasculature gaps, and organelles [4]. \n\nIn his article, Jun Wu [1] brilliantly overviewed the advantages, pitfalls, and caveats of the EPR effect.",

            "text": "Passive targeting is the foremost mechanism by which nanocarriers and drug-bearing macromolecules deliver their payload selectively to solid tumors. An important driver of passive targeting is the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is the cornerstone of most carrier-based tumor-targeted drug delivery efforts. Despite the huge number of publications showcasing successes in preclinical animal models, translation to the clinic has been poor, with only a few nano-based drugs currently being used for the treatment of cancers. Several barriers and factors have been adduced for the low delivery efficiency to solid tumors and poor clinical translation, including the characteristics of the nanocarriers and macromolecules, vascular and physiological barriers, the heterogeneity of tumor blood supply which affects the homogenous distribution of nanocarriers within tumors, and the transport and penetration depth of macromolecules and nanoparticles in the tumor matrix. To address the challenges associated with poor tumor targeting and therapeutic efficacy in humans, the identified barriers that affect the efficiency of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect for macromolecular therapeutics and nanoparticle delivery systems need to be overcome. In this review, approaches to facilitate improved EPR delivery outcomes and the clinical translation of novel macromolecular therapeutics and nanoparticle drug delivery systems are discussed.",

Suppressed blood flow or obstructed blood vessels in advanced cancers lead to heterogeneity of the EPR effect [7][8][9][10][11][12]. Criticisms of the EPR effect were recently raised [13,14], probably because of inaccurate understanding of the EPR effect together with the use of inappropriate nanomedicines, particularly those lacking good stability in vivo and those with an inadequate or poor experimental design [7][8][9]. For instance, if the release of active pharmaceutical ingredients from liposomes is too slow because the complexes are very stable, even though they accumulates in tumors by EPR effect, the therapeutic outcome is poor [7][8][9][10][11][12]15]. \n\nThe EPR effect was first demonstrated in mouse tumor models in which the tumor size was usually smaller than 10 mm and the tumors were highly vasculated; nanomedicines thus had high permeability. In contrast, human tumors diagnosed in clinical situations are frequently larger than 3 mm and up to 10 cm or more. In such large tumors, blood flow is often suppressed or blood vessels are occluded because of the formation of vascular clots or thrombi [9][10][11][12][15][16][17][18]. This blood-flow suppression thus results in little or no drug delivery and, therefore, a highly limited EPR effect [9,12,[15][16][17][18]. However, Ding et al. observed that more than 87% of human renal tumors manifested a considerable EPR effect with significant diversity and heterogeneity in different patients [19]. Also, Lee et al. reported that nanoparticles conjugated with positron-emitting radionuclei such as 64 Cu resulted the EPR effect in breast cancer, including metastatic cancer [20].",

The nanoconstructs' reduced particle size, which is lower than tumour vascular permeability, allowed them to easily pass through and produce the EPR effect (600-800 nm). However, the nanoconstructs have the bigger particle size than the pore of blood capillary (6-12 nm) and renal filtration (5-6 nm), influences the targeting of NPs (Choi et al., 2009). \n\nMultiple tumors may develop tumor interstitium with different ECM (e.g., fibrin, fibronectin, hyaluronan collagen, and proteoglycans), tumor parenchyma and stroma cell compositions due to variations in the tumor type and stage. The variations in physical rigidity and pressure ranges may affect the distribution and transport of nanoconstructs in the tumor, which may further affect Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 10 their therapeutic efficacy (Swartz and Lund, 2012;Perry et al., 2017).

Studies in animal models have demonstrated a cut-off size of 500 nm - 1 \u00b5m for molecules or nanoparticles to extravasate into a tumor, however, surprisingly little is known about the kinetics of the EPR effect. Here we present a pharmacokinetic model to quantitatively assess the influence of the EPR effect on the uptake of a drug into a solid tumor. We use pharmacokinetic data for Doxil and doxorubicin from human clinical trials to illustrate how the EPR effect influences tumor uptake. This model provides a quantitative framework to guide preclinical trials of new chemotherapies and ultimately to develop design rules that can increase targeting efficiency and decrease unwanted side effects in normal tissue.",

            "text": "Chemotherapy for human solid tumors in clinical practice is far from satisfactory. Despite the discovery and synthesis of hundreds of thousands of anticancer compounds targeting various crucial units in cancer cell proliferation and metabolism, the fundamental problem is the lack of targeting delivery of these compounds selectively into solid tumor tissue to maintain an effective concentration level for a certain length of time for drug-tumor interaction to execute anticancer activities. The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) describes a universal pathophysiological phenomenon and mechanism in which macromolecular compounds such as albumin and other polymer-conjugated drugs beyond certain sizes (above 40 kDa) can progressively accumulate in the tumor vascularized area and thus achieve targeting delivery and retention of anticancer compounds into solid tumor tissue. Targeting therapy via the EPR effect in clinical practice is not always successful since the strength of the EPR effect varies depending on the type and location of tumors, status of blood perfusion in tumors, and the physical-chemical properties of macromolecular anticancer agents. This review highlights the significance of the concept and mechanism of the EPR effect and discusses methods for better utilizing the EPR effect in developing smarter macromolecular nanomedicine to achieve a satisfactory outcome in clinical applications.",

            "text": "The Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect is a phenomenon that occurs in solid tumors, allowing certain nanoparticles to preferentially accumulate and remain within the tumor tissue. It is an important concept in the field of nanoparticle-based drug delivery for cancer treatment. The EPR effect arises from the unique characteristics of tumor blood vessels and the tumor microenvironment. Compared to normal blood vessels, tumor blood vessels are often leaky, irregularly shaped, and have poor lymphatic drainage. These abnormal blood vessels result from the rapid and disorganized growth of tumor cells, leading to incomplete and insufficient vascular networks within the tumor tissue. The leaky blood vessels in tumors allow nanoparticles to extravasate or \"leak out\" into the tumor interstitial space more easily than in healthy tissues. Furthermore, due to the lack of functional lymphatic vessels, the clearance of these extravasated nanoparticles from the tumor tissue is limited. As a result, the nanoparticles can accumulate and persist in the tumor for an extended period, providing an opportunity for effective drug delivery. The EPR effect is size-dependent, with nanoparticles in the range of tens to hundreds of nanometers exhibiting the highest accumulation in tumor tissues. These nanoparticles can passively extravasate through the enlarged pores in tumor Shaily Tyagi, Ashish Kumar, Anurag Chourasia, Saket Saini, Deeksha, and Anjali Dixit International Journal of Research -GRANTHAALAYAH 7 blood vessels, allowing them to reach the tumor interstitial space. However, larger nanoparticles may face difficulties penetrating deeper into the tumor due to increased interstitial pressure.The EPR effect has been utilized in the design of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems. Nanoparticles can be engineered to carry anticancer drugs, imaging agents, or therapeutic agents specifically to the tumor site, taking advantage of the EPR effect. By encapsulating drugs within these nanoparticles, they can be protected from premature degradation, improve their stability, and allow for sustained release at the tumor site. This targeted delivery approach aims to enhance treatment efficacy while reducing the systemic toxicity associated with conventional chemotherapy.",

            "text": "In 1986, Matsumura [193] proposed a phenomenon where nanoparticles with specific sizes displayed tumor accumulation properties. This tumoritropic performance was then recognized as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and played an indispensable role in nanoscale drug delivery therapy field (Fig. 9). With respect to tumorous tissues, the augmented angiogenesis is prone to accompany with wide inter-endothelial gap, poor vessel structural integrity and lymphatic reflux deficiency. These vascular alterations enable micromolecular substances (100 nm to 200 nm) to selectively permeate and retain in tumor surroundings [194]. The EPR effect endows drug delivery systems with passive targeting ability and contributes to increased therapeutic efficiency as well as reduced systemic side effects. However, controversy exists since the EPR effect tremendously varies intratumorally and intertumorally due to distinct tumor microenvironments and vascular densities [195,196]. Warrenet al. [197] demonstrated that rare nanoparticles could passively penetrate into the tumor vessels of ovarian cancer, breast cancer and GBM. Based on mouse models, human tumorous tissues and mathematical models, conclusion was made that 97% of nanoparticles were transported through active process instead of passive diffusion [197]. Ding et al. [198] held opposite opinion that 87% renal cancer exhibited significant EPR effect, despite considerable heterogeneity was also observed in tumors with different size and gender (male samples showed intensified EPR) [198]. The EPR effect  may eventually depend on the specific tumor pathophysiology, because differences were observed in the variety of tumor types. Although numerous EPR effect studies based on animal models achieved significant efficacy, the majority of which were failed to be translated into clinic [199]. Therefore, more intensive investigations should be conducted to fully illustrate the EPR effect behind nanoparticle drug delivery platforms. Conventional anti-GBM drug delivery is invariably accompanied by unsatisfactory bio-distribution and systemic side effects. Since plenty of therapeutic agents against GBM cells fail to reach the action site and function in vivo, novel nanoscale biomaterials have been developed as vehicle to escort them.",

            "text": "As seen in several papers, the high accumulation of drug nanocarriers in normal tissues can lead to undesirable toxicity through drug release and catalytic activity [111]. With this new perspective, it can be hoped that the actual accumulation of drug nanocarriers into solid tumors will result in a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment, especially by enhanced tumor penetration of the drug. Therefore, to enhance therapeutic activities in solid tumors, accepting the EPR effect, along with recruiting combined therapeutic modalities to trigger the penetration of drug nanocarriers into malignant cells, can result in improved nano-based precision carriers for targeting therapeutic and diagnostic agents in the treatment of cancer. However, the accumulation of drug nanocarriers in solid tumors, especially in peritumoral areas, could be an EPR-independent strategy. Therefore, based on the nature of the nanocarriers and drug availability, a new delivery nanoplatform could be developed for tracking and treating poorly vascularized solid tumors. Another strategy to modulate EPR is the manipulation of drug nanocarriers through surface charge modifications, cluster size, flexible shape, and surface coatings for greater stability, with or without external inducers, to augment the permeability of tumor-associated vessels [6,112,113]. Modifications applied to drug nanocarriers to enhance the EPR effect usually do not result in potential active targeting. Since the effect of EPR indicates a high accumulation of targeted nanocarriers in the stromal tissue of solid tumors, overtaking the inflow on outflow of drug nanocarriers can lead to inactive or semi-active accumulation of nanocarriers in solid tumors using the EPR effect. \n\nCompetition is also one of the most important strategies in the development of therapeutic nanomedicine for solid tumors. Indeed, the main competitors of EPR-based treatment of solid tumors are the liver, spleen, lung, and kidney. Therefore, reducing the clearance of drug nanocarriers by modulating the physicochemical properties of nanocarriers matched to the TME of solid tumors can improve EPR-based tumor targeting and cancer nanomedicine treatment efficacy. As mentioned in Section 3, altering the physicochemical properties of drug nanocarriers can alter penetration into tumor tissue.",

            "text": "The concept of drug delivery to tumors by nanoparticles (NP) is largely based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect that relies on the anatomical and pathophysiological differences between solid tumors and normal tissues. Thus, the EPR effect is a functional consequence of such tumor features as abnormally leaky blood vessels and impaired lymphatic drainage that are beneficial for its growth and also enhance the extravasation and retention of macromolecules and colloids in the tumor. First reported by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 [1], the EPR effect initially served as a basis for the development of anticancer therapy using macromolecular drugs but later it was also applied to colloidal drug delivery systems based on nanocarriers, such as polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, and micelles. [1,2]. However, the results of the EPR-based delivery as a strategy for enhancing the selectivity of the antitumor drugs are often disappointing. One possible reason is a considerable inter-and intra-individual heterogeneity of tumors. Indeed, while the EPR effect is undoubtedly an intrinsic pathophysiological feature of solid tumors, it may change over time during tumor development and varies not only between animal models and patients, but even among tumors and metastases within the same patient [3,4]. This heterogeneity of tumors and complexity of the EPR phenomenon might be responsible, at least in part, for the limited translation of colloidal drug delivery systems into clinics [5][6][7][8]. Moreover, the EPR mechanisms has been much disputed. Thus, the earlier studies described the nanocarriers' entry into tumors as a result of their influx via the more or less permanent inter-endothelial gaps (or pores) in the tumor vessels, and it was therefore concluded that this influx depended on the cut-off size of these pores [9][10][11].",

However, the correlations are significantly stronger for the imaging contrast ratio (permeability factor R 2 = 0.20; retention factor R 2 = 0.67) than for the delivery ratio (R 2 = 0.12 and 0.25) or tumor cell delivery (R 2 = 0.09 and 0.27). This is consistent with our previous results, which suggest that the EPR effect is more important for the use of pHLIP as an imaging contrast agent than for its use as a tumor-specific drug delivery system. Finally, we observed correlations between the blood-tissue transport rate constants and the magnitude of tumor cell delivery. The correlations between these parameters were either absent or significantly weaker for the imaging contrast ratio and the delivery ratio. Parameters that resulted in increased transport of pHLIP from blood to tissue (k FBN and k PBN ) were correlated with increased tumor cell delivery, while the opposite was true for the tissue-to-blood transport parameters (k FNB and k PNB ). Moreover, the rate of free pHLIP elimination from the blood was negatively correlated with tumor cell delivery, but not with imaging contrast ratio or delivery ratio. Taken together, these results suggest that these parameters have a much stronger impact on pHLIP delivery than on tumor targeting.",

            "text": "In the realm of targeted drug delivery for cancer treatment, the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect serves as a cornerstone of passive targeting strategies. Tumors are characterized by irregular vasculature and impaired lymphatic drainage, allowing nanoparticles to accumulate passively within the tumor microenvironment (Upponi & Torchilin, 2014). The EPR effect leverages this unique physiological characteristic of tumor tissues, facilitating the selective accumulation of nanoparticles in the tumor without the need for specific targeting ligands. Although the EPR effect has shown efficacy in various preclinical models, its success in clinical applications remains inconsistent, potentially due to variability in tumor vascularization and interstitial pressures (Domb & Kumar, 2013). \n\nConversely, active targeting approaches enhance specificity by incorporating ligands on nanoparticle surfaces that bind to specific receptors overexpressed on cancer cells. These ligand-receptor interactions enable nanoparticles to actively seek out and adhere to target cells, significantly enhancing cellular uptake compared to passive methods alone (Zi et al., 2022). Commonly used ligands include antibodies, peptides, and small molecules that are selected based on the receptor profiles of the target tumor cells. Active targeting strategies not only improve therapeutic payload delivery but also enable precise modulation of drug release in response to environmental stimuli, such as pH changes in the tumor microenvironment (Doppalapudi,et al., 2016). \n\nWhile passive targeting is advantageous due to its simplicity and broad applicability, it often lacks the precision of ligand-mediated delivery systems. Integrating both passive and active targeting mechanisms holds promise for overcoming the limitations of each approach. However, optimizing ligand density and nanoparticle stability remains a critical focus of ongoing research to maximize therapeutic efficacy and minimize off-target effects in clinical settings (Upponi & Torchilin, 2014;Domb & Kumar, 2013).",

            "text": "In the field of nanomedicine, particularly in the design and application of NPs for tumor treatment, the EPR effect is considered a key mechanism 135 . Nanomedicines target tumor tissue by exploiting the EPR effect, which utilizes the permeability of tumor vasculature and defects in the lymphatic system for passive accumulation in solid tumors. Discovered in 1986, the EPR effect has been crucial in cancer nanotherapy 136 . However, it varies because of the complexity and heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment, with its abnormal structure of tumor blood vessels, high interstitial pressure, and uneven blood flow. The EPR effect also varies significantly among patients, tumor types, and even between primary tumors and metastases within the same patient 137 . This leads to uneven distribution of NPs within the tumor, thereby limiting their therapeutic effects 138 . This variability results in cancer nanomedicines having different levels of accumulation and therapeutic effects in different tumors and patients 139 . Therefore, to enhance the accumulation of nanomedicines in tumors with low EPR effects, researchers have proposed several alternative targeting strategies, including tumor vasculature targeting, cell-mediated tumor targeting, tumor-penetrating peptides, iRGD (internalizing arginine-glycine-aspartate, CRGDK/RGPD/EC)-facilitated transendothelial extravasation, improved tumor penetration, and local delivery methods 140 . \n\nA key challenge in translating the EPR effect from animal models to human clinical applications stems from significant differences between animal and human vasculature. For instance, animal models, particularly rodent tumors, often show stronger EPR effects because of higher blood flow and distinct vascular architecture. Studies have shown that rodent tumors have an average blood flow of 5.4 mL/100 g/min, while human tumors range between 30 and 64.8 mL/100 g/min, leading to less efficient NP accumulation in human tissues. Additionally, higher interstitial fluid pressure and solid stress in human tumors further limit drug penetration. Overcoming these barriers is crucial for improving the clinical efficacy of EPR-based nanomedicines 141 . \n\nTherefore, researchers have focused on improving permeability and retention to enhance NP accumulation within tumors 142 .",

This is because, on the one hand, the vascular system of tumor tissues, compared to that of normal tissues, is structurally abnormal and more \"leaky, \" allowing these abnormal vessels to have larger gaps, which enables nanoscale drug delivery systems to pass through the vascular wall into tumor tissues more easily; on the other hand, compared to normal tissues, tumor tissues lack an effective lymphatic drainage system, meaning that once the drug delivery systems penetrate the vascular wall into the tumor tissues, they are more difficult to clear [142]. As a result, the concentration of these nanoscale drug delivery systems in tumor tissues increases, and their retention time prolongs, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect of the drugs on tumor cells.",

            "text": "Despite various approaches to control solid tumor growth, such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and thermotherapy, solid tumors are still the leading cause of death in cancer patients [1]. The need for better clinical outcomes in patients with cancer has led researchers to reconsider therapeutic strategies. To overcome these issues, the structural characteristics of solid tumors, drug nanocarrier transport in tumor vessels and the interstitium, selective drug delivery systems, and analytical tools should be carefully considered to develop cancer therapeutics [2,3]. Although it has long been thought that drug nanocarriers will facilitate cancer therapeutics by directing drugs to solid tumors, nanomedicine development has not yet achieved promising clinical outcomes. Numerous reports indicate that virus-/inorganic nanoparticles-/organic nanoparticles-based nanocarriers could improve the efficacy and safety of anticancer drugs through potential targeting, mitigated drug release in non-target tissues, and pH-sensitive drug release in the tumor microenvironment (TME) [4][5][6][7]. Tumor vascular permeability and the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) mechanism in macromolecular drug delivery to solid tumors have been reported as successful strategies for cancer therapeutics [8][9][10]. However, the low EPR effect in human solid tumors [8], poor tumor extravasation [11] and infiltration [11], and a diversity in the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME) [12] has resulted in the full realization of EPR-mediated cancer therapeutics [13]. \n\nToday, simulation models have reported the dynamics of tumor vessel cooption and have promoted the treatment of solid tumors [14,15]. However, different results were obtained from different strategies aimed at investigating EPR-mediated drug delivery to cancer cells.",

Regardless of the stages of vascular formation in solid tumors, which have been studied by Fang et al. [42], exploring the molecular characteristics of tumor vessels can provide a more accurate understanding of the active or inactive delivery of drug nanocarriers. Unlike normal vascular architecture with a homogeneous distribution of endothelial cells surrounded by pericytes, the heterogeneous vasculature of a solid tumor results in different permeability models [43]. This morphological abnormality not only provides greater vascular permeability in solid tumors but also leads to increased interstitial pressure in the tumor tissue, which generates multiple distribution patterns of drug nanocarriers [44]. It seems that determining the balance between vascular resistance and vascular leakage of solid tumors can be used as a basis for drug delivery mediated by the EPR effect to increase therapeutic efficacy in interstitial fluid. Basically, momentary changes in fluid flow with vascular resistance, and vascular leakage with vascular wall pore diameters ranging from 50-100 nm (tumor vessels with poor permeability) to 500-1000 nm (high permeability vessels) are explained. Overall, the EPR effect is expected to be more effective during the early phases of cancer growth or peritumors than late phases due to improved leakage behavior and the rate of fluid flow. This result could advance future therapeutics for solid tumors with a different approach.",

Fast-growing tumors develop poorly organized vasculature with large endothelial fenestrations that allows NPs to accumulate in the tumor interstitium. Tumors also have impaired lymphatic drainage that enhances NP retention in the tumor [88,89]. Although the EPR effect has served as the foundation for most cancer nanomedicines, there is heterogeneity in its presentation based on tumor type and patient population. Furthermore, the size of a tumor and the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment affect the EPR effect [90]. The existence of the EPR effect in metastasis is an unresolved question, with studies reporting that metastases exhibit the phenomenon [91], while others report otherwise, especially in early-stage metastasis [92]. \n\nTargeting of therapeutics to bone metastases or any other tissue can utilize the unique physical characteristics of the tissue (passive targeting) to improve drug delivery. In the bone, passive targeting takes advantage of the fenestrations in bone-marrow capillaries. Active targeting exploits specific receptors upregulated on bone-marrow endothelial cells or specific interactions with the bone matrix to improve drug delivery. In this section, we discuss the different methods of targeting, the ligands used, and the NPs utilized (Table 3).",

In this review, we summarize clinical studies in which imaging has provided valuable information on the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and target site accumulation of nanomedicine-based drug delivery systems. Importantly, these studies provide convincing evidence on the uptake of nanomedicines in tumors, confirming that the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is a real phenomenon in patients, albeit with fairly high levels of inter- and intraindividual variability. It is gradually becoming clear that imaging is critically important to help address this high heterogeneity. In support of this notion, a decent correlation between nanomedicine uptake in tumors and antitumor efficacy has recently been obtained in two independent studies in patients, exemplifying that image-guided drug delivery can help to pave the way towards individualized and improved nanomedicine therapies.",

Within solid tumors, the microenvironment is often characterized by high cell density, irregular blood vessel structures, elevated interstitial pressure, and an acidic milieu, which collectively impede drug penetration. These physiological barriers may prevent therapeutics from accessing solid tumors and lead to suboptimal treatment outcomes. Matsumura and Maeda's pioneering work demonstrated that nanoparticles can extravasate through inherently leaky and loosely compacted tumor vasculature, remaining within the tumor space due to poor lymphatic drainage; this effect is known as Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) [173]. Despite the EPR-mediated enhancement of passive targeting, a modest < twofold increase in nanodrug entry was measured in tumors compared to normal organs [174]. Thus, the intratumor drug concentrations achievable with passively targeted nanoparticles may be inadequate for effective treatment of most cancers [175,176].",

For instance, by packaging with a well-designed nano-shell, the diagnostic agents as well as therapeutic agents can attach to the tumor cell, so as to increase the concentration and prolong the exposure time. Moreover, using a nano-vehicle with a biphasic structure can increase the solubility of hydrophobic agents and improve the drug distribution in the bladder [19,20]. Moreover, solid tumor tissues are rich in blood vessels, wide in vascular wall space, poor in structural integrity, and lack lymphatic return, resulting in high permeability and re-tention of nanoparticles. That is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The EPR effect promotes the selective distribution of macromolecular substances in tumor tissue as well as preventing the internal agents from prematurely exposing to the body fluid or the normal tissue, so as to protect the agents from degradation and decrease the immunogenicity of agents [20].

            "text": "Cancer nanomedicine was originally developed for more efficient delivery of chemotherapeutic agents into tumor, and has been extensively employed as a therapeutic for cancer treatment owing to its unique features in drug delivery, diagnosis and imaging, as well as the therapeutic nature of some nanomaterials themselves [1,2]. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect has been considered as the major discipline for development of cancer nanomedicine [3]. By this way, nanomedicines can passively accumulate in tumor due to the large interendothelial gaps and the absence of lymphatic drainage [4,5]. However, the translation of nanomedicine has been limited due to the low clinical effectiveness of EPR effect. According to a retrospective analysis of published studies during 2005-2015, it was founded that only 0.7% of nanoparticle was delivered to solid tumor following systemic administration [6]. Recently, Sindhwani et al. found that the gaps of leaky vessels are not responsible for the penetration into tumor over several different types of tumors [7], as tumor vasculature is mostly continuous, and gaps occur at a very low frequency. It is crucial to explore new strategies to bypass the bottlenecks of traditional nanomedicine delivery. Besides passive accumulation by EPR effect, nanomaterials can integrate novel mechanisms for active tumor-targeted delivery. Taking advantage of molecular markers overexpressing on tumor tissues compared to normal cells, incorporating specific ligands or antibodies should be considered to promote nanoparticle accumulation in solid tumors. Nanomedicine with penetration-assisted peptides or transformable properties, such as reversible charge, have been explored to increase internalization of drugs through active transport [8].",

The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect has been extensively utilized in the design of nanocarriers. However, its efficacy in patients has become controversial following clinical studies [36]. Recent research has highlighted considerable heterogeneity in the clinical effectiveness of the EPR effect in tumors, suggesting that it may not be as pronounced as observed in animal models [37,38]. Additionally, studies have begun to explore mechanisms beyond the EPR effect, such as the lymphatic elimination of nanoparticles and the promotion of tumor penetration through activated transcellular transport pathways [39][40][41]. These insights imply that the accumulation of nanoparticles within tumor tissues could be governed by a more intricate array of biological processes, rather than solely relying on the EPR effect. Notably, although targeted drug delivery at the tissue level has improved in vivo drug distribution to some extent [42], there remains a lack of specificity. Increasing evidence suggests that solely delivering nano-carriers to tumor tissues is insufficient as poor accumulation and penetration significantly restrict the therapeutic effects of drugs [43]. Furthermore, merely determining the targeted accumulation of a drug at the tumor tissue level often falls short in accurately predicting its therapeutic efficacy [44,45]. Doubts persist regarding the effective binding ability between free drugs delivered by nano-carriers and their intended targets, posing a major limitation to tissue targeting.",

            "text": "EPR-targeted drug delivery was first discovered by Maeda and colleagues in solid murine tumors and reached the clinic about 30 years ago with the approval of the first EPR-based drug. Interpersonal and intra-, as well as inter-tumoral heterogeneity, is a major difficulty in EPR drug delivery studies. Since drug accumulation through EPR effect in the tumor may not be enough to obtain therapeutic effect, penetration, internalization, effective drug delivery, and cytoplasmic release are crucial for improvements with anticancer therapy. Actively targeted drug delivery systems have been highly useful for the treatment of hematological malignancies, whereas, for solid tumors, active targeting must rely on EPR-mediated accumulation in tumors. Quantification of the EPR-effect is thus necessary. To assess the EPR effect, the development of fast, quantitative EPR-imaging Active targeting can also be used as a complementary approach to EPR-mediated tumor targeting to enhance drug delivery, accumulation, and retention in tumors [174]. Finally, pharmacological and physical co-treatments, nanoparticle-based combination therapies, bio-inspired design of nanoparticles allowing tumor-selective drug release, advanced imaging techniques coupled with HTP computing technologies, and development of 3D-models of cells, better animal models, and organoids are necessary to improve the application and efficacy of EPR-targeted drug delivery for cancer therapy in both clinical and pre-clinical settings.",

            "text": "Solid tumors are characterized, among other features, by the abnormal development of blood and lymphatic vessels, which results in increased vascular permeability and reduced lymphatic drainage compared to normal tissues.For this reason, intravenously administered mNPs can more readily accumulate in the tumor tissue.This process is known as the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect and was first described by Prof. Maeda in 1986 [76].In the field of nanotechnology, the EPR effect has been extensively studied for both diagnosis and therapy of solid tumors, aiming to improve efficacy and reduce side effects in healthy tissues [77].In fact, it has been widely described as the most efficient mechanism for targeting mNPs in solid tumors [78][79][80][81].However, it is also known that the EPR effect varies depending on the type of tumor, its developmental stage, and the heterogeneity of blood vessels [82].\n\nThus, the EPR effect remains the subject of considerable controversy.For instance, aberrant tumor vasculature may translate into poor tissue perfusion and inefficient dis-semination of the therapeutic.Also, the increased interstitial pressure inside tumors is another physical barrier for passive tumor targeting.In 2014, Prof. Nichols commented that the attenuated impact of the EPR effect in the fight against cancer is likely the result of numerous factors, although none of them entirely invalidate it [83].In this regard, some of us have recently demonstrated that the limitations observed in the EPR effect are even more pronounced in the context of brain tumors [84].\n\nNonetheless, in certain cases, the EPR effect can serve as a good basis for achieving significant accumulations of mNPs in the tumor through their intelligent design, capable of utilizing intrinsic tissue properties that lead to stability changes of mNPs, allowing them to remain retained for longer periods.An example is the work by Tseng et al. [85], in which they reported the development of a lactate-responsive mNP carrier as a therapeutic approach for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a subcutaneous mouse model (H1975 cell line).",

            "text": "Enhanced permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, first introduced in 1986 by Matsumura and Maeda, has been increasingly studied over time. Pathophysiological characteristics of EPR vary substantially with tumorous and healthy tissues of a patient. It has been realized that the EPR effect is heterogeneous and changes with the progression of tumor (Golombek et al. 2018;Sindhwani et al. 2020). It has been recognized as an important platform for NP delivery to solid tumors. Low MW drugs are easily extravagant out of the blood vessels and accumulate in the healthy tissues, while, on the other hand, abnormal wide fenestrations in tumor results in retention of nanodrugs, up to several hundred nanometers in size, at the pathological sites. This, along with lack of lymphatic drainage, limits the accumulation of NPs in tumors (Fig. 3). As a consequence, clinical outcomes of nanoparticles fluctuate (Rosenblum et al. 2018;Sindhwani et al. 2020).\n\nTo translate the NPs from clinical research successfully to clinical application, and facilitate personalized cancer therapy, it is important that efficient passive targeting NPs should be designed, which can selectively target the tumor cells through EPR (Yao et al. 2020;Zhao et al. 2016). A combined effect of pharmacological and physical (hyperthermia and radiotherapy) approaches can be employed to enhance the accumulation of EPRbased nanocarriers in the tumor tissue, and thus increase the treatment efficacy. Researchers have attempted to combine the drug carriers with functionalized physical, biological or chemical ligands to improve passive and active targeting strategies (Nguyen et al. 2021). Daunoxome, Marqibo, Onivyde, Genexol-PM, CPX-1, AZD2811 and EndoTAG-1 are few examples of passively targeted NPs currently used clinically with a better pharmacokinetic profile (Wilhelm et al. 2016). Currently, a liposome encapsulated Doxorubicin (C225-ILS-DOX) was formulated (Table 2), where delivery efficacy was further increased by attaching antibody fragments to its surface.

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is historically one of the most frequently cited advantages of nanoparticle cancer therapeutics [37]. As tumorigenesis occurs, the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) induces the formation of a disordered, complex vascular network feeding tumor cells as they proliferate. High expression of VEGF in tumor tissue has been implicated in the formation of abnormal vascular wall morphology, where the endothelium lining the blood vessels contains large gaps-or \"leaky\" junctions-allowing for enhanced permeability of small particles and cells across the vascular wall. It is this enhanced permeability that is a double-edged sword for cancer: on the one hand, it is believed to enhance tumor metastasis by allowing the escape of tumor cells into the infiltrating vessels, which circulate them across the body to distant metastatic sites [38]; on the other hand, the leaky vasculature unique to the tumor microenvironment promotes the accumulation of systemically circulating nanoparticles at the tumor site, a phenomenon that should enhance the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle drugs against solid tumors. Despite the premise of the EPR effect to preferentially enhance the uptake of nanoparticles in tumors, the challenges we have outlined above clearly indicate there remains significant room for improving nanoparticle delivery. Uptake into tumor tissue via the EPR effect alone has been found to result in a mere 2-fold increase in accumulation of systemically injected drugs [39]. While drugs piggybacking on the EPR effect have excelled in preclinical models, they have yet to find clinical success in humans [40]. For many anti-cancer drugs, such as chemotherapeutics that are inherently toxic, systemic injection of even nanoparticle formulations must be done at very high doses to achieve significant drug accumulation via the EPR effect; this occurs, however, at the cost of off-target toxicity that limits the administered dose and therefore, the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs [39].",

            "text": "The Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect is a phenomenon that leads to the enhanced accumulation and retention of macromolecules and nanoparticles in solid tumors compared to normal tissues [188,219]. This improved accumulation results from the tumor vasculature that grows abnormally in order to feed the rapidly growing tumor. This results in leaks in the vasculature, from which nanomedicines can penetrate the tumor. However, the EPR effect is not a universal property of all solid tumors and care should be taken when exploring this route of passive tumor targeting [219]. Some tumors have a very dense extracellular matrix with very limited EPR-based accumulation (e.g., pancreatic ductal carcinoma). In addition, analysis from 200 different patient tumors across eight different cancer types have revealed marked differences in the tumor vasculature and morphology, observed between tumor types, between tumors of the same type, and even within the same tumor [218,219]. Despite this large heterogeneity, a good number of patients could still benefit from EPR-based passive targeting, and improvements in diagnostics to identify which patients could benefit from EPR would lead to better treatment outcomes [220]. To make use of the EPR effect, PEGylation is commonly used to increase the circulation lifetime long enough to allow the accumulation of the therapeutic nanoparticles in the tumor. As described above, PEGylation can also be used to achieve tunable sizes in the 30-100 nm range [124,180], and this size tunability could be employed to improve perfusion in denser tumors.",

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is a property of macromolecules larger than 40 kDa or even 800 kDa (even as large as bacteria); these macromolecules include proteins such as albumin and immunoglobulin-G (IgG), polymer conjugates, liposomes, micellar drugs, nanoparticles, and other biocompatible macromolecular compounds [1][2][3][4][5]. The macromolecules tend to accumulate in tumor tissues much more than in normal tissues [1][2][3][4][5]. In 1986, Matsumura and Maeda found that the underlying mechanism of tumor-selective drug targeting is based on the unique characteristics of tumor blood vessels [6]. The causes of the EPR effect are (i) defective tumor blood vessels; (ii) various vascular effectors including nitric oxide (NO), bradykinin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), carbon monoxide (CO) produced by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and prostaglandins (e.g., prostaglandin E 2 , prostaglandin I 2 ) that facilitate extravasation; and (iii) impaired lymphatic clearance, so that macromolecular drugs remain in tumor tissues for extended periods [1,4,[7][8][9][10]. The EPR effect occurs not only in primary cancers but also in metastatic cancers including lymphatic, liver, and lung metastases and in inflamed tissues [4,[10][11][12]. Different researchers throughout the world have extensively verified the EPR effect in different tumor models as well as in cancer patients [2,[13][14][15]. \n\nThe heterogeneity of tumor tissues is another important issue because the EPR effect depends on tumor blood flow: no blood flow suggests a poor EPR effect or no EPR effect at all [10,11,16,17].",

This mechanism describes the intrinsic ability of macromolecules to reach and accumulate in the solid tumors' interstitium, based on tumor pathophysiological characteristics such as: (i) neovascularization, characterized by deficient basement membranes and fenestrated structures of endothelial tubes, (ii) upregulation of inflammatory factors and (iii) lack of efficient drainage of lymphatic systems, that together sustain the delivery, accumulation and retention of molecules into solid tumor tissues [35,36]. Passive targeting exploits the EPR effect on the delivery and retention of drugs at target site. However, in clinical settings, this strategy has not always worked as well as hoped due to a variety of factors, including the tumor type, location, blood perfusion status, physical-chemical characteristics of delivered agents and difficulty in predicting the distribution of drugs.",

            "text": "Solid tumors exhibit a special microenvironment featuring tortuous vascularity, angiogenesis, and hypoxia [1][2][3]. Abnormal tumor vasculature, high interstitial fluid pressure, growth-induced solid stresses. And solid stresses from the abnormal stromal matrix are the main limitations that prevent drugs from penetrating the solid tumor [4,5]. Therefore, the accurate and efficient delivery of theranostic agents into tumor lesions in a controlled manner is critical and remains a significant challenge till date. However, the absence of vascular supportive tissues in tumors results in the formation of leaky vessels with pores (200 nm to 1.2 \u03bcm in diameter) [6] and leads to poor lymphatic drainage, which is the structural basis of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The EPR effect is considered an effective method to achieve the passive targeting of tumor tissues [7,8]. In preclinical studies, targeted delivery systems based on EPR have demonstrated a remarkable improvement in anticancer efficacy when compared Ivyspring International Publisher with the efficacy of traditional chemotherapeutic drugs [7][8][9]. \n\nHowever, numerous parameters (such as vascular permeability and mutation, tumor cell density, and tumor stromal heterogeneity) prevent the successful application of EPR-based theranostics in clinical applications because of tumor heterogeneity [10][11][12][13][14][15]. Different patients with the same type of tumor, different types and sizes of tumor, and different developmental stages of the same tumor may show different EPR effects [16,17]. For example, hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma both have high vascular density and exhibit a strong EPR effect, whereas pancreatic and prostate cancers are characterized by low vascular density, resulting in a lower EPR effect [18]. Metastatic tumors have a high degree of necrosis at the central site relative to the primary tumor because of the lack of blood vessels due to the decrease in the EPR effect.",

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect first coined by Matsumura and Maeda [16] is defined the phenomenon of macromolecules or high molecular weight drug and nanomedicine accumulation inside solid tumor models compared to healthy tissue counterparts [4]. EPR effect is usually induced by a leaky tumor vasculature by the accelerated angiogenesis and impaired lymphatic drainage by the disorganized growth of tumors [104,105]. In details, NPs with appropriate sizes can evade the tumor capillaries and be retained in the tumor tissues for days due to the lack of lymphatic drainage. Additionally, particles with high positive charges can bind non-specifically to the negatively charged luminal surface due to the presence of sulfate and carboxylate sugar moieties [106]. It is noteworthy that nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins, and bradykinin, which act as vasodilators, can enhance the EPR effect in tumors by increasing their vascular permeability [107]. Furthermore, some nanomedicine formulations are effective in the treatment of multidrug resistance (MDR) [108]. In contrast, Jain et al. [109] claimed that elevated interstitial fluid pressure and heterogeneous blood supply limit macromolecular delivery to tumors. Furthermore, a key challenge is the promotion of the EPR effect in patients with EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes since the EPR-insensitive phenotype is known to have smaller endothelial fenestrations, heterogeneously high or low pericyte coverage, more developed and branched vasculatures, a relatively dense ECR, and more developed immune profiles compared to EPR sensitive phenotypes [105]. Thus, the role of EPR is still in question in terms of clinical translation and different human tumor types due to their heterogeneity [105,110]. Among the three major targeted drug delivery methods, namely, passive targeting, active targeting, and physical targeting; passive targeting acts via the EPR effect, by which tumor cells preferentially absorb NPs [111].",

            "text": "Even though D2B exerts outstanding PSMA selectivity in vivo [170], the low Enhanced Permeability and Retention effect (EPR) of the antibody-impregnated radioconjugate ( 223 RaA-silane-PEG-D2B) may impede optimal tumor accumulation [171]. Similarly, association between the EPR effect and the tumor uptake of different nanoparticles was reported in prior preclinical studies with breast, ovarian, pancreatic cancer, and squamous cell carcinoma xenografts [172][173][174]. Thus, special emphasis should be laid on the enhancement of EPR to prolong tumor retention time and delay nanoparticle leakage from the tumor mass [171,172]. In addition, although 223 RaA-silane-PEG-D2B with a diameter of 250 nm [82] is fitted to the pore size of the subcutaneously developing LNCaP C4-2 prostate cancer, it shows continuous change during tumor progression that impacts EPR effect and related tumor accumulation [175][176][177]. To enhance EPR and thus the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticles, the size and shape of the nanoagents along with the chemical properties and charge of the surface coating must be addressed and selected carefully [76][77][78][79]178]. Since the blood perfusion makes a critical contribution to the transport of nanoparticles to tumor sites through the EPR [179], the use of drugs such as angiotensin II for blood flow enhancement in the target area could be a possible solution for the improvement of EPR. Furthermore, adjuvants, inflammatory factors, or antibody photosensitizers seem to be feasible to increase drug transport via altering the EPR effect [180][181][182][183].",

            "text": "Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) Effect: Tumor cells, in a frantic attempt to mitigate the circumstance of limited diffusion, which negatively influences nutrient supply, oxygen supply and waste removal, engage in neoangiogenesis to step up vasculature. In order to avoid the imminent consequences of hypoxia, ischemia and toxicity, this process seems to occur very quickly and as a result, the contributions of the angiogenic regulators are largely excluded. This gives rise to highly disorganized and fenestrated tumor vessels, with discontinued endothelial linings and undesirable permeability to particles of up to 700 nm in diameter [63,64]. This pathologically orchestrated phenomenon is referred to as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [65] (Figure 2). Maeda et al. conceptualized and clearly demonstrated how angiogenic flaws associated with rapid tumor growth promoted site-specific accumulation and retention of nanoparticle-drug conjugates at the tumor site [65,66]. Taking advantage of the pressure gradient and leaky vessels at the tumor site, the nanoparticle-based drug accumulates at the tumor site, extravasates into the tumor microenvironment, and prolongs the release of therapeutic agents within the tumor with a resultant improvement in the treatment outcome. This emerged a land slide achievement in the field of nanomedicine and widened the scope of nanoparticle-based drug delivery via passive targeting such that new nanodrug formulations received approval for the treatment of other disease conditions such as fungal infection, hepatitis A, multiple sclerosis and end stage renal disease [67]. However, in order to maximize the advantages offered by EPR in the passive delivery of drugs, the size and surface properties of the nanocarrier must be controlled to avoid uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) as previously described. The ideal size range to benefit from the EPR effect is between 10 to 200 nm as particles that are too small would be cleared by the kidneys, preventing accumulation into the tumor site, and particles that are too large will not adequately penetrate the tumor vasculature and interstitial space.",

            "text": "Employing nanoparticles for the delivery of cancer drugs is a fertile area of research. Low solubility, high toxicity, multi-drug resistance, poor selectivity, and low bioavailability often restrict the use of drugs in treatment or cause detrimental effects. Apart from cancer drug delivery, they are also used in the targeted delivery of anti-microbial and bactericidal compounds. \n\nDrug targeting conventionally has been based on passive targeting. Uncontrolled multiplication of cancerous cells causes nanometre-range lesions leading to a 'leaky' tumor. This gives rise to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, where either cancer drugs such as doxorubicin and cisplatin, or cytotoxic nanoparticles, accumulate at the 'leak' and cause damage. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect works as the foundation of anticancer nano-medicine and its design by using various drug formulations. Drug delivery based on the EPR effect is an effective strategy for most solid tumors [49]. The vascular mediators including prostaglandins, bradykinin, and nitric oxide play a vital role in facilitating and maintaining EPR effect dynamics. The advanced stage of cancers may induce activated blood coagulation cascades, which cause thrombus formation in tumor vasculature. The drug delivery, as well as the EPR effect, will be enhanced by restoring obstructed tumor blood flow and improving tumor vascular permeability through vascular mediators. Moreover, the efficiency of the EPR effect depends on the pathophysiological conditions of tumors, drug formulations, and other factors such as the tumor microenvironment. In the physiological location, research on magnetite nanoparticles coupled with lipids reveals a low selectivity for the targeted organ/tissue. However, accumulation in tumor tissues would result from passive targeting, which is facilitated by the ERP effect in tumors via fenestrated arteries (Figure 6) [50]. \n\nJ.

Status of the 'EPR effect' and clinical relevance\n\nThe initial success in cancer nanomedicine was fueled by the concept of enhanced permeability and retention (EPR effect) observed in pre-clinical models. 14 EPR has been questioned and discussed critically 15 and this section will only highlight brie\ue104y some latest observations. A leaky vasculature due to neovascularization, wider fenestrated endothelium, poor perfusion and poor lymphatic drainage is thought to be the driver for enhanced extravasation and sequestration of NPs in the tumour architecture. 16,17 EPR has dominated the literature on cancer nanomedicine as the primary reason for the efficacy of NPs. However, blatant misuse of this concept to claim therapeutic superiority has been at the epicenter of the current debate surrounding the efficiency of nanomedicine. 7,18 The main criticism against the EPR effect is that the success of pre-clinical effects could not be translated into clinically signi\ue103cant efficacy. The lack of EPR effect has been attributed to a large inter-and intra-individual heterogeneity in the tumour vasculature which is highly variable at different stages of tumorogenesis and depends on the tumour type. 19 The difference in tumor vascular permeability which is related to poor diffusion and penetration of NPs between a xenogra\ue09d model and a clinical tumor has been claimed as the reason for poor clinical translation",

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is the main mechanism described so far by which nanocarriers are more likely accumulated in solid tumor sites than in normal tissues [53][54][55]. The EPR effect exploits the proliferation of endothelial cells during rapid and defective angiogenesis (i.e., the formation of new blood vessels from existing ones) and the lack of adequate lymphatic drainage. There is a loss of tight junctions and significant gaps between endothelial cells [32] that varies from 100 nm to 2 \u00b5m, depending on the type and stage of a tumor [32,54]. The size of nanocarriers plays the most critical role in EPR-based passive tumor targeting. Only nanocarriers smaller than the gap can extravasate from the vasculature and accumulate in tumor sites [31][32][33]. The accumulated nanocarriers are retained due to the dysfunctional lymphatic drainage in tumors, which allows them to release drugs into the vicinity or inside the tumor cells [33]. In general, a higher retention of nanocarriers allows a higher extravasation and accumulation in the tumor sites, which is a better EPR-based passive tumor targeting. Nanocarriers with sizes between 30-200 nm are proposed as optimal for EPR-based passive tumor targeting [32]. Besides, EPR-based passive tumor targeting is time-dependent and requires a long circulation half-life of nanocarriers.",

The concept of this phenomena and its impact on transport of nano-drugs into cancer tissues was formulated for the first time in 1986 [35]. This theory is based on the fact, that tumor vasculature is characterized by discontinuous epithelium, impaired lymphatic drainage and reduced uptake of the interstitial fluid in contrast to normal blood vessels with firmly sealed endothelium. Subsequent accumulation of macromolecules provides the environment supporting the passive transport of nanotherapeutics to the target site [36]. High heterogeneity of EPR effect cause a significant limitation of this strategy, not only among different patients, but also in the case of the same subject, which whom a varied distribution of pore sizes and consequently, diverse drug delivery might be observed [37]. A precise impact of EPR effect on nanoparticles accumulation in tumor tissues is also difficult to determine, since a variety of nanoparticle properties, including shape, size, zeta potential, presence of homing ligands is involved in this process [38]. Previously, some drug delivery systems using this strategy were introduced to clinical trials. Such agent was SP1049Cpluronic polymeric micelle-based nanoparticles caring doxorubicin tested for advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction treatment and murine leukemia. It was reported that SP1049C decline tumorigenicity and aggressiveness of cancer in vivo and diminishes BCRP (breast cancer resistant protein) overexpression. It also modifies DNA methylation profiles, which results in sensitization of MDR cancer cells to antineoplastic treatment [39,40]. In 2005 and 2008, SP1049C has received an orphan drug designation from FDA for the treatment of esophageal carcinoma and gastrointestinal cancer, respectively. Other nanoformulation, tested in clinical trials, was NK911-micelle encapsulated doxorubicin proposed for the treatment of various solid tumors.",

            "text": "Polymers and supramolecular polymer assemblies such as micelles may take advantage of Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect to accumulate in solid tumor tissue. The EPR effect is a property of most solid tumors and means that the tumor filters off and concentrates in tumor tissue large molecules or supramolecular assemblies as micelles or nanoparticles of tens of thousands to millions kDa mass (Maeda 2001(Maeda , 2012(Maeda , 2013)). The accumulation principle is that the endothelium of blood vessels in normal tissue is impermeable for macromolecules, while the fast grown endothelium of neovasculature in solid tumors is generally permeable for macromolecules up to ca 200 nm in diameter depending on the tumor type and animal species (Torchilin 2007, Maeda et al. 2013). Additionally, solid tumors have poor or even completely missing lymphatic drainage, which further hampers elimination of macromolecules from tumor interstitial space. The EPR effect-based targeting may also be effectively combined with ligand-based targeting with ligands to receptors overexpressed on target. \n\nWhile these targeting principles are well-established for nanocarriers of anticancer chemotherapeutics, they may therefore bring also significant benefits to polymer radiopharmaceutics for cancer applications. Despite advances in drug delivery systems in the past two decades, polymer nuclear medicine applications still remain well underestimated compared to more than 100,000 citations to date for delivery systems for chemical drugs (Figure 1). Therefore, the aim of our research was to transfer experience from polymer carriers of chemical drugs to polymer carriers of radionuclides. In this article, we present the most important advances reached in the radiolaboratory at the IMC.",

However, EPR often provides insufficient impact in providing effective cancer treatment. 92 Interestingly, NIR-PIT uniquely induces a super-enhanced permeability and retention (SUPR) effect by selectively killing the tumor in the perivascular space and causing dilation in the tumor vessels ( Figure 6). 93 Enlargement of the vessel leads to significantly increased nanodrug leakage into the tumor bed and homogeneity of drug spread. Visualized through fluorescence imaging and MRI, recent studies were performed in which targeted quantum dots, nanoparticles, and contrast agents mimicking cancer nanodrugs rapidly accumulated in tumor tissues treated with NIR-PIT. 93,94 Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of NIR-PIT on cancer nanodrug delivery, but the SUPR effect provides a promising opportunity for combination therapy implementing current and candidate nanodrugs.",

            "text": "Passive targeting is heavily dependent on the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect. First coined by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986, the EPR effect is a transport phenomenon defined by the existence of fenestrations in the tumor vascular system. The newly emergent vessels in solid tumor tissues continually hyperplasia with a structurally poor vascular wall and substantial spaces, concomitant with defective lymphatic reflux. This EPR effect promotes the high selectivity, permeability, and retention of nanomedicines, sizes ranging from 10 to 200 nm, allowing for preferential distribution in tumor tissues (Figure 3). The effects, along with reducing toxic side effects, enhance the clinical efficiency of drugs (Wu, 2021). However, research performed by Chan et al. revealed insufficient fenestrations or endothelial spaces in the blood vessel wall to facilitate effective extravasation and nanoparticle accumulation within xenograft tumor models and numerous human tumor specimens. Moreover, prolonged blood circulation failed to transport nanomedicines to the tumor site, with the dense extracellular matrix obstructing the complete nanoparticle penetration into the tumor (Pandit et al., 2020). Consequently, only a few drug molecules can target the tumor site while many were accumulated in organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys, hindering nanoparticle accumulation in tumors and potentially inducing toxic side effects (Golombek et al., 2018). To enhance passive targeting efficacy, Shi et al. advocated for combining pharmacological and physical treatments, utilizing the ultrasound thermal effect and the nanomedicine's nano-effects to re-engineer the tumor microenvironment. The team also outlined the fundamental principles of nanomedicine-based combined treatments and recent clinical advancements in integrating nanomedicine therapy with photodynamics and immunotherapy (Shi et al., 2020).",

            "text": "The EPR Effect. Passive targeting is a drug delivery approach in which drugs are delivered to the targeted site by conjugating with polymer which releases the drug outside the targeted site due to altered environmental conditions (Figure 6(a)). Tumors and many inflamed areas of body have hyperpermeable vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage which passively provides increased retention of macromolecules into tumor and inflamed area of body [27][28][29][30]. This phenomenon is called enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [27]. It constitutes one of the practical carrier-based anticancer drug delivery strategies. EPR effect is primarily utilized for passive targeting due to accumulation of prodrug into tumor or inflamed area. Low molecular drugs covalently coupled with high-molecular-weight carriers are inefficiently eliminated due to hampered lymphatic drainage and therefore accumulate in tumors. While EPR effect enhances the passive targeting ability due to higher accumulation rate of drug in tumor and subsequently due to accumulation, prodrug slowly releases drug molecules which provide high bioavailability and low systemic toxicity [30]. \n\nPassive accumulation of macromolecules such as PEG and other nanoparticles in solid tumors is a phenomenon which was probably overlooked for several years as a potential biological target for tumor-selective drug delivery. Ara-C) was covalently linked to varying molecular weight -OH terminal PEGs through an amino acid spacer in order to improve the in vivo stability and blood residence time (reproduced from [22]). \n\nThe existence of the EPR effect was experimentally confirmed by David et al., for macromolecular anticancer drug delivery systems [31]. Furthermore, passive targeting increases the concentration of the conjugate in the tumor environment and therefore \"passively\" forces the polymeric drug to enter the cells by means of the concentration gradient between the intracellular and extracellular spaces and therefore is not very efficient. The more efficient way to provide targeting is by \"active targeting\" [32].",

            "text": "The hypoxic and acidotic condition in tumor tissue further create a hostile microenvironment which impairs the tumoricidal activities of anticancer drugs and immune cells. Aside from these architectural defects, a lot of inflammatory molecules and cytokines, such as VEGF, HIF-1alpha, nitric oxide, bradykinin and proteases, are involved and orchestrate the campaign of nutrients and oxygen supply for aggressive tumor growth and metastasis [1][2][3]. \n\nMaeda and his graduate student Matsumura found that many proteins show the unique behavior of progressive accumulation in tumor tissues during 19 to 72 h. In contrast, small molecules did not achieve such tumoritropic accumulation. They coined the term of the enhanced permeability and retention effect (the EPR effect) to describe this unique functional phenomenon, and advocated a new concept for macromolecular therapeutics in cancer chemotherapy in 1986 [4]. \n\nSince the concept was introduced to the field of cancer chemotherapy, it became one of the most cited principles for nanomedicine drug development [5]. However, the clinical therapeutic benefits are insufficient, the inadequate of the EPR effect was questioned [6,7]. \n\nHuang and his colleagues did a comprehensive and thorough review on the EPR effect and its related tumor vasculature and microenvironment [8]. They uphold the concept of the EPR effects with extensive evidence from literature. They summarized the factors involving the EPR effect in various tumor models and clinical applications. Several attempts at enhancing the EPR effect for improving the delivery efficacies of nanodrug delivery systems were also discussed. \n\nThe key to improving the perfusion and extravasation of anticancer nanodrugs into tumor tissue is to improve the blood flow into tumor tissues. Vascular normalization is one of the hypotheses trying to address the issue of poor blood perfusion into tumor tissues [9]. It is believed that the drugs and oxygen cannot be pumped into tumor tissue if the tumor vasculature is abnormal, thus, temporarily normalizing the tumor vasculature for facilitating drug delivery to become a rational temptation.",

There are plenty of systems that enhance the accumulation efficacy to tumor via EPR effect (Regehly et al., 2007;Lee et al., 2009). However, this targeting strategy may release a considerable quantity of drugs before substantial uptake by tumor cells.

            "text": "Nanosized drug delivery system can increase chemotherapeutic drug distribution in tumors by passive targeting strategy, which is an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Maeda et al., 2000). Till date, various nanocarriers have been developed to simultaneously improve drug efficacy and reduce side effects through EPR-dependent drug accumulation in tumor (Guo et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2021). Although EPR effect has been confirmed in the murine tumor model, the positive consequences of nanotechnology for clinical application are less clear (Harrington et al., 2001). Even in the murine model, EPR effect did not always positively influence the therapeutic efficacy of micelle drugs (Chen et al., 2018). Because of elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and high-density extracellular matrix of tumor tissue (Heldin et al., 2004), nanoparticles around 50-200 nm suitable for EPR effect are distributed preferentially around the tumor vasculature, instead of the tumor deep tissue (Minchinton and Tannock, 2006;Barua and Mitragotri, 2014). Moreover, an ideal drug delivery system should prolong drug blood circulation by stable encapsulation, until drug release in the tumor cells (Wang et al., 2016;Keller et al., 2020); this is because small drugs leaking from nanocarriers could be cleared rapidly by the kidney. Therefore, a great challenge still exists in optimizing targeted drug delivery system, which should overcome the dilemma between preferential distribution of larger nanoparticles (50-200 nm) in tumor tissue by EPR effect and penetration of very small nanoparticles (15-20 nm) (Perrault et al., 2009;Sykes et al., 2014) into the deep tumor tissue by simultaneous diffusion.",

            "text": "A drug-delivery system may be considered suitable for clinical practice if it is non-toxic, biocompatible, stable in blood, non-immunogenic, non-thrombogenic, and biodegradable [17]. \n\nThe enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is the principle behind the passive targeting used in all containers and carriers. This principle and term were proposed in 1986 [18]. Rapid tumor growth is accompanied by neovascularization with wide fenestrations and the suppression of lymphatic drainage [19]. Traditionally, the EPR concept presumes that small molecules enter via diffusion and leave the interstitial space of the tumor, whereas macromolecules (containers, carriers) are no longer able to do so after extravasation [20]. In addition to the traditional explanation, other theories concerning how the pathophysiological characteristics of tumor growth shape the EPR effect have been put forward [21,22]. Thus, the EPR effect has been accepted as a universal principle incorporated into the design of anticancer drug-delivery systems [23]. However, there are currently serious disputes about the effectiveness of the EPR effect when using nanoparticles [24,25]. At the same time, it is important to note that the current understanding of the EPR effect is based on results obtained in animal models, meaning that the results of EPR-effect studies in patients must be collated if delivery systems that fully exploit the EPR effect are to be successfully designed [26].",

            "text": "Unlike the above active targeting strategies, passive targeting serves as a basis for developing macromolecular anticancer therapy. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect plays a vital role in passive targeting, which mainly relies on the anatomical and pathophysiological characteristics of solid tumors and their microenvironments, such as high vascular density in tumor tissue based on angiogenesis, intermittent tumor vasculature with leaky effects and poor drainage of tumor lymphatic system [119,120]. As shown in Fig. 3A, due to the EPR effect, nanoformulations in circulation can enter tumor tissues through the gaps between endothelial cells in tumor blood vessels [121]. This effect further enhances the preferential accumulation of nanocarriers within tumor tissues and accelerates intracellular delivery including endocytosis, lysosomal fusion, escape, cytoplasmic release, and combining the target organelle (Fig. 3B) [46,119,122]. These properties of tumors provide favorable conditions for designing tumor-targeted antitumor NPs. Drug-carrying NPs can increase the accumulation of chemotherapy drugs in tumor tissues through EPR effect, improve therapeutic effects and reduce toxic and side effects by reducing unnecessary release in normal tissues [123,124]. This unique passive targeting effect of nanomaterials on tumor tissue is highly beneficial for developing multifunctional nanoplatforms for TACE therapy of HCC, as it synergically enhances the safety of the transarterial administration and promotes more efficient drug absorption by the tumor.",

Further investigation of the EPR in various human tumors and the development of better preclinical models is therefore essential for the design of NCs with better tumor penetration and therapeutic outcome 9,10 . Recently, Theek et al. investigated the correlation between tumor vascularization and EPR-based passive targeting in a subcutaneous tumor model 37 . Utilizing both contrast-enhanced functional ultrasound and computed tomography-fluorescence molecular techniques, they demonstrated heterogeneous accumulation of 10-nm near infrared-labeled polymeric NCs (pHPMA-Dy750) within and between the tumors (5%-12%). Similarly, Hansen et al. recently developed copper-64-loaded PEGylated liposomes and evaluated the EPR effect of these liposomes by microPET/CT imaging 38 . Evaluation of 11 dogs bearing spontaneous solid tumors revealed that while the EPR effect is a predominant feature in few solid tumors (e.g., carcinoma), resulting in high liposome accumulation, it could not be generalized to all solid tumors. In a more advanced study, Miller et al. showed that an FDA-approved 30-nm carboxymethyl dextran-coated magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) (ferumoxytol) could be used as a surrogate or companion particle to predict intratumoral transport, pharmacokinetics (PK), and distribution of a therapeutic NC based on poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-bpoly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-PEG) 39 . Recently, Lee et al., utilized 64 Cu-labeled HER2-targeted liposomes and PET/CT to quantify drug accumulation in 19 patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer 40 . The peak liposomes accumulation was observed at 24-48 h and patients were classified based on 64 Cu-liposomal lesion deposition using a cut-point that is comparable to a response threshold that was measured in preclinical studies. Patients with high 64 Cu-liposomal lesion deposition were associated with more favorable treatment outcomes.",

The main mechanism of tumor targeting of anticancer nanomedicines is based on the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, first described by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 [112] as a passive yet powerful targeting strategy. They showed that tumor tissues had defective blood vessels with aberrant branching and large openings between endothelial cells of around 400 nm due to their rapid proliferation and decreased number of pericytes. This unique characteristic helps macromolecules, such as nanocarriers, easily move into tumor tissues after crossing the endothelium barrier. Furthermore, solid tumors have a poor lymphatic drainage system, leading to extended retention times of nanocarriers in the tumor extracellular matrix. \n\nAlthough the EPR effect has allowed the successful development of some anticancer nanomedicines with a passive tumor-targeting mechanism [99], many well-designed drug delivery systems fail when tested in patients. Over the last years, the role of the EPR effect has been investigated, focusing on the influence of the TME, heterogeneity of human tumors, and differences between animal models and actual patients [104,113,114]. These factors may contribute to the observed limited penetration of nanomedicines in human tumors, highlighting the need for further refinement of passive targeting strategies.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles have become a powerful tool in the clinical field, not only by their capacity to deliver drugs to diseased tissues in a controlled and selective manner [1], but also by their ability to simultaneously provide information about the stage of the disease progression [2]. Nanosystems endowed with these dual functions, drug delivery, and diagnosis, received the name of theranostic nanocarriers. Among the different clinical applications of these smart nanocarriers, antitumoral therapy have received the highest attention [3]. The origin of this interest began in 1986, when Maeda and Matsumura reported the passive tendency of intravenously injected nanometric agents to be accumulated within solid tumors [4]. The accelerated growth of solid tumors demands the rapid construction of tumoral blood vessels in order to provide the required nutrients to sustain them. These vessels are built in an uncontrollable manner presenting wide interendothelial junctions which create pores with diameters with up to a few hundreds of nanometers [5]. Thus, when nanoparticles that were injected in the blood stream reach the tumoral tissue, they can pass through these fenestrations being selectively accumulated there. Moreover, solid tumors usually present inefficient drainage system. This is a consequence of the compression of lymphatic vessels due the expansion of tumoral tissue, which enhances the retention time of the nanoparticles within the diseased tissue. The combination of these two characteristics, high permeability of tumoral blood vessels and inefficient drainage, constitutes to the gold standard of the use of nanoparticles in oncology and receives the name of enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect [6]. The discovery of EPR effect triggered the race to design nanocarriers capable to selectively deliver chemotherapeutic agents to tumoral tissue reducing the systemic toxicity caused by these drugs in healthy tissues. Thus, a vast number of different nanoparticles composed of both organic materials as polymers [7], lipids [8], and dendrimers [9] as well as by inorganic ones such as metals [10], ceramics [11], and carbon allotropes [12], among others have been reported exhibiting excellent drug delivery capacities.",

Anticancer agents are easily distributed in the patient's body and indiscriminately reach not only tumors, but also normal organs and tissues. Therefore, the development of a suitable tumor-selective drug delivery system is needed to avoid the undesirable systemic side effects of anticancer agents. The most effective strategy is to exploit the anatomical and pathophysiological abnormalities of tumor tissue, particularly the tumor vasculature. 1) ][4] This characteristic is generally known as the \"enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)\" effect [5][6][7] (Fig. 1). \n\nTumor localization of nanocarriers after systemic administration is thought to involve three processes (Fig. 1A): distribution through the vascular compartment in solid tumors, transport across the angiogenic vascular wall (extravasation from tumor blood circulation), and diffusion within the tumor interstitium. Various nanocarriers for anticancer agents that benefit from the EPR effect have been developed as drug delivery carriers. However, in spite of some benefits in anticancer drug delivery, nanocarriers (of any design) have not always shown sufficient delivery of associated agents to tumors, and have resulted in insufficient therapeutic effects. The tumor microenvironment, for example, spatial heterogeneity of vascular permeability and/or hypovascularity, appears to become a barrier to extravasation of nanocarriers from tumor vasculature and their diffusion in the interstitium of solid tumors (Fig. 1B). In this article, we describe and discuss some trials that attempt to manipulate the barriers in the tumor microenvironment that hinder extravasation through the tumor vasculature and penetration of nanocarriers in solid tumors.",

            "text": "This also contrasts with the phenomenon known as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR), which is mainly dictated by particle size and assumes that tumor vasculature is inherently leaky. Through accumulation in the tumor vasculature, EPR holds that certain cancer-targeting macromolecules over 40 kDa can deliver such therapeutics to the solid tumor [101]. EPR is dependent on the size and design of the macromolecule therapeutic, position of the vasculature within the tumor as well as its leakiness and the tumor location [102]. The main limitation of EPR is that while tumors grow, the vascular density and the transport between cells is decreased, and therefore, the EPR effect is decreased due to the decreased tumor vasculature accumulation, thus reducing passive delivery of therapeutics [103].",

            "text": "This targeted approach holds promise for improving therapeutic outcomes [65][66][67].In malignancies such as cancer, rapid angiogenesis leads to an abnormal vascular structure characterized by twisted, dilated, and permeable blood vessels, resulting in the phenomenon known as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) [68].This effect contributes significantly to the efficacy of drug delivery to tumors, especially in nanoparticle-based treatments.It allows drugs to accumulate in tumor tissue, leading to better therapeutic outcomes.By harnessing the EPR effect, researchers can develop targeted nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems that selectively concentrate drugs in tumors, reduce systemic toxicity, and maximize anti-tumor activity [68][69][70].Regulation of the EPR effect is primarily influenced by several factors, including drug surface properties, size and shape, targeting mechanisms, and circulation time.These factors have a direct or indirect effect on the distribution and fate of drugs in tumors.However, some limitations must be considered when using the EPR effect for drug delivery, such as differences in the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity between different tumor types, models, and patients [70,71].The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in the development and optimization of nanoparticles and their carriers.By incorporating scaffolds into nanoparticle design, researchers can create systems that produce synergistic anti-cancer effects by releasing multiple agents from a single carrier while addressing the challenges associated with the release of hydrophobic agents [72][73][74].\n\nIn addition, advances in nanotechnology have led to the development of nano-drug carriers such as nanoparticles that have the potential to reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment of tumors.Studies have shown that these carriers can increase the efficacy of immunotherapy by improving the transport and targeting of therapeutic agents to cancer cells while minimizing systemic toxicity.By leveraging the unique properties of nanomaterials, nano drug carrier systems offer a promising approach to overcoming the challenges associated with conventional chemotherapy and improving anti-tumor response [75].",

            "text": "Over a period of decade, many types of cancers are being treated by conventional chemotherapy using small molecules. Lack of tumour selectivity results in developing severe adverse side effects; consequently drug doses need to be used in less volumes. Drug efficacy also remains suboptimal [81]. To improve the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of hydrophobic drugs, development of site specific tumour targeted chemotherapy is the most effective approach for treating different types of cancers most successfully with ease. Tumour specific targeting at vascular and tissue level can be achieved by the breakthrough discovery of enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of solid tumours. Pathophysiological and anatomical features of tumor vessels are attributed to the rate and extent of EPR effect in most solid tumours. As a result, many researchers across the globe have been employing the concept of tumor targeting drug delivery following the concept of EPR effect to develop efficient and effective anticancer drugs [82]. \n\nTissues undergoing some pathological conditions result in diseases such as cancer or inflammation exhibits the characteristic abnormal vasculature, which enhances the permeability, retention, and extravasation of macromolecular drugs. Activation of vascular permeability factors as well as deregulated angiogenesis contributes to EPR effect of solid tumours. Important characteristic features of abnormal vasculature include formation of large fenestrations (300 nm to 4,700 nm in size) between the endothelial cells because of its discontinuous features. Activation of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic molecules and imbalance in their expression lead to the formation of large fenestration [83]. Abnormal porous vasculature, compression of the lymphatic vessels as a result of increase in number of cancer cells, and dysfunctional lymphangiogenesis, which causes lymphatic drainage impairment in tumor tissues, are also among other factors. \n\nInterstitial fluid of tumours, which constitutes any constructs or macromolecules including encapsulated drugs or antibodies, is retained for longer period than in normal tissues [84][85][86][87] (Figure 2).",

The clinical treatment of cancer has utilized more than 20 nanotechnology-based therapeutic products [26]. With progression in the field of nanomaterials and nanotechnology, researchers have worked intensively to build multi-functional nanocarriers that can meticulously transport therapeutic agents to tumor sites [27][28][29]. Nanoparticles are being extensively used as diminutive drug delivery vehicles to amplify the advantages of a co-delivery system. In general, the possible co-delivery approaches using different types of nanocarriers have proved to be efficient in repressing MDR, improving efficacy and drug targeting, achieving a synergistic therapeutic effect, and reducing systemic toxicity and the adverse effects of chemotherapeutic agents [23,25,28,30]. \n\nNanocarriers possess unique characteristics, such as a nanometric size, a high surface area to volume ratio, advantageous drug release patterns, and targeting qualities that can help them accumulate preferentially in tumor tissues [15]. Most importantly, nanomaterials can significantly increase the accumulation of their load at tumor locations by utilizing the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) [4,30]. EPR is a phenomenon that is hypothesized to be caused by leaky tumor vasculature and poor lymphatic outflow. EPR is crucial in the realm of nanotechnology, specifically the passive targeting of nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment, and it has been explored extensively by Galiardi et al. [13,25,27]. The development of more effective nanoparticles to deliver desired multiple payloads concurrently is a major challenge. Multiple biological parameters, such as interaction with plasma proteins, blood circulation time, extravasation, tumor tissue penetration, and cancer cell uptake, might alter the biodistribution of systemically administered nanoparticles [24]. Surface modification of nano-systems that bestow unique targeting capabilities or stimuli-sensitive responses impact the nanoparticles' overall in vivo behavior [30,31].",

This concept has been recently scrutinized due to disappointing therapeutic efficacy and limited clinical success with anti-cancer nanomedicines compared with excellent results in small animal xenograft models (Anchordoquy et al. 2017;Bjornholm et al. 2017;Moghimi and Farhangrazi 2014;Nel et al. 2017;Park 2013). The complexities and heterogeneity associated with the EPR effect have now been confirmed in high-resolution imaging studies in dogs with primary tumors, but these attempts have yet to resolve nanomedicine transport pathways into tumors as well as their variability within the same tumor mass (Hansen et al. 2015). Two transport pathways for translocation of nanoparticles from the blood circulation into the solid tumors (interendothelial and transendothelial pathways) have been proposed (Bjornholm et al. 2017;Chauhan et al. 2012;Cabral et al. 2011;Dvorak and Feng 2001;Fang and Nakamura 2011;Gerlowski and Jain 1986;Hobbs et al. 1998;Liu et al. 2017;Matsumura and Maeda 1986;Taurin et al. 2012;Yuan et al. 1995). The interendothelial pathway considers nanomedicine extravasation from the blood into tumor interstitium through the pores or open fenestrations in the tumor blood vessels, whereas the latter relies on transcytosis by tumor endothelial cells. What are the evidence supporting these pathways?",

The EPR effect plays a crucial role in nanoparticle-based drug delivery for cancer treatment.

            "text": "The mechanism of improved efficacy for liposomal formulations is often attributed to passive targeting that results in the accumulation of liposomes in tumors due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [19][20][21][22].The EPR effect is thought to allow nanoparticles within blood vessels to extravasate into tumor tissue because the tumor vasculature is immature and leaky, and the associated lack of a lymphatic system does not allow fluids with liposomes to leave the site [23][24][25][26][27].However, the role of the EPR effect in improving drug efficacy is controversial [28,29].Investigators have reported that the EPR effect is heterogeneous and likely not relevant in all tumors [30,31].This may be particularly relevant for metastatic disease, where inter-lesion heterogeneity in drug delivery may limit the benefit of any EPR effect seen in solid tumor preclinical models [32,33] as well as in the treatment of primary tumors in the clinic [34].While some investigators are trying to augment or enhance the EPR effect [33] to overcome the challenges of heterogeneous retention, others have reported that the accumulation of liposomal formulations in tumor tissues may be more likely due to active processes such as transcytosis [35,36], therefore strategically coopting cellular uptake mechanisms through drug design, may be more fruitful in achieving better therapeutic effects.Relevant to our findings, it has also been shown that improved efficacy with liposomal formulations may not be dependent on tumor-specific accumulation at all, but may instead be due to the prolonged circulation lifetime of liposomes and the slow release of active drug cargo over time [37][38][39].An effect we have previously demonstrated for liposomal camptothecins in colorectal cancer models [40].\n\nThe objective of the experiments conducted in this study was to lay the groundwork for investigating the potential of designing liposomes to address challenges of heterogeneous TMEs.",

Together, these beneficial features have resulted in the regulatory approval of about a dozen nanomedicines for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. In recent years, significant progress has been made in combining nanomedicines with imaging, to better understand key aspects of the tumor-targeted drug delivery process, and to address the high inter- and intra-individual heterogeneity in the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect. Strategies explored in this regard have included the use of traditional imaging techniques, companion diagnostics and nanotheranostics. Preclinically, integrating imaging in nanomedicine and drug delivery research has enabled the non-invasive and quantitative assessment of nanocarrier biodistribution, target site accumulation and (triggered) drug release. Clinically, imaging has been emerging as a promising tool for patient stratification, which is urgently needed to improve the translation of cancer nanomedicines. We here summarize recent progress in imaging-assisted anticancer nanotherapy and we discuss future strategies to improve the performance of cancer nanomedicines in patients.",

            "text": "Growth of malignant cells in solid tumors induces changes to the tumor microenvironment (TME). These changes result in promotion of tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis, but also in tumor resistance to drugs and radiotherapy. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in neo-angiogenic tumor tissue enables the transport of therapeutic molecules from the circulation into the tumor, but studies show that further diffusion of these agents is often not sufficient for efficient tumor eradication. Despite the hyperpermeable vasculature facilitating the delivery of drugs and tracers, the high density of stromal cells and matrix proteins, in combination with the elevated interstitial fluid pressure in the microenvironment of solid tumors, presents a barrier which limits the delivery of compounds to the core of the tumor. Reversing the cancer-cell-induced changes to the microenvironment as well as novel nanoparticle strategies to circumvent tumor-induced stromal changes have therefore been suggested as potential methods to improve the delivery of therapeutic molecules and drug efficacy. Strategies to modulate the TME, i.e., normalization of tumor vasculature and depletion of excessive stromal proteins and cells, show promising results in enhancing delivery of therapeutic compounds. Modulation of the TME may therefore enhance the efficacy of current cancer treatments and facilitate the development of novel treatment methods as an alternative for invasive resection procedures.",

            "text": "The microvascular endothelial gap is dense and the structure of endothelial cells is complete in normal tissue, whereas in solid tumor tissues, the neovascular endothelial pores are between 380 nm and 780 nm, and the structural integrity of endothelial cells is poor. Therefore molecules or particles of certain sizes tend to gather in tumor tissues more than in normal tissue, 63 as shown in Fig. 2A. This phenomenon is called the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is considered to be the mechanism of completing passive targeted therapy of tumor tissues. 64 In preclinical trials, drugs or gene delivery-targeted systems based on EPR have shown signi\ue103cant progress in anticancer efficacy compared with traditional chemotherapy. 65 A variety of nanomaterials based on the EPR effect have been applied in the past few years, where the sizes of the nanobubbles at the nanoscale can be transformed on account of the sizes of the pores in tumor vessels. Given that different gap sizes exist in endothelial cells for different categories of tumors, a suitable size nanomaterial must be established based on the category of the tumor. Also, the obstruction generated by biological barriers when nanoparticles reach the blood circulation system requires high attention. 66 Thus, considering these challenges, to better take advantage of the EPR effect in nanomaterial delivery, various means of treatment have been designed. EPR-based nanoparticle-targeting strategies are primarily committed to adjusting the size of drugs or vectors and/or utilizing ligands that link molecules involving the EPR effect. 67",

            "text": "The latter feature allows attachment to the system ligands for targeting tissues or cells [9]. Drug loading methods include the generation of hydrolytic or acid-sensitive linkage, complexation, and ion pair or permanent bond formation, ensuring the release/action of the drug in the target place [10]. One of the advantages of nanoscale drug carriers is their ability to uptake into tumor sites via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The abovementioned effect, discovered by Maeda et al., is based on a universal pathophysiological mechanism in which macromolecular compounds (above 40 kDa) such as polymeric drug carriers might be accumulated in the tumor area. This in turn leads to achieving targeted delivery and retention of the anticancer agent into tumor tissue. It should be emphasized, that EPR strongly depends on factors associated with the tumor location and vascularization degree as well as the physicochemical properties of the carrier and anticancer agent. In clinical practice, using the EPR effect is the main idea in the passive targeting of solid tumors in cancer nanotherapy [11,12]. \n\nIt was proved that drug delivery technologies can enhance the health of patients. This is due to minimizing off-target drug accumulation, improving the delivery of a drug to the target site, and facilitating patient compliance [13,14]. Furthermore, the controlled release of the active substance through the use of nanoformulation may be helpful for creating a reduction in adverse events. This can result in fewer medical procedures, lead to lower staff costs, and provide a greater chance of remission [15]. \n\nIt was established that a plethora of tumors overexpressed folate receptors (FR) on their surface [16]. Therefore, FR-targeting has become the basis of many therapeutic, diagnostic, and imaging methods in the treatment of cancer to enhance cancer cells' uptake of drug-loaded vehicles. Known strategies of active targeting rely on folic-acid-modified anticancer drugs, antibodies, or antibody-drug conjugates, as well as drug delivery nanoplatforms.",

            "text": "Cancer has emerged as one of the main causes of death in the world and poses a serious threat to human health. Although conventional therapies, including surgery and radiation, remain as the standard treatment for cancer, the limitations of these treatment options are becoming increasingly apparent [1]. Surgery is an effective treatment method for tumors, but postoperative metastasis and recurrence renders tumor treatment more difficult. The therapeutic effect of radiotherapy is limited by the hypoxic and necrotic region of the tumor. On the other hand, many promising therapeutic methods such as drug therapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy are developing rapidly. All of these treatments rely on therapeutic agent such as chemotherapeutic agents, photosensitizers, and immunoadjuvants to reach the tumor region and kill tumor cells through cytotoxicity or immune activation. However, the acidic, hypoxic and hypo-vascular tumor microenvironment affects the delivery of various therapeutic agents, resulting in treatment resistance of tumor cells. Systemic injection of therapeutic agents cannot specifically act on tumor cells and may cause toxic effects on normal tissues. Therefore, many studies focus to improve the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents in order to enhance the tumor therapeutic effect and reduce toxic effects. \n\nIn the past decade, the rapid development of nanomaterials has become a powerful thrust for the advancement of tumor treatment. Nanomaterials such as liposomes, metal particles, polymers and micelles are widely used as targeted delivery carriers of therapeutic agents and play important roles in the treatment of tumors. Tumors are more permeable to nanoparticles (NPs) than normal tissue due to the sifted vascular structure [2]. NPs can enter and remain in tumor tissue through leaky tumor blood vessels to exert therapeutic roles. This phenomenon is called the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is the basic mechanism by which NPs deliver drugs to solid tumors [3]. Various nanomaterial-based treatments, including chemotherapy, photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and immunotherapy, have been proven to have good tumoral inhibitory effects in preclinical studies.",

            "text": "Hence, diffusion can sometimes be considered an obstacle to yielding novel, effective therapies for solid tumors. Furthermore, if the interstitial fluid pressure stops as a function of tumor solid stress [60], or fluid flow in small vessels is reduced [61], EPR-mediated drug delivery could fail. Thus, the changes in fluid velocity in different parts of solid tumors based on their heterogeneous development and progression can be considered a very important indicator of the efficacy of EPR-mediated drug delivery in solid tumors. As the role of interstitial fluid pressure [59] and tumor solid stress [62] in modulating fluid velocity is very important, it is expected that the intratumoral transport of nanocarriers and the EPR effect in the peritumoral areas will be greater than that of the core of solid tumors. In addition, the change in the direction of fluid flow in solid tumors [63,64] due to the irregular structure of vessels can result in the mitigation of convection/diffusion-enhanced delivery of drugs for the treatment of solid tumors. By reversing the flow, the viscosity of the fluid in solid tumors is expected to be increased several times that of normal tissue due to an increase in hematocrit [65]. Therefore, this phenomenon can effectively manipulate convection and diffusion events in interstitial transport in solid tumors mediated by EPR. \n\nTumor vessel development and maturation can also lead to the formation of an integrated structure of endothelial cells and the presence of pericytes, which changes the mechanism of intratumoral transport of drug nanocarriers due to an alteration in the ratios of convection/diffusion status [58,64]. Although reducing the number and size of vascular wall pores moderates the passive transport of drug nanocarriers into the interstitial space, computational models predict that even without vessel pores/gaps due to decreased interstitial fluid retention and reduced leakage into vessel lumen with higher uptake through intercellular and linked vesicles effectively increases the tumor delivery of macromolecular drugs based on the EPR effect (Figure 2) [64].",

This step determines NP localization and retention in the tumor region. NPs are believed to mostly possess the EPR effect of solid tumor vasculature. Thus, any strategy to enhance tumor permeability should be promising. However, given that only a mean of 0.7% of the injected dose (%ID) of NPs is delivered to cancer cells, the major role of EPR in NP uptake is questionable. A study on a subset of gold nanoparticles using computational modeling and simulation of physiologically based pharmacokinetics indicated that the low delivery efficiency largely stems from the low distribution and permeability coefficients at the tumor site [5].",

            "text": "The discovery of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in solid tumors has led to the development of a wide range of nanomedicines, including liposomes, for cancer therapy [1]. The EPR effect describes the preferential accumulation of nanoparticles at tumor sites due to leaky vasculature (i.e. enhanced permeation) and impaired lymphatic drainage (i.e. enhanced retention), in comparison to normal tissue. Nano-sized delivery systems have been shown to result in significant increases in tumor accumulation of drugs in comparison to that achieved following administration of free drug [2]. Yet, despite demonstrating substantial accumulation of drug in many pre-clinical and human tumors [2][3][4], clinically approved liposome formulations, such as DoxilH/CaelyxH (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) and MyocetH (unpegylated liposomal doxorubicin), have only resulted in a modest increase in anti-tumor efficacy relative to the standard of care [5][6][7][8][9]. Major limitations of liposome-based drug delivery are: \n\n(1) variability in the EPR effect and therefore, total tumor accumulation [4]; (2) limited tumor penetration [10]; and (3) slow or limited release of hydrophilic/amphiphilic drugs [11,12]. While it is clear that the poor performance has been linked to a number of factors, one of the most significant is the inability to achieve consistent inter-subject and intra-tumoral accumulation of liposomes [4,10,13,14]. \n\nHeterogeneity in liposome accumulation implies the presence of inter-subject and intra-tumoral variations in the EPR effect.",

            "text": "Current anticancer treatments mainly rely on chemotherapy, radiotherapy and/or surgery [102][103][104]. Those treatments, yet effective in many cases, present several drawbacks. In particular, chemotherapy lacks great tumor tissue selectivity, leading to non-specific drug distribution and side effects. In this sense, nanoparticles have emerged as a powerful tool to encapsulate drugs and reduce side effects [105][106][107]. \n\nThe rationale behind the use of nanoparticles in cancer treatment relies on the Enhanced Permeability and Retention effect (EPR effect), which is the basis of some commercialized nanomedicines [108]. The EPR effect, first reported by Maeda and coworkers [109], promotes the passive accumulation of nanoparticles in solid tumors as a result of the hypervasculature, the enhanced permeability and the poor lymphatic drainage found in many tumors (Figure 3). Reproduced from [110] with permission of MDPI, 2015. \n\nOwing to the uncontrolled angiogenesis, the newly formed vessels present an abnormal architecture, including wide fenestrations  nm endothelial cell-cell gaps), irregular vascular alignment or lack of smooth muscle layer, among others. As a result, molecules larger than 40 kDa leak out from them and accumulate in the extravascular tumoral tissues. On the contrary, healthy tissues do not show this abnormal development and no accumulation is observed, thus creating a differential selectivity for cancer tissues [111]. In addition, unlike normal tissues where the extracellular fluid is constantly removed, tumors present defective lymphatic drainage and the accumulated macromolecules tend to remain in the tumoral mass for longer periods of time [112]. \n\nThe magnitude of the EPR effect in humans highly depends on the particularities of the patient and the tumor [113] although some alternative strategies, such as tumor-homing peptides or some types of cells, are currently being explored to overcome the lack of EPR effect. \n\nThese alternative approximations have successfully been evaluated using in vivo tumor models, demonstrating the suitability of using MSNs for tumor drug delivery.",

Tumors have blood arteries that are prone to leakage, allowing nanoparticles to exit the bloodstream and accumulate in the space between cells in the tumor [129]. This enables the direct delivery of therapeutic substances to the tumor site [130]. Nevertheless, relying solely on the EPR effect may not be adequate for achieving optimal drug administration because of the diverse composition of tumor blood vessels and the elevated interstitial pressure within tumors. To address these constraints, the EPR effect is frequently integrated with other targeting approaches.",

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect has underlain the predominant nanomedicine design philosophy for the past three decades. However, growing evidence suggests that it is over-represented in preclinical models, and agents designed solely using its principle of passive accumulation can only be applied to a narrow subset of clinical tumors. For this reason, strategies that can improve upon the EPR effect to facilitate nanomedicine delivery to otherwise non-responsive tumors are required for broad clinical translation. EPR-adaptive nanomedicine delivery comprises a class of chemical and physical techniques that modify tumor accessibility in an effort to increase agent delivery and therapeutic effect. In the present review, we overview the primary benefits and limitations of radiation, ultrasound, hyperthermia, and photodynamic therapy as physical strategies for EPR-adaptive delivery to EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes, and we reflect upon changes in the preclinical research pathway that should be implemented in order to optimally validate and develop these delivery strategies.",

            "text": "Tumor vasculature is structurally unique and different from normal vasculature. Tumor tissue also shows highly up-regulated production of vascular effectors. As a consequence extravasation of macromolecules into the interstitial space would occur. The effectors affecting vascular permeability factors includes (brady)kinin, NO, prostaglandins, VEGF (or vascular permeability factor), and CO (by HO-1) in or near the most solid tumors. This enhanced vascular permeability also commonly occurs in inflamed tissue at the sites of infection that is affected by many similar vascular mediators. \n\nOnce macromolecules extravasate from the circulation or blood vessels into the tumor interstitium, they remain in the tumor for a long time without being cleared. This situation is in great contrast to normal tissue, in which macromolecules are cleared via the lymphatic system. Thus, prolonged retention of macromolecules-for more than days to weeks-is a unique characteristic of the EPR effect in tumor tissue.  The EPR effect is applicable to biocompatible macromolecules with MW > 40 KDa. \n\nHowever, the EPR effect occurs frequently heterogeneously, which means that tumor selective macromolecular drug delivery based on the EPR effect may not procede homogeneously. Consequently, drug delivery may be less efficient to metastatic liver cancers and to less vascularized cancers, e.g., cancers of the pancreas and prostate, rendering poor EPR effect. Therefore better therapeutic outcomes for such cancers depends on further augmentation of drug delivery to such tumors. We thus developed measures to enhance the EPR effect. One method involves raising the systemic blood pressure, e.g., from 100 to 160 mmHg by using angiotensin II during arterial infusion of a macromolecular drug, e.g., SMANCS/Lipiodol. This method produced excellent clinical results even in advanced and difficult-to-treat tumors such as metastatic liver cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and cancers of the pancreas, and others. 88) other method is utilization of NO-releasing agents such as NG for advanced and poor-EPR tumors.",

Tumor blood vessels are characterized by leaky vasculature, decreased lymphatic drainage. An effect indicating passive retention was identified by Maeda et al., which is called the 'Enhanced Permeation and Retention (EPR) effect'. 1] Accrediting their low molecular weight and nonspecific diffusion, free anticancer drugs tend to easily pass between the intercellular spaces. As a result, they remain in the bloodstream for a shorter time and the probability of reaching the drug to the tumor site decreases. Drugs anchored with nanocarriers bring larger sizes against intracellular spaces, they sustain in the circulation for a longer time. As the blood vessels surrounding tumor tissues are defective and porous, nanocarrier containing anti-cancer drugs can permeate through blood vessels towards tumorous tissues, wherein they accumulate and show the desired pharmacological effect. Thus, nanomedicines, on account of the EPR effect, extravasate into the tumor environment. 22 The EPR differs with types of tumor, their progression and location. Besides, the properties of the nanocarriers used, too affect the extravasation of nanomedicines.",

            "text": "The cancer nanotherapeutics-based approach offers various advantages over conventional chemotherapy such as improved drug stability and solubility, prolonged half-lives of drugs in blood plasma, specific targeting of tumors with improved absorption, enhanced concentration of drugs at target site, ability to encapsulate a range of drugs, therapeutic payloads into the blood stream via targeted drug delivery with minimum systemic toxicities [71]. This nanotherapeutics-based approach for cancer therapy would improve the current cancer treatment potential, along with the management of drug resistance induced by CSCs. Nanoparticles-based platforms allow both the passive and active targeting of tumors. Solid tumors are generally hypervascular due to the upregulation of proangiogenic signaling pathways. However, the newly formed vessels indicate an abnormal architecture with the hyperpermeability tumor cells. The tumor mass also demonstrates poor lymphatic drainage, which allows the accumulation of macromolecules of a size of >40 kDa within the tumor microenvironment [72,73]. Thus, defective tumor vessels and impaired lymphatics in the tumor tissue allow the preferential accumulation of nanoparticles (NPs) in tumor vasculature and interstitial space by enhancing the permeability of the abnormal tumor microvasculature while suppressing the lymphatic drainage. The EPR effect is a fundamental prerequisite for nanoparticles-based targeted delivery to tumors. In order to benefit from the EPR effect, the optimal particle size should be in the range of 10 to 200 nm. If particles are too small, they will be cleared through the kidney and will not accumulate into the tumor site. In contrast, particles that are too large would not be able to penetrate tumor vasculature and interstitial space [74]. There is a substantial variation in EPR between patients and tumor types and sometimes even within the same patients or tumor type with time. Various researchers have demonstrated the stratification of cancer patients' subpopulations based on the nanoparticle's accumulation though EPR during preliminary clinical studies [75,76]. These reports indicate that EPR is a predictive marker and may have vital role cancer nanotherapies-related clinical success.",

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) is a phenomenon involving solid tumors where their porous vasculature and secretion of elevated levels of vascular permeability factors create an environment that promotes tumor growth (i.e. necessary levels of oxygen and nutrients) [60]. Since the onset of this discovery, cancer therapies have exploited the distinct tumor microenvironment to deliver therapeutics to cancer tissue [61]. Within the context of brain tumors, passive targeting is especially significant as glioma vasculature is considerably hypervascularized, leaky, and deficient of a proper lymphatic drainage system. This creates an ideal environment for the uptake and retention of nanoparticles in tumor tissues, while sparing healthy brain cells [62]. It has been shown that passive targeting can be enhanced by localizing supermagnetic nanoparticles within glioma through an externally applied magnetic field [63]. In one study using this approach, magnetic paclitaxel nanoparticles significantly increased the survival of glioma-bearing rats when compared with free paclitaxel [64]. Regardless, the efficacy of EPR-based nanoparticle delivery for glioma therapy is still under question because of glioma's pathophysiological heterogeneity. It has been well reported that the core of gliomas consists of hypovascularized or necrotic tissue. Therefore, these central areas of the tumor do not exhibit an active EPR effect [65]. Moreover, it is thought that the existence of a \"hypoxic niche\" supports the small subpopulation of tumor stem cells that are responsible for glioma growth, progression, and disease recurrence [66,67]. The access of nanoparticles to the hypoxic core may therefore be crucial for therapeutic impact.",

However, most accumulation, retention, and drug transfer kinetics in solid tumors have been investigated in animal models without accessing human data. Therefore, despite various reports on the therapeutic advantages of drug nanocarriers for the treatment of tumors (Table 1), significant advances have still not been observed in clinical trials. Of course, the use of other treatment modalities, such as photothermal therapy [71], photodynamic therapy [72], magnetic field therapy [73], sonodynamic therapy [74], has been able to boost the efficacy of drug nanocarriers in tumor therapy. However, the heterogeneity of solid tumors and the effect on EPR-mediated passive drug targeting result in a non-uniform distribution of the drug in solid tumors [75], which increases the likelihood of local cancer recurrence.",

Despite the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which amplifies the accumulation of nanoparticles at the site of a tumor, tumor heterogeneity caused by the dense extracellular matrix of growing cancer cells and the interstitial fluid pressure from abnormal angiogenesis in the tumor inhibit drug/particle penetration, leading to inhomogeneous and limited treatments. Therefore, nanoparticles for penetrated delivery should be designed with different strategies to enhance efficacy. Many strategies were developed to overcome the obstacles in cancer therapy, and they can be divided into three main parts: size changeability, ligand functionalization, and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. This review summarizes the results of ameliorated tumor penetration approaches and amplified therapeutic efficacy in nanomedicines. As the references reveal, further study needs to be conducted with comprehensive strategies with broad applicability and potential translational development.",

            "text": "The discovery of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect has resulted in the development of nanomedicines, including liposome-based formulations of drugs, as cancer therapies. The use of liposomes has resulted in substantial increases in accumulation of drugs in solid tumors; yet, significant improvements in therapeutic efficacy have yet to be achieved. Imaging of the tumor accumulation of liposomes has revealed that this poor or variable performance is in part due to heterogeneous inter-subject and intra-tumoral liposome accumulation, which occurs as a result of an abnormal transport microenvironment. A mathematical model that relates liposome accumulation to the underlying transport properties in solid tumors could provide insight into inter and intra-tumoral variations in the EPR effect. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework to describe liposome transport in solid tumors. The mathematical model is based on biophysical transport equations that describe pressure driven fluid flow across blood vessels and through the tumor interstitium. The model was validated by direct comparison with computed tomography measurements of tumor accumulation of liposomes in three preclinical tumor models. The mathematical model was fit to liposome accumulation curves producing predictions of transport parameters that reflect the tumor microenvironment. Notably, all fits had a high coefficient of determination and predictions of interstitial fluid pressure agreed with previously published independent measurements made in the same tumor type. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the model attributed inter-subject heterogeneity in liposome accumulation to variations in peak interstitial fluid pressure. These findings highlight the relationship between transvascular and interstitial flow dynamics and variations in the EPR effect. In conclusion, we have presented a theoretical framework that predicts inter-subject and intra-tumoral variations in the EPR effect based on fundamental properties of the tumor microenvironment and forms the basis for transport modeling of liposome drug delivery.",

            "text": "Surface properties play a critical role in determining the internalization process of the drug particles into the target cell. To avoid opsonization and subsequent clearance by the RES, surface modification of polymers using PEG can be effective to a certain extent. Thus, the EPR-based drug delivery can be modulated by modifying the size, shape and sometimes by surface alteration of the nanoparticles. \n\nCurrently, a number of passively targeted nanoparticles are in clinical use including, Abraxene, Doxil, Marqibo, Myocet, and DuanoXome. Many other nanoparticles have shown promising therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials. \n\nMajor drawbacks of passive targeting include the inability to distinguish between healthy and diseased tissues, inadequate tumor accumulation, intra-and inter tumoral as well as inter-individual tumor heterogeneity. Different vascular and TME parameters contribute to the heterogeneity in EPR-mediated nanoparticle accumulation. These include vascular permeability, endothelial cell receptor expression, and vascular maturation at the vessel level. Several stromal parameters, including extracellular matrix (ECM), tumor cell density, hypoxia, and interstitial fluid pressure, contribute to heterogeneity in EPR-based tumor targeting responses. All of these pathophysiological parameters are factors necessary to be taken into consideration for the development of personalized and improved nanodrug treatments using the EPR effect. The extent of tumor accumulation always varies between tumor types, and in patients, making it necessary to determine the EPR effect. Thus, the application of direct and indirect imaging and other technologies is necessary to evaluate the degree of the EPR-effect. The presence of an EPR and non-EPR tumor in the EPR and non-EPR patients may help improve the EPR-based drug delivery systems for success in the clinic. \n\nDense cancer stroma is a critical component of the TME, where it has crucial roles in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. Most anticancer therapies target cancer cells specifically. However, tumor stromal factors can promote resistance of cancer cells to such therapies, ultimately resulting in deadly diseases such as PDAC (pancreatic ductal carcinoma).",

            "text": "One of nanomedicine's primary contributions to cancer research is its illustration of the power of intentional agent design as a tool for enhancing drug delivery. This philosophy has spurred decades of research into nanoparticle formulations and functionalization of existing drugs, pushing forward the concept of personalizing medical treatment by tailoring drug design for specific applications. The coming years hold the potential to revolutionize treatment options for a variety of ailments, chief among them being solid tumor cancers.\n\nIn the wake of the massive intellectual and financial investment in nanomedicine design, scrutiny of the founding principles and assumptions upon which the discipline has been built is warranted. Few would argue that that the most prevalent nanomedicine designs principle in cancer treatment is the idea of the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect. First introduced by Matsumura and Maeda in the 1980's [1], the EPR effect describes the phenomenon of high molecular weight drug and nanomedicine accumulation preferentially inside solid tumor models versus healthy tissue counterparts. This was primarily attributed to two tumor characteristics: a) a leaky tumor vasculature as a result of the accelerated angiogenesis that is a hallmark of cancer and b) impaired lymphatic drainage, another result of the disorganized growth of tumors. These original studies showed dramatic uptake in tumor tissue, displaying elevated drug Ivyspring International Publisher concentrations that increased up to 72 hours after injection with minimal accumulation in healthy tissue. The theory did face some criticism, most prominently via work by Jain et al. in their discovery that elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and heterogeneous blood supply limited macromolecular delivery to tumors [2,3]. Nevertheless, its basis and implications remain largely unchanged more than three decades later.\n\nThe observation of the EPR effect provided a clear design philosophy for cancer therapy development -increase drug concentration at the site of interest relative to healthy tissue as a means of alleviating treatment side effects. This was explored mainly through optimizing formulations for increased blood circulation time, such as encapsulation of agents within liposomes and surface chemistry modification using PEG chains. These changes led to longer exposure of the tumor site to circulating nanoparticles, increasing relative accumulation. Time-dependent optimization was coupled with careful size selection",

            "text": "Especially in tumor tissues, polymeric drug delivery systems increase by 10 to 100-fold the concentration of the drug compared to results following administration of an aqueous solution of the pure drug. This observation can be interpreted by an increase in permeability of the tumor vessels, whose endothelial cells are poorly aligned with wide fenestrations and lack a smooth muscle lining. This phenomenon is usually referred as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and was first explored in solid tumors [12]. The EPR effect has been observed not only in tumor growth, but also in chronic inflammation and infection cases, as well as in ischemic tissues and injured myocardial cells [13][14][15]. MI could cause many pathophysiological changes, including the enhanced permeability of endothelial cell membranes. Several angiogenic factors and vasoactive substances are upregulated after MI in ischemic tissue. This could activate and mobilize endothelial cells to form new leaky vessels, resulting in EPR-attributed nanoparticle localization. For example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is produced to promote angiogenesis and restore oxygen supply to the damaged tissue, is known to increase vascular permeability after MI [16]. However, this is a field of great controversy and there are many contradicting results for this targeting approach [17,18]. In contrast to the EPR effect in tumors, the post-MI EPR effect does not last long and begins to diminish after 24-48 h with partial functional recovery observed after two weeks [15]. A long period of treatment is generally required to treat and heal the heart after an ischemic episode to prevent negative left ventricular remodeling. This time window may be too short for the delivery of the necessary therapeutics through passive targeting strategies [19]. \n\nThe most promising method, with interesting preliminary results, is active targeting drug delivery. In most cases, a typical nanoparticle carrier consists of a polymer or lipid matrix loaded with a certain medicine.",

            "text": "Although the use of nanoparticles has shown several advantages [15], their site-specific delivery is still a problem for which passive and active-targeting approaches are necessary [16,17]. \n\nThe passive targeting approach utilizes the exploitation of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. In many disease conditions, including lung cancers, the endothelial lining of the blood vessels exhibits higher permeability than in normal conditions [17,18]. The presence of this leaky vasculature allows the higher permeation of the nanoparticles into the target site [19]. Moreover, the lack of a normal lymphatic drainage system in the tumor site contributes to higher levels of retention of the nanoparticles. However, this idiosyncratic property cannot be applied to low molecular weight drugs which have a small residence time and rapid excretion from the tumorous cells. Low molecular weight drugs can be encapsulated in unionized drug carriers to improve their pharmacokinetics (elongated systematic circulation), increasing tumor selectivity and lowering side effects. This phenomenon of tumor-targeting is called \"passive\" and depends upon the properties of the carrier molecule (its molecular weight and residence time) and the tumor anatomy (vascularity, porosity, etc.), but does not have any ligands for specific cells' binding sites. The EPR effect provides a 20-30% higher concentration of the drug targeted delivery of the tumorous site compared to normal body tissues [20,21]. \n\nEPR effect is extremely dependent on the intrinsic pathways of tumor cells' growth and it is controlled specifically by the rate of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, the rate of perivascular tumor development, stromal thickness response and the intratumor pressure. All these elements, along with the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, can influence the efficiency of the drug's targeted delivery [22]. However, the extrusion properties of the newly formed tumor's blood vessels have an impact on the nanomedicine impregnation; it causes an increase in the interstitial pressure, which may hinder the retention of the drug carriers in the tumor tissues.",

            "text": "Passive targeting in cancer nanotechnology utilizes the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, a phenomenon due to structural and functional abnormalities of tumor vasculature, such as leaky blood vessels and impaired lymphatic drainage, allowing nanoparticles to selectively accumulate in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 1). This approach facilitates targeted drug delivery to cancer tissue, but its efficiency is often hampered by tumor heterogeneity, dense extracellular matrix, and increased interstitial fluid pressure, which limits drug penetration and distribution. Optimization strategies have been developed to overcome these challenges, including customization of nanoparticle design through size, shape, and surface modifications such as PEGylation, the use of controlled release mechanisms such as pH-sensitive or enzyme-responsive systems to normalize tumor vasculature, and improve EPR efficiency. Despite these challenges, passive targeting remains a fundamental strategy in cancer therapy, enabling nanotechnology delivery systems to exploit tumor-specific properties for improved therapeutic outcomes [32][33][34][35]. \n\nTumors stimulate rapid angiogenesis to meet their need for oxygen and nutrients. However, the resulting blood vessels are disorganized, have an irregular shape, have large endothelial gaps, and have a poorly developed basement membrane. These characteristics make the tumor vessels very permeable, allowing nanoparticles and macromolecules to escape from the bloodstream and accumulate in the tumor interstitium. At the same time, tumors lack efficient lymphatic drainage, which prevents the removal of these therapeutic agents and leads to their prolonged retention in the tumor. Taken together, these features create a microenvironment in which drugs and nanoparticles preferentially concentrate in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue. The EPR effect improves drug efficacy by enabling higher local drug concentrations while minimizing systemic side effects. However, the efficacy of the EPR effect varies by tumor type and patient and is influenced by factors such as vascular density, stromal composition, and interstitial fluid pressure. Poorly vascularized tumor regions and high interstitial fluid pressure can limit drug penetration, resulting in uneven distribution of therapeutic agents.",

In addition, little or no lymphatic drainage in tumors leads to passive accumulation and retention of nanoparticles with prolonged circulation times in the tumor resulting in an enhanced permeation and retentions (EPR) effect [60][61][62][63][64]. In order to reach the target solid tumor site, the circulation time of drug carriers in the blood should be increased, which can be achieved by incorporating well-characterized macromolecules, e.g., PEG, polyacrylic acid, polyvinyl alcohol, dextran, chitosan and polyethyleneimine. DOX, as an anticancer drug, incorporated into PEG-coated liposomes, is currently in use on clinical conditions and demonstrated high efficacy in EPR-based tumor therapy with low side effects [60]. Haam et al. developed PEG-modified drug carriers for reducing toxicity and increasing circulation time [65][66][67]. These carriers effectively delivered the drugs to tumor cells and showed high therapeutic effects.",

            "text": "However, it is now generally accepted that the clinical advantage of nanomedicine is the more manageable post-treatment side effects and not necessarily an improved anti-tumor response [14,15].\n\nSince Maeda and his co-workers reported that nano-sized particles could preferentially extravasate into tumor interstitium because of the leaky tumor vasculature and remain there, due to the lack of a functional lymphatic drainage system [16], this phenomenon, also known as enhanced permeation and retention effect (EPR), has become the cornerstone of the design and application of nanomedicines to treat cancer.Since 1960, more than 59,000 original research papers on the use of nanocarriers have been published, of which more than 1600 are traceable in the Netherlands.\n\nUnfortunately, the heterogeneous nature of tumors, not only between different tumors [17], but more importantly within an individual tumor [18,19], makes EPR based drug delivery less reliable.Strikingly, a considerable part of the research done today on nanoparticles for drug delivery relies on the EPR as a means to reach individual tumor cells.Other factors related to the tumor microenvironment formulation of nanoparticles have also added to the controversy surrounding the use of NPs for drug delivery; while a stable composition and stealthiness is desired, to promote the pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutics in long circulating nanoparticles, these two characteristics hamper cellular drug delivery, due to a limited drug release and/or poor interaction and uptake of nanoparticles by the targeted cells.These observations prompted the nanomedicine community to explore other alternative approaches to improving cellular drug delivery or to bypassing the EPR, for a more effective targeting of tumors [20][21][22].\n\nAt the Erasmus Medical Center, the Nanomedicine Innovation Center Erasmus (NICE) is particularly involved in research towards improving drug delivery to tumors; either through manipulation of the tumor microenvironment, through surgical approaches, or by using smart drug delivery systems, mostly focused on liposomes (Figure 1).",

            "text": "Passive targeting is another important strategy that exploits the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, a phenomenon whereby nanoparticles preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues due to the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage that are characteristic of solid tumors. Although passive targeting does not involve specific ligand-receptor interactions, it allows for the preferential concentration of nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment, thereby increasing the local concentration of the drug and enhancing its efficacy. \n\nWhile passive targeting is inherently less selective than active targeting, it plays a crucial role in delivering nanoparticles to solid tumors, including CRC. The EPR effect is particularly effective for larger nanoparticles, such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, which can accumulate in tumor tissues more readily than smaller particles. However, the effectiveness of the EPR effect can vary significantly between patients and tumor types, leading to variability in therapeutic outcomes. For example, tumors with dense stromal tissue or poor vasculature may exhibit a reduced EPR effect, limiting the accumulation of nanoparticles. \n\nTo address these limitations, combining passive and active targeting strategies has been proposed as a synergistic approach that can enhance the specificity and efficacy of nanoparticlebased drug delivery systems. For instance, nanoparticles that initially accumulate in the tumor via the EPR effect can be further targeted to specific cancer cells using surface ligands, thus providing a dual-targeting approach that maximizes drug delivery and minimizes off-target effects. This dual-targeting strategy has been shown to improve therapeutic outcomes in preclinical models of CRC by ensuring that the drug is delivered directly to the tumor cells, even in heterogeneous tumor environments. \n\nOverall, the integration of active and passive targeting strategies represents a promising approach for improving the precision and effectiveness of nanoparticle-based therapies for CRC. As research continues to advance, the development of more sophisticated targeting mechanisms will likely lead to even greater improvements in the treatment of this challenging disease.",

            "text": "Enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) in cancer therapy leverages the structural and functional abnormalities of solid tumors [66,67]. Blood vessels in tumors form quickly and poorly as a result of an increased rate of angiogenesis to meet the increased demands for nutrients and oxygen [68]. The newly-formed blood vessels are distorted and the endothelial cells are poorly aligned with large openings [69]. The tumor's vascular wall also exhibits substantial structural abnormalities due to the absence of perivascular cells and smooth muscle layers [68,69]. The tumor's leaky vasculature facilitates the transport of macromolecules and nanoparticles into the tumor tissue while the complementary poor lymphatic drainage prevents clearance of the macromolecules and nanoparticles, leading to their accumulation within the tumor tissue [51,68,70]. Thus, the differences in the blood vessels of tumors and healthy tissues make targeting possible [70,71]. This phenomenon and passive tumor targeting is referred to as the EPR effect [68,69]. \n\nVarious studies have exploited the EPR effect in the delivery of macromolecular therapeutics and nanoformulations; however, the therapeutic effects vary depending on the tumor type, size, origin, and location [72,73]. Blood vessels in pancreatic adenocarcinoma may collapse or become clogged because of the dense stroma (Figure 2) and various extracellular components which induce stress and constriction, affecting the extravasation of macromolecules and particles into tumor tissues [67,[74][75][76]. This may explain why nanotherapeutics have not demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, other studies have reported that the EPR effect in cancer is not based only on the \"leakiness\" of the vasculature because rigid tumors such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer exhibit EPR [72,73,77,78].",

The tumor blood vessels differ very much from the ones in healthy tissues [3]. In cancer sites, blood vessels are discontinuous, resembling pipes with nano-holes. Therefore, nanoparticles can exit the circulation and penetrate the tumor interstitial space [3]. Furthermore, lymphatic filtration is poor within tumors, which facilitates drug accumulation [3]. Thus, the high permeability and increased retention processes lead to the accumulation of nanoparticles in solid tumors and to the release of therapeutic agents into malignant cells [3,7,8]. Contrarily, in healthy tissues, the blood vessels do not possess the same large fenestrations and the nanoparticles cannot exit the blood circulation and enter healthy tissues [3]. and increased retention processes lead to the accumulation of nanoparticles in solid tumors and to the release of therapeutic agents into malignant cells [3,7,8].

            "text": "Solid tumors are the major cause of death worldwide and their treatment remains a challenge [1][2][3]. Chemotherapy is one of the few treatment options available for metastasized tumors which cannot be removed surgically; however, the effectiveness of this therapeutic modality is not yet satisfactory [4]. This problem mainly stems from the lack of tumor selectivity by these agents; hence, the occurrence of severe adverse effects limits the usage of chemotherapy [5]. Nanomedicines have been designed to guide drugs more precisely to tumor cells and away from sites of toxicity. These agents have numerous theoretical advantages over low-molecular-weight drugs, including high drug loading, specific targeting, and the ability to protect the payload from degradation and release the drug in a controlled or sustained manner [6]. Theoretically, nanomedicines with larger particle size leak more slowly from blood vessels compared with most chemotherapy drugs. Fortunately, vascular leakage is a major feature of the vasculature of solid tumors. Specifically, tumor neovasculature has larger lumens and wider fenestrations (200 nm to 1.2 \u00b5m in diameter) due to its lack of a smooth muscle layer and pericytes [7]. When injected intravenously, nanomedicines ranging in size from 10 to 500 nm tend to circulate for a long time and can preferentially access the tumor tissue through the leaky tumor vasculature; subsequently, they are retained in the tumor bed due to reduced lymphatic drainage [8][9][10][11][12]. This pathophysiological phenomenon based on abnormal tumor angiogenesis to increase the delivery of nanomedicines in tumors is known as \"the enhanced permeability and retention\" (EPR) effect [10][11][12][13]. Matsumura and Maeda first reported the EPR effect in 1986 [11]. Follow-up studies rigorously verified that the EPR effect can be observed using macromolecules with an apparent molecular size >45 kDa (the threshold for renal clearance) and a longer plasma half-life.",

            "text": "The term passive targeting can be defined as the accumulation of nanoparticles in solid tumors. The foundation of passive targeting was discovered by Matsumura and Meda around 1986. They found two key observations to passive targeting: (1) spontaneous accumulation of drug carrier in areas of solid tumors with leaky vascular and (2) retention of the carrier due to compromise lymphatic drainage. With these two observations, the concept of enhancing permeability and retention (EPR) effect was formed [128]. To further understand the basis of the EPR effect, we must first understand the pathophysiology of the tumor. Solid tumors grow at a rapid rate, and this comes with high nutrients and oxygen demand. Thus, new blood vessels and neovasculature were formed, and this is term as angiogenesis. These new blood vessels often exhibit disorganized course, irregular, discontinuous epithelium and structurally different from healthy vessels. Due to this, the nanoparticles can leak between the gaps and enter the tumor. This stage is referring to the enhanced permeability of the EPR effect. It should be noted that solid tumor has poor lymphatic drainage. Molecules smaller than 4 nm can diffuse back to the bloodstream, but the nanoparticles are impeded due to their larger particle size, thus retain in the solid tumor. This part refers to the retention of the EPR effect [128,129].\n\nFor MSNs to be used as a drug delivery agent through passive targeting, there are several parameters that must be controlled, which are the particle size, particle shape and surface properties. The particle size must be larger than the renal clearance level but small enough to be able to diffuse to the tumor cell through the leaky vessel, which is approximately between 50 nm to 300 nm. A previous study showed the non-spherical nanoparticles could reduce phagocytosis, which leads to longer circulation. However, it is difficult to conclude that particle size is the main variable as there are many techniques and materials used to produce MSNs. Therefore, particle size may not be the main parameters that need to be controlled to achieve a good EPR effect [129]. Surface properties of MSNs are the most important aspect for a good EPR effect. With surface modification, the MSNs",

            "text": "Although chemotherapy nano-encapsulation \n\noften reduces some of the side-effects observed with the un-encapsulated drug [3,7], the impact on efficacy has been less clear in some cases [8][9][10][11]. Impressive efficacy has been achieved in recent trials for blood cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia [12], but findings in solid tumors have been more heterogeneous when comparing un-encapsulated and encapsulated formulations. This is especially problematic considering most FDA-approved TNP are indicated for solid tumors, including breast, ovarian, pancreatic, lung, and liver cancers. A meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials compared liposomal and conventional chemotherapy efficacy across >2,500 patients, finding no substantial difference in objective response, overall survival, and progression-freesurvival [8]. This clinical experience contrasts with most studies using animal tumor models, where TNP superiority is typically reported [8,13]. Consequently, these results raise the questions: what is driving heterogeneous patient response to TNP in solid cancers, and how can TNP clinical efficacy be better predicted? Beyond merely improving drug safety, TNP are thought to improve efficacy through the enhanced delivery to solid tumors. Due to their size and other physicochemical properties, NP may passively accumulate in tumor tissue due to a variety of factors that are collectively known as the \"enhanced permeability and retention\" (EPR) effect [14,15] or \"tumor cell endocytosis\" in earlier literature [16,17]. In principle, disrupted and leaky tumor endothelium, high amounts of tumor-associated phagocytic immune cells, and dysfunctional lymphatic drainage all may contribute to the EPR effect that governs TNP delivery. Most data describing large EPR effects come from rapidly progressing mouse models of cancer, and particularly subcutaneous xenografts. Yet it is evident that many tumors in the clinic exhibit more complex tissue architecture and thus diverse EPR behavior.",

This can occur in a few different ways including using EVs as a drug delivery system to directly target tumors or as a method of remodeling the TME. This therapeutic avenue is largely attractive due to the biological nature of EVs, conferring stable bioavailability as well as distribution in vivo, and EVs can carry a diverse range of different cargo (Kang et al., 2021). In addition to this, solid cancers can exhibit a phenomenon known as the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR), which describes increased accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors compared to regular tissues. As EVs are a type of nanoparticle, it is plausible that they may be subject to EPR (Phillips et al., 2021). EPR is observed in various solid tumors, and is characterized by abnormal tumor vasculature, tumor permeability, and a lack of effective lymphatic drainage (Wu, 2021). The leaky tumor vasculature allows for nanoparticles to extravasate through surrounding blood vessels (Maeda et al., 2013). Together, these function to help nanoparticles persist and accumulate in tumors, allowing for retention and direct delivery to the site of interest (Wu, 2021). These characteristics make EVs an attractive therapeutic avenue that can be adapted to different treatment approaches.",

Given the situation of high mortality rates which related to the rapid development of cancer, the effective treatment of cancer has always been the attractive research field for clinics and scientific researchers. \n\nThe mainstream of tumor treatment methods is mainly divided into chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy and Immunotherapy. Chemotherapy is the mainstream cancer treatment modalities in clinic for various types of cancers. However, the severe side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and inducible drug resistance make it difficult to meet ideal practical clinical requirements [2]. As a result, nanotechnology-based chemo-drug delivery systems have aroused widespread concern due to its potential benefit for treating cancer. Several therapeutic nanoparticles such as liposomes, albumin NP(Nab-paclitaxel), and polymeric micelles (Genexol-PM), have already been approved for clinical application for cancer treatment. At the same time, many other nanotechnology-based treatments are under clinical trials now [3]. Compared to other conventional drug administration, nano-drug delivery systems possess their own properties as fellows. Due to its drug loading capacity, it could increase the solubility of insoluble chemotherapy drugs; the release of loaded drug could be easily controlled with proper nanomaterials; in addition, nanocarriers could also help change the distribution characteristics of drugs in the body as well as the membrane transport mechanism of drugs. \n\nThe enhanced permeability and retention effect, also known as EPR effect, could be the crucial foundation which plays a core role in cancer nano-therapy. In most tumors tissues, the inner walls of tissues and blood vessels were damaged by rapidly growing tumor cells, causing a stronger permeability than that of normal tissues, selectively allowing polymer drugs with proper size to enter and remain in the tumor tissue, which enabled the polymer drugs targeting distribution ability.",

Their study revealed that tumor-damaged blood vessels exhibit increased vascular permeability. These leaky vasculatures enable nanomaterials in the size range of 10-150 nm to reach the tumor site easily, with exhibited affinity to be retained within the tumor, owing to the positive pressure from blood vesicles to the tumor site. Thus, formulation scientists should take advantage of the EPR effect when designing intravenous anticancer drug delivery systems by manufacturing the anticancer nanomedicine in this advantageous size range [37]. Fig. 2 shows the difference between the damaged blood vessel near the tumor site and the continuous, well-formed blood vessel near the healthy tissue. The defective or leaky vasculature provides gaps for the drug-loaded nanoparticles to enter the tumor site. This abnormal tumor vasculature characteristics is highly advantageous for delivering chemotherapy drugs directly to the cancer cells while minimizing the effect on the healthy cells.",

Once metastatic growths break through the serous membrane, cancer cells can spread into various pelvic organs. Endothelial cells become gradually more essential to vascularize the tissue, when tumor metastases grow larger than approximately 2 mm 3 , at a threshold where cells in newly forming tumor cores will reach a state of hypoxia. Solid tumors are generally associated with compromised vascular integrity and impaired lymphatic drainage; culminating in a phenomenon termed the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [48]. The EPR effect is a passive mechanism and leads to NP accumulation in solid tumor tissue, as further discussed in Section 3.2 of this review. However, at this stage of cancer progression, peritoneally delivered NPs will reach target cells in the ascites through convection, and advanced metastases through the EPR effect. Hence, it can be speculated that the suggested route will be sufficient without the need for systemic IV administration.",

            "text": "The EPR effect has become a significant driver of cancer nanomedicine design in the therapy of solid tumours, serving as a critical cornerstone of tumour-targeted drug delivery [82,83]. EPR-mediated tumour accumulation has traditionally been thought to be caused by long-circulating NPs with hydrodynamic diameters wider than the renal clearance threshold, which can extravasate from leaky tumour vasculature. However, recent research has looked into ways to broaden the traditional concept of EPR-based tumour targeting [83]. The mechanism by which NPs enter solid tumours was more complex than previously thought, and immune cells in the tumour microenvironment play critical roles in the accumulation, retention, and tumoral distribution of nanomedicines [83,84]. \n\nThe fact that the EPR effect is a blood vessel phenomenon that heavily depends on tumour blood flow is a crucial issue that needs to be addressed [85]. Many clinical cancers, particularly advanced late-stage and refractor cancers, are poor in tumour blood flow due to high coagulation activity and thrombi formation, resulting in an unsatisfactory EPR effect. The EPR impact is significantly broader in small animal xenograft tumour models, which are routinely employed in preclinical settings to explore cancer nanomedicines, than in tumours developing in humans. As a result, assessing the degree of EPR effect in tumours using non-invasive imaging is a promising strategy for stratifying patients for cancer nanomedicine treatment. \n\nThe EPR effect is a dynamic phenomenon that can empowered by altering vascular mediators. Numerous investigated methods successfully enhanced the EPR effect-based nanomedicine therapy, such as the alteration of the tumour vasculature or focusing on tumour stroma and extracellular matrix [85]. Active targeting added to EPR-based passive targeting (Fig. 4) can improve nanomedicine tumour accumulation and retention. Antibodies, antibody fragments (e.g., nanobodies), and peptides are examples of tumour-targeting ligands. Even if the nanocarrier is designed for active targeting, passive accumulation happens first, followed by target-specific binding as a supplementary technique.",

            "text": "Enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is the basic concept for the tumor-targeted delivery of macromolecular anticancer agents [1,2]. It is based on the unique physiological and anatomical nature of tumor tissues, which show as high vascular permeability and defected lymphatic clearance, and consequently, the progressive accumulation of macromolecules into tumor tissues is observed [1,2]. Many anticancer nanodrugs have been developed based on the EPR effect that show a superior tumor targeting effect and therapeutic activities [3][4][5][6][7]. However, the concept of the EPR effect was primarily based on small size/early stage solid tumors in mice. In contrast, many cancers seen in clinics are at an advanced stage and are of a large size. The blood vessels of such tumors are often occluded or embolized [8][9][10][11]. Also, the advanced large tumors have many necrotic areas or degenerated blood vessels, and tumor blood flow is always irregular, so one can claim that the EPR effect also exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity [5,6]. Because of such suppressed blood flow as seen by angiography, drug delivery to tumors is frequently very poor. As a matter of fact, many refractory tumors, such as pancreatic cancer and metastatic liver cancer, have poor blood flow, thus even nanodrugs or sophisticated antibody drugs cannot be effectively delivered into the tumor. Thus, the challenges to open-up tumor blood vessels and restore tumor blood flow are critical and of great importance for anticancer nanomedicine. \n\nBased on this knowledge, we have developed a method counteracting against the problems by using a vascular dilator, nitric oxide (NO) donor such as nitroglycerin (NG), and an angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor such as enarapril [5,6,12,13]. We and other groups have further described additional strategies to enhance the EPR, and thus the therapeutic effect of anticancer nanodrugs using nano-designed NO donors [14,15].",

            "text": "Cancer remains one of the most devastating diseases, with 18.1 million new cases and 9.6 million deaths worldwide in 2018 alone [1]. Currently, first-line cancer treatment regimens include one or more modalities, such as surgery, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Therefore, imaging/therapeutic/theranostic agent delivery remains an important issue in cancer management. Generally, these agents can be passively distributed to target cancer cells in tumors, and passive targeting relies mostly on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect derived from the leaky nature of tumor vasculature [2]. The basic pathophysiological phenomenon of EPR is hyperpermeable tumor vasculature combined with impaired lymphatic drainage, resulting in enhanced permeability and retention of molecules [3,4]. Although the conventional EPR effect results in improved delivery to tumors compared with normal tissue, some tumors do not exhibit the EPR effect and the permeability of vessels may not be the same throughout a single tumor [5,6]. Moreover, the rapid proliferation of cancer cells around the vessels may impede therapeu-tic molecule penetration [7]. Therefore, the killing of perivascular cancer cells will help improve the EPR effect. Treatments that induce apoptosis or necrosis in perivascular tumor sheaths can enhance the delivery of therapeutic molecules to solid tumors [8]. Several approaches are being explored to enhance vascular permeability and augment drug delivery within tumors, such as radiotherapy [9,10], hyperthermia [11], and photoimmunotherapy (PIT) [12]. \n\nRecently, PIT using a photosensitizer-conjugated antibody against tumor-associated antigens accompanied with exposure to light of a specific wavelength has been attracting attention as a new type of therapeutic modality for cancer [12,13]. The photosensitizerantibody conjugates strongly bind to cells in the immediate perivascular space, and thus PIT rapidly induces necrotic cell death, especially in the perivascular space, leading to a dramatic increase in tumor vascular permeability.",

            "text": "Passive targeting (Figure 5) exploits the peculiar anatomical and pathological abnormalities of the tumor vasculature which promote the accumulation of polymeric nanoparticles in the perivascular tumor region by convection or passive diffusion (Bazak et al., 2014). Convection refers to the movement of large molecules across large pores. Contrarily, diffusion is defined as a process of molecular transport across the cell membrane along the concentration gradient without consumption of cellular energy and applies mostly to compounds with a low molecular weight. However, diffusion is a more important mechanism of drug accumulation in a tumor mass because convection through the interstitium is poor; the high interstitial pressure of a tumor microenvironment does not allow the convection of drugs. The excessive leakiness of tumor vasculature, characterized by large fenestrations with a mean diameter of 100-800 nm, promotes the localization of nanoparticles into the interstitial space as a consequence of the \"enhanced permeability\" effect. At the same time, inefficient drainage of the tumor tissue due to the absence or ineffectiveness of lymphatic vessels results in \"enhanced retention\" of nanoparticles. Together, these two phenomena are known as the \"Enhanced Permeability and Retention\" (EPR) effect. The EPR effect is the cornerstone in nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery in cancers, especially in solid tumors which are characterized by rapid growth, with the exception of hypovascular tumors such as prostate or pancreatic cancer (Danhier et al., 2012). The size of a nanoparticle impacts the overall manifestation of the EPR effect on nanoparticle accumulation in tumor tissue. Polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, liposomes, and dendrimers of 80-150 nm are retained in the solid tumor tissue, but smaller particles (<20-30 nm) can easily diffuse into other compartments. Therefore, small nanoparticles exhibit poor retention even when they have good permeability (Wang et al., 2010). \n\nThe anti-tumor efficacy of many clinically available nanoformulations (Doxil, Caelyx, and Abraxane) can be partially explained on the basis of the passive targeting of the EPR effect.",

            "text": "the most promising and pivotal technologies in tumor diagnosis and therapy as it revived the application of toxic therapeutic agents such as doxorubicin for tumor treatment [8,9]. Such nanocarriers mainly include liposome, polymeric micelle, nanoconjugate, gold nanoparticle, carbon nanotube, dendrimer, and phagebased nanoplatforms [10]. Among these nanoplatforms, polymeric nanoparticles, a kind of colloidal particle that consists of natural or synthetic polymers, have received the majority of attention due to their excellent stability and the ease of surface modification [11]. Besides, the particles, which are approximately 100 nm in size, are characterized by low clearance during circulation and a high enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in solid tumor [12]. EPR effects, a phenomenon resulting from the defective architecture of tumor blood vessels and various vascular permeability factors, have a pivotal effect on the distribution and intratumoral penetration of nanoparticles [13]. It has been demonstrated that the microvascular pore size of a glioma is 7 to 100 nm; thus, the particles that are approximately 100 nm in diameter tend to be appropriate vehicles for penetration into the tumor interior through the large gaps between endothelial cells [14,15]. \n\nAlthough EPR effect of tumor could facilitate the accumulation of chemotherapeutics-loaded nanoparticles into tumor parenchyma, using passive targeting seems inadequate, as splenic filtration and phagocytes in the liver may decrease the accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors [12]. Besides, the EPR effect of brain tumor was much weaker than that of peripheral tumors, indicating that BBB is still a main obstacle for brain tumor drug delivery [16,17]. In this case, drug delivery system which could simultaneously targeted the BBB and brain tumor might facilitate drug penetrated from vascular and selectively accumulated in tumor cells [16,17]. Advances in the analysis of tumor cell proteins have expanded the use of dual-targeted drug delivery. Among these, various receptors expressed on the surface of or inside tumor cells allow for active targeting delivery of agents into tumor tissues [18].",

            "text": "It is generally accepted that solid tumors are usually highly heterogeneous, with significant differences in the vascular system depending on tumor type and stage of growth (Pe'er et al., 2021). It is worth noting that tumor tissues generally lack functional lymphatic vessels and there is a large gap between endothelial cells, which leads to the easy exosmosis or retention of macromolecules. This unique pathophysiological property promotes the selective accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor tissues, a phenomenon defined as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) (Maeda et al., 2000). The passive targeting strategy based on the EPR effect can significantly improve the specific distribution of drugs in tumor tissues and minimize the toxic effect on normal tissues through the rational design of nanocarriers (such as liposomes, polymer nanoparticles, etc.). \n\nYuan et al. adopted silk fibroin (SF) as the carrier material of the drug delivery system, and successfully constructed a dual-drug coloaded hydrogel system (Yuan et al., 2025). The team combined 5-FU in SF solution with curcumin dissolved in acetone solvent through precise process control to produce a nanoparticle drug delivery system with a particle size distribution ranging from 77.87 nm to 299.22 nm. It is worth noting that this composite nanosphere exhibits a significant EPR effect, which enables it to effectively enrich solid tumor tissue through a passive targeting mechanism, thus enhancing tumor therapy. \n\nIn view of the complex variability and potential toxicity of nanocarriers, Ji and other researchers have carried out innovative research based on natural small molecules (Ji et al., 2022) (Figure 3A). They found that honokiol (HK) can self-assemble through intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions to form stable NPs. This self-assembled system based on natural ingredients exhibits unique tumor-targeting properties: First, HK NPs can selectively accumulate at the tumor site thanks to the EPR effect; Subsequently, they enter the cell through endocytosis of tumor cells.",

            "text": "Alongside the MPS, both passive and active targeting play a key role in assisting NP delivery to tumor sites as depicted in Figure 2. Large fenestrae of 100-200 nm (increases to 400-600 nm in some liver diseases) and an absence of an organized basement membrane are features of the liver sinusoids (Aird, 2007). Hence they are able to facilitate passive liver targeting through the widely reported EPR effect. This effectively builds up a high local concentration of NPs in the perisinusoidal space of Disse, whereby diffusion towards the malignant tumor cells can occur. Since the EPR effect is evident within tumors, it results in the preferential uptake and retention of NPs (Maeda, Wu, Sawa, Matsumura, & Hori, 2000). Excessive proangiogenic signaling within the tumor microenvironment leads collectively to the production of immature blood vessels that are heterogeneous, poorly perfused and disorganized. Leakage results from large inter-endothelial cell junctions, favoring the retention of NPs. These mechanistic features underpin the EPR effect and have been greatly exploited as a strategy to passively deliver NPs into tumors. It was established that NK012, a polymeric micelle formulation of SN-38, enhances its antitumor activity through the EPR effect. By using a VEGF-secreting tumor model, significantly enhanced accumulation of NK012 within tumors was demonstrated, augmented by the hypervascularity and hyperpermeability induced by VEGF (Koizumi et al., 2006). Similarly, in a Phase II clinical trial the accumulation of the liposome, CPX-1, in CRC lesions was attributed to EPR-based accumulation (Batist et al., 2008;Goel et al., 2011;Golombek et al., 2018). Despite the benefits of passive targeting, major limitations still exist. Heterogeneity within tumors and between the primary and metastatic tumors, often causes the nonuniform delivery of NPs (Adua et al., 2017).",

On the other hand, an actively growing tumor involves rapid neovascularization, resulting in a tissue architecture that distinctively differ from its normal counterpart, which is characterized by 1) faulty endothelial linings with gaps and; 2) lack of lymphatic drainage. 7,8 The EPR effect suggests that macromolecular drug carriers can, in theory, accumulate in a solid tumor tissue passively based on such pathologic characteristics, and may serve as a tentative model for reduced toxicity via such passive targeting of cytotoxic agents. \n\nHowever, this approach has been less effective in practice than in theory due to the fact that some tumors have well-developed lymphatic drainage. 8,9 1][12] Therefore, high levels of therapeutics may fail to retain sufficiently in tumor sites, reducing the reliability of the EPR effect. Specific targeting of tumor cells may help to retain NPs in the tumor site and avoid their rapid removal by the brain lymphatic drainage.

            "text": "For more than three decades, enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)-effect-based nanomedicines have received considerable attention for tumor-selective treatment of solid tumors. However, treatment of advanced cancers remains a huge challenge in clinical situations because of occluded or embolized tumor blood vessels, which lead to so-called heterogeneity of the EPR effect. We previously developed a method to restore impaired blood flow in blood vessels by using nitric oxide donors and other agents called EPR-effect enhancers. Here, we show that two novel EPR-effect enhancers\u2014isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN, Nitrol\u00ae) and sildenafil citrate\u2014strongly potentiated delivery of three macromolecular drugs to tumors: a complex of poly(styrene-co-maleic acid) (SMA) and cisplatin, named Smaplatin\u00ae (chemotherapy); poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) polymer-conjugated zinc protoporphyrin (photodynamic therapy and imaging); and SMA glucosamine-conjugated boric acid complex (boron neutron capture therapy). We tested these nanodrugs in mice with advanced C26 tumors. When these nanomedicines were administered together with ISDN or sildenafil, tumor delivery and thus positive therapeutic results increased two- to four-fold in tumors with diameters of 15 mm or more. These results confirmed the rationale for using EPR-effect enhancers to restore tumor blood flow. In conclusion, all EPR-effect enhancers tested showed great potential for application in cancer therapy.",

            "text": "In essence, the EPR effect refers to the phenomenon of selective accumulation of macromolecular agents in tumor tissues, facilitated by the unique anatomical and pathophysiological characteristics of tumor blood vessels. This allows for the preferential permeation and retention of macromolecular drugs within solid tumors following systemic administration. The validity of the EPR effect has been established not only in experimental animal models but also in humans, including cases of liver, renal, and metastatic breast cancers [13][14][15]. Recent studies examining human renal tumors and metastatic breast cancers have demonstrated a significant EPR effect in more than 87% of samples, highlighting the pivotal role of this effect in the advancement of anti-cancer nanomedicines [13,14]. Based on the EPR effect, nanomedicines exhibit many beneficial features for targeted cancer therapy, in contrast to those of conventional small molecular anti-cancer drugs, which tend to spread indiscriminately in normal tissues and organs, thus leading to systemic adverse effects [7,8,10]. Nanomedicines, therefore, offer promise in terms of improved treatment options. In the 1990s, the first polymer-conjugated nanomedicine, SMANCS (styrene maleic acid polymer-conjugated neocarzinostatin), was approved in Japan, marking a significant milestone in the development of anti-cancer nanomedicine [15]. Over the past two decades, the field of anti-cancer nanomedicine has experienced substantial growth and advancement [16][17][18]. Many nanomedicines are currently being utilized in clinical settings, with numerous others undergoing clinical trials (see Table 1). \n\nIn recent years, numerous nanomedicines have been designed and developed for advanced, less-invasive cancer therapy. Examples include nanoprobe-based photodynamic therapy [12,19] and boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) [20,21], as well as magnetic hyperthermia therapy using magnetite [12,19], all of which demonstrate promising therapeutic potential. Additionally, the application of nanomedicine in cutting-edge biomedical fields such as immunotherapy, gene therapy, and preventive medicine has garnered sig-nificant attention.",

Only a small fraction of the administered dose reaches tumor cells because the drug is preferentially re-absorbed from the interstitium into blood capillaries (1,2) and because intranodal pressure is elevated. (3) The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (4) describes the phenomenon by which molecules of certain sizes accumulate into a tumor due to tumor vasculature permeability. Cabral et al. (5) report that sub-50 nm polymetric micelles incorporating platinum anticancer drugs accumulated in metastatic foci within clinically tumor-positive LN due to the EPR effect, suggesting the importance of controlling nanocarrier size when treating LN metastasis. Our group has shown the induction of sinus hyperplasia, increased blood vessel density, (6) increased intranodal pressure (3) but no change in LN volume (6) in the early stages of LN metastasis. Jeong et al. (7) report a lack of angiogenesis during the formation of LN metastasis, consistent with observations that hyperplasia, (3) increases in intranodal pressure (3) and blood vessel density (6,8) are detected before angiogenesis in clinically tumor-negative LN. \n\nThe EPR effect is relevant to the development of drug delivery systems (DDS) to treat LN metastasis but little is known about the EPR effect in metastatic LN. We established a recombinant inbred mouse, MXH10/Mo-lpr/lpr (MXH10/ Mo/lpr), with LN that swell to a diameter of 10 mm at 3 months, a size similar to that of human LN. (9) We developed a model of LN metastasis in which metastasis is induced to the proper axillary LN (PALN) via lymphatic vessels following inoculation of tumor cells into the subiliac LN (SiLN).

            "text": "There has been much progress in the development of nanomedicines for use cancer imaging and therapy [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. To increase the potential for clinical application, nanomedicines with increased precision and safety have recently been designed and evaluated. Following intravenous administration, particles with a certain size range can localize to the tumor region through an \"enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect\" [21][22][23]. Molecules or particles with a size of >40 kDa (renal clearance threshold) may be present in the systemic circulation for a prolonged period [22,23]. Leaky tumor vasculature and insufficient lymphatic drainage of tumor tissue can increase the permeability and accumulation of particles [24]. Although the EPR effect has been proved in many animal studies, its usefulness for clinical application is still controversial [21]. The pathophysiological states are different according to the animal species (rodent versus human), tumor types originated from same source, and primary versus metastatic tumors in the same patient [21]. Consideration of the heterogeneity of EPR effect is necessary for the successful translation of nanomedicines to the clinical situation [21]. As drug delivery via EPR does not usually occur in normal tissues, it can be used as a passive tumor-targeting strategy [25]. However, the heterogeneity of tumor tissue, including highly hypovascular areas and necrotic tissues, frequently observed in large tumors may limit the efficiency of particle delivery. In addition to various factors that modulate the EFR effect [26] (e.g., bradykinin, nitric oxide derivatives, prostaglandins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]), ligand-receptor interactions have been introduced as an active tumor-targeting strategy [27].",

            "text": "The EPR effect refers to the preferential localization of NNMs in pathological tissues due to the enhanced permeability of the vasculature that supplies such tissues (e.g., tumors and inflammatory conditions). Deregulations in angiogenesis and/or the increased expression and activation of vascular permeability factors predominates at these sites, which can lead to fenestrations allowing passage of NNMs (Hashizume et al., 2000;Nehoff et al., 2014). In addition to the enhanced leakiness of tumorous and inflamed blood vessels, the EPR effect also relates to the observation that solid tumors tend to lack functional lymphatic drainage, which limits the removal of extravasated NNMs from the target site (Maeda et al., 2013;Danhier, 2016). These pathological properties allow NNMs to accumulate at pathological sites and is referred to as passive targeting. To achieve this, it is important that NNMs with drug cargo circulate long enough in the bloodstream (i.e., show prolonged circulation kinetics). This can be achieved by conjugating polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the surface of NNMs (Figure 1). Thus, the EPR effect is expected to increase the therapeutic efficacy of NNMs in comparison to small molecules, which often show inferior pharmacokinetic properties (Matsumura and Maeda, 1986;Hobbs et al., 1998;van der Meel et al., 2013). The EPR effect was first observed in 1986 (Matsumura and Maeda, 1986) and has since been exploited particularly for the development of NNMs for passive tumor targeting, leading to NNMs with adequate physicochemical properties and prolonged circulation half-life that accumulate in tumors over time (Maeda et al., 2013;Nakamura et al., 2015;Danhier, 2016). The EPR effect and thus extent of passive targeting is highly dependent on the tumor pathophysiology. Currently, it is recognized that EPR is a very heterogeneous phenomenon as it depends on the type of tumor and can vary significantly within the same tumor type Ojha et al., 2017).",

            "text": "One of the challenges in cancer therapy and more so in RCC is the broad non-specific target-based treatment approach, which not only causes severe side effects in patients but also in most cases enhances drug resistance by enhancing the survival of chemotherapy-treated residual tumor cells into an aggressive phenotype. The advantage in the application of nanotechnology is the use of \"nanocarriers\" as drug delivery vehicles that mediate targeted delivery of drugs to tumor sites without causing much harm to normal tissues (135). However, the technology is still in infancy and, currently, there are a few clinical applications of this technology in cancer treatment [127,[130][131][132][133]. Nonetheless, several in vitro and in vivo mouse model studies have demonstrated that the technology has the potential to have a significant impact on clinics. \n\nNanocarriers, usually having a size of less than 100 nm in one dimension, are organic/inorganic or hybrid particles shaped in the form of micelles, dendrimers, liposomes, or virus-like particles and are used to encapsulate/covalently conjugate or absorb cancer drugs. These nanocarriers have shown significantly greater efficacy in different cancer models compared to drugs on its own (136). Nanoparticle formulated (nanocarriers) drugs allow for specific targeting of tumor cells by providing superior solubility and stability of drugs in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in improved internalization of the drugs in the tumor without much loss in the circulation, circumventing harmful side effects in patients. One great advantage of nanoparticleformulated drugs is that they cannot pass the tight junctions of the normal vascular lining but can easily pass through the leaky vascular lining of tumors to enhance their concentration at the tumor site (137). This phenomenon known as \"enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR)\" is the fundamental principle of nanoparticle-conjugated drug treatment of tumors (138). However, in that scenario, the surface area and size of nanocarriers play an important role in active tumor targeting and are adjusted for EPR effects to occur without unwanted uptake of nanodrugs by the normal endothelial system (138).",

            "text": "Chemotherapy, as a conventional therapeutic strategy for NB, has yielded great achievements in narrowing tumor area prior to surgery resection, preventing tumor metastatic spread, suppressing tumor proliferation, and prolonging patients' lifetime. Chemotherapeutics routinely administered for NB include several cytotoxic agents such as vincristine, DOX, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, topotecan, irinotecan, and paclitaxel (PTX) (George et al., 2010). However, curative effects of these chemotherapeutic agents tended to be severely compromised due to their rapid clearance and non-specific distribution, which leads to unavoidable systemic toxicity. In addition, multidrug resistance is another major cause of chemotherapy failure (Wu et al., 2022). Currently, nanomaterial-based approaches have been proposed in combination with chemotherapy aim to enhance the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy regimens through multiple strategies. Nanomedicines enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy for NB mainly through the following ways: 1) targeting chemotherapeutics through nanocarriers; 2) improving permeability to tumor tissues; 3) reversing multiple drug resistance; 4) collaborating with other therapeutic approaches for NB. \n\nThe abnormal vascular proliferation in tumor tissues is characterized by high vascular density and poor vessel wall integrity, wide gaps, permeability to macromolecular particles and comparatively slow lymphatic reflux, thus enabling NPs of a certain size to access and retain in tumor tissues, and achieving efficient and accurate enrichment in tumor tissues. Such effect is called the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which belongs to the passive targeting effect (Matsumura and Maeda, 1986). Besides, various nanomaterial-based targeted drug delivery systems have been designed to enhance the aqueous solubility, stability and pharmacokinetics process of numerous hydrophobic drugs in vivo, enabling aggressive targeting of drug delivery to tumor sites, realizing targeted drug release and reducing drug toxicity while enhancing drug efficacy and overcoming drug resistance. NPs with diameter less than 200 nm exhibit stronger EPR efficacy which are widely utilized for tumor targeting therapy.",

            "text": "Such physical characteristics are likely advantageous to the nanoparticles in exploiting the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect associated with solid tumors. Passively targeted nanoparticles enter through leaky vasculature of the solid tumors and are retained in the tumor tissue for extended periods of time due to impaired lymphatic flow. This unique microphysiology of tumors is exploited by many FDA-approved nanoformulations such as Doxil and Abraxane. In solid tumors, such as lung cancer, the EPR effect plays an important role in determining the efficacy of the nanoparticle-based drug delivery system [72]. The presence of a highly fenestrated blood vasculature in the tumor facilitates the EPR effect allowing the enhanced entry of colloidal nanoparticles into the tumor (Figure 2). Additionally, the poor lymphatic flow in the tumor tissue adds to this effect and results in enhanced retention of nanoparticles within the tumor site. In contrast to tumor tissues, the blood vasculature in normal tissues is intact and less permeable attenuating the uptake of nanoparticles by normal tissues. Furthermore, the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles are critically important for passive targeting of solid tumors. The EPR effect usually applies to particles that are less than 200 nm in size. However, particles less than 50 nm in size frequently undergo extravasation from the tumor through the fenestrations and are thus less likely to be retained in the tumor tissue for extended periods of time. Moreover, active targeting of nanoparticles is accomplished by decorating the surface of the nanoparticle with specific ligands to promote the binding and interaction with overexpressed protein receptors on cancer cell surfaces. This approach leads to preferential binding, uptake, and intracellular accumulation of the drug or gene in the targeted cells. However, the overall tumor accumulation and therapeutic effect of targeted nanoparticles may be principally controlled by the EPR effect [73]. \n\nFabrication of polymeric nanoparticles with uniform and sub-200 nm size requires critical control over each and every step in the synthesis procedure, which is always challenging.",

Furthermore, drug resistance brought on by drug efflux pumps has shown to be a significant barrier for nanomedicines [44,45]. The clinical transition of nanomedicines from bench to bedside is significantly hampered by these biological hurdles. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect was proposed by Maeda in the 1980s, which explained the uptake of nanomedicines [46]. Passive targeting of nanocarriers relies on the EPR effectbased accumulation in malignancies [46]. Further, these nanocarriers can be made stealthily with a coating of PEGs and zwitterionic polymers [47]. Current marketed NP-based anticancer drugs all rely on passive targeting pathways to accumulate in tumors. However, a meta-analysis of 2,589 patients in the clinic revealed that the liposomal DOX did not increase objective response, overall survival, or progression-free survival rates [48]. Unspecific delivery and the extremely variable EPR impact in individuals may be the cause of nanomedicines' meager clinical results [46,49]. Responses to the EPR effect vary among patients, cancer kinds, and even within a single patient, distinct tumoral lesions. Ligand-functionalized nanocarriers for active tumor targeting have been created as the second generation of nano-scale drug delivery systems to increase anticancer efficacy. Both the EPR effect and strong bind affinity to the particular biomarkers on the targeted cancer cells and tumor vascular epithelial cells are necessary for these active targeting nanocarriers to reach the tumor locations [50,51]. Different small molecules and biomolecules are used as targeting ligands [52].",

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is historically one of the most frequently cited advantages of nanoparticle cancer therapeutics [37]. As tumorigenesis occurs, the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) induces the formation of a disordered, complex vascular network feeding tumor cells as they proliferate. High expression of VEGF in tumor tissue has been implicated in the formation of abnormal vascular wall morphology, where the endothelium lining the blood vessels contains large gaps-or \"leaky\" junctions-allowing for enhanced permeability of small particles and cells across the vascular wall. It is this enhanced permeability that is a double-edged sword for cancer: on the one hand, it is believed to enhance tumor metastasis by allowing the escape of tumor cells into the infiltrating vessels, which circulate them across the body to distant metastatic sites [38]; on the other hand, the leaky vasculature unique to the tumor microenvironment promotes the accumulation of systemically circulating nanoparticles at the tumor site, a phenomenon that should enhance the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle drugs against solid tumors. Despite the premise of the EPR effect to preferentially enhance the uptake of nanoparticles in tumors, the challenges we have outlined above clearly indicate there remains significant room for improving nanoparticle delivery. Uptake into tumor tissue via the Cellular internalization of nanoparticles is achieved either passively or actively, although the lines between these two methods of internalization have been somewhat blurred as researchers continue to develop new methods of characterizing and enhancing nanoparticle uptake by tumor cells. Santi\u00e0 et al. reviewed various methods of nanoparticle surface functionalization and found that methods such as PEGylation enhance the passive internalization of nanoparticles [36]. Analytical methods such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been used to visualize accumulation of passively internalized nanoparticles in endosomes, and continued functionalization of nanoparticle coronas with ligands such as cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have further enhanced nanoparticle uptake into tumor cells.",

            "text": "Most current chemotherapy drugs do not sufficiently distinguish between cancerous and normal cells, leading to systemic adverse effects and dose-limiting toxicity. Moreover, rapid elimination of anticancer drugs reduces the curative effect and requires the administration of the drug in large quantities, which results in poor response, high cost, and undesirable toxicity. 1 Attention is now being focused on killing cancer cells by more specific targeting while sparing normal cells. To achieve these goals, one of the methods is the development of novel delivery systems for both existing and new drugs. Nanoparticles (NPs), the advanced, sustained drug delivery systems, are making a significant contribution to the improvement in oncology therapy, such as enhancing the anticancer efficacy and reducing drug toxicity. 2 In addition, it has been confirmed that a tumor can take up NPs passively through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR). The fundamental features of EPR physiology are hyperpermeable tumor vasculature allowing enhanced permeability of large particles, which are large enough to avoid renal clearance into the interstitial space of the tumor. Meanwhile, the impaired lymphatic drainage of tumor limits the clearance of these particles and causes their enhanced retention. 3 owever, many clinical outcomes have indicated that EPR is not as reliable to ensure tumor targeting of NPs as previously proved by preclinical studies, which may be attributed to the complex tumor microenvironment. 4 o overcome the limitation of passive targeting, a variety of methods have been used to ensure that NPs acquire active tumor targeting ability; one of them is to couple NPs with various biomolecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides, aptamers, etc. These active targeting moieties are capable of reducing off-target effects and improving the bioavailability of the NPs. 5 Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is overexpressed in multiple human solid tumors, is closely related to the prognosis and response to chemotherapy. Thus, it has been a promising target for therapy and a mediator for targeted delivery. 6,7",

            "text": "The reason why conventional chemotherapy treatments for brain tumors fail to avoid remission of the tumor after surgical resection followed by chemotherapy is that penetration and retention of the drug in brain tissue is poorly achieved. However, blood vessels in solid tumor show some weaknesses that can be exploited in order to enhance drug delivery to the tumor. These are extensive angiogenesis, extensive extravasation, defective vascular architecture and impaired lymphatic clearance from the interstitial space of tumor tissues. They all enhance the permeability of blood vessels in tumor tissues and contribute to retention of macromolecules and other particles. Maeda coined the term enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) to describe this effect. [147] Thanks to EPR effect, some nanomaterials have been shown to be able to cross the BBB and be retained in brain tumor tissue. Nanoparticle-mediated delivery systems allow for a controlled local release within brain tissue. Computational models can help to understand how physicochemical properties of nanoparticles affect therapeutic delivery and efficacy, thus allowing to optimize the design of nanoparticles for the treatment of brain tumors. [148] egarding GBM, different approaches have been explored in the past few years. Nonenergy dependent pathways (passive uptake) and energy-dependent pathways (active uptake through convection-enhanced delivery, CED) have been considered for drug delivery, in a mission to identify less invasive and safer ways to apply this therapeutic strategy. Also, different delivery strategies have been developed, as viral delivery vehicles, nonviral delivery vehicles and multifunctional delivery systems. [149,150] Although nanoparticles are able to cross the BBB, active targeting to tumor tissue still needs to be improved. Polymeric nanoparticles and CED, polymeric micelles and CED, and liposomal nanoparticles and active tumor targeting are plausible therapeutic strategies. [151] ecent advances have been made in nano-mediated delivery of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (gene therapy), antiangiogenic factors and immunoconjugates. Magnetic nanoparticles show advantages over other materials that have made them a suitable material for nanomedicine.",

            "text": "Nanomaterials can reach and accumulate in tumors via passive and active targeting. While active targeting depends on specific interactions between nanomaterials and tumors (see Section 1.3.3), passive tumor targeting by nanomaterials precedes the active targeting and is essential to create an opportunity for the occurrence of specific interactions. Indeed, passive and preferential targeting of the tumors by both NPs and NCs have been observed, and this phenomenon has been named the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) [132,134]. EPR can be explained by the presence of pores with sizes of up to 2000 nm within tumors [135]. These pores represent inter-endothelial gaps formed during angiogenesis in the tumors, and they allow NPs to accumulate in cancer tissues at higher concentrations than in normal tissues. Thus, this passive accumulation of NPs in tumors takes advantage of the pathophysiological properties of the tumor tissue. Despite being the foundation of tumor-targeted drug delivery and the NP accumulation principle, the EPR effect in patients has been recently questioned [136,137]; the mechanism of entry of NPs into solid tumors appears to be more intricate than considered earlier [138]. Either way, passive tumor targeting by nanomaterials has certain disadvantages, such as arbitrary targeting, inefficient dispersion of the NPs, and variability among different tumor types and different patients [137]. Interestingly, the EPR effect is generally more pronounced in animal models than in cancer patients, which hampers understanding of the NC biodistribution and translation to clinic of the results obtained in animal studies. \n\nThe biodistribution of NPs and NCs is affected by their interaction with the environment, and this interaction differs for NPs and NCs. Upon administration, NPs are rapidly exposed to protein-rich biological fluids. These proteins interact with the NPs and form a protein corona on their surface [139]. Such protein coronas affect the size and charge of the NPs [140] as well as their stability, dispersibility, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity profiles [141]. Ultimately, the biodistribution of decorated NPs is altered, and they may even get recognized by the immune system (RES).",

The EPR effect has attracted great interest because of its success in preclinical animal models (153-155), but it has failed to demonstrate greater efficacy when studied in clinical setting (156,157). Moreover, the advantage that the EPR effect offers in facilitating the accumulation of nanosystems in the tumor is relatively low and estimated at less than 2-fold compared with normal organs, and the resulting drug concentration is insufficient to treat most tumors (158). In the particular context of PC, tumor lesions differ in size and location and often have poor vascularization and perfusion, which prevent nanoparticles from take advantage of the EPR effect (159). IP delivery represents a more appropriate administration route because it exploits the irregularities and disorganization of mesothelial tissue caused by tumor cell infiltration, a mechanism that has been described as the main responsible of drug accumulation in tumor nodules following IP delivery (160,161). However, a formulation developed for IV administration will not necessarily demonstrate better efficacy when administered via IP. An example is given by pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD). The analysis of the pharmacokinetic curves of doxorubicin in patients receiving PLD via HIPEC following CRS, suggested a slow and variable absorption into the intraperitoneal tissues (40% of the administered drug was retained) with no advantages respect to the drug administered as such (162).\n\nThe addition of specific moieties to the surface of the nanoparticles facilitates their interaction via active targeting with specific molecules overexpressed at the tumor site. CD44 has already been extensively described as a suitable antigen for tumor targeting since it is overexpressed in a plethora of cancers as lung (163,164), prostate (165), colon (166,167), ovarian (168) and \n\nothers (169). In several human ovarian cancer models, overexpression of CD44 is linked with cancer cells adhesion to peritoneal mesothelial cells (170). As the primary ligand of CD44, hyaluronic acid (HA) as",

            "text": "In nanomedicine, the delivery mechanisms of nanoparticles also impact their clinical applications in the treatment and diagnosis of cancer. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect has long been considered the primary mechanism for the tumor delivery of nanoparticles (passive targeting), which suggests that nanoparticles smaller than the endothelial gaps enter tumors and cannot leave [63]. However, pharmacokinetic studies indicate that the number of nanoparticles in tumors decreases over time and is influenced by tumor heterogeneity. Sindhwani et al. suggested that although the gaps between endothelial cells are considered a dominant factor in the EPR effect, studies have observed that these gaps are not frequent [64]. The number of endothelial gaps is 60 times less than the number of nanoparticles accumulated, as measured in their recent experiments. While this provides some evidence for the EPR effect, it still cannot fully explain the accumulation of nanoparticles at tumor sites. To date, only ten nanomedicines have received FDA approval, and only 14% of these drugs have demonstrated clinical efficacy. Research indicates that after systemic administration, only 0.7% of nanomedicines reach solid tumors [65]. Undoubtedly, nanomedicines are beneficial in cancer treatment. As carriers for chemotherapeutic drugs, they significantly enhance patient tolerance by limiting systemic toxicity. However, the high attrition rate has led to some doubts about the effectiveness of nanomedicine. Consequently, despite being a research hotspot in the biomedical field in recent years, nanomedicines still face several challenges and issues in clinical translation and application.",

            "text": "Passive targeting is based on enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) (Matsumura and Maeda, 1986;Torchilin, 2011) The rapid growth of tumours results in large gaps in vascular endothelial cells, leading to more drugs entering tumour tissue. The imperfect lymphatic reflux function of tumour tissue results in the long-term retention of drugs at the tumour site. The EPR effect is known as the \"royal gate\" (Danhier et al., 2010) and is the gold standard for the design of antitumour drugs and the physiological basis for the entry and accumulation of macromolecules and small particles in tumours. The presence of NPs can not only reduce the toxic side effects of chemotherapy drugs but also enhance the EPR effect and improve the targeting ability and efficacy of drugs (Torchilin, 2007a). For example, Doxil (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) has a drug concentration that is 10 times higher than that of free doxorubicin at the tumour site (Torchilin, 2007b).\n\nExcept for tumours with blood vessels, such as prostate cancer or pancreatic cancer, almost all fast-growing tumours exhibit the EPR effect Din et al., 2017;Fang et al., 2020a). NPs must be of a certain size to exploit the EPR effect. The size of the drug in blood circulation must be larger than the renal clearance threshold to ensure long-term circulation. Therefore, the size of the NPs must be greater than 10 nm (Maeda et al., 2009;Maeda et al., 2013). Second, the size of NPs should be smaller than the lumen size of the vasculature at the tumour site; therefore, they need to be smaller than 100 nm (Noguchi et al., 1998;Liu et al., 2018a). In-depth studies have found that NPs that are approximately 50 nm have the highest efficacy on primary and metastatic tumours (Tang et al., 2014a). In addition to size, other NP properties, such as biocompatibility and surface charge, impact the EPR effect (Kobayashi et al., 2014",

            "text": "In the next phase of delivery, PNPs must extravasate out of blood vessels into the tumor site (Figure 1, Phase II). By means of prolonged circulation times, PNPs can accumulate inside tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The EPR effect relies on the differences between the vascularization of normal tissues and tumors. In normal tissues, small molecules transit easily out of the blood stream, while large molecules, such as NDDS, cannot. In contrast, the tumor vasculature is a chaotic network of undeveloped and \"leaky\" angiogenic blood vessels, which allows the extravasation of large NDDS that are up to several hundred nanometers in size. This, in conjunction with impaired lymphatic drainage, results in the relatively effective and somewhat selective accumulation of NDDS within tumors [9,65]. Accordingly, most FDA-approved cancer nanomedicines exploit the EPR effect to \"passively\" target and accumulate within diseased tissues. However, the clinical efficacy of the EPR effect has become highly controversial. This is due to widespread variations in the presence of leaky tumor vasculature and its inconsistent molecular cut-off size, which is dependent on the patient and the tumor's location, stage, and type [66]. In addition, tumor tissue exhibits irregular blood vessel formation and permeability, poor blood flow, and non-uniform interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), which further limits the extravasation and perfusion of NDDSs [66,67]. Therefore, tactics to overcome these barriers are needed.",

There are models for almost every other step in drug delivery for cancer therapy (e.g. pharmacokinetics, diffusion, uptake, tumor growth, survival rates, etc.), but not the crucial EPR effect. Using pharmacokinetic data for Doxil and doxorubicin we show how the EPR effect influences tumor accumulation for different values of the rate constants for tumor uptake by the EPR effect and intravasation back into circulation. Modeling results show the kinetics of drug accumulation with time. By taking into account intravasation back into circulation, tumor uptake shows a characteristic maximum, with loss of drug from the tumor at longer times. This model provides a quantitative framework to guide preclinical trials of new chemotherapeutic delivery vehicles and ultimately to develop design rules that can increase targeting efficiency and decrease unwanted side effects in normal tissue.",

            "text": "Therefore, tumor blood vessels are leaky compared to normal blood vessels due to the defective endothelial cells and more vascular permeability, as well as vastly expressed vascular mediators including bradykinin, NO, and VEGF, resulting in selective accumulation of nanodrugs into tumor tissues with little or no distribution in normal cells [4]. Among others, the most prominent pathophysiological factors contributing to EPR-targeted passive tumor targeting include active transcytosis across the blood vessel wall for NPs extravasation and phagocytic uptake by TAMs as a mechanism of NPs retention [2]. \n\nIn EPR-based passive targeting, TME plays a vital role. One of the crucial metabolic features of fast-proliferating tumor cells is glycolysis, which is the key energy source of cell division and transforms the neighboring milieu into an acidic. This decreased pH of TME can be utilized to deliver pH-responsive NPs to release drugs at a low pH [1,5,6]. \n\nThe EPR effect is dynamic and a phenomenon of tumor blood vessels, which is mostly dependent on blood flow. Animal models of solid tumors rich in blood flow demonstrated enhanced EPR effects. However, many clinical cancers such as late-stage tumors and refractory tumors are associated with poor blood flow due to the coagulation and thrombi formation exhibiting poor EPR effect [7][8][9][10][11][12]. For such tumors, the improvement of EPR-based drug delivery is necessary by modifying tumor blood vessels, angiogenesis, a vascular edifice, blood flow, etc. The EPR effect can be enhanced by modifying vascular intermediaries such as angiotensin II, nitroglycerin or NO, CO, and enzyme inhibitors [7][8][9][10]. An integration of vascular mediators with a nanodrug may be an important strategy for an enhanced EPR effect. Further, targeting tumor stroma and extracellular matrix, and controlling tumor vessels, may improve EPR-targeted drug delivery to tumors [4]. \n\nTumor blood flow and vascular permeability fluctuate significantly, and blood flow is commonly blocked as the tumor size rises.",

            "text": "Tumors are heterogeneous by nature and various studies have shown that the EPR effect within tumors is also highly heterogeneous [11][12][13]. Heterogeneity is present among tumor models of different species, diverse tumor types of the same origin, tumors at different locations in the same patient, and even at different stages of the same tumor during its development [14][15][16]. Within a tumor, variations in the thickness and density of the extracellular matrix (ECM), uneven blood flow distribution, and disproportionate vessel permeability have been shown to affect the heterogeneity of the EPR effect [11,17]. These factors vary substantially among tumors and even within the same tumor over time. In addition, the physicochemical properties of a nanoscale drug carrier, such as size, shape, and elasticity, contribute to the heterogeneity of the EPR effect. Several studies have shown that the size, shape, and elasticity of nanomedicine carriers impacted extravasation from the vessel and retention in the tumor site, resulting in varied therapeutic efficacy [18][19][20]. However, it is critical to mention that our current understanding of the EPR effect is mostly based on animal data, especially from fast-growing xenograft models in mice, which have been used most to explain the EPR effect. Experimental data on EPR effectiveness in patients should be further accumulated for the successful clinical use of nanomedicine. \n\nConsequently, the delivery of an EPR-dependent nanomedicine can be further enhanced to maximize its therapeutic efficacy [21,22]. Although the benefits of nanomedicine in principle surpass the efficacy of standard therapeutics, its therapeutic efficacy is not always satisfactory because if it is largely influenced by the heterogeneity of the intensity of the EPR effect [23][24][25]. This unsatisfactory therapeutic outcome in mice and humans requires novel approaches to improve the EPR effect by additional different strategies (Figure 1).",

[26] These particles can be modified with various types of materials including biomolecules. Altering the organizations of atoms can modify the properties of nanoparticles, such as elasticity, plasticity, strength, and conductivity. \n\nNanoparticle systems have unique properties that allow for both passive and active targeting of tumors. [27] umor neovasculature has abnormal architecture and vessels are highly permeable. The tumor mass has also poor lymphatic drainage, allowing for accumulation of macromolecules greater than approximately 40 kDa within its microenvironment. Nanoparticles utilize this feature, known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, to target solid tumors. The ideal size range to benefit from the EPR effect is between 10 and 200 nm. Outside this range, smaller particles will be cleared by the kidney, preventing accumulation within the tumor site, while larger particles will not adequately penetrate the tumor vasculature and interstitial space. However, some clinical trials have not shown the efficacy of the EPR effect. [28] One possible cause of EPR effect failure could be increased interstitial pressure in the tumor microenvironment. It has also been assumed that the EPR effect cannot be employed after an operation. Attempts have been made to increase the efficiency of the EPR effect by induction of hypertension, by repairing the abnormal vasculature, or by targeting of perivascular cells. [28]",

            "text": "The normal vasculature is impermeable to molecules of size > 2-4 nm, whereas tumors have leaky vasculature facilitating the retention of NPs in the circulation due to its high density associated outer defective porous vasculature structure. In addition, the poor lymphatic drainage facilitates the stagnation of NPs within the neoplastic environment which is also an extra benefit of EPR effect [16]. Hence, passive targeting takes the advantages of the leaky vasculature as well as tumor microenvironment and helps drugs to expose directly at the tumor tissue bypassing systemic metabolism [17]. Ligand mediated active targeting could also utilize EPR effect to cross the vascular barrier [18]. Thus, EPR effect has become one of the principle considerations for the development of targeted drug delivery system. \n\nHowever, EPR effect is involved with several challenges since macromolecules or NPs can invade into the tumor tissue only if they can avoid the RES and renal clearance. A drug should remain at least 6 hours in the circulation to get accumulated into the neoplastic tissues via EPR effect [19]. EPR effect was reported unsuccessful to maintain stable circulation of NPs in the bloodstream due to size restrictions of the tumor fenestrations. The development of therapeutic nanocarriers with enhanced retention time is still under practical challenge, particularly in clinical tumors, where the blood vessel morphology is very different than that of mice model used in preclinical studies. This could limit the intratumoral distribution of NPs [20]. In addition, the blunt localization and accessibility of drug carriers into the tumor might not be feasible in case of certain tumors (lung cancer). The high interstitial pressure of solid tumors does not allow homogenous distribution of drugs in the tumor. The advantages of passive targeting serve as a dilemma because EPR effect is unable to promote the uptake of NPs by target cells. In parallel, the ability of an encapsulated drug to reach their pharmacological target should also be considered. Although, passive targeting is promoting drug entry into the tumor tissue, material composition, size, and surface properties are also important determinant factors in this matter.",

            "text": "Tumor is a disease formed by abnormal cell proliferation, with the most prominent feature being mass formation in the body. Finding new drug delivery technology is an urgent task to improve the efficiency of tumor therapy [1]. Although a variety of treatments (such as surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) have been created to enhance clinical cancer treatment, the effects of treatment on tumor recurrence and metastasis are still unsatisfactory [2]. When a patient has an invasive malignant tumor or undergoes a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), local treatment may not suffice, and chemotherapy can be more effective [3]. However, the toxicity and side effects, poor solubility, poor stability, and limited specificity of most chemotherapy drugs seriously limit the prospects for continued application and favorable outcomes of conventional chemotherapy drugs. With the continuous advancement in the precision of diagnosis and specificity of treatment, nanocarriers (NCs) have emerged as a promising modality in medicine, assisting in the delivery of traditional chemotherapy drugs to overcome limitations in clinical practice or for research studies. Numerous studies have shown that they have the potential to improve anticancer efficacy and reduce drug side effects [4][5][6]. \n\nDelivering drugs to specific sites of lesions is one of the major challenges of chemotherapy [7]. NCs that can comprehensively control the distribution of drugs in vivo in space, time, and dose have become a research hotspot [8]. NCs can be loaded with one or more drugs and delivered to tumors through active or passive targeting mechanisms. These pathways enable drugs to accumulate in tumor tissues and reduce the harmful effects of the drugs [9]. However, due to the different delivery challenges and complex tumor microenvironments (TME) faced by each drug form or technology, it is difficult to overcome all obstacles in the design of NCs, making translation of NCs into clinical practice very difficult [10]. \n\nIdeal NCs need to achieve precise drug delivery and local disease control with minimal systemic toxicity [11]. Maeda and colleagues discovered the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) phenomenon, which enables the retention and accumulation of NCs at tumor sites [12,13].",

            "text": "Over the past decades, there have been several advances and successes in cancer treatments, primarily due to an improved understanding of carcinogenesis processes, cell biology, and tumor microenvironment (25). However, cancer is a complex disease; therefore, many types of cancer still have a high fatality rate. Targeted drug delivery in this context is highly critical for improving the survival rates of cancer patients with information that can ensure the accurate delivery of anticancer drugs (26). In addition, drug targeting helps to define the selective release of cancer drugs at the specific tumor site with a higher pharmacological impact. Two targeting methods can be achieved using NPs: active and passive (27). In passive targeting, localization of NPs is best achieved for the organ of interest within the tumor microenvironment, whereas active targeting allows for identifying the uptake levels of NPs by the tumor cells (28) (see Figure 2). \n\nRecent advances have enabled personalized treatments for individual patients, where the targeted cancer therapies are categorized as monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, and immunotoxins (29). Targeted cancer therapies aim to address some of the challenges of conventional chemotherapy, where the targeted drugs impact the rapidly developing cancer cells and specific normal cells such as intestinal epithelium. In this regard, targeted drug delivery focuses on using pharmacological agents that inhibit cell growth and cell death, thereby restricting cancer metastasis. In addition, rather than focusing on molecular changes, targeted cancer therapies interfere with the protein interactions responsible for tumorigenesis (29). \n\nThe enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is one of the primary considerations for effective drug delivery to tumor tissues. The EPR effect is a unique feature associated with tumor cells that are considered a significant milestone in tumor targeting with chemotherapy. Therefore, this EPR effect has become essential in anticancer drug development and various drug design and delivery strategies using macromolecule agents, molecular imaging, antibody therapy, liposomes, and protein-polymer conjugates, respectively (17, 30). However, there are serious disputes about the impact of EPR when using NPs (31).",

This effect may influence the optimal dosing regimen for CRLX101 and other cyclodextrin-based therapies, as higher drug concentrations in the tumor tissue could lead to increased efficacy and reduced systemic toxicity [59]. This observation is echoed in a review by Maeda et al. [60], where they discuss the impact of the EPR effect on nanoparticle drug delivery and how it might be leveraged to improve treatment outcomes. \n\nMoreover, it is increasingly recognized that specific tumor characteristics, such as molecular and genetic profiles, could influence the response to treatment and, consequently, the optimal dosing regimen [61]. For instance, a study by Boehnke et al. [62] highlighted the role of tumor genetics in determining the efficacy of nanoparticle-based drugs. They found that tumors with certain genetic profiles were more likely to respond to nanoparticle-based therapies, suggesting that a personalized approach to treatment could improve outcomes for patients. As such, it becomes imperative to consider individual patient factors and tumor characteristics when determining the most appropriate dosing strategy for CRLX101.",

However, the delivery of nano-sized agents into cancer tissue is problematic because it mostly relies on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect that depends on the leaky nature of the tumor vasculature and the prolonged circulation of nano-sized agents, allowing slow but uneven accumulation in the tumor bed. Delivery of nano-sized agents is dependent on several factors that influence the EPR effect; 1. Regional blood flow to the tumor, 2. Permeability of the tumor vasculature, 3. Structural barriers imposed by perivascular tumor cells and extracellular matrix, 4. Intratumoral pressure. In this review, these factors will be described and methods to enhance nano-agent delivery will be reviewed.",

            "text": "Several research groups demonstrated the exceptional potential of AgNPs as anticancer agents; however, they have also emphasized that the toxic behavior of these nanomaterials renders them somewhat similar to conventional chemotherapy drugs. Nevertheless, the main difference between AgNPs and conventional small molecular drugs lies within the \"nano\" nature of AgNPs, which ultimately helps to reduce the severity of undesired side effects. As a result of this nano-feature, AgNPs can be targeted either passively or actively to the tumor tissues, where they can, thus, accumulate in high concentrations (Figure 2). Passive accumulation is based on the unique architecture of the tumor tissue, where neo-angiogenesis leads to an atypical endothelial layer and to fenestrated vasculature, which together with the impaired lymphatic drainage guides the penetration and accumulation of nano-sized materials within the cancerous tissues [26]. This phenomenon is called the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which has been exploited for drug design in the nanomedicine field [27]. It has also been proposed that shape, size, and capping materials applied on the surface of the nanoparticles can help to optimize their passive accumulation. We have to note, however, that these observations have been established mostly using xenograft models, where the tissue structure is known to be different from that of naturally developing human tumors [28]. For instance, it has been found that nanomedicine accumulation in the tumors is more efficient in small animal xenograft models than in naturally occurring tumors in patients [29,30]. However, evidence suggests that EPR effect drives drug accumulation in tumors growing in patients as well, but its efficacy heavily varies on the specific anatomical features of the given tumor [31]. Therefore, while the EPR effect may act as a decisive concept upon nanoparticle tumor-targeting, it must be regarded cautiously as it has become a focus of debate recently. \n\nAs an alternative to passive targeting, active targeting strategies have been proposed to be viable approaches to increase the cancer specificity of silver nanoparticles.",

The steady release of Etop from GNPs could be attributed to lysosomal degradation and acidic tumor environment.

            "text": "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect was defined by Matsumura and Maeda as an intratumoral phenomenon resulting from the increased leakiness of newly forming tumor vessels as well as decreased lymphatic drainage. 1 Therapy based on the EPR effect has not been the expected success, 2 possibly due to individual patient EPR variations, and patient stratification might be central to fully exploit the therapeutic potential of liposomal drugs. 4][5][6][7][8] We have performed extensive studies of the EPR effect using a radiolabeled 64 Cu-liposome formulation. 9 Based on PET/CT imaging of spontaneous malignant tumors in canine cancer patients, we have demonstrated that the EPR-effect is not ubiquitous, even for tumors with a similar histopathology. 10 Molecular imaging techniques, such as 64 Cu-liposome PET/CT, could potentially serve as the basis for selecting patients with a high EPR effect for liposome based chemotherapy (the theranostic principle), as has already been shown clinically. 7 This has a large potential for improving the response rates to liposomal chemotherapy. 11 However, for liposomes to accumulate via the EPR effect in solid tumors, a long circulating half-life is mandatory. This is generally achieved by decorating liposomes with varying levels and lengths of polyethylene glycol (PEG), a method known as PEGylation. 12 Unfortunately, PEG decoration has the ability to induce the formation of anti-PEG IgM antibodies. 13 Anti-PEG antibody formation is highly problematic for subsequent administrations of PEGylated liposomes, as it leads to a rapid liposome clearance, and thereby eliminates the possibility to achieve EPR dependent tumor accumulation. This problem has been termed \"the accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon\" and is well described in experimental animals. 14 Most PEGylated liposomes containing chemotherapeutics do not seem to induce anti-PEG antibodies, probably because the B-cells responsible for producing anti-PEG antibodies do not survive exposure to liposomal chemotherapy. 15,16",

            "text": "Passive targeting of nanoparticles refers to the passive accumulation of nanoparticles in the tumor tissue, which is generally attributed to the enhanced permeability and retention effect.The concept of EPR was first introduced more than 30 years ago when Maeda and colleagues found that certain macromolecules accumulate preferentially in the tumor tissue [4].EPR is mainly the result of leakiness of the discontinuous endothelium of angiogenic tumor vasculature combined with defective lymphatic drainage of the tumor matrix, which facilitates the extravasation and accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor.It has been shown that the number of nanoparticles accumulated in tumor tissue may be 10-200 times higher than in normal tissue as a result of EPR.The EPR effect is considered to be the primary element to improve the efficacy and safety of nanotherapeutics.In fact, most of the nanomedicines marketed thus far base their increased therapeutic index mainly on the EPR effect [5].\n\nNevertheless, the EPR effect alone is insufficient for adequate nanoparticle accumulation, particularly in some circumstances.The EPR effect is not effective for some cancers because of tumor heterogeneity and cancer stage, is even not applicable to some types of cancers, and it is not effective in some patients because of individual differences.A survey of the literature in this area from 2005 to 2015 that included 232 data sets showed that only a median of 0.7% of the systemically administered nanoparticle dose could reach the solid tumor in mouse models [6]; multivariate analysis of the pertinent parameters indicated that tumor type, tumor model, and nanomaterial properties are the major factors to affect the delivery efficiency of the nanoparticles.Research also found that the high interstitial fluid pressure of tumor tissue impedes the extravasation of nanoparticles [7]; some particles that have entered the tumor intercellular space via EPR effect may be forced back into the blood circulation because of the high fluid pressure within the tumor interstitium.It is manifest that blood cancers, very early stage tumors, and small metastasized cancers do not have or have only insignificant EPR effect.",

            "text": "Nanotechnology has been considered a promising therapeutic tool to control cancer since NPs, due to their physicochemical characteristics, can deliver a drug to a specific target increasing its circulating half-life and conserving its stability and solubility, reducing side effects. (Shi et al., 2017). Moreover, NPs increase therapeutic molecule (DNA, mRNA, siRNA, and proteins) accumulation and tumor penetration, cellular internalization, and intracellular release. Furthermore, a nanocarrier can also facilitate drug transit through epithelial-endothelial surfaces like the blood-brain barrier. Likewise, some NPs such as AuNPs, GO, and IONPs have therapeutic effects. \n\nOn the other hand, the most frequent route of nanotreatments administration is intravenous, which offers advantages and disadvantages. For instance, NPs administrated intravenously can be delivered to the tumor by passive, active, or both mechanisms. Passive targeting takes advantage of the pathophysiological characteristics of the solid tumor vasculature associated with the disorganized and leaky tumor vascularization caused by the angiogenesis process and poor lymphatic drainage that increases permeability and retention of macromolecules, including NPs. Therefore, due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, large NPs can accumulate and remain in tumor tissue (Shi et al., 2017). Moreover, the EPR effect allows the delivery of NPs conjugated with cytotoxic drugs to tumor tissue reducing toxic effects. However, the EPR effect may vary from patient to patient, type of tumor, and in the same tumor over time since angiogenesis is a dynamic process constantly changing the tumor vasculature. Likewise, inflammatory molecules and proangiogenic factors (IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, proteases [MMP-9], and vascular endothelial growth factors [VEGFs]) can enhance the EPR effect (Wu, 2021). In addition, characteristics such as size, shape (filomicelles, cylindrical, ellipsoidal, or discoidal), and negative or neutral surface charges must be considered while designing NPs to exploit EPR effect therapeutic benefits in cancer treatment.",

For passive targeting via the EPR effect, several criteria must be met. First, the macromolecular carrier must remain in systemic circulation for a considerable length of time because the accumulation at the tumor site via the EPR effect is a time-dependent occurrence [18]. Second, macromolecular carriers must possess critical quality attributes such as: (i) appropriate size to allow extravasation and accumulation in tumors via the wide fenestrations found only in tumor blood supply; (ii) an ideal surface charge to avoid opsonin aggregation; (iii) an optimum surface chemistry that allows tissue penetration; (iv) stability of macromolecule integrity to avoid nonspecific release; and (v) biocompatibility [24].",

            "text": "Successful delivery of therapeutic agents (e.g., chemotherapeutic drugs, nucleic acids, antibodies, etc.) to the target site is the major challenge for any disease treatment, including cancer. Nanoformulation of the therapeutic agents, e.g., nanomedicine, can improve their solubility, pharmacokinetics, disease-targeting capacities, and drug release manners, thus enhancing delivery efficiency [1]. Cancer nanomedicines are designed to passively target tumor tissues by the enhanced pearmeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is the gold standard principle of nanoparticle-based cancer drug delivery. Unfortunately, the current EPR-based cancer nanomedicines have failed to achieve high therapeutic efficacy in patients [2]. Although over twenty nanoformulations have been approved for clinical use, including Doxil (liposomal doxorubicin), Abraxane (albumin-bound paclitaxel), and Onivyde (liposomal irinotecan), they only alleviate some adverse effects but cannot improve patient survival [3]. A meta-analysis study showed that less than 1% of the administrated nanoparticles could be delivered to the tumor tissues [4]. The heterogeneous EPR effect and complex biological barriers have greatly hindered the delivery of cancer nanomedicines into tumors and resulted in limited therapeutic efficiency. Thus, it is highly requisite and urgent to develop innovative nanocarriers with integrated and synchronized functions for efficient cancer drug delivery. \n\nThe cancer drug delivery process comprises the following steps, including (1) circulation in the blood compartment, (2) extravasation from the tumor vasculature into the extracellular matrix, (3) penetration into the tumor parenchyma, (4) entry into tumor cells, (5) transport to the subcellular targets, and (6) drug release [5]. To achieve high delivery efficiency, nanomedicines are required to have different or even opposite properties in each step.",

            "text": "The medical community has recently sought alternative therapies that improve selective toxicity against cancer cells, while decreasing side effects. Nano-biotechnology, defined as biomedical applications of nano-sized systems, is a rapidly developing area within nanotechnology (5). Nanoparticles, such as liposomes, allow unique interaction with biological systems at the molecular level. They can also facilitate important advances in detection, diagnosis, and treatment of human cancers and have led to a new discipline of nano-biotechnology, called nano-oncology. Nanoparticles are being actively developed for tumor imaging in vivo, biomolecular profiling of cancer biomarkers, and targeted drug delivery (6)(7)(8). \n\nGrowing solid tumors have capillaries with increased permeability as a result of the disease process (e.g., tumor angiogenesis). Pore diameters in these capillaries can range from 100 to 800 nm. Drug-containing liposomes that have diameters in the range of approximately 50-200 nm are small enough to extravasate from the blood into the tumor interstitial space through these pores (9). Normal tissues contain capillaries with tight junctions that are impermeable to liposomes and other particles of this diameter. This differential accumulation and penetration of liposomal drugs in tumor tissues relative to normal cells is the basis for the increased tumor specificity of liposomal drugs relative to free drugs. In addition, due to impaired and defective lymphatic vessels, tumors lack lymphatic drainage and therefore there is low clearance of the extravasated liposomes from tumors. Thus, this liposome-mediated passive targeting can result in increases in drug concentrations within solid tumors of several-fold relative to those obtained with free drugs. This phenomenon has been termed the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) (10)(11)(12). This mechanism of action of the liposomal drugs is thought to be due to sustained release of drug from the liposomes and diffusion of the released drug throughout the tumor interstitial fluid, with subsequent uptake of the released drug by tumor cells. \n\nAt present, however, EPR effect has been measured mostly, if not exclusively, in implanted tumors with limited data on EPR in metastatic lesions.",

            "text": "Poorly vascularized tumor regions and high interstitial fluid pressure can limit drug penetration, resulting in uneven distribution of therapeutic agents. To overcome these challenges, researchers are optimizing the design of nanoparticles and exploring vaso-modulating agents to improve drug delivery efficiency. Combining the EPR effect with active targeting strategies, in which ligands on nanoparticles are bound to specific tumor markers, further increases precision. Despite its limitations, the EPR effect remains a cornerstone of nanomedicine and targeted cancer therapies, offering a way to improve the efficacy and safety of cancer treatments [36][37][38]. Tumor angiogenesis triggered by accelerated growth leads to disorganized, highly permeable blood vessels that facilitate extravasation and accumulation of nanoparticles (10-200 nm) in the tumor interstitial spaces [39][40][41][42]. Impaired lymphatic drainage increases retention and prolongs drug concentration at the tumor. Successful utilization of the EPR effect requires careful nanoparticle design. The ideal size prevents premature elimination by renal filtration or absorption by the mononuclear phagocyte system [43,44]. Shape optimization, including spherical or rod-shaped nanoparticles, affects biodistribution and tumor infiltration, while surface modifications such as PEGylation improve circulation time and evade immune recognition [45,46]. Controlled release mechanisms, such as pH-sensitive or enzyme-responsive systems, enhance targeted efficacy. Passive targeting offers advantages such as selective drug accumulation, reduced systemic toxicity, broad applicability to various solid tumors, and simpler development processes than active targeting based on ligand receptors [28,47]. Nevertheless, limitations such as variability of the EPR effect, obstacles such as dense extracellular matrix, increased interstitial pressure, and reduced efficacy in non-solid tumors pose significant problems. Advanced techniques such as tumor priming, passive and active targeting integration, and stimuli-responsive nanoparticles are currently being investigated to overcome these challenges [48,49]. Although passive targeting is essential for the delivery of nanoparticles to tumors, ongoing advances in nanoparticle development and the incorporation of tumor biology are critical to overcoming these difficulties and expanding their application in cancer treatment.",

These changes are accompanied by an increase of permeability mediators such as bradykinin, nitric oxide and prostaglandins. A phenomenon observed to be universal in solid tumors is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect for lipid and macromolecular agents. Its principal mechanism is to enhance vascular permeability to maintain adequate supply of nutrients and oxygen for tumor growth. This offers huge opportunities for more selective targeting of lipid-or polymer-conjugated anticancer drugs, such as SMANCS (a conjugate of neocarzinostatin and poly (styrene-co-maleic acid) and PK-1(PK1 is a synthetic N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide copolymerdoxorubicin (dox) conjugate) to the tumor. 46,47 Its basic characteristic effects are in areas for the modulation and improvement of the delivery of macromolecular drugs to the tumor. 48,49 e \"EPR effect\" and passage of NPs to the tumor NPs selectively accumulate in tumor tissues by a purely physical phenomenon called EPR effect. At the early stages of tumor development, the lack of blood vessels results in the dependence of the growing tumor on its surrounding tissues for nutrients such as glucose and oxygen. Even then, the tumor core does not receive enough nutrients. This situation stimulates growth of new blood vessels that can carry the required oxygen and nutrients to the tumor for its rapid growth and replication. Because of the rapid growth of the blood capillaries, a process called angiogenesis, the new blood capillaries have a defective vasculature with large number of wide openings between the epithelial cells than healthy blood vessels and lack of the normal basement membrane. The gap size varies depending on the stage of development of the tumor and generally range from a few hundred nanometers to a few microns. In contrast, the pores of normal blood vessels are only 2-6 nm.",

            "text": "Since Matsumura and Maeda [67] reported on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect for the delivery of macromolecules in cancer therapy, there has been a prevailing philosophy to design nanomedicines for cancer imaging and treatment characterized by nanoparticles with a spherical shape, an average diameter of 100 nm, and a surface mostly decorated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains [67,68]. Particularly, Maeda et al. [69,70] observed in preclinical in vivo models that endothelial cells of tumor vessels are not tightly connected but they rather exhibit irregular fenestrations ranging in size from several tens up to a few hundreds of nanometers. This peculiar characteristic has stimulated scientists in developing a plethora of blood-borne spherical nanoparticles sufficiently small to pass through these fenestrations and be retained within the diseased tissue. This variety of nanoparticles relies on self-assembly and colloidal interactions and differ in their material compositions, sizes, and surface properties. Specifically, both organic (e.g., lipids, polymers, block copolymers), and nonorganic (e.g., iron oxide, gold, silver) materials have been employed [71][72][73]. Nanoparticle surfaces have been modified with different coatings, including lipids, stealth polymer chains that enhance particle blood longevity, and a variety of moieties for recognizing specific cancer cell molecules enabling what is known as active targeting [74][75][76][77][78].\n\nIndeed, the US food and Drug Administration approved the first EPR-dependent nano-drug, known as Doxil, in 1995, putting in the spotlight nanotechnology and its benefits in the fight against cancer [79]. However, the universal utility of the EPR effect in the fight against cancer has recently been re-scrutinized, and alternative delivery strategies are necessary to facilitate the delivery of therapeutics to tumors [80][81][82]. Particularly, recent studies have shown that the EPR effects might not be as clinically relevant as it is in mice, as the size of the irregular vascular fenestrations and their density depend on the type and the stage",

            "text": "The use of nanomedicine for cancer treatment takes advantage of its preferential accumulation in tumors owing to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The development of cancer nanomedicine has promised highly effective treatment options unprecedented by standard therapeutics. However, the therapeutic efficacy of passively targeted nanomedicine is not always satisfactory because it is largely influenced by the heterogeneity of the intensity of the EPR effect exhibited within a tumor, at different stages of a tumor, and among individual tumors. In addition, limited data on EPR effectiveness in human hinders further clinical translation of nanomedicine. This unsatisfactory therapeutic outcome in mice and humans necessitates novel approaches to improve the EPR effect. This review focuses on current attempts at overcoming the limitations of traditional EPR-dependent nanomedicine by incorporating supplementary strategies, such as additional molecular targeting, physical alteration, or physiological remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. This review will provide valuable insight to researchers who seek to overcome the limitations of relying on the EPR effect alone in cancer nanomedicine and go \u201cbeyond the EPR effect\u201d.",

            "text": "Blood vessels increase their permeability when affected by solid tumors or by inflammatory or infectious processes [213]. The vessels become leaky, thus allowing particles to cross the wall and permeate the interstitial space. The size of the particles can vary from 10\u2212500 nm, thus including liposomes or micelles. The nature of the disease affects the porosity of the vasculature, allowing for control over diffusion of the drug; the choice of a properly sized carrier would allow the drug to extravasate from the blood vessel ( Figure 8). Moreover, tumor cells lack an effective lymphatic drainage system. Both aspects facilitate structures with a size up to approximately 200 nm to accumulate in tumor tissue. Maeda and co-workers named this phenomenon \"Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect\" and widely investigated this method as a targeting solution for cancer, especially when using macromolecular drugs [214][215][216][217][218][219][220]. Figure 8. Illustration of the EPR effect. Only particles smaller than the cut-off size can permeate the vessel walls and extravasate to the tissues, eventually resulting in enhanced retention and accumulation of particles due to slow lymphatic clearance.\n\nTo exploit this targeting method, drug carriers should circulate in blood long enough to provide acceptable accumulation of the active molecule in the area of interest. PEG-coated liposomes loaded with highly toxic anticancer drugs such as anthracyclines circulate for a long time in the blood flow, thus exerting a positive effect in cancer therapy with reduced side effects [221]. The PEG coating inhibits liposome uptake by the reticuloendothelial system and significantly extends liposome residence time in the bloodstream. Polyphosphazenes-platinum (II) conjugates afford high tumor selectivity by EPR effect,allowing for controlled release of the active platinum moiety, avoiding problems due to unfavorable pharmacokinetics and short circulation time of platinum-based anticancer drugs [222]. Mouse model studies showed how the EPR effect is responsible for the accumulation of PEGylated anti-inflammatory antibody in inflamed joints after intravenous administration [223",

            "text": "Maeda and Matsumura reported that proteins and nanoparticles can accumulate in the tumor environment due to the leaky neovascular system and immature lymphatic system-the so-called enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [60,61]. However, several barriers associated with the tumor microenvironment, including abnormal vasculature, high interstitial fluid pressure, tumor-cell density, and abnormal stromal matrix, limit the EPR effect and/or inhibit the permeability of nano-drugs in the cancer tissues [77,78]. Therefore, modulating the blood flow and vasculature at the tumor site is one of the key factors for the improvement of the EPR effect. As described above, the co-delivery of the NO donor with anticancer drugs significantly enhances the efficacy of cancer treatment via the MDR inhibitory effect of NO, including the inhibition of P-gp expression and HIF-1 activation. \n\nAnother important characteristic of the NO molecule is \"angiogenesis\", which increases the tumoral blood flow and vascular dilation as described above. NO-triggered improvement of the angiogenesis of the tumor environment was studied in order to enhance the EPR effect [79]. Maeda and co-workers reported that several NO generators-such as nitroglycerin, hydroxyurea, and L-Arg-significantly enhanced tumor accumulation of the tested nanomedicines in a mouse model of implanted colon cancer and sarcoma [80]. It is interesting to note that there was no increase in nanoparticle accumulation in the other normal tissues. This is probably due to the difference in vascular structures between intra-tumoral and normal tissue regions. Weidensteiner et al. applied the NO donor JS-K [O(2)-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) 1-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate] to a cerebral blood vessel.",

            "text": "The team also outlined the fundamental principles of nanomedicine-based combined treatments and recent clinical advancements in integrating nanomedicine therapy with photodynamics and immunotherapy (Shi et al., 2020). Additionally, the EPR effect is modulated by several in vivo factors, including EPR enhancers such as AT-II (vasoconstrictor), peroxynitrite (free radical that affects vascular endothelial integrity), nitroglycerin (nitric oxide-releasing agent), and vascular permeability promoters like bradykinin, prostaglandins, VEGF, and other inflammatory cytokines. These substances enhance the EPR effect by raising vascular permeability and macromolecular extravasation (Li et al., 2017). The EPR effect of nanomedicines has been found to be influenced by factors such as vascular injury, tumor density, and blood flow. Within the tumor tissue, the proliferation of cancer cells creates significant pressure, which compresses the lymphatic and vascular systems. This compression leads to vascular failure and causes the concentration of functional lymphatics and blood vessels on both sides of the tumor. The distribution of vasculature within the tumor is uneven, with greater unevenness from the periphery to the center, further hindering the permeability of nanomedicines (Munir, 2022). To address this issue, there is a need to enhance EPR-based drug delivery by modifying tumor vasculature, angiogenesis, vascular structure, blood flow, etc. Subhan et al. (2023) utilized a combination therapy of angiogenesis inhibitors and chemotherapy to normalize the vascular system and enhance the effectiveness of EPR effect-mediated drug delivery in cancer therapy. Summarily, while the EPR effect poorly promotes nanomedicine uptake by tumour cells and has a relatively inefficient nanomedicine delivery, active targeting can more efficiently deliver nanomedicines to tumour tissues in vivo. While the EPR effect is a foundational concept enabling selective nanoparticle accumulation in tumor tissue, its efficacy can be inconsistent due to biological heterogeneity among tumor types and within the tumor microenvironment.",

            "text": "The current enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)-based approved nanomedicines have had little impact in terms of prolongation of overall survival in patients with cancer. For example, the two Phase III trials comparing Doxil\u00ae, the first nanomedicine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, with free doxorubicin did not find an actual translation of the EPR effect into a statistically significant increase in overall survival but did show less cardiotoxicity. In the current work, we used a two-factor factorial experimental design with intraperitoneal versus intravenous delivery and nanomedicine versus free drug as factors to test our hypothesis that regional (intraperitoneal) delivery of nanomedicine may better increase survival when compared with systemic delivery. In this study, we demonstrate that bypassing, rather than exploiting, the EPR effect via intraperitoneal delivery of nanomedicine harboring a sustained-release function demonstrates dual pharmacokinetic advantages, producing more efficient tumor control and suppressing the expression of stemness markers, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis signals, and multidrug resistance in the tumor microenvironment. Metastases to vital organs (eg, lung, liver, and lymphatic system) are also better controlled by intraperitoneal delivery of nanomedicine than by standard systemic delivery of the corresponding free drug. Moreover, the intraperitoneal delivery of nanomedicine has the potential to replace hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy because it shows equal efficacy and lower toxicity. In terms of efficacy, exploiting the EPR effect may not be the best approach for developing a nanomedicine. Because intraperitoneal chemotherapy is a type of regional chemotherapy, the pharmaceutical industry might consider the regional delivery of nanomedicine as a valid alternative pathway to develop their nanomedicine(s) with the goal of better tumor control in the future.",

            "text": "The extent of the EPR effect varies between small animal tumors and human tumors by types and locations.To better utilize the EPR effect for human tumor therapy, the design of nanomedicine should be improved.\n\nSize and physical-chemical properties such as surface charge and spatial configuration are crucial for a drug to achieve the EPR effect.Studies using serial molecular sizes of HPMA copolymers in solid tumor animal models indicated that the threshold of macromolecular molecules (drugs) to be retained and accumulated in tumor tissue is above 40 kDa [38].Nanoparticles in the range of 100~200 nm are considered the optimal size for achieving the EPR effect in solid tumors while escaping the filtration traps of the liver and spleen [39].Negative or neutral surface charges are also important for achieving excellent plasma half-lives longer than several hours in circulation in order to be accumulated in tumor tissue.Particles in worm-like shapes such as ellipsoidal, cylindrical and discoidal shapes, or filomicelles, can achieve better accumulation results within tumors [40].Deformability and degradability are also important for a smarter drug to be released in the right environmental condition to execute a tumor-killing effect once it enters the tumor tissue [39,40].As an example, HPMA copolymer-conjugated pirarubicin achieved very promising clinical therapeutic results in a patient with stage IV prostate cancer with extensive metastasis [41].\n\nOn the other hand, the delivery of macromolecular drugs can be enhanced by temporarily modulating the EPR effect in the targeted tumor tissues, such as applying adjuvants like nitric oxide donors to enhance the EPR effect to facilitate the drug delivery into tumor tissue.As mentioned before, many other inflammatory factors involved in the EPR effect can be utilized to modulate the intensity of this effect to facilitate drug extravasation, accumulation, and penetration into tumor tissue [42][43][44][45][46].The EPR effect can also be markedly enhanced by photo-immunotherapy with antibody-photosensitizer conjugate pretreatment to achieve up to a 24-fold greater accumulation of nanomedicines in tumors.",

            "text": "Cancer treatment has been the first field, in the early 2000s, to benefit from the use of nanotechnology and in particular from the use of nanocarriers in order to improve the efficiency of the drug delivery minimizing side effects and maximizing treatment efficacy [24].The overall strategy is based on organ/cell-specific targeting which can be achieved not only by designing nanocarriers with specific features but also taking account of the specific target's characteristics.Cancer targeting has taken advantage of the well-established enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [25].In 1986, the concept of EPR stemmed from the observation that therapeutic macromolecules distributed and accumulated preferentially into the tumor interstitium, and this effect was attributed to the presence of fenestrations in the imperfect tumor blood vessels and to the poor lymphatic drainage in the tissue.Although subsequent research has continuously characterized the EPR effect with many other features which vary among patients and different types of tumors, increased permeability and retention remain the cornerstones of this phenomenon.Nonetheless, other factors affect the magnitude of the EPR, such as the extracellular matrix and its interaction with the extravasated objects [24].\n\nHence, while the EPR effect represents the main force driving passive targeting, these latter factors affecting the EPR effect are obstacles to an effective nanocarrier-based approach which can, in turn, become a precious ally for a successful strategy.In fact, active targeting is based on the recognition of a ligand by its target and can be used to ultimately refine tissue and cell specificity of nanocarriers.\n\n3.1.Cardiac Passive Targeting.Similarly to cancer research, that took advantage of the tumor's biological characteristics, cardiac passive targeting can also stem from heart anatomy and pathophysiology.\n\nThe adult heart is composed of several cell types [26] and almost all of them are involved in the development of fibrosis, the major pathophysiological process that leads to cardiac dysfunction and CHF [27].",

            "text": "Cancer is a leading cause of mortality, with 606,520 cancer-related deaths projected to occur in the United States in 2020 [1]. Despite recent advances in the fields of cancer diagnosis and therapy, the path to curative therapies remains littered with significant hurdles that must be overcome. Current treatment options, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, are invasive, painful, and often ineffective and imprecise, which result in acute and chronic side effects that negatively impact the patient's overall well-being [2]. Since Paul Ehrlich promoted the concept of a \"magic bullet' in the early 1900s, researchers have attempted to develop targeted platforms that can distinguish between cancer cells and the trillions of healthy cells in the body, and deliver a therapeutic drug dose to cancer cells without harming healthy cells [3]. The integration of nanotechnology and targeted drug delivery has opened potential avenues to achieve this goal. With high surface area to volume ratios and unique physiochemical properties, the architecture of nanoparticles allows optimization for the delivery of various imaging and therapeutic agents [4]. \n\nTargeting of nanoparticles to tumor sites can be achieved by several general methods: passive, active, or through externally applied forces, as shown in Figure 1 [5]. In passive targeting, nanoparticles selectively accumulate at the tumor site via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, a phenomenon utilized by several clinically-approved Ivyspring International Publisher drug nanoformulations including Doxil TM and Abraxane TM [6]. It has been suggested that the EPR effect arises due to a leaky vasculature (having pores of 100 nm to 2 \u00b5m in diameter) and poor lymphatic drainage in the tumor -two distinctive characteristics of some neoplastic tissues not present in normal tissues [7]. While numerous studies have attributed increased tumor accumulation to the EPR effect, it should be noted that less than 1% of administered nanoparticles accumulate in solid tumors [8], and the vast majority accumulate in other organs -primarily the liver, spleen, and lungs [9].",

            "text": "To accurately transport molecular probes containing paramagnetic substances into tumor tissues, and to achieve early diagnosis and even combined treatment in the body, the main challenges are as follows: (1) making probes that are concentrated in the tumor site, and (2) retaining and avoiding the impact of blood flow. The traditional delivery strategy faces a series of abnormal vascular-system problems in solid tumors such as a large number of new lymphatic vessels and blood vessels, ineffective lymphatic drainage, high permeability and reflux disorder [29,30]. The abnormal structure can lead to the long-term accumulation of drugs in tumors [31,32], a phenomenon that was named the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) by Gerlowski et al. in 1986 [33,34]. Based on these properties, passive drug delivery can be achieved [35]. This passive delivery strategy has become a major player in recent decades for cancer treatments. Its primary advantage is its simplifying of the operation. As passive nanodrug administration is mainly based on differences between the physiological qualities of the liver and the pathological aspects of HCC, the biocompatibility surface modification of nanodrugs needs to be considered to ensure that they can participate in the blood circulation for as long as possible and eventually reach the tumor site, rather than being swallowed by the reticuloendothelial system [36]. However, the disadvantages of passive drug delivery cannot be overlooked. Firstly, the whole process depends largely on the EPR effect of the tumor itself. If the EPR effect of the tumor is not clear, this method becomes ineffective. Secondly, the permeability of each part of the whole tumor is not uniform, making drug distribution over the whole tumor-tissue area difficult, which may lead to long-term recurrence due to tumor residue. Thirdly, nanodrugs may remain deposited in certain natural liver tissues, thereby reducing therapy efficacy [35] and making the entire treatment process difficult to control. Finally, the absence of targeting particularly effective HCC cells leads to the limited internalization of cancer cells [36]. \n\nAnother delivery strategy is active targeted delivery, which is discussed in this review.",

            "text": "Tumors that grow more than 1-2 mm require blood vasculature for their nourishment supply. Such vasculature is often leaky and disorganized [107]. Tumor cells secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other growth factors, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), bradykinin (BK), prostaglandins (PGs), and nitric oxide (NO), which promote surrounding endothelial cells for angiogenesis [108][109][110][111]. This leads to active accumulation of nanocarriers in the tumor site and subsequent release of payload due to leaky vasculature and lower lymphatic drainage. This phenomenon is called the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, first discovered by Matsumura and Maeda [112]. Exploiting the EPR-effect, nanocarriers can attain high drug concentrations at the tumor site and reduce toxic effects of the chemotherapy drugs on other organs. Nearly all types of nanocarriers, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, dendrimers encapsulating small molecules, proteins, peptides, and nucleotides, are capable of achieving the EPR effect [113,114]. Nanoparticles can accomplish sustained drug release at tumor tissue without overburdening the cells with large doses of chemotherapy. This passive targeting strategy can help to overcome MDR, commonly seen in resistant cancer cells [115,116]. Table 1 summarizes passive drug targeting-based nanomedicines currently undergoing evaluation [25]. Figure 4A illustrates passive drug delivery by the EPR effect [25].",

            "text": "Although cancer cell proliferation was significantly slowed down in the FA-F-127/F-68-TPL and TPL groups, necrotic lesions were also commonly observed in the tumor tissues of both groups, which may be mainly to the drug inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. With small tumor size, blood vessels have not yet formed, or the tumor necrosis center has no blood vessels, and the EPR effect of nanomaterials does not exist [62]. The EPR effect is more significant only in tumors with a volume >100 mm 3 [59]. Thus, the EPR effect is stronger with abundant blood vessels within the tumor. Therefore, the EPR effect will be weakened if tumor angiogenesis is inhibited. So far, almost all nanomedicine designs have relied on the high permeability of tumor blood vessels to enter the tumor matrix, i.e., targeted delivery relying on the EPR effect [59]. However, most antitumor drugs have inhibitory effects on tumor angiogenesis, which will become a difficult obstacle to overcome for effective targeted drug delivery. TPL can inhibit tumor angiogenesis, thereby affecting its EPR-dependent targeted delivery, which may be the main reason why the antitumor effect of FA-F-127/F-68-TPL in animal experiments is not significantly different from that of the naked drug TPL.

            "text": "It is generally believed that the anatomy and pathophysiology of solid tumors differ from that of normal tissue. For example, solid tumors have a high blood vessel density to meet the nutrition and oxygen required by tumor cells growth. Furthermore, the tumor lacks functional lymphatic vessels and the gap between tumor endothelial cells is relatively large, which can extravasate or retain macromolecular drugs. The phenomenon that makes nanoparticles accumulate in tumor cells is called the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [14][15][16]. \n\nThe discovery of this phenomenon has promoted the emergence of passive targeting nanoparticles, which can target tumors through the EPR effect. In research, oxaliplatin was encapsulated into N, O-carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles by ionic crosslinking, and resveratrol was encapsulated into them by emulsification crosslinking. The particle size of the former was about 190.0 nm and that of the latter was about 164.2 nm. The nanoparticles enhanced the solubility, stability, and EPR effect of oxaliplatin and resveratrol, showing stronger anti-CRC activity in subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice compared to the free drug [17]. \n\nHowever, according to research findings, nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm are filtered out by the kidneys, and particles larger than 100 nm are captured by the liver, so the ideal nanoparticles should be between 10 nm and 100 nm in size, which can circulate for a long time to increase the possibility of uptake by tumors [18]. Moreover, Anitha et al. [19] mentioned that the degree of vascularization in CRC is low. It can be seen that there are controversies about the EPR effect in CRC. In recent years, scientists have gradually realized that the tumor-targeting mediated by EPR is highly heterogeneous. Hence, it is necessary to enhance the targeting ability of nanoparticles based on EPR by combining them with other targeting mechanisms [20,21].",

            "text": "cells.\n\nDrug delivery systems with liposomes and nanoparticles take advantage of the fact that cancers particularly express an imbalance in vascular permeability factors such as nitric oxide, bradykinin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [5][6][7] ultimately causing an over-expression of these vascular permeability factors that lead to increased vascular permeability and tortuous vasculature within the tumor bed [8]. This is the basis of the central tenet of nanoparticle therapeutics, the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effectwhich describes the property that molecules of certain sizes, such as liposomes, are able to accumulate in tumor tissue much more readily than normal tissue [9]. The over-expression of vascular permeability factors and development of tortuous vessels with poorly aligned endothelial cells give way to fenestrations that lead to abnormal molecular and fluid transport dynamics, allowing for a system of passive targeting of the tumor bed. In addition,a lack of effective tumor lymphatic drainage seen within solid tumors may, contribute to the EPR effect by preventing clearance of the liposomes leading to their accumulation [10,11]. This unique phenomenon was initially applied in clinical radiology with gallium scintigraphy (Gallium 67 scan) in the diagnosis of solid tumors and areas of inflammation and now is being applied to cancer treatment. More recently, however, it has been noted that macromolecules, generally defined as greater than 40kDa, have faired better in terms of retention within the tumor bed when compared to low-molecular-weight substances. Low-molecular-weight substances, instead of being retained by the solid tumor, were returned to circulation by simple diffusion into the bloodstream [11,12]. In a chemotherapeutic application, others have confirmed this principle using HPMA [N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer] conjugated to Doxorubicin and demonstrated an inverse relationship between tumor uptake and urinary clearance [13,14].\n\nOne of the key principles for liposomes used in drug delivery is the amount of biocompatibility and biodegradability in order to",

            "text": "Nanomedicine for cancer therapy is advantageous over conventional medicine 1 because it has the potential to enable the preferential delivery of drugs to tumors owing to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and the delivery of more than one therapeutic agent for combination therapy. 2 Moreover, the engineering of a targeting ligand onto the nanoparticles' (NPs') surface can result in prolonged and localized drug delivery, which should translate into greater efficacy and reduced drug side effects. [3][4][5] Cancer treatment stands to benefit from targeted drug delivery, as tumor cells express many molecules on their surface that distinguish them from normal cells. 6 Although there are expectations of improved efficacy of targeted NPs derived from specific cellular-level interactions, there are conflicting literature reports on tumor accumulation of targeted NPs: previous reports suggest that a tumor-targeting ligand does not increase NP accumulation in tumors, but the targeting antibody may increase tumor cell internalization. 3,7 The results of these studies suggest that the tumor localization of NPs is independent of the ligand and primarily relies on the EPR effect. 8 These reports are in contrast, however, to others, which suggest that the attachment of tumor-targeting antibody on NPs enhances total accumulation in solid tumor. [9][10][11] One difference might be the presence or absence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the complex and its impact on the EPR effect. 12 In fact, the increased circulation time Dovepress Dovepress 4100 capolla et al and tumor retention time of the PEGylated complexes could result in the enhanced tumor accumulation of both targeted and untargeted complexes, thereby masking any effect of the ligand in the process. EPR is a highly variable phenomenon, characterized by large inter-and intraindividual differences. In light of this, a significant number of tumor-targeting studies have focused on the evaluation of parameters affecting the EPR effect, 13,14 and additional studies are clearly needed to understand the influence of NPs' modification on tumor localization and uptake. 3,7,[9][10][11] Currently, several nanotechnology-enabled diagnostic and therapeutic agents for cancer are in clinical trials. 15 Indeed, multifunctionality is the key feature of NP-based",

            "text": "Furthermore, angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in normal tissues follow the law of diameter reduction in smaller branches, which is not seen in solid tumors [39]. Therefore, the heterogeneity of solid tumor microvascular networks could result in alterations in vascular permeability and interstitial fluid flow, which act as key biological barriers to cancer drug delivery and efficacy in solid tumors. The overgrowth of solid tumors and a fibrotic response with increased ECM deposition lead to the introduction of mechanical barriers, resulting in altered interstitial fluid flows [40,41]. Heterogeneity of vascular fluid flow due to physical barriers due to increased cell proliferation in some solid tumor areas can reduce the efficiency of drug nanocarriers, especially in dimensions larger than 100 nm, intratumoral transport, and the EPR effect [20,41]. \n\nRegardless of the stages of vascular formation in solid tumors, which have been studied by Fang et al. [42], exploring the molecular characteristics of tumor vessels can provide a more accurate understanding of the active or inactive delivery of drug nanocarriers. Unlike normal vascular architecture with a homogeneous distribution of endothelial cells surrounded by pericytes, the heterogeneous vasculature of a solid tumor results in different permeability models [43]. This morphological abnormality not only provides greater vascular permeability in solid tumors but also leads to increased interstitial pressure in the tumor tissue, which generates multiple distribution patterns of drug nanocarriers [44]. It seems that determining the balance between vascular resistance and vascular leakage of solid tumors can be used as a basis for drug delivery mediated by the EPR effect to increase therapeutic efficacy in interstitial fluid. Basically, momentary changes in fluid flow with vascular resistance, and vascular leakage with vascular wall pore diameters ranging from 50-100 nm (tumor vessels with poor permeability) to 500-1000 nm (high permeability vessels) are explained. Overall, the EPR effect is expected to be more effective during the early phases of cancer growth or peritumors than late phases due to improved leakage behavior and the rate of fluid flow. This result could advance future therapeutics for solid tumors with a different approach.",

            "text": "Over 20,000 Americans are diagnosed annually with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [1]. Standard treatment usually consists of surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and temozolomide chemotherapy, but median survival is only about 14.6 months [2]. Given these unsatisfactory results, new therapeutic approaches are clearly needed. Although other chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel (Taxol) are even more effective against GBM cells in vitro than temozolomide [3], they have been found to be clinically ineffective against GBM [4]. The limited efficacy of such drugs has been attributed to an inability to achieve therapeutic concentrations of these drugs in the tumor due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)specifically the BBB within the tumor. Modulation of both drug delivery and the integrity of the BBB thus represent promising strategies for enhancing treatment efficacy. \n\nSolid tumors often have vascular systems that are leaky and have impaired blood flow compared to the circulation through normal tissue. Structural characteristics of tumor vascularity such as increased tortuosity, irregular shape and dilation of blood vessels coupled with endothelial fenestrations result in leakage of blood plasma macromolecules and drugs into tumor tissue. The extravasation of these plasma macromolecules into tumors and their concentration and retention within the tumor is a phenomenon referred to as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [5,6]. The EPR effect is the basis, for example, of preferential uptake of gadolinium contrast agents into tumors compared to normal brain tissue, as observed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The anatomical and physiological factors promoting the EPR effect that lead to increased extravasation of drugs and macromolecules from the serum into tumors are not uniformly distributed throughout tumors [7,8]. The EPR effect is often maximal at core regions within a tumor, regions frequently characterized by necrosis, while the EPR effect is diminished at the peripheral zones of a tumor. These peripheral areas may contain many viable cancer cells and are also the regions where the tumor BBB is most likely to remain intact.",

            "text": "Considering these rationales and developments, it is striking that no biomarkers or companion diagnostic tests are available to guide the clinical translation of cancer nanomedicines. It is likely that the lack of probes and protocols for patient stratification, together with the high inter-and intra-individual variability in the tumor accumulation of drug delivery systems, explains the relatively poor therapeutic responses achieved with nanomedicine formulations in advanced-stage clinical trials. The effectiveness of treating solid tumors with cancer nanomedicines largely relies on their ability to accumulate in tumorous tissues, via the so-called enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [86]. While the extent of the EPR effect in humans (especially as compared to mouse models) and the vessel and macrophage density) and imaging biomarkers. The latter can encompass standard imaging probes and protocols to noninvasively and quantitatively assess tumor blood vessel perfusion and permeability, as well as companion nanodiagnostics (e.g. iron oxide nanoparticles) and nanotheranostics (e.g. radionuclide and drug co-loaded liposomes). The overall goal of including such probes and protocols for patient stratification is to differentiate between individuals who are likely to respond to such targeted therapies and individuals who are unlikely to respond, thereby contributing to nanomedicine performance, translation and product development. \n\nappropriateness of the terminology are an ongoing subject of debate, it is clear that long-circulating cancer nanomedicines do accumulate in tumors and metastases in patients, at least to some extent. However, as a result of tumor and metastasis heterogeneity, a high variability in nanomedicine target site accumulation exists. To address this issue, and to improve the translation and clinical performance of cancer nanomedicines, probes and protocols are needed to predict and monitor their tumor accumulation and antitumor efficacy.",

            "text": "As mentioned in Section 3, altering the physicochemical properties of drug nanocarriers can alter penetration into tumor tissue. For example, binding molecules or coatings of drug nanocarriers can modulate the renal filtration rate [114], or natural and synthetic polymers can be used to minimize uptake by the liver [115]. On the other hand, the different morphological structures of solid tumors are key factors in designing and developing potential targeting drug nanocarriers. This means that EPR effect-based drug delivery is much more effective in primary tumors with vascular structures 1 to 4 than in mature tumors with vascular structures 5 to 6 [116]. Therefore, quantifying the morphological structures of solid tumors by various methods, such as imaging and histopathology, can highlight the ability of the EPR effect to improve the efficacy of anticancer nanomedicine. For instance, it has been determined that in micro-metastatic tumor cell clusters the possibility of EPR effect-based drug delivery is much lower than that of other tumors [117]. \n\nStandardization of the methodology for analyzing the EPR effect in solid tumors can enable researchers to develop the function of EPR effect-based treatment of solid tumors. According to Sections 2 and 5, exploring the morphology of solid tumors and their development can provide useful information about the EPR effect-based tumor delivery of nanodrugs, intracellular infiltration, cancer cell death, and changes in the physiological behavior of the tumor. It should be noted that the main cause of EPR effect-based dependent or independent treatment of solid tumors is due to the intratumoral morphological heterogeneity of solid tumors and the different methodologies used in EPR effect analysis. Therefore, due to the presence of different methodologies, along with the variable structure of the solid tumor, reports on the EPR effect-based treatment of tumors are conflicting. \n\nThe timetable of treatment interventions is a critical challenge that can limit the EPR effect on the treatment of solid tumors. The review of Park, Choi, Chang, Um, Ryu, and Kwon [46] confirms the alliance of the EPR effect and the reduction of hypoxia levels in solid tumors based on greater oxygen permeability using drug nanocarriers [118].",

            "text": "Tumor blood flow and vascular permeability fluctuate significantly, and blood flow is commonly blocked as the tumor size rises. Early-stage small tumors demonstrate a more uniform EPR effect than advanced large tumors and advanced large tumors reveal heterogeneity in the EPR effect due to the dynamic nature of the EPR effect [13]. It is thus crucial to use EPR enhancers in advanced tumors to improve EPR-based drug delivery. Several strategies may be applied to enhance the EPR effect in solid tumors by modifying tumor blood vessels, angiogenesis, a vascular edifice, blood flow, and other related factors affecting EPR [14]. By controlling tumor vessels using therapeutic nanomaterials as drug delivery carriers, the EPR effect could be increased remarkably. Nanodrugs utilized in anticancer therapy have the benefit of their privileged assemblage in leaky tumors due to the EPR effect [15]. Desmoplastic tumors are allied with dense stromal factors. Therefore, the permeability of the NPs into the tumor is less. These tumors are resistant to NP-based chemotherapy. By modulating tumor blood vessels utilizing nanostructures including NPs, liposomes, micelles, polymers, and nanobiomaterials for drug delivery, the EPR effect may be potentially enhanced for different cancer therapies, such as pancreatic cancer and ulcerative colitis [14,16]. \n\nAttempts to engulf the shortcomings of traditional EPR-based nanodrug delivery may include supplementary approaches such as molecular targeting and modification or restoration of the TME [17]. The EPR effect represents several physiological variables, each of which is heterogeneous within a tumor, in a patient, and across patients. As a result, it is necessary to anatomize biophysical factors key to the EPR effect, improve insights into the dynamicity of the EPR effect, fabricate improved nanodrugs effective for passive delivery, recognize patients with high-EPR tumors expected to respond to nanodrugs, improve the imaging methods for detecting and quantifying the EPR in tumors both in animal models and human.",

A major advantage of nanoscale DDS in cancer therapy is the EPR effect, which facilitates selectively accumulation of nanoscale particles and vesicles in tumors owing to their enhanced permeability and prolonged retention in tumor vasculature leakage. 29 Through the EPR effect, Exos minimize non-specific binding to non-targeted sites while concentrating drugs at tumor sites. Moreover, we used an external magnetic field to actively target and transport Exos to the tumor site by guiding Fe 3 O 4 NPs, resulting in improved therapeutic outcomes.",

            "text": "Passive targeting usually utilizes physiological structural characteristics to achieve the natural distribution of drug differences in the body [21]. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect refers to the selective accumulation and long-term retention of macromolecular drugs in tumor tissues due to the high permeability and structural abnormalities of blood vessels around tumor tissues. This provides a theoretical basis for the enrichment of nanomedicines in tumor tissues [22]. In addition to the EPR effect that can be observed in tumor models, the properties of the site of the lesion can be similarly exploited in the cardiovascular field to prolong drug retention for ameliorative and therapeutic purposes [23]. In peripheral arterial disease, the passive accumulation of NPs in ischemic tissue is achieved by the EPR effect, and their accumulation is positively correlated with the degree of ischemia. As blood perfusion improves, the EPR effect diminishes and NP accumulation decreases [24]. However, the EPR effect in the context of cardiovascular disease is considerably less prolonged than in tumors, and may not be sufficient for drug delivery. Furthermore, the integrity and hemodynamic characteristics of the vasculature also restrict the passive targeting of drugs to the lesion site [25]. In atherosclerosis, while there may be inflammation and damage to the vessel wall, the integrity of the vessel prevents the drug from easily passing through the vessel wall, thereby limiting drug penetration and delivery. Similarly, in areas of ischemia, blood flow may be slowed or completely interrupted, which affects the distribution of the nanomedicine and its ability to reach the lesion [26]. Therefore, in the field of cardiovascular disease therapy, although initial drug aggregation in the diseased region can be achieved using the EPR effect, this effect is not sufficient to achieve the desired efficacy. There is an urgent need to develop DDSs capable of precisely targeting damaged cardiovascular tissues to enhance targeting precision and prolong the duration of drug efficacy.",

The preferential accumulation of drug-loaded nanoparticles in neoplastic tissues is referred to as passive targeting [9,10]. Passive targeting is facilitated by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [11], i.e., the mechanism by which high molecular weight drug carriers accumulate in the tumor microenvironment (TME) due to increased vascular permeability and the nanometer size of nanoparticles [12]. The TME also possesses impaired lymphatic drainage that prevents the efficient removal of these macromolecules or nanoparticles, thus enhancing their retention within neoplastic tissues [13][14][15]. \n\nThe concept of EPR originated from a landmark study in 1986 by Matsumura and Maeda on the mechanisms of the tumoritropic accumulation of proteins and chemotherapeutic agents [16]. In this study, an increase in the accumulation and uptake of a derivatized styrene-maleic acid polymer loaded with neocarzinostatin (SMANCS) was observed in tumor cells relative to the native neocarzinostatin. SMANCS has a molecular size of 16 kDa and can bind serum albumin (67 kDa) to become a larger molecule [17]. The superior accumulation of SMANCS in tumor tissues offered prolonged duration of action and increased therapeutic efficacy. The authors opined that EPR is made possible by an increased vascular permeability, a dysfunctional lymphatic drainage system, and the relative size of nanoparticles. They showed that very small molecules will traverse biological barriers easily, while larger molecules like nanoparticles may be filtered through highly vascularized and permeable barriers.",

            "text": "The EPR mechanism was initially described for non-brain solid tumors in 1986 (142,143). This mechanism is based on four main components: (1) hypervascularization of the tumor, (2) enhanced permeability of tumor vasculature, (3) hampered absorption of macromolecules back into the vasculature, and (4) reduced drainage of molecules through the lymphatic system. Because the BBTB in high-grade gliomas is even more permeable than fenestrated non-brain capillaries, many optical guidance drugs reach the tumor via this mechanism. Furthermore, the lack of a lymphatic system in tumors prevents the clearance of large molecules and lipids from the interstitial space, greatly contributing to drug retention (142,143). It is worth noting that some tumors do not have increased vascularity, and therefore the EPR effect is not observed in them. For example, metastatic prostate and liver cancers have low vascular densities (144,145). This low vascular density potentially explains the lack of FLS-, ICG-, and 5-ALA-labeling of some brain metastases. \n\nIn order for the EPR effect to occur, the injected molecule should be biocompatible, have no clearance by the reticuloendothelial system, and be non-reactive to blood cells or the endothelium (142). The molecule should be large enough (>40 kDa) to avoid renal clearance through the pores in glomerular endothelium and have a weakly negative or neutral surface charge (142,146). With respect to the upper limit of size of a molecule for EPR, researchers have demonstrated that 1-\u00b5m diameter Lactobacilli can be selectively delivered into the tumor with additional dilation of the tumor endothelial cell junctions by an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (147). Many drugs, including polymer conjugates, bind to albumin (60 kDa), increasing their molecular weight, thus satisfying the criteria for EPR delivery.",

            "text": "Angiogenesis in the cancer disease state is rapid, leading to blood vessels with defective architecture, characterized by wide inter-endothelial junctions, large number of fenestrae and transendothelial channels and a discontinuous or absent basement membrane [22]. This causes a significantly higher permeability of the endothelial barrier of tumor vasculature compared with normal tissue, resulting in not only the accumulation of macromolecules in the tumor interstitium but also importantly their retention due to missing or decreased lymphatic drainage. As this abnormal blood flow into and lymphatic drainage from tumors is exploited for drug delivery, we reasoned that it could also be exploited for imaging. The EPR effect is a unique, molecular weight and size dependent phenomenon, in which large molecules or particles tend to accumulate over time in solid tumors more than normal tissues, due to these anatomical defects [23]. The covalent attachment of polyethylene glycols (PEG) to a drug molecule or delivery vehicle (Figure 1) is the most successful strategy to exploit the EPR effect for passive tumor targeting [24]. First reported in the late 1970s, and with the subsequent discovery of the EPR effect, pegylation strategies have been widely used in the pharmaceutical industry to improve the clinical performance of several drug candidates [25]. With respect to drug delivery, pegylation designates the covalent attachment of one (or more) PEG chains either to a low molecular weight drug, a large bio-molecule or to the delivery vector for the drug molecule such as liposomes, or nanoparticles (Figure 1). PEGs are non-toxic, non-immunogenic, non-antigenic, FDA approved polymers for human oral, intravenous and dermal pharmaceutical applications and are cleared through renal and hepatic pathways [26]. Fast renal clearance can be avoided by conjugating small molecules with PEGs, whereas macromolecular conjugation with low molecular weight PEG can mask cationic charges, reduce enzymatic degradation and avoid opsonization and subsequent elimination by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) [27].",

            "text": "We first observed prolonged tumor-selective accumulation of blue albumin (67 kDa) (Fig. 1A,B), which can be readily visualized by injecting Evans blue intravenously as a blue tumor. 27) The amount of Evans blue-albumin in the tumor and other organs were quantified, and time dependent progressive accumulation was only seen in the tumor tissues (Fig. 2A). The tumor concentration of blue albumin was about 10 fold higher than that of blood at 145 hrs (Fig. 2A). This phenomenon was coined the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. We also confirmed the EPR effect by using radiolabeled serum proteins; IgG (170 kDa), transferrin (90 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), and ovalbumin (48 kDa). However, we did not observe the EPR effect with low molecular weight proteins such as ovomucoid (29 kDa) and neocarzinostatin (12 kDa). 27) o confirm the molecular weight dependency of the EPR effect, we used biocompatible synthetic copolymers of hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA), which ranged in size from 4.5 to 800 kDa, 28)-31) that was kindly provided by Professors Karel Ulbrich and Ruth Duncan. We reconfirmed our earlier findings: most biocompatible plasma proteins and HPMA polymers between 4.5 and 800 kDa exhibited the EPR effect (Fig. 3A,B). 28)-33) A more detailed time course study showed that the tumor uptake of HPMA copolymers after intravenous injection was relatively rapid: some showed a marked tumor uptake within a few hours, while smaller HPMA copolymers, about 30 kDa or smaller, showed no EPR effect. Figure 3B illustrates the relationship among tumor uptake, plasma concentration, and renal clearance in terms of drug size (MW). A relatively long circulation time after intravenous injection was needed for the EPR effect to occur. For progressive drug accumulation to tumor, high drug concentrations in circulation is needed.",

            "text": "The Active Nanotargeting of MBC 3.1. Why and How to Target Tumor Cells? Nanotechnological strategies have consistently improved the therapeutic index of anthracyclines and taxanes, mainly by ameliorating their toxicity profiles. However, improvements in clinical outcomes are controversial, and no substantial changes in overall survival have been observed compared to conventional chemotherapy in most cases. This piece of data probably reflects the fact that nanoparticles often accumulate into the tumor mass by enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, while hardly entering the tumor cells. The EPR effect allows proteins larger than 30 kDa to passively extravasate from the blood vessels into the tumor interstitial space, thanks to the increased vascular permeability in correspondence with the tumor endothelium. Indeed, during tumor growth, neoangiogenesis is promoted in order to satisfy the increasing oxygen demand and, at the same time, the endothelium of the new blood vessels is tortuous, poorly differentiated, and leaky, thus allowing molecules extravasation. Moreover, solid tumors lack functional lymphatics and are unable to eliminate extravasated nanomaterials, thus contributing to increasing nanoparticles accumulation and prolonged retention within the tumor [79,80]. Therefore, the EPR effect has become one of the most exploited biological phenomena for nanotherapeutic strategies. Nonetheless, it is a complex process depending on many factors such as tumor type, tumor microenvironment, and nanoparticle properties, and it does not ensure the intracellular delivery of the drug [79]. Certainly, the passive diffusion of nanoformulated drugs through leaky tumor vasculature may have a prominent role for the treatment of primary tumors with more than 100 mm 3 in volume; however, it remains less effective in a metastatic setting. Metastases are only poorly accessible to molecular or nanoparticle agents because of their small size, high dispersion to organs, and low vascularization if compared to primary tumors [12,81]. As a consequence, the EPR effect is not sufficient for proper drug nanodelivery to these sites, and the development of effective therapies toward metastases still remains a main challenge in cancer treatment.",

            "text": "The use of polymeric delivery systems takes advantage of a drug's pharmacokinetic properties, such as its solubility, halflife, and prolongation of plasma circulation time, to achieve optimal passive targeting. This ensures that the drug matrix is passively transported to the solid tumour (Ekladious et al., 2019). Furthermore, passive targeting certainly depends strongly on two parameters: The tumour endothelial permeability to macromolecules and the presence of reduced lymphatic outflow. These two factors determine how well passive targeting works. When these factors are improved, the likelihood of passive targeting would increase. The enhanced effect of permeation and retention, often called as the EPR effect, is a phenomenon unique to tumours. It was first discovered and stated by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986. Because tumours have defective blood vessels, they form vascular permeability factors. These factors ensure that the tumour tissue receives adequate nutrients and oxygen, allowing the tumour to develop rapidly. Aliphatic polyester dendrimers containing dimethylolpropionic acid have been identified as a promising possibility for the preparation of therapeutic anticancer conjugates. The results of in vitro and in vivo evaluation showed that the water-soluble polyester dendrimers were biocompatible. The delayed aggregation of dendrimers in important organs results in a prolonged period of dendrimer-mediated drug administration, which appears to be beneficial for the EPR effect of passively targeting tumours (Kheraldine et al., 2021). In addition, tumour cells would stimulate dilatation of blood channels through excessive release of permeability mediators (Greish et al., 2003;Gillies and Fr\u00e9chet, 2005). \n\nPolymeric drug conjugates and drug loaded polymeric micelles, dendrimers, polymeric nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes would selectively accumulate inside solid tumor owing to the EPR effect (Puri et al., 2009;Shcharbina et al., 2013).",

            "text": "To ensure their preferential accumulation in targeted tumours some anticancer drugs can be modified. We proposed to subdivide different approaches to targeting of anticancer and other drugs specifically to the site of action into two big clusters: passive and active targeting [67]. Active targeting is usually achieved when the drug is conjugated to a carrier together with a targeting component that redirects the carrier and associated drug to the specific cells. For a preferential accumulation of the modified drug specifically in the tumour or tumour environment, passive targeting includes modifications of drug or drug formulations other than using targeting moieties. \n\nThe oldest and most known approach for a passive targeting of anti-cancer drugs to tumours is the use of enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). The EPR effect was first described by Maeda and co-workers. The EPR effect is the result of the increased permeability of the tumour vascular endothelium to circulating macromolecules combined with limited lymphatic drainage from the tumour interstitium. High molecular weight substances or low molecular drugs coupled with high molecular weight carriers penetrate highly vascularized tumour tissues, are inefficiently removed by lymphatic drainage and therefore accumulate in tumours. The existence of the EPR effect was experimentally confirmed for many types of macromolecular anticancer drug delivery systems [68]. Despite the simplicity of the approach it has serious disadvantages. The accumulation of high molecular weight substances occurs only to solid tumours with developed vascularization, high tumour mass and poor lymphatic drainage. However, these types of solid tumours can be relatively easy removed by surgery. The efficiency of this type of passive targeting is low for multifocal metastatic tumours that cannot be removed using surgical procedures and requires chemotherapy. Consequently, the EPR effect cannot be effectively used for overcoming drug resistance in most tumours that badly require it. \n\nSeveral other approaches have been proposed for a passive targeting of anticancer drugs specifically to tumour cells. Most of them use specific tumour conditions to release anticancer drugs from the delivery system specifically to the tumour environment or in tumour cells [69,70].",

Previously, various types of nanomedicines have been demonstrated to accumulate in solid tumors via the EPR effect. However, EPR is a highly variable phenomenon because of tumor heterogeneity, resulting in low drug delivery efficacy in clinical trials. Because ultrasonication using micro/nanobubbles as contrast agents can disrupt blood vessels and enhance the specific delivery of drugs, it is an effective approach to improve the EPR effect for the passive targeting of tumors. In this review, the basic thermal effect, acoustic streaming, and cavitation mechanisms of ultrasound, which are characteristics that can be utilized to enhance the EPR effect, are briefly introduced. Second, micro/nanobubble-enhanced ultrasound imaging is discussed to understand the validity and variability of the EPR effect. Third, because the tumor microenvironment is complicated owing to elevated interstitial fluid pressure and the deregulated extracellular matrix components, which may be unfavorable for the EPR effect, few new trends in smart bubble drug delivery systems, which may improve the accuracy of EPR-mediated passive drug targeting, are summarized. Finally, the challenging and major concerns that should be considered in the next generation of micro/nanobubble-contrast-enhanced ultrasound theranostics for EPR-mediated passive drug targeting are also discussed.",

            "text": "Delivery of anticancer drugs to the target tissue is one of the main tasks to be solved. NPs loaded with the drug are transported in the body by two mechanisms: passive and active targeting. Passive targeting to solid tumors can be achieved through the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect), as first described in the 1980s [13,14]. Pathological, pharmacological, and biochemical studies have shown that a solid tumor usually has such pathophysiological characteristics as hypervascularization, incomplete vascular architecture, and secretion of vascular permeability factors that stimulate extravasation and immaturity of lymphatic capillaries [15]. The tumor vasculature is characterized by a high proportion of proliferating endothelial cells, increased tortuosity, pericyte deficiency, and the formation of an atypical membrane. All this leads to rapid vascularization of the tumor, which is necessary to provide it with oxygen and nutrients and further proliferation. These characteristics make tumor blood vessels permeable to macromolecules. In addition, the lymphatic drainage system of the tumor functions ineffectively due to immature lymphatic capillaries; thus, nanocarriers are selectively preserved for a long period in the interstitial tissue of the tumor [15]. Numerous studies have shown that the EPR effect induces passive accumulation of macromolecules and micelles in solid tumors, enhancing the therapeutic effect while reducing side effects. It was also found that in most human tumors the effective pore size in the vasculature ranges from 200 to 600 nm in diameter, which allows passive targeting of tumors [16]. It was noted that the secretion of various factors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and the main growth factor of fibroblasts in tumor tissues and overexpression of genes (such as vascular permeability factor or vascular endothelial growth factor) cause hyperpermeability of tumor microvessels. However, let us note that vascular permeability in the tumor changes with its progression and depends on the type of tumor and its anatomical location.",

            "text": "Drug targeting is defined as the selective drug release at a specific physiological destination organ or tissue or cell in which specific pharmacological impact is required. Nanocarrier mediated cell targeting includes active and passive mechanisms. In passive targeting, the drugs can be delivered to the target organ passively based on the longevity of the pharmaceutical carrier in the blood and preferential accumulation of the drug-loaded nano delivery system at the site of interest [145]. The main property of tumor tissues is that they have defective blood vessels and hence exhibit increased vascular permeability. This unique characteristic helps to transport macromolecules into tumor tissues. Maeda et al have demonstrated that the site of infection or inflammation where excess bradykinin is generated also exhibits enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [146]. The main difference between the infection-induced EPR effect and that of tumor is the duration of the retention period. In the case of normal tissues, the time will be shorter due to swelling while in cancer tissues the lymphatic drainage system is active. Thus swelling may disperse after a few days. In cancer, the enhanced vascular permeability results in adequate nutrients and oxygen supply to the tumor tissues for their rapid growth. This unique anatomical-pathophysiological nature of tumor blood vessels is being exploited to deliver drug molecules to the tumor tissues. Macromolecules bigger than 40 kDa will spill out from the tumor vessel and concentrate in tumor tissues. Normal tissues lack this EPR effect driven drug delivery. This unique EPR effect feature of tumor cells is subsequently thought to be a milestone principle in tumor-targeting chemotherapy and is turning into an inexorably encouraging worldview approach for anticancer drug development. Hence, it has become the golden standard in anticancer drug design and anticancer strategies using macromolecular agents, including gene delivery, molecular imaging, antibody therapy, micelles, liposomes, and protein-polymer conjugates [147][148][149]. PEG is the most important polymer used to modify proteins to enhance the efficiency of drug delivery. PEGylated Lasparaginase has a circulation lifetime of 5.7 days in humans compared to 1.2 days for the original enzyme [6] and was successfully used as induction therapy for phase-3 acute lymphoblastic",

            "text": "Although progresses in cancer therapy have improved the overall survival rate of patients, the cancer heterogeneity still demands new therapeutic strategies in order to reduce the burden of this disease and to amend the prognosis. Currently, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy represent the standard therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment. Nevertheless, in some cases the efficacy of conventional approaches fails, especially due to difficult anatomical sites of intervention or chemoand radio-resistance of cancer cells which can frequently promote recurrences, metastasis and second primary tumors [1]. In addition, full exploitation of chemotherapy, the most conventional method approved for the treatment of cancer, is in many cases limited, mainly due to the harmful side effects resulting from the indiscriminate action of drugs on both cancerous and healthy cells and tissues, as well as to low bioavailability or unfavorable biodistribution. To date, several therapeutics exploiting the opportunities provided by nanomaterials have been successfully introduced for the treatment of cancer and other diseases [2,3]. The primary advantages of these nanostructures reside in their high surface to volume ratio allowing their functionalization with large amounts of targeting ligands and active compounds and preventing their degradation. Noteworthily, considering anticancer applications, nanoparticles can predominantly accumulate in solid tumors taking advantage of a peculiar feature of neoplastic tissues. In fact, tumors require high oxygen and nutrient supply to proliferate, therefore, angiogenesis is stimulated rapidly forming aberrant vasculature. Indeed, the rapid formation of tumor blood vessels results in abnormalities in the epithelia causing tumor vasculature to be more permeable than normal vasculature. This phenomenon, called enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect, allows nanoparticles, conversely than small molecules that can diffuse back to the blood stream, to diffuse more efficiently into tumor tissue than normal ones and to persist and accumulate in the tumor site [4,5].",

            "text": "The rationale for using nanoparticles (of any type) in cancer treatment relies on the Enhanced Permeability and Retention effect (EPR effect). It was first reported by Maeda and coworkers and, indeed, it is the basis of some commercialized nanomedicines [26]. According to Maeda et al., the EPR effect promotes the passive accumulation of nanoparticles in a tumor as a consequence of the poor lymphatic drainage, enhanced permeability, and the hypervasculature characteristic of many solid tumors [27]. \n\nSuch passive accumulation of nanoparticles is greatly affected by features such as their size and surface chemistry. Regarding size, nanoparticles will avoid renal clearance if they are at least 10 nm in diameter, and will extravasate to the tumor if they are smaller than 400 nm. Nonetheless, this is still a controversial issue regarding the size that maximizes extravasation and subsequent cancer cell uptake. In this sense, some authors consider a size of ca. 300 nm as the most effective [28], while others propose a size of ca. 100 nm or below [29]. The surface chemistry directly affects the behavior of the nanoparticles in a biological fluid, as it determines the extent of plasma proteins adsorption onto the surface. These proteins form a protein corona that provides a biological entity to the particles, triggering their bloodstream clearance, and preventing tumor accumulation [30]. This phenomenon can be minimized by modifying the surface of MSNs with stealth moieties, such as polyethylene glycol or zwitterionic molecules, that prevent protein deposition through the creation of a hydration layer [23]. \n\nEven though the EPR effect constitutes a reliable strategy for accumulating nanomedicines in a tumor, its magnitude is greatly affected by the particularities of the tumor and the patient [31]. That non-universal passive accumulation has boosted the development of active strategies to enhance the delivery of nanocarriers. Examples of such strategies are particle-carrying tumor-tropic cells that spontaneously migrate to tumor tissues or nanoparticles functionalized with tumor-tropic peptides that promote their accumulation and tumor penetration [23].",

            "text": "While molecular-target drugs target cancer at the molecular level, at a much earlier period of time, a more general tumor-targeting strategy had been depicted and developed by focusing on unique anatomical and pathophysiological features of solid tumors [1]. Compared to normal blood vessels, tumor blood vessels are very leaky due to the defected architecture of endothelial cells and high vascular permeability due to the highly expressed vascular mediators such as bradykinin (BK), nitric oxide (NO), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), by which the accumulation of macromolecules (i.e., larger than 40 kDa) selectively into tumor tissues could be achieved with very little distribution in normal tissues [1,2]. This unique phenomenon is coined the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and it was first recovered by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 [1], which is a landmark principle in the development of targeted anticancer drugs. \n\nBased on the concept of the EPR effect, macromolecular anticancer strategy, i.e., nanomedicine, has been developed. Tumor-targeted drug delivery systems using nanoplatforms including liposome, polymeric micelles, polymer conjugate, and nanoparticles have become a promising fusion area for nanotechnology and medicine. In the past two decades, many researchers have been working on EPR effect-based nanomedicine, taking an enormous step forward. In 1980s, the founder of EPR effect, Professor Maeda, developed styrene maleic acid copolymer conjugated neocarzinostatin (SMANCS), which was approved in Japan in 1990s [1]. Recently, more nanomedicines have been used in clinic, for example, Doxil is an FDA approved liposomal drug for the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma and other cancers.",

Because of the tight junctions in the normal endothelial cell gap, it prevents particles larger than 2 nm from passing. However, the tight junctions of the tumor vasculature and the basement membrane are disordered, allowing 10 to 500 nm NP to exude and accumulate in tumor matrix [138]. The lymphatic system of the tumor is also damaged; further intercepting macromolecular particles and delaying their outflow [139].

            "text": "In tumor-bearing mice, nanoparticles (NPs) greater than 10 nm in diameter have a proclivity to accumulate in the tumor. Accumulation of these NPs in tumors, however, is modest and only about 20 to 40% greater than its accumulation by normal tissues [1]. The preferential uptake of NPs by tumors is due to the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. The EPR effect is thought to result from a combination of leakiness of tumor blood vessels resulting in flux of NPs from the blood into the tumor tissue and reduced numbers of lymphatic vessels in tumors associated with decreased drainage of NPs and occurs despite a higher interstitial pressure within the tumor. Notably, several rarely used therapies, such as nitroglycerin, may enhance the EPR effect and augment accumulation of NPs within tumors [2,3]. When NPs have diameters less than \u223c10 nm, they are rapidly secreted by the kidneys and the effect of EPR is greatly reduced [4]. Moreover, NPs with very short halflife and/or with their nonspecific binding may accumulate within the tumor to a greater extent, if the EPR effect is enhanced by pegylation of particles. By prolonging blood circulation (plasma half-life) of the NP and reducing nonspecific binding, pegylation may also enable accumulation of ligandnanoparticle conjugates in tumors above the EPR effect.\n\nBuilding on accumulation of NPs in tumors from the EPR effect, researchers have sought to increase their tumor delivery by coating the particles with tumor-localizing ligands. The mechanism by which ligands increase the antitumor efficacy of their cargo (in our case siRNA) is somewhat controversial. Most investigators have determined that increased efficacy of targeted ligand-siRNA NPs is due to enhanced binding to the tumor surface marker and accumulation of NPs in the tumor compared to that in nontargeted tissues. Some investigators, however, have found that accumulation of targeted and nontargeted NPs within tumors was similar and found that increased efficacy of the targeted NP was due to enhanced receptor-mediated endocytosis and increased intracellular localization of the siRNA therapeutic [5]. Most likely, both mechanisms have important",

            "text": "Conventional chemotherapy is based on low-molecular-weight (usually below 1000 Da) drugs. Due to their small size, chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin (DOX), gemcitabine, and cisplatin, have unfavorable pharmacokinetics and suboptimal bioavailability. This is evidenced by their short half-life and accumulation in non-target tissues. Their non-specific mechanism of action and the high volume of distribution can cause severe side effects such as neurotoxicity, myelosuppression, nausea, and vomiting in patients. Uncontrolled cancer cell proliferation and incomplete vascularization lead to the formation of tumors that can be easily permeable to nanocarriers (Figure 6). By increasing the diameter of systemically administered drugs, renal elimination can be reduced and the half-life of drug with accumulation at the site of action can be improved [44]. Additionally, the impairment of lymphatic drainage increases the retention, accumulation, and content release of nanodrugs. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect was first described in 1986 [45,46]. Due to numerous studies on the EPR phenomenon, its high heterogeneity has been observed. Heterogeneity in EPR-mediated tumor targeting can be attributed to changes in vessels (permeability, receptor expression, or maturation) or stroma (dense extracellular matrix, high cellularity, hypoxia, or interstitial fluid pressure). This translates into noticeable differences among individuals or tumor and metastases features in the same patient. Heterogeneity affects the effectiveness of drugs transported in nanocarriers. Interestingly, even variable drug accumulation in the surroundings of neoplastic lesions can provide better therapeutic efficacy than the use of standard forms of chemotherapeutic agents. The delivery of specific drugs to the site of action and the effectiveness of therapy can be improved by tumor-targeted drug transport. Tumor-targeting delivery systems are expected to increase drug concentration in cancerous tissues while limiting the delivery of drugs to normal tissues [44]. The improved concept of drug delivery involves the use of specific molecules called ligands.",

            "text": "Cancer is one of the most common causes of death in the world that was responsible for millions of deaths in the 20 th century, and still remains one of most challenging diseases to treat. Cancer as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality with more than ten million new cases every year is the biggest public health concern (1, 2). Although chemotherapeutics are widely used for cancer treatment, and effective to some extent, their nonspecific biodistribution to normal tissues and affecting healthy rapidly dividing cells (enterocytes, white blood cells, etc.) cause drug-induced toxicity and numerous serious side effects. In addition, free cancer therapeutics suffer from poor solubility, low stability, rapid in-vivo degradation, and short plasma residence time. To overcome the aforementioned limitations of chemotherapeutics, various nanoparticulate systems including liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, dendrimers, and inorganic nanoparticles have been increasingly investigated for cancer therapy due to several advantages (3-7). \n\nThe enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which is due to unique structural features of many solid tumors, including hypervasculature, poorly aligned defective endothelial cells lacking smooth muscle layer, and impaired lymphatic drainage (Figure 1), has the critical role in nanoparticles accumulation at the tumor site (8,9). However, the effective nanocarriers of chemotherapeutics cannot only rely on the EPR effect. In order to use beneficial features of the EPR effect for anticancer delivery, nanomedicines should exhibit prolonged circulation time. Size, surface charge, hydrophobicity, composition, PEGylation, and shape are critical parameters in pharmacokinetic properties of nanostructures (10,11). \n\nAlthough nanoparticle accumulation in tumor site is very critical for antitumor efficacy enhancement and reduced adverse effects, inefficient drug release at the target site and endosomal entrapment of nanoparticles are very important obstacles for achieving maximum efficacy.",

            "text": "The potential for nanoparticles to improve clinical outcomes in cancer has usually focussed on improving the effectiveness of existing or novel therapeutic drugs by enhancing their delivery to target sites, thereby increasing the concentration of the drug that is delivered to its site of action while minimising its concentration elsewhere. A similar strategy is relevant for both MRI and radiotherapy. This can be achieved by passive targeting using the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, or via active targeting with targeting ligands (cf. Fig. 2). The EPR effect describes a tendency for nanoparticles (and macromolecules) to preferentially accumulate in cancerous tumours (Nakamura et al. 2015;Shi et al. 2020;Wu 2021). The proposed biological mechanism for the EPR effect is increased vascular permeability in the tumour environment (itself mediated by the need for tumours to induce new blood vessel formation to sustain blood supply), wherein the blood vessels in close proximity to the tumour have \"leaky\" walls that permit larger molecules to enter (Houston et al. 2020). A second component is a dysfunctional lymphatic drainage system from tumours, diminishing clearance of these same structures (Nakamura et al. 2015). This means particles of the appropriate size may be more likely to enter tumour cells and less likely to leave them, resulting in a higher intra-tumoural concentration of the particles, relative to surrounding tissue. If the particles are too small, they are usually cleared by the renal system too efficiently for any significant tumour uptake to occur, as well as accumulating in healthy tissues (Nakamura et al. 2015). Most particles that exploit the EPR effect are roughly 10-100 nm in diameter (Fang et al. 2020).\n\nWhile the EPR effect relies on an imbalance between vascular uptake and lymphatic drainage in tumour deposits, active targeting relies on functionalising nanoparticles to have an affinity for the cancerous cells. The two main forms of active targeting are (Bi et al. 2016): (i) directed targeting, or nanoparticles that bind to targetable molecules or structures (e.g. receptors or proteins) that may be expressed exclusively or to a disproportionately high extent by",

            "text": "Attempts are being made to combine cancer cell-specific targeting with EPR-based accumulation. Intracellular delivery of drug-loaded macromolecule conjugates and pharmaceutical nanocarriers accumulated in tumors through the EPR effect can be facilitated in various ways [155]. \n\nOne of the methods to facilitate the EPR effect is increasing the permeability of tumor vasculature by using vascular permeability factors, antiangiogenesis therapy, supplying oxygen to hypoxic regions, or thrombolysis therapy. Another option is to augment tumoral retention via ECM modulation. This strategy includes direct depletion of ECM components, inhibition of the synthesis of ECM components, or modulation of ECM-associated cells [156]. \n\nOptimization of nanomedicine design to enhance the EPR effect is also one of the strategies that are proposed, as well as a combination of the nanomedicine with the external stimuli, including ultrasounds, radiotherapy or hyperthermia or usage of nanomedicine modified with the cell-penetrating peptides [157]. Many attempts were made to improve the clinical translation of the EPR. The effort of studying the EPR effect paid off, as some of the developed nanomedicine-based EPR-enhancing strategies are currently undergoing clinical trials as shown in Table 3. \n\nDespite the potential effectiveness of nanomedicine-based therapies in the treatment of cancer, patients' response to such cancer treatments cannot be reliably predicted. However, the effect of EPR varies from patient to patient and may even vary within lesions in the same patient. Unlike all new cancer drugs, where protocols exist to distinguish between those who respond well to treatment and those who do not, nanomedicine-based cancer treatment technology does not have such a safety buffer. One of the proposed solutions is to perform noninvasive imaging of labeled nanocarriers that accumulate in tumors through the EPR effect. This makes it easy to identify low EPR patients who are unlikely to respond to treatment and refer them to established or experimental interventions. Similarly, patients with a high intensity of the EPR effect can count on relatively effective treatment with nanomedicine. The future for EPR-based nanomedicine is to create more personalized treatment strategies.",

            "text": "Leaky vasculature of the tumor blood vessels enables the nanocarriers to simply enter into the interstitial space by crossing the endothelial barrier. The size of tumor endothelial cell linings varies depending on the type of tumor and ranges from 100 to 700 nm, which is 50-60 times greater than the normal endothelium (Greish, 2007). Moreover, poor lymphatic drainage system in solid tumors results in insufficient circulation to the extravasated cells, leading to the accumulation of the nanocarriers to the tumorous site. This process is referred as enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) and it is thought to be a good approach in efficient tumor targeting (Torchilin, 2011). The effective execution of EPR by tumors, as well as tumor characteristics including (pH, angiogenesis and microenvironment) are essential for successful passive targeting (ud Din et al., 2017). Tumor hypoxia physiologically triggers angiogenesis which results in the formation of networks of abnormal blood vessels with enhanced permeation because of large spaces that develop between endothelial cells with a size up to 600 nm (Sibgha et al., 2021). Furthermore, tumor interstitium with reduced lymphatic drainage is also significant. EPR effect has gained notoriety for passive tumor targeting, considering that it is deemed to be the criterion (Hirsjarvi et al., 2011). \n\nNanocarriers with low molecular weight drugs reenter into the blood circulation because of diffusion process and are unable to accommodate the tumor site for longer period of time. The pathophysiology and immunochemical conditions of tumor cells completely decide targeting behavior of such drugs, which is known as 'passive targeting' (Figure 2). Nanocarriers are not only the source of improvement of the blood circulation of drugs but also enhance the tumor targeting using EPR effect (Haider et al., 2020). To attain the prolonged retention of drugs, a variety of carriers are used, including polymeric and pH-dependent systems. Furthermore, the distinct and dissimilar microenvironment surrounding tumor cells in comparison to normal cells contributes to passive targeting. Rapidly spreading and overactive cancers have an incredibly high metabolic ratio.",

Utilizing these pathological properties, macromolecular substances that do not ordinarily leak out of normal blood vessels can leak easily from tumor blood vessels, and macromolecules that leak locally into the cancer tissue stay in place for a long time because of a lack of efficient lymphatic drainage. As a result, highly stable macromolecular substances that are not captured by the reticuloendothelial systems in the body and are not filtered from the renal glomerulus can accumulate selectively in cancer tissue. Collectively, these ideas are termed the enhanced permeability retention (EPR) effect 15 ( Figure 1). The first paper on the EPR effect revealed the accumulation of various high-molecular-weight proteins in tumors; among F I G U R E 1 Diagram of the enhanced permeability retention (EPR) effect. (A) Small molecules easily leak from normal vessels, but macromolecules (including IgG) are too large to pass through normal vessel walls. (B) Even macromolecules can extravasate from tumor vessels and be retained in the tumor tissue for long periods of time due to the EPR effect (modified from Matsumura [2012] 26) them, IgG accumulated most efficiently. That is, IgG retains not only active targeting based on the antigen-Ab reaction, but also passive targeting ability. Animal experiments have contributed to the development of drug delivery systems (DDSs) for several payloads such as anticancer agents and nucleic acids, and these approaches have been accepted worldwide. 16,17 However, some clinical problems remain, and DDSs based on the EPR are not fully functional. 18 It has become clear that the most important mechanism underlying the EPR effect is tumor vascular hyperpermeability caused by the production of vascular permeability factors associated with cancerinduced hypercoagulation of blood. This increase in blood coagulation results in formation of cancer stroma, which interferes with the EPR effect. 19",

            "text": "Nanoparticle tumor targeting or delivery is based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect . EPR effect is a hallmark for targeted drug delivery of biocompatible nanomedicine or macromolecular drugs in tumor tissue [53,96,99,[103][104][105][106][107][108][109]. The effect can be observed in both primary and metastatic tumors. The EPR effect can be visualized in vivo tumor models or human tumors [99,108]. The EPR effect reflects pathophysiology of solid tumor including defective vascular architecture, upregulated neoangiogenesis and excessive production of various vascular mediators. It is noteworthy that these factors are common immune disruptors and contribute to the immune dysfunction. \n\nEvaluation of some drug encapsulated liposomes and micellar nanoparticles reveal another example of failed attempts in cancer chemotherapy. Nanotechnologybased nanomedicine has been the focus of great attention in the past couple of decades. Initially, liposome particles presented the poorest outcomes in the pharmacokinetics because of little considerations of the rapid clearance and removal of nanoparticles by phagocytic cells. However, current methods of attaching biocompatible polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the surface of particles potentially protect them against this problem. However, in the in vivo setting, it is important that drugencapsulated liposomes or nanoparticles remain stable and intact enough to reach to the target tissues without disruption of particles or micelles on its way to reach cancer clumps. Otherwise, the active component of LMW drug would often leak out from such particles during circulation and subject to rapid clearance by urinary tract or lymphatic channels, as well as potential decomposition by the liver and the bile. The possibility that particles would burst before reaching the target make such drugs to lose effectiveness while producing adverse effects similar to the parental LMW drug given iv as shown in Fig. 2a, b.",

            "text": "This observed toxic effects of AgNPs are in agreement with that of many previous reports (Hajipour et al. 2020;Elsharawy et al. 2020). \n\nIn the present study, the efficacy of the prepared nanocomposite was assessed in vivo by following up the change in the intraperitoneal Ehrlich ascites (fluid) tumor volume and cellular viability after intraperitoneal treatment with the nanocomposite, and a marked inhibition in Ehrlich tumor growth was demonstrated. This marked decrease in Ehrlich tumor volume upon treatment can be explained by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The EPR effect is based on the hyperpermeability of the tumor vessels due to the large holes between endothelial cells of the tumor vessel wall, and the absence of lymphatics, allowing therapeutic particles to enter the tumor and stay there (Jain and Stylianopoulos 2010). In our case, both tumor and the therapeutic nanocomposite were present together in the peritoneal cavity and retained there for the entire treatment period. These are ideal conditions for the EPR effect. However, this fluid Ehrlich tumor model cannot answer the question about the delivery of our rGO flakes that exceed 300 nm to solid tumors, where the effect of the nanoparticle size must be considered for optimal drug delivery and therapeutic outcome. Nevertheless, it is known that the holes in the solid tumor vessel wall range from 200 nm to 2 \u03bcm with an average of about 400 nm (Gao et al. 2012), compared to holes of the normal vessel wall with size of less than 10 nm. In this context, our prepared nanocomposite would be advantageous since it could selectively pass through the holes of the solid tumor vessels but will not be able to extravasate to normal tissues, reducing the adverse toxic effects. Also, the negative charge of this nanocomposite may prevent from being recognized and prolonged their circulation time in blood, which in turn enhanced the EPR effect (Pei et al. 2020). Therefore, in this study, the size and charge of rGO/AgNC were suitable for the EPR effect in the studied model and can be advantageous for application in treatment of solid tumors.",

This mechanism capitalizes on the rapid growth of cancer cells, characterized by leaky, layered blood vessel structures, and reduced lymphatic clearance within the tumor tissue. These factors collectively increase the penetration of circulating nanoparticles into the tumor environment, facilitating targeted drug delivery to tumor cells. However, active targeting involves combining drug carriers with receptors, peptides, or surface molecules that are highly expressed in tumor cells. This modification ensures that drug accumulation within the tumor cells exceeds that in normal tissues, achieving precise targeted drug delivery [40,41] (Figure 4). However, relying solely on either passive targeting or active targeting to increase PTA accumulation has its limitations. Currently, the primary strategy involves leveraging the advantages of both passive and active targeting to mitigate constraints and enhance the efficacy of PTT.",

            "text": "he toxicity issues on nearby normal tissue are a main concern for systemic injection of therapeutic agents at the tumor site. These complications have led to improve the center-point target delivery of anticancer drugs and drug nanoformulations to enhance the therapeutic potential and minimize the toxic effects. Rapid advancement in the drugloaded nanomaterials in the past decade has been a powerful thrust for the innovation of cancer treatment. Some nanomaterials like liposomes, micelles, polymers, metal nanoparticles (NPs), etc., have been widely used as drug-loaded targeted delivery vehicles and play a significant role in cancer treatment. These nanocarriers have been loaded with different antitumor drugs, which include doxorubicin, paclitaxel, cisplatin, tamoxifen, etc. [6][7][8] In comparison to normal tissues, solid tumors are more permeable to therapeutic agents including NPs due to enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). 9 The EPR-effect is now a well-acknowledged phenomena, validated in different cancer models as well as in cancer patients. 10 Cancer tissues with rich blood vessels exhibit a good EPR effect and concomitantly respond to treatments, whereas tumors with reduced blood flow demonstrate poor drug delivery and treatment strategies. 11 It has been reported that nitric oxide (NO) is one of the most important factors to enhance the EPR effect through vasodilation, opening of cell junction gaps of endothelial cells, and increasing the blood flow within the hypovascular cancerous mass. \n\nOnly a few drug-loaded nanoformulations have shown remarkable success in cancer management, as many challenges still persist in the clinical application of these nanomaterials. The TME is characterized by hypoxia, acidity, immunosuppression, and high interstitial fluid pressure (IFP). 12 Therefore, the pinpoint targeted application of nanoformulations at the tumor site is still a challenge which needs to be achieved to effectively eradicate the cancer menace. \n\nIncorporation of specific therapeutic payloads within or on the surface of a particular bacteria as a tool of tumor therapy is now considered as an innovative approach for cancer management.",

            "text": "Effective drug delivery to tumor cells via chitosan NPs is divided into two categories (active and passive) (Figure 4). In passive DOX delivery, chitosan NPs accumulate in tumor tissue through leaky or defective vessels using the permeability and retention (EPR) effect [128]. NPs carrying anticancer drugs can easily navigate through the blood vessels in the angiogenic tumor site. This characteristic leads to a higher concentration of these NPs in tumor tissue compared to natural anticancer drugs, a phenomenon referred to as the EPR effect [129]. Once a solid tumor achieves a specific size, the surrounding normal vasculature becomes inadequate to meet the increasing oxygen demands for tumor development. Subsequently, as tumor cells undergo cell death, they release growth factors that stimulate the formation of new blood vessels from nearby capillaries [130]. Angiogenesis denotes the rapid formation of novel and irregular blood vessels, characterized by a disrupted epithelium and the absence of the basal membrane typically present in normal vascular systems. Due to the vascularization needed by rapidly growing tumors, coupled with restricted lymphatic drainage, the resulting irregular vascular architecture gives rise to an amplified EPR effect [131]. However, passive targeted drug delivery exhibited lower therapeutic efficacy and systemic side effects [132]. \n\nThe targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs presents dual benefits. Firstly, precise delivery to the targeted site reduces the requirement of the dosage, enhancing the efficacy of the therapy method [133]. Secondly, by reducing the overall drug dosage, the manifestation of drug-induced adverse effect is either prevented or significantly minimized. Nanomedicine therapy influences the diverse active and passive targeting capabilities of NPs to deliver drugs to specific target site [134]. Because of these potentials, NPs are used as viable methods for overcoming the drawbacks of traditional cancer therapies, such as nonselective toxicity and drug resistance. Tumor-targeted drug delivery takes use of the differences between malignant and healthy tissues [135]. During tumor progression, the tumor microenvironment changes. Inadequate oxygen supply and glucose to lactate conversion, caused by increased metabolism and growth rates, lead to a fall in the pH of the tumor tissue.",

Factors such as irregular and dysfunctional tumor vasculature, high interstitial fluid pressure, and the varied expression of permeability factors across tumor types can substantially reduce the passive targeting effectiveness (Karpuz et al., 2020b). These limitations necessitate a deeper understanding and potentially the combination with active targeting strategies to enhance delivery efficiency and therapeutic outcomes. Our discussion now acknowledges these challenges, recognising that a successful translation into clinical practice requires strategies to overcome or complement the EPR effect.",

            "text": "Over the last three decades, we have witnessed tremendous progress in the field of nanomedicine through the preparation of a vast number of nanoscale (bio)materials. Nanomedicine itself is defined as the biomedical application of nanoscale systems with unique physicochemical properties, including small size, large specific surface area, high reactivity, and quantum effects  of the nanoparticles (NPs) [1,2]. Nanomedicine is specifically designated for therapeutics (drug delivery), diagnostics, and imaging, as well as for regenerative medicine. Aiming to improve the treatment outcomes, new nanomedicinal drugs and formulations have been reported on an almost daily basis for targeting various diseases. Until now, most nanomedicine applications have focused primarily on drug delivery and theranostic nanoplatforms for cancer treatment. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, first described by Maeda and co-workers in 1986, allows for high accumulation of the drug nanocarriers via the leaky vasculature and the deficient lymphatic system around solid tumors, as illustrated in the right panel of Figure 1 [3][4][5]. The EPR effect has been a cornerstone for cancer nanomedicine development, and various types of nanocarrier drug delivery systems have been developed to take advantage of this passively targeted strategy. Moreover, active targeting strategies have been developed to further improve the drug accumulation selectively through specific binding to receptors overexpressed by cancer cells (left panel of Figure 1), resulting in enhanced therapeutic activity and reduced systemic toxicity. Globally, there are around 15 approved cancer drug nanoformulations for clinical use, and 80 candidates for novel cancer nanomedicines are now under evaluation in clinical stages [6]. Simple liposomal and micellar formulations containing chemotherapeutic agents still predominate in this group. \n\nDespite the obstacles and challenges, oncology has become the main focus of nanomedicine [8]. Liposomal doxorubicin was the first FDA-approved nanodrug (1995) achieving improved therapeutic efficacy through passive targeting via the EPR effect [9].",

            "text": "To date, a large number of studies have been published demonstrating the advantages of DDS over freely soluble drugs, at basic research, preclinical and clinical levels [1,[8][9][10]. Upon intravenous (i.v.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration, the prolonged circulation times and increased hydrodynamic diameter of nanomedicines lead to passive accumulation in solid tumors, metastasis or at sites of inflammation via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, [11,12] a vascular phenomenon that involves the extravasation and retention of macromolecules. The EPR effect is driven by incorrect tumor blood vessels and impaired lymphatic drainage due to rapid unorganized solid tumor and metastatic growth. Simultaneously, the nano-sized dimensions of the DDS prevent them from accumulating in healthy organs and tissues, as observed for carrier systems with dimensions in the upper-nano and micro ranges [13]. Finally, an increase in drug levels at target sites and reduction of drug concentrations in potentially endangered healthy tissues support the use of nano-sized DDS to achieve significant improvements in the balance between therapeutic efficacy and unwanted and treatment-limiting side effects [14,15]. \n\nA detailed understanding of the above-mentioned DDS-mediated drug targeting systems is highly relevant for the translation of novel DDS from basic research and preclinical development into clinic applications [16]. Quantitative assessments of the biodistribution, target site localization, and accumulation in healthy organs and tissues are key points and tasks in DDS development. Determination of the pharmacokinetics of DDS can be conducted after i.v. administration either invasively, i.e., by collecting blood, tumor or tissue samples, or non-invasively, i.e., by using various imaging techniques. Several non-invasive imaging methods are commonly used for monitoring the DDS biodistribution and target site accumulation, e.g., positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and fluorescence optical imaging (FI) [5,[17][18][19].",

            "text": "Engineered nanoparticles display immense potential for diagnosis and therapy of various diseases including cancer [1][2][3][4]. The most critical factor and greatest challenge in developing nanoparticles for cancer therapy is ensuring their reliable delivery into solid tumors. Nanomedicine development continues to focus largely towards improving passive delivery of nanoparticles to solid tumors by changing their physical and chemical characteristics [5][6][7][8][9]. Demonstrations of successful nanoparticle delivery remains limited, with only a handful of nanoparticle-based cancer therapeutics approved for clinical use. In these cases, approval of cancer nanomedicine formulations often resulted from nanoparticle-altered drug bio distribution and toxicity, compared to free drug, rather than increasing concentration of drug in tumor [10][11]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of free doxorubin versus liposomal doxorubicin administered to patients showed no difference between the two cohorts in terms of objective response [12]. Successful clinical translation of a \"targeted\" nanoparticle, i.e. nanoparticle conjugated with an \"active\" targeting moiety towards tumor cells, remains an unrealized goal. There is a growing recognition that a barrier to achieving this ideal is our lack of a clear understanding of biological mechanisms leading to nanoparticle uptake and distribution in solid tumors.\n\nEnhanced permeability and retention (EPR) arising from aberrant and leaky vasculature in the tumor remains the accepted mechanism for nanoparticle access and retention in the tumor microenvironment. \"Passive\" retention is thought to be dominated by nanoparticle size slowing reentry into blood [13][14]. Using this rationale, increased bioavailability through prolonged blood circulation enhances passive nanoparticle access and entry into the tumor, motivating development of stealth nanoparticles exhibiting increased circulation time [15][16][17]. Original observations supporting the development of the EPR hypothesis were from human tumors grown in immunocompromised mouse models.\n\nFor the past several decades, preclinical studies in cancer biology and drug development have relied heavily on immunocompromised mouse",

            "text": "In recent times, nanomedicine delivery to tumors has attracted extensive attention in the field of tumor treatment (Allen and Cullis, 2004;Peer et al., 2007). The advantage of nanomedicines over free drugs is based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Fang et al., 2011;Maeda, 2012). The fundamental characteristics of EPR physiology are highly permeable tumor vessels allowing the enhanced permeability (EP) of large particles including proteins, macromolecules, liposomes, micelles, and other particles large enough to avoid renal clearance, into the tumor interstitium combined with impaired lymphatic drainage limiting clearance and causing enhanced retention (ER) of those extravasated particles. Both features result from the rapid growth of a tumor and collapse of the existing blood and lymph vessels in the limited interstitial space (Leu et al., 2000;Dreher et al., 2006). With EPR effect as the main principle for passive targeting strategy, nanomedicine delivery to tumors has achieved success to varying degrees. However, the clinical benefits of the three EPR-based Food and Drug Administration (FAD)-approved nanomedicines including pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil/Caelyx), liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome), and nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane) for the treatment of solid tumors were demonstrated to be only modest (O'Brien et al., 2004;Gradishar et al., 2005;Jain and Stylianopoulos, 2010), posing considerable challenges for the clinical translation of new nanomedicines. Accumulating evidence revealed that EPRdependent drug delivery was always compromised by the tumor microenvironment including irregular vascular distribution, elevated tumor interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), poor blood flow, rich extracellular matrix (ECM) and abundant tumor stroma cells (Nichols and Bae, 2014). Delivery barriers posed by the tumor microenvironment are the main reasons responsible for the modest survival benefits of FDA-approved nanomedicines (Jain and Stylianopoulos, 2010).",

However, EPR-based formulations have some disadvantages, such as nonspecific distribution, poor tumor accumulation, and the heterogeneity of tumors and patients. In addition, various stromal characteristics, such as extracellular matrix density, interstitial fluid pressure, variations in tumor blood flow and vascular permeability, growth-induced solid stress, and hypoxia, can have an additional impact on heterogeneity in EPR-based tumor targeting. As a result of all these variables, the EPR effect may not be applicable to all solid tumors [27,28]. In this context, researchers have concentrated their efforts on the assessment of new-generation nanoformulations with active targeting properties, such as ligand-based active tumor targeting and stimuli-responsive mechanisms (tumor microenvironment TME-responsive and exogenous stimuli-responsive drug delivery) [27,29] (Figure 1). The ligand-based targeting strategy is achieved through the decoration of the nanocarrier surfaces with ligands which selectively interact with receptors or antigens overexpressed onto the tumor cells. This strategy will improve the affinities of the nanocarriers for the surface of cancer cells, thus enhancing drug penetration. Moreover, the lack of such receptors or antigens in normal cells prevents nonspecific uptake by healthy cells and tissues.",

            "text": "After entry into the systemic circulation, the DDS needs to reach the target tumor tissue. Typically, drugs with low molecular weight can enter/exit from healthy or tumor tissues, without accumulating in them. In addition, one of the major issues to face in the solid cancer therapy is the lack of tumor selectivity of anticancer drugs. According to literature, tumor tissues are characterized by hypervascularization with a lack of lymphatic drainage and a high production of vascular permeability factors, which provokes the presence of irregular gaps between endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature [135].\n\nIn this scenario, nanotechnology can help to achieve high accumulation of drug nanocarriers in tumor tissues, avoiding the surrounding healthy tissues. Indeed, DDSs with nanometric size (between 8-100 nm) can extravasate through porous and permeable cancer vessels. The retention of nanocarriers in the tumor site is caused by reduced lymphatic drainage. This phenomenon is known as the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect [136] and it allows modest specificity, thus finally providing an increase of 20\u221230% drug accumulation in tumor site compared to normal organs [116] (Figure 4A).\n\nTo take advantage of this effect, Zhang and colleagues formulated NPs useful for the treatment of breast cancer, able to simultaneously deliver Doxorubicin (DOX), Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH), which can inhibit the interaction of angiogenic factors such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), and ATRA [137]. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown the accumulation of NPs in tumor tissues via EPR effect, decreasing the typical monotherapy toxicity. Furthermore, this co-delivery system has demonstrated a higher anticancer activity in inhibiting tumor growth.\n\nTo sum up, drug delivery by using EPR effect represents a good starting point to improve drug accumulation in tumor tissues, but the particle size is not the only factor to be taken into account to determine a tumor target specificity [138].",

            "text": "Taking into consideration various forms and stages of cancer, desired drug delivery systems based on an injectable hydrogel/scaffold as a smart approach were produced. These smart delivery systems are majorly stimuli-responsive, such as photosensitive, thermoresponsive, pH-sensitive, and multi-stimuli-based scaffolds [11,13]. \n\nOver the years, the knowledge of cancer biology and the increased availability of versatile biomaterials have led to the significant development of nanotechnology and next-generation scaffolds that can deliver drugs to tumor tissue with improved treatment results [14][15][16][17][18][19]. Nanomedicines among the first generation include Doxil \u00ae (liposomal doxorubicin) and Abraxane \u00ae (paclitaxel bound to albumin), which proved beneficial to cancer patients [20]. Recently, nanoparticles (such as polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes) along with scaffolds presented as 3D networks have gained much attention by enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of drugs both locally and in a targeted manner [21][22][23]. In diseases like cancer, rapid angiogenesis causes fenestrated and leaky vessels, leading to the EPR (enhanced permeability and retention) effect [24]. The EPR effect plays a substantial role in tumor drug delivery, specifically nanoparticles through drug accumulation in tumor sites [24][25][26]. The various factors such as drug surface properties, size and shape, targeting, and circulatory time mainly regulate EPR-based drug delivery directly or indirectly. However, there are certain limitations associated with the EPR effect, e.g., tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that varies in types of tumors with the same origin, models, and patients [26,27]. \n\nThe tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in designing and developing nanoparticles or associated carriers [28].",

This phenomenon is known as the so-called Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect [10]. Preferably, the EPR effect in combination with efficient CPPs bound to the polymer chain could enhance internalization of some anti-tumor drugs into the malignant cells [11,12]. In some therapeutic applications, the internalization of the drug into the cancer cells is a prerequisite to its activity. e.g., in photodynamic therapy, the development of singlet oxygen inside the target cell is a crucial parameter for the high efficacy of tumor cell destruction [13]; therefore, a polymer carrier bearing both CPP and a photosensitizer could substantially improve the outcome of the therapy. \n\nIn this work, an HPMA-based copolymer was used as a carrier of both a fluorescent label and a CPP as a cell uptake enhancer. The presented system can be used either directly as a diagnostic probe for tumor imaging or even for fluorescence-guided surgery; eventually, upon replacement of the fluorophore by an anticancer drug it might be utilized as a polymer therapeutic system with enhanced accumulation in solid tumors and with improved penetration into the cancer cells.",

            "text": "The targeting process of nanocarriers can be divided into two types, i.e., passive targeting and active targeting, and these two types of targeting process experience different mechanisms. For passive Targeting, the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) arises from the formation of leaky blood vessels and impaired lymphatic drainage in rapidly growing tumors, which contributes to the accumulation of nanoparticles and microparticles within the tumor. Extensive research has been conducted on nanosized drug carriers, such as liposomes, dendrimers, polymer-drug conjugates, polymer micelles, and inorganic nanoparticles, for drug delivery in cancer chemotherapy using this distinctive approach (Akhter et al., 2018). Due to their specific size range (typically between 1 nm and 200 nm), these nanoparticles preferentially accumulate at the tumor site by exploiting the highly permeable blood vessels and leveraging the EPR effect (Liao et al., 2020)]. Distinguishing with passive targeting, the active targeting employs surface-conjugated ligands that interact with cell membrane receptors, and nanocarriers facilitate receptor-mediated endocytosis, leading to increased drug concentrations within the target cells (Hejmady et al., 2020). Tumor cells often exhibit overexpression of specific receptors, making these receptors ideal targets for active targeting using ligandfunctionalized nanoparticles (Juan et al., 2020). Consequently, both tumor cells and endothelial cells are considered viable cellular targets for active targeting strategies. Additionally, nanoparticles have the potential to address these limitations by leveraging the EPR effect to accumulate anticancer drugs specifically within tumor tissues, and nanoparticles can prolong the half-life of drugs, enhance the solubility of hydrophobic drugs, and reduce potential immunogenicity (Shi et al., 2010). Thus, through active targeting, nanocarriers can mitigate the non-specific distribution of drugs, enhance drug accumulation within the tumor, and improve treatment safety and efficacy.",

            "text": "Cancer therapy is typically perceived as a tremendous burden on a patient, not only affecting the tumor but all systems of the organism. Countless efforts were taken to develop a new approach to overcome this issue [1]. The most advanced approach recognized worldwide is the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) [2][3][4]. The EPR effect or passive targeting to tumors is based on such physicochemical characteristics as size, shape, and charge of a therapeutic agent, whether it is a small molecule drug or a particulate formulation [5]. The EPR effect relies on pathophysiology of solid tumors, which involves defects of their vascular structure, impaired neoangiogenesis, and secretion of vascular mediators. For decades, this approach was a predominant topic of many publications devoted to new cancer therapies [3]. Thirty-five years after its discovery, the most tumorselective and personalized method utilizing the EPR effect is the administration of oil-based formulations of nanodrugs via arterial infusion into tumor-supplying arteries [4]. EPR effect-based treatments also include various types of chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, boron neutron capture therapy, etc. The main disadvantages of passive targeting of tumors are a high degree of off-targeting and its association with toxicity to the healthy tissue [1,6]. \n\nPassive targeting efficacy strongly depends on the tumor progression stage and requires a thorough tumor assessment. At the same time, the EPR effect has been widely studied in mice models, but the success of its translation into treatment of humans is still debated [7][8][9]. \n\nHowever, the targeting of tumors can be reinforced using active targeting [6]. In this way, the therapeutic agent is chosen from the passive targeting \"toolbox\": a nanoparticle or a small drug molecule. The active targeting moiety is typically a ligand for a cellular receptor known to be present onto cancer cells with high abundance but not onto healthy cells (Scheme 1). Such moiety directs the conjugate to the tumor with a higher efficacy than passive targeting alone [10]. Integrin receptors are considered one of the key targets in cancer therapy [11,12].",

            "text": "Recently, nanoparticles (NPs) are regarded as a novel solution to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity in antitumor treatment owing to their smaller size, shorter circulation time, and larger modified surface area (Chen et al., 2014;Long et al., 2014;Morton et al., 2014;Zhao et al., 2014). Different from traditional drug-delivery system, the NPs with modified surface can bind to receptors expressed at the target site, and can be internalized into cancer cells through its pharmacological action (Rapoport et al., 2007;Long et al., 2014). \n\nMost malignant solid tumors have unique blood vessels with the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect), which is critical for survival, growth, evolution, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells (Maeda et al., 2000). Owing to enhanced EPR effect and cellular internalization in tumor microenvironment, NPs could distribute and accumulate specifically into the tumor region (Maeda, 2012;Maeda et al., 2000Maeda et al., , 2013)). Therefore, novel delivery systems such as engineered nanomaterials have been developed and modified owing to the EPR effect, which allows extravasations of nanomaterials and limits the elimination of the extravasated materials (Maeda, 2012;Maeda et al., 2000Maeda et al., , 2013)). Owing to their smaller size, shorter circulation time and larger modified surface, NPs are regarded as efficient drug-delivery platform in chemotherapy. In addition, owing to the EPR effect in malignancy tissues, the concentrations of NPs are higher at the target spots. Thus, NPs have been extensively investigated for the delivery of small molecules and nucleic acids and as well as for imaging purposes. In recent years, the use of nanomedicine especially drug formulation by polymeric NPs has shown a great deal of promise to provide solutions to such problems in improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing systemic toxicity in cancer treatment (Chen et al., 2014;Long et al., 2014;Morton et al., 2014;Zhao et al., 2014).",

Breast cancer is a disease that usually features leaky blood vessels with high permeability. The defective vasculature architecture, created as a result of the rapid vascularization that is necessary to serve fast-growing cancers, coupled with poor lymphatic drainage, allows an enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) of nanoformulated drugs or nanodrugs. 1,2 It is obvious that the vascular permeability of tumor tissues directly correlates with the nanodrug retention in vivo. This feature can be utilized for enhancing cancer therapeutic efficacy. Because the vascular mediator plays an important role in modulation of tumor vascular permeability, administration of the vascular antagonists can significantly suppress the EPR effect in tumors. 3 Rolipram, an anti-inflammatory drug, was incorporated into a nanoparticle and tested in a rat model of inflammatory bowel disease. 4 The rats that",

            "text": "The active cargo can be easily encapsulated or covalently bonded with the nanocarriers exploiting the chemical-physical properties of the materials that compose them (Fleige et al., 2012). The nanostructured transport systems are originally designed to increase cellular uptake and accumulation due to their nanometric size. One of the unique features of almost all solid tumors is \"leaky\" tumor vascularization and compromised lymphatic drainage. As previously described, a growing tumor mass generates a network of abnormal blood vessels (angiogenesis) for increasing oxygen and nutrients supply. This feature, combined with the poor lymphatic clearance typical of tumor masses, allows particles between 10 and 100 nm in size to passively penetrate through the pores of blood vessel walls and accumulate preferentially in tumor sites rather than in other healthy tissues. This effect, known as enhanced permeability and retention, (EPR) has shown promising results compared to standard therapies in terms of reduced toxicity in healthy tissues and increased drug concentration at the target site. Over the past 20 years, a variety of nano-carriers such as liposomes, micelles, albumin nanoparticles and polymeric conjugates have been approved for the treatment of various tumors (Ventola, 2017). However, the nanocarrier exploiting the EPR effect must necessarily have a long circulation time in the blood to arrive at the target area. One of the approaches commonly used to increase the efficiency of drug transport to cells and cancerous tissues is to modify the surface of nanocarriers with watersoluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). Because of their hydrophilic nature, PEG chains create a hydrated cloud that protects the surface from aggregation, opsonization, and phagocytosis, increasing blood circulation time (Suk et al., 2016). Doxil R , PEG-coated liposomal doxorubicin was approved by the US FDA in 1995 and is used for the treatment of breast cancer through the accumulation of passive cancer. However, the passive targeting of drug carrier systems through the EPR effect has some limitations. First, the EPR effect is highly biologically dependent on the degree of vascularization and angiogenesis of the tumor.",

            "text": "Drug delivery is a process which includes the administration, distribution and engagement of the drug and drug molecules with their target aimed at achieving therapeutic effects at site of action and or systemic effects. The term 'drug' may represent biologics, peptides, nucleic acids, transgenes or small molecules, among others. Targeted approaches for the delivery of therapeutics to cancer cells typically employ systemic administration or loco-regional delivery targeted at localising the payload at the target site while maintaining steady bioavailability, as illustrated in Fig. 1 [14]. The overarching goal of cancer drug delivery systems is to ensure continuous availability of optimal drug molecule concentrations at receptor sites for the desired pharmacological effects and anti-tumour activity. Possibly, the hyper-permeability of tumour vasculature and the lack of a lymphatic drainage system are attributed to the accumulation and retention of drug molecules in tumours. These, collectively referred to as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which was discovered by Matsumura and Maeda became a leveraging point on which non-viral drug delivery nanoparticle development was based [15]. However, subsequent evidence shows that EPR effect is not observed in all tumours due to inherent heterogeneity in endothelial vasculature and stromal architecture of different tumour types as well as differences in size and molecular structure of payload that is delivered, highlighting on the unreliability of EPR in the development of cancer selective drug delivery platforms [16][17][18]. This subsequently resulted in imbalance between drug distribution by non-viral delivery systems and tumour uptake in in vitro studies [17]. Additional evidence shows the overreliance on EPR in non-viral (nanoparticles) drug delivery technology platforms is challenged by less than 1% of nanocarriers reaching targeted tumour sites in tumours with high EPR (highly porous and leaky vasculature), but instead nanoparticles are trafficked into solid tumours (and their microenvironment) via an active, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent process called transcytosis [19,20].",

            "text": "Abnormal angiogenesis around the solid tumor causes the large gaps (~100 nm) between endothelial cells in blood vessels, thus resulting in a higher permeability of nanoparticles into the tumor site. The quick growth of the tumor leads to loss of lymphatic reflux, thus making those trapped nanoparticles stay in the tumor. Therefore, nanoparticles reveal a great ability to target the solid tumor due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. \n\nMaximizing the PS concentration in a solid tumor and controlling the 1 O 2 production within the cancer cells is a daunting challenge. NPs act as a promising PS carrier to the tumor through the passive EPR effect. Thus, a lower dose is required, which lessens side effects and provides a better therapeutic outcome compared to free PS treatment [88]. PEGylation of the surface of NPs with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to mask the NPs from the host immune system and increase their hydrodynamic size, which reduces renal clearance, is the most frequently used method to prolong NPs in blood circulation and increase drug accumulation at the tumor site [89]. Recently, surface modification by zwitterionic polymers has shown improved NP stabilization, longer retention in blood, and enhanced retention in the tumor compared to standard PEGylation, due to the super-hydrophilic nature and responsive properties of the pH [90][91][92]. Surface-modified nanocarriers with the EPR effect benefit PS delivery into tumors; however, only around 0.7% injected dose (ID) of nanocarriers are accumulated at the tumor site at the end [93]. Therefore, developing active targeting strategies has become an important direction to improve the efficiency of PS delivery.",

            "text": "Diseased tissues are frequently characterized by the gaps between endothelial cells. These gaps increase endothelial permittivity to large particles, such as NPs, while having no effect on the extravasation of small molecules [182]. Subsequent residence time of NPs within the diseased tissue is theoretically increased, as compared to the small molecules based on NP size. This phenomenon, referred to as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, remains the driving force for a significant number of NP applications, since its discovery in the 1980s [183]. Passive targeting effectiveness is primarily influenced by MSN size, shape, and surface charge [184]. While preclinical evidence supporting the efficacy of the EPR effect is vast, clinical studies showed that passively targeted NPs are not more effective than lone molecules [185][186][187][188]. The differences in efficacy in preclinical animal models and human subjects are thought to be the results of innate differences in physiology and tumor features. Irregular or lack of blood flow in solid tumor bodies along with passive targeting inability to target metastatic tumor cells are additional sources of EPR ineffectiveness [188]. While MSNs did not undergo clinical trials to assess their passive targeting effectiveness in humans, current evidence from other NP formulations suggest that active targeting is a better strategy.",

This approach enhanced the uniformity of the spheroids and peritumoral angiogenic capacity compared to spheroids composed of only cancer cells. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the tumor-EC hybrid spheroids exhibited expression profiles associated with aggressive behaviors, such as cancer progression, invasion and metastasis. The blood vessels sprouting around the hybrid spheroids on the chip displayed the distinctive characteristics of leaky tumor vessels. We further validated the suppressive effects of axitinib on tumor growth and angiogenesis, depending on exposure dose and time. Notably, we successfully induced both lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis around the tumor hybrid spheroids by promoting interstitial flow. In summary, our findings demonstrated that vascularized tumor-on-a-chip reproduces various characteristics of vascularized tumors.

Abstract Most pediatric cancers are highly chemo-sensitive, and cytotoxic chemotherapy has always been the mainstay of treatment. Anthracyclines are highly effective against most types of childhood cancer, such as neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, nephroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and so forth.

This mechanism has the potential to minimize acute and chronic toxicities, including cardiotoxicity, as well as maximize the efficacy of chemotherapy through synergy with tumor-targeting accumulation of the active molecules and possible dose-escalation. Simply replacing doxorubicin with P-THP in a given regimen can improve outcomes in anthracycline-sensitive pediatric cancers with little risk of adverse effects, such as cardiotoxicity.

Conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the principal approaches for treating metastasizing tumors, but the lack of targeting results in severe side effects and low treatment efficacy. Nanoparticles reportedly increase selectivity, given that they can accumulate at specific locations owing to the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. In this respect, plasmonic nanoparticles, such as gold nanorods (AuNRs), are interesting because of their photothermal and optical properties, making them suitable for biomedical applications, such as drug delivery, tumor ablation, and theranostics. To increase the tumor accumulation of AuNRs, extracellular vesicles (with sizes ranging from 40\u2013150 nm) have attracted attention because of their remarkable biocompatibility and natural cell-accumulation selectivity. To further increase the targeting properties of the nanosystem, we functionalized the AuNRs with methotrexate (MTX), which is known to interact with the overexpressed folate receptors in cancer cells. We combined the inherent homing properties of exosomes from B16F10 cells with the active targeting properties of MTX to increase the accumulation of AuNRs in metastatic lung melanoma tumors. Methods We obtained and exhaustively characterized B16F10 exosomes loaded with MTX-functionalized AuNRs (EXOS-AuNR-MTX). The safety of the complete nanosystem, as well as its specific and time-dependent accumulation in B16F10 cells, was determined using the mitochondrial MTS assay and fluorescence analysis, respectively. Results Surface functionalization with MTX in combination with B16F10 EXOS was used to promote the accumulation of AuNRs in metastatic lung nodules, with significantly greater amounts of gold in the tumors following EXOS-AuNR-MTX treatment than following only AuNR-MTX treatment, as was determined in vivo and ex vivo by quantitative gold measurements. Remarkably, 5.5% of the injected dose of the AuNRs was recovered at the tumor sites, whereas only 1% of the injected dose usually accumulated in tumors due to the EPR effect, as reported. We further confirmed the preferential accumulation of AuNRs from EXOS-AuNR-MTX rather than from AuNR-MTX in tumor vessels and tumor nodules rather than healthy tissues by histological analysis. Conclusion Our approach provides a valuable tool to improve the accumulation of gold nanoparticles in metastatic tumor nodules by combining the natural properties of exosomes to drive the targeting of AuNR-MTX.",

AMT-253 is currently being evaluated in a Phase I first-in-human clinical trial (NCT05906862).\n Citation Format: Jing Shi, Jiaqing Yan, Yaling Huang, Jun Guo, Yan Kong, Xun Meng, Shu-Hui Liu.

However, in the absence of a persistent EPR effect, the peritumoral endothelium can function as an access barrier to tumors and negatively affect the effectiveness of NPs. In recognition of the peritumoral endothelium as a potential barrier in drug delivery to tumors, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs are modified with a quinic acid (QA) derivative, synthetic mimic of selectin ligands. QA-decorated NPs (QA-NP) interact with human umbilical vein endothelial cells expressing E-/P-selectins and induce transient increase in endothelial permeability to translocate across the layer. QA-NP reach selectin-upregulated tumors, achieving greater tumor accumulation and paclitaxel (PTX) delivery than polyethylene glycol-decorated NPs (PEG-NP). PTX-loaded QA-NP show greater anticancer efficacy than Taxol or PTX-loaded PEG-NP at the equivalent PTX dose in different animal models and dosing regimens. Repeated dosing of PTX-loaded QA-NP for two weeks results in complete tumor remission in 40-60% of MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice, while those receiving control treatments succumb to death. QA-NP can exploit the interaction with selectin-expressing peritumoral endothelium and deliver anticancer drugs to tumors to a greater extent than the level currently possible with the EPR effect.",

Since anti\u2010CTLA\u20104 antibodies block immunosuppressive signals mainly in the lymph nodes (LNs), efficient drug delivery to the lymphatic system is desirable. However, the immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially anti\u2010CTLA\u20104 are currently administered intravenously (i.v.), resulting in limited efficacy in controlling solid tumor and inhibiting metastases, and the method of administration has not been optimized. Here, we show that a combination of local radiotherapy and administration of anti\u2010CTLA\u20104 antibodies using a lymphatic drug delivery system (LDDS) suppresses solid tumor and metastases. We compared the efficacy of LDDS\u2010based immunotherapy or radioimmunotherapy with i.v. administration in a solid\u2010tumor model created by subcutaneous inoculation into LN\u2010swollen mice with osteosarcoma cells. Tumor\u2010bearing mice were divided into various groups (no treatment, immunotherapy [i.v. or LDDS], radiotherapy, and radioimmunotherapy [i.v. or LDDS]) and were observed for 28\u2009days. Immunotherapy was administered with a cumulative dose of 10\u2009mg/kg of anti\u2010CTLA\u20104 monoclonal antibody, and radiotherapy was administered with a cumulative 8\u2009Gy of fractionated X\u2010ray irradiation. For immunotherapy alone, LDDS provided slight tumor growth inhibition but did not inhibit distant metastasis. For radioimmunotherapy, however, tumor growth was delayed and distant metastasis was suppressed compared with radiotherapy alone.

            "abstract": "The unique physiology of tumors limits the efficacy of chemotherapeutics. In efforts to improve the effectiveness of the existing chemotherapy drugs, nanomedicine emerged as a new hope but proved inadequate due to the transport barriers present within the tumor tissues, which limits the potential of nanomedicine. Dense collagen networks in fibrotic tissues contribute to hindering the penetration of molecular- or nano-scale medicine through tumor interstitium. In the present study, human serum albumin (HSA)-based nanoparticles (NPs) were developed for gemcitabine (GEM) and losartan (LST), which could offer secreted protein acids rich in cysteine (SPARC) and enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR)-mediated drug accumulation in tumors. Also, the tumor microenvironment (TME) modulation approach using LST was coupled to investigate the impact on antitumor efficacy. GEM-HSA NPs and LST-HSA NPs were prepared by the desolvation-cross-linking method and characterized for size, potential, morphology, drug loading, drug-polymer interactions, and hemocompatibility. For investigating the efficacy of prepared NPs, cytotoxicity and mechanisms of cell death were elucidated in vitro by using various assays. Intracellular uptake studies of prepared HSA NPs indicated their uptake and cytoplasmic localization. Furthermore, in vivo studies demonstrated significantly improved anticancer efficacy of GEM-HSA NPs in combination with LST pretreatment. Extended LST treatment further improved the anticancer potential. It was shown that the improved efficacy of the nanomedicine was correlated with the reduced thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and collagen level in tumor tissue upon LST pretreatment. Moreover, this approach exhibited augmented nanomedicine accumulation in the tumor, and hematological, biochemical, and tissue histology indicated the safety profile of this combination regimen.

            "text": "The unique physiology of tumors limits the efficacy of chemotherapeutics. In efforts to improve the effectiveness of the existing chemotherapy drugs, nanomedicine emerged as a new hope but proved inadequate due to the transport barriers present within the tumor tissues, which limits the potential of nanomedicine. Dense collagen networks in fibrotic tissues contribute to hindering the penetration of molecular- or nano-scale medicine through tumor interstitium. In the present study, human serum albumin (HSA)-based nanoparticles (NPs) were developed for gemcitabine (GEM) and losartan (LST), which could offer secreted protein acids rich in cysteine (SPARC) and enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR)-mediated drug accumulation in tumors. Also, the tumor microenvironment (TME) modulation approach using LST was coupled to investigate the impact on antitumor efficacy. GEM-HSA NPs and LST-HSA NPs were prepared by the desolvation-cross-linking method and characterized for size, potential, morphology, drug loading, drug-polymer interactions, and hemocompatibility. For investigating the efficacy of prepared NPs, cytotoxicity and mechanisms of cell death were elucidated in vitro by using various assays. Intracellular uptake studies of prepared HSA NPs indicated their uptake and cytoplasmic localization. Furthermore, in vivo studies demonstrated significantly improved anticancer efficacy of GEM-HSA NPs in combination with LST pretreatment. Extended LST treatment further improved the anticancer potential. It was shown that the improved efficacy of the nanomedicine was correlated with the reduced thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and collagen level in tumor tissue upon LST pretreatment. Moreover, this approach exhibited augmented nanomedicine accumulation in the tumor, and hematological, biochemical, and tissue histology indicated the safety profile of this combination regimen. Concisely, the undertaken study demonstrated the potential of the triple targeting (SPARC, EPR, TME modulation) approach for augmented efficacy of chemotherapeutics.",

Inspired by the mechanism and our previous finding about fructans and fructooligosaccharides from Platycodon grandiflorus (FFPG), we developed a nano drug delivery system (NDDS) targeting lung cancer. The aim was to improve the efficiency of the liposomal delivery of Paclitaxel (PTX) and enhance the anti-tumor efficacy. Methods: The FFPG-Lip-PTX NDDS was prepared by electrostatic adsorption. Dynamic light scattering, zeta potential, and transmission electron microscopy were used for physical characterization. The release behavior of the NDDS was simulated by dialysis. The uptake of the NDDS was observed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Cytotoxicity, apoptosis, migration, and invasion experiments were used to evaluate the anti-tumor ability of the NDDS in vitro. The penetration and inhibition of tumor proliferation were further analyzed via a 3D tumor sphere model. Finally, in vivo biological distribution and pharmacodynamic experiments verified the targeting and anti-tumor ability of the FFPG-Lip-PTX NDDS. Results: FFPG-Lip-PTX possessed a homogeneous particle size distribution, high encapsulation efficiency, and stability. In vitro experiments confirmed that FFPG promoted the uptake of the NNDS by tumor cells and enhanced cytotoxicity. It also increased the anti-tumor effect by promoting cell apoptosis and inhibiting invasion and metastasis. The same conclusion was obtained in 3D tumor spheres. In vivo experiments exhibited that FFPG-lips-PTX showed more significant lung cancer-targeting activity and anti-tumor effects. Conclusions: In this study, a novel lung-targeted NDDS is proposed to enhance the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy drugs on lung cancer.",

Based on the EPR effect, pharmaceutical nanoparticles with a higher circulation time in the blood are collected in tumor tissues with enhanced vascular permeability, and this tool is commonly used for selective drug delivery into tumors through passive accumulation.

They named this the EPR effect (enhanced permeability and retention), the mechanism by which large molecules accumulate in tumors. Based on the EPR effect, pharmaceutical nanoparticles with a higher circulation time in the blood are collected in tumor tissues with enhanced vascular permeability, and this tool is commonly used for selective drug delivery into tumors through passive accumulation. In fact, EPR drug delivery does not work on normal tissues (Torchilin, 2011)."

This results in leaks in the vasculature, from which nanomedicines can penetrate the tumor.

Some tumors have a very dense extracellular matrix with very limited EPR-based accumulation (e.g., pancreatic ductal carcinoma). In addition, analysis from 200 different patient tumors across eight different cancer types have revealed marked differences in the tumor vasculature and morphology, observed between tumor types, between tumors of the same type, and even within the same tumor (Golombek et al., 2018)(Lammers et al., 2012).

Some have argued that the explosion in the number of research papers has not been followed by sufficient clinical activity in nanomedicine. However, three new nanodrugs have now been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the past three years, confirming the validity of nanotechnology approaches in cancer. Excitingly, translational pipelines contain several additional intriguing candidates. In this Nano Focus article, we discuss potential barriers inhibiting further incorporation of nanomedicines into patient care, possible strategies to overcome these barriers, and promising new directions in cancer interventions based on nanotechnology. Insights presented herein are outcomes of discussions held at a recent strategic workshop hosted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which brought together research, clinical, and commercial leaders of the nanomedicine field."

EPR effect is usually induced by a leaky tumor vasculature by the accelerated angiogenesis and impaired lymphatic drainage by the disorganized growth of tumors (Greish, 2010)(Dhaliwal et al., 2019). In details, NPs with appropriate sizes can evade the tumor capillaries and be retained in the tumor tissues for days due to the lack of lymphatic drainage. Additionally, particles with high positive charges can bind non-specifically to the negatively charged luminal surface due to the presence of sulfate and carboxylate sugar moieties [106]...In contrast, Jain et al. (Jain, 1987) claimed that elevated interstitial fluid pressure and heterogeneous blood supply limit macromolecular delivery to tumors. Furthermore, a key challenge is the promotion of the EPR effect in patients with EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes since the EPR-insensitive phenotype is known to have smaller endothelial fenestrations, heterogeneously high or low pericyte coverage, more developed and branched vasculatures, a relatively dense ECR, and more developed immune profiles compared to EPR sensitive phenotypes (Dhaliwal et al., 2019). Thus, the role of EPR is still in question in terms of clinical translation and different human tumor types due to their heterogeneity (Dhaliwal et al., 2019)(Golombek et al., 2018).",

However, growing evidence suggests that it is over-represented in preclinical models, and agents designed solely using its principle of passive accumulation can only be applied to a narrow subset of clinical tumors. For this reason, strategies that can improve upon the EPR effect to facilitate nanomedicine delivery to otherwise non-responsive tumors are required for broad clinical translation. EPR-adaptive nanomedicine delivery comprises a class of chemical and physical techniques that modify tumor accessibility in an effort to increase agent delivery and therapeutic effect. In the present review, we overview the primary benefits and limitations of radiation, ultrasound, hyperthermia, and photodynamic therapy as physical strategies for EPR-adaptive delivery to EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes, and we reflect upon changes in the preclinical research pathway that should be implemented in order to optimally validate and develop these delivery strategies."

Furthermore, a key challenge is the promotion of the EPR effect in patients with EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes since the EPR-insensitive phenotype is known to have smaller endothelial fenestrations, heterogeneously high or low pericyte coverage, more developed and branched vasculatures, a relatively dense ECR, and more developed immune profiles compared to EPR sensitive phenotypes (Dhaliwal et al., 2019). Thus, the role of EPR is still in question in terms of clinical translation and different human tumor types due to their heterogeneity (Dhaliwal et al., 2019)(Golombek et al., 2018)."

The liposome is tagged with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the F(ab')2 fragment of human monoclonal antibody GAH, which positively reacts to >90% of cancerous stomach tissues, but negatively to all normal tissues. In preclinical studies, MCC-465 showed superior cytotoxic activity against several human stomach cancer cells compared with DXR or DXR-incorporated PEG liposomes. The main purpose of this trial was to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting toxicity (DLT), recommended phase II dose and pharmacokinetics (PK) of MCC-465.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nPatients with metastatic or recurrent stomach cancer were eligible for entry. The initial dose was 6.5 mg/m2. MCC-465 was administered as a 1-h infusion every 3 weeks and the treatment continued for up to six cycles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-three patients received a total of 62 cycles at the 6.5-45.5 mg/m2 dose level. DLTs were myelosuppression and appetite loss at the 45.5 mg/m2 dose level. Other toxicities were mild. Neither palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia nor cardiotoxicity was observed. Acute reactions related to infusion were observed commonly in 16 patients over the entire dose range. While no antitumor response was observed, stable disease (SD) was observed in 10 out of 18 evaluable patients. The pharmacokinetic study showed a similar AUC and Cmax to Doxil.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMCC-465 was well tolerated. The recommended dose for a phase II study of MCC-465, for a 3-week schedule, is considered to be 32.5 mg/m2 in an equivalent amount of DXR."

Major scientific reasons for repeated failures of such therapeutic approaches are attributed to reductionist approaches to research and infinite numbers of genetic mutations in chaotic molecular environment of solid tumors that are bases of drug development.

Using the population-based Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked dataset, we identified 374\u2009331 patients \u226567 years of age with a new primary diagnosis of breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, bladder, uterine, pancreatic, gastric cancer, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma from 2005 through 2013. Cancer patients were individually matched by demographics and comorbidities to Medicare beneficiaries without cancer, who served as controls. Validated diagnosis codes were used to identify arterial thromboembolic events, defined as a composite of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. The Mantel-Haenszel estimator was used to compare risks of arterial thromboembolic events between cancer and noncancer groups during 30-day periods in the 360 days before date of cancer diagnosis. From 360 to 151 days before cancer diagnosis, the 30-day interval risks of arterial thromboembolic events were similar between cancer patients and matched controls. From 150 to 1 day before cancer diagnosis, the interval 30-day risks of arterial thromboembolic events were higher in cancer patients vs matched controls, progressively increasing as the cancer diagnosis date approached and peaking during the 30 days immediately before cancer diagnosis, when 2313 (0.62%) cancer patients were diagnosed with an arterial thromboembolic event vs 413 (0.11%) controls (odds ratio, 5.63; 95% confidence interval, 5.07-6.25). In conclusion, the risk of arterial thromboembolic events begins to increase 150 days before the date of cancer diagnosis in older persons and peaks in the 30 days before."

The basic pathophysiological phenomenon of EPR is hyperpermeable tumor vasculature combined with impaired lymphatic drainage, resulting in enhanced permeability and retention of molecules (Nichols et al., 2014)(Azzopardi et al., 2013). Although the conventional EPR effect results in improved delivery to tumors compared with normal tissue, some tumors do not exhibit the EPR effect and the permeability of vessels may not be the same throughout a single tumor (Sriraman et al., 2014)(Jain, 1998). Moreover, the rapid proliferation of cancer cells around the vessels may impede therapeu-tic molecule penetration (Grantab et al., 2006). Therefore, the killing of perivascular cancer cells will help improve the EPR effect.",

The advent of engineered nanoparticles has allowed us to circumvent the initial limitations to drug delivery such as pharmacokinetics and solubility. However, in spite of significant advances to tumor targeting, an effective treatment strategy for malignant tumors still remains elusive. Tumors possess distinct physiological features which allow them to resist traditional treatment approaches. This combined with the complexity of the biological system presents significant hurdles to the site-specific delivery of therapeutic drugs. One of the key features of engineered nanoparticles is that these can be tailored to execute specific functions. With this review, we hope to provide the reader with a clear understanding and knowledge of biological barriers and the methods to exploit these characteristics to design multifunctional nanocarriers, effect useful dosing regimens and subsequently improve therapeutic outcomes in the clinic.",

Strategies to enhance drug penetration have potential to improve therapeutic outcome. The development of multicellular layers (MCLs), in which tumor cells are grown on a semipermeable Teflon support membrane, has facilitated quantification of drug penetration through solid tissue. The goals of the present study were to quantify the penetration of anticancer drugs as a function of cellular adhesion and packing density and to determine the effects of variable penetration on therapeutic efficacy in this model system. We compared the properties of MCLs grown from two epithelioid and round subclones of a colon carcinoma cell line. One pair of epithelioid and round sublines differed in expression of alpha-E-catenin, and both pairs generated MCLs with different packing density. The penetration of commonly used anticancer agents (paclitaxel, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil) through MCLs derived from these cell lines was significantly greater through the round (loosely packed) than through the epithelioid (tightly packed) sublines. In MCLs treated with doxorubicin, we observed greater survival in the tightly packed cell lines than in the loosely packed cell lines. Impaired penetration of anticancer agents through MCLs derived from the tightly packed cell lines and relative resistance to killing of cells within them by doxorubicin treatment strengthen the role of tumor cell adhesion and packing density as contributing to drug resistance.",

The EPR effect of macromolecules in cancer tissues is defined, and the distinction between the EPR effect (with reference to clearance of macromolecules from the interstitial space of tumor tissues) and the simple passive targeting of drugs to tumors is described. Additional points of discussion include the uniqueness of tumor vessels, the influence of kinin and other vascular mediators such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins, and the heterogeneity of the EPR effect. Two different strategies to augment the EPR effect that were discovered are elevating blood pressure artificially via slow infusion of angiotensin II and applying nitroglycerin or other NO donors. Use of the nitroagent increased not only the blood flow of the tumor, but also the delivery of drug to the tumor and the drug's therapeutic effect. This finding shows an intriguing analogy to hypoxic cardiac infarct tissue, in that both are improved by NO. These two methods were applied to treatment of rodents and human cancers, in combination with other anticancer agents, with successful results achieved in rodents as well as humans. These data suggest very appealing prospects for utilization of the EPR effect in future development of cancer therapeutics.",

This enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, whilst recognized as a major breakthrough in anti-tumoral targeting, has not yet been fully exploited in infection. Shared pathophysiological pathways in both cancer and infection are evident and a number of novel nanomedicines have shown promise in selective, passive, size-mediated targeting to infection. This review describes the similarities and parallels in pathophysiological pathways at molecular, cellular and circulatory levels between inflammation/infection and cancer therapy, where use of this principle has been established."

For example, therapeutic agents have been integrated with nanoparticles engineered with optimal sizes, shapes, and surface properties to increase their solubility, prolong their circulation half-life, improve their biodistribution, and reduce their immunogenicity. Nanoparticles and their payloads have also been favorably delivered into tumors by taking advantage of the pathophysiological conditions, such as the enhanced permeability and retention effect, and the spatial variations in the pH\u2005value. Additionally, targeting ligands (e.g., small organic molecules, peptides, antibodies, and nucleic acids) have been added to the surface of nanoparticles to specifically target cancerous cells through selective binding to the receptors overexpressed on their surface.

Advances in protein engineering and materials science have contributed to novel nanoscale targeting approaches that may bring new hope to cancer patients. Several therapeutic nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use. However, to date, there are only a few clinically approved nanocarriers that incorporate molecules to selectively bind and target cancer cells. This review examines some of the approved formulations and discusses the challenges in translating basic research to the clinic. We detail the arsenal of nanocarriers and molecules available for selective tumour targeting, and emphasize the challenges in cancer treatment. Cancer remains one of the world's most devastating diseases, with more than 10 million new cases every year 1. However, mortality has decreased in the past two years 2 owing to better understanding of tumour biology and improved diagnostic devices and treatments. Current cancer treatments include surgical intervention, radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, which often also kill healthy cells and cause toxicity to the patient. It would therefore be desirable to develop chemotherapeutics that can either passively or actively target cancerous cells. Passive targeting exploits the characteristic features of tumour biology that allow nanocarriers to accumulate in the tumour by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect 2. Passively targeting nanocarriers first reached clinical trials in the mid-1980s, and the first products, based on liposomes and polymer\u2013protein conjugates, were marketed in the mid-1990s. Later, therapeutic nanocarriers based on this strategy were approved for wider use (Table 1) and methods of further enhancing targeting of drugs to cancer cells were investigated. Active approaches achieve this by conjugating nanocarriers containing chemotherapeutics with molecules that bind to overexpressed antigens or receptors on the target cells. Recent reviews provide perspective on the use of nanotechnology as a fundamental tool in cancer research and nanomedicine 3,4. Here we focus on the potential of nanocarriers and molecules that can selectively target tumours, and highlight the challenges in translating some of the basic research to the clinic.

As tumorigenesis occurs, the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) induces the formation of a disordered, complex vascular network feeding tumor cells as they proliferate. High expression of VEGF in tumor tissue has been implicated in the formation of abnormal vascular wall morphology, where the endothelium lining the blood vessels contains large gaps-or \"leaky\" junctions-allowing for enhanced permeability of small particles and cells across the vascular wall. It is this enhanced permeability that is a double-edged sword for cancer: on the one hand, it is believed to enhance tumor metastasis by allowing the escape of tumor cells into the infiltrating vessels, which circulate them across the body to distant metastatic sites (Iyer et al., 2006); on the other hand, the leaky vasculature unique to the tumor microenvironment promotes the accumulation of systemically circulating nanoparticles at the tumor site, a phenomenon that should enhance the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle drugs against solid tumors. Despite the premise of the EPR effect to preferentially enhance the uptake of nanoparticles in tumors, the challenges we have outlined above clearly indicate there remains significant room for improving nanoparticle delivery. Uptake into tumor tissue via the EPR effect alone has been found to result in a mere 2-fold increase in accumulation of systemically injected drugs (Nakamura et al., 2016). While drugs piggybacking on the EPR effect have excelled in preclinical models, they have yet to find clinical success in humans (Danhier, 2016). For many anti-cancer drugs, such as chemotherapeutics that are inherently toxic, systemic injection of even nanoparticle formulations must be done at very high doses to achieve significant drug accumulation via the EPR effect; this occurs, however, at the cost of off-target toxicity that limits the administered dose and therefore, the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs [39].",

Nanosized drugs have a large loading capacity, the ability to protect the payload from degradation, a large surface on which to conjugate targeting ligands, and controlled or sustained release. Nanosized drugs also leak preferentially into tumor tissue through permeable tumor vessels and are then retained in the tumor bed due to reduced lymphatic drainage. This process is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, while the EPR effect is widely held to improve delivery of nanodrugs to tumors, it in fact offers less than a 2-fold increase in nanodrug delivery compared with critical normal organs, resulting in drug concentrations that are not sufficient for curing most cancers. In this Review, we first overview various barriers for nanosized drug delivery with an emphasis on the capillary wall's resistance, the main obstacle to delivering drugs. Then, we discuss current regulatory issues facing nanomedicine. Finally, we discuss how to make the delivery of nanosized drugs to tumors more effective by building on the EPR effect."

It is generally believed that enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) plays a key role in nanocarriers' accumulation in preclinical tumor models and is a clinically relevant phenomenon in certain cancer types. However, use of EPR effect as an across-the-board explanation for nanoparticle tumor access is likely over-simplified, particularly in the stroma rich solid tumors such as PDAC. Recently, ample evidences including our own data showed that it is possible to use transcytosis as a major mechanism for PDAC drug delivery. In this mini-review, we summarize the key studies that discuss how transcytosis can be employed to enhance EPR effect in PDAC, and potentially, other cancer malignancies.

To move the field forward, we have to improve our understanding of the EPR effect, of its cancer type-specific pathophysiology, of nanomedicine interactions with the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, of nanomedicine behavior in the body, and of translational aspects that specifically complicate nanomedicinal drug development.

We reported that restoring obstructed tumor blood flow overcomes impaired drug delivery, leading to improved EPR effects. I also discuss gaps between small animal cancers used in experimental models and large clinical cancers in humans, which usually involve heterogeneous EPR effects, vascular abnormalities in multiple necrotic foci, and tumor emboli. Here, I emphasize arterial infusion of oily formulations of nanodrugs into tumor-feeding arteries, which is the most tumor-selective drug delivery method, with tumor/blood ratios of 100-fold. This method is literally the most personalized medicine because arterial infusions differ for each patient, and drug doses infused depend on tumor size and anatomy in each patient.

Approximately half of the tumour models evaluated exhibited tumour size-dependent accumulation of FCE28068; smaller tumours had the highest accumulation. Administration of free Dox (5\u00a0mg/kg) produced tumour levels of <2.5\u00a0% dose/g independent of tumour size. Whereas the degree of EPR-mediated targeting showed ~12-fold difference across the tumour models evaluated, Dox release from FCE28068 at 1\u00a0h displayed ~200-fold variation.ConclusionsMarked heterogeneity was seen in terms of EPR effect and Dox release rate, underlining the need to carefully calibrate tumour models used to benchmark nanomedicines against known relevant standard agents and for optimal development of strategies for late pre-clinical and clinical development."

We show that blood vessels in both a xenografted tumor and primary human tumors contain a sizable fraction of immature blood vessels that have not yet recruited periendothelial cells. These immature vessels are selectively obliterated as a consequence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) withdrawal. In a xenografted glioma, the selective vulnerability of immature vessels to VEGF loss was demonstrated by downregulating VEGF transgene expression using a tetracycline-regulated expression system. In human prostate cancer, the constitutive production of VEGF by the glandular epithelium was suppressed as a consequence of androgen-ablation therapy. VEGF loss led, in turn, to selective apoptosis of endothelial cells in vessels devoid of periendothelial cells. These results suggest that the unique dependence on VEGF of blood vessels lacking periendothelial cells can be exploited to reduce an existing tumor vasculature."

For such tumors, the improvement of EPR-based drug delivery is necessary by modifying tumor blood vessels, angiogenesis, a vascular edifice, blood flow, etc. The EPR effect can be enhanced by modifying vascular intermediaries such as angiotensin II, nitroglycerin or NO, CO, and enzyme inhibitors [7](Wu, 2021)(Islam et al., 2021)(Haider et al., 2021). An integration of vascular mediators with a nanodrug may be an important strategy for an enhanced EPR effect.

However, treatment of advanced cancers remains a huge challenge in clinical situations because of occluded or embolized tumor blood vessels, which lead to so-called heterogeneity of the EPR effect. We previously developed a method to restore impaired blood flow in blood vessels by using nitric oxide donors and other agents called EPR-effect enhancers. Here, we show that two novel EPR-effect enhancers\u2014isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN, Nitrol\u00ae) and sildenafil citrate\u2014strongly potentiated delivery of three macromolecular drugs to tumors: a complex of poly(styrene-co-maleic acid) (SMA) and cisplatin, named Smaplatin\u00ae (chemotherapy); poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) polymer-conjugated zinc protoporphyrin (photodynamic therapy and imaging); and SMA glucosamine-conjugated boric acid complex (boron neutron capture therapy). We tested these nanodrugs in mice with advanced C26 tumors. When these nanomedicines were administered together with ISDN or sildenafil, tumor delivery and thus positive therapeutic results increased two- to four-fold in tumors with diameters of 15 mm or more. These results confirmed the rationale for using EPR-effect enhancers to restore tumor blood flow.

Overexpression of PDE-5 has been reported in lung, colon, metastatic breast cancers, and bladder squamous carcinoma. Moreover, sildenafil has been reported to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells of different origins to the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents with augmented apoptosis mediated through inducing the downregulation of Bcl-xL and FAP-1 expression, enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, phosphorylating BAD and Bcl-2, upregulating caspase-3,8,9 activities, and blocking cells at G0/G1 cell cycle phase. Sildenafil has also demonstrated inhibitory effects on the efflux activity of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as ABCC4, ABCC5, ABCB1, and ABCG2, ultimately reversing multidrug resistance. Accordingly, there has been a growing interest in using sildenafil as monotherapy or chemoadjuvant in EPR augmentation and management of different types of cancer. In this review, we critically examine the basic molecular mechanism of sildenafil related to cancer biology and discuss the overall potential of sildenafil in enhancing EPR-based anticancer drug delivery, pointing to the outcomes of the most important related preclinical and clinical studies."

However, many clinical cancers such as late-stage tumors and refractory tumors are associated with poor blood flow due to the coagulation and thrombi formation exhibiting poor EPR effect [7](Wu, 2021)(Islam et al., 2021)(Haider et al., 2021)(Huang et al., 2021)(Subrahmanyam et al., 2021). For such tumors, the improvement of EPR-based drug delivery is necessary by modifying tumor blood vessels, angiogenesis, a vascular edifice, blood flow, etc. The EPR effect can be enhanced by modifying vascular intermediaries such as angiotensin II, nitroglycerin or NO, CO, and enzyme inhibitors [7](Wu, 2021)(Islam et al., 2021)(Haider et al., 2021). An integration of vascular mediators with a nanodrug may be an important strategy for an enhanced EPR effect. Further, targeting tumor stroma and extracellular matrix, and controlling tumor vessels, may improve EPR-targeted drug delivery to tumors (Fang, 2022)"

These properties of tumors provide favorable conditions for designing tumor-targeted antitumor NPs.

Dox micelles with a small particle size and high encapsulation efficiency were obtained using a pH-induced self-assembly method. Compared with free Dox, Dox micelles exhibited improved cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and cellular uptake. In addition, Dox micelles showed a sustained release behavior in vitro, and in a transgenic zebrafish model, Dox micelles exhibited a longer circulation time and lower extravasation from blood vessels into surrounding tissues. Anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities of Dox micelles were investigated in transgenic zebrafish and mouse models. In transgenic zebrafish, Dox micelles inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing zebrafish. Furthermore, Dox micelles suppressed tumor metastasis by killing CTCs. In addition, improved anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities were also confirmed in mouse tumor models, where immunofluorescent staining of tumors indicated that Dox micelles induced more apoptosis and showed fewer proliferation-positive cells. There were decreased side effects in transgenic zebrafish and mice after administration of Dox micelles. In conclusion, Dox micelles showed stronger anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities and decreased side effects both in vitro and in vivo, which may have potential applications in cancer therapy.",

Blood vessels in tumors form quickly and poorly as a result of an increased rate of angiogenesis to meet the increased demands for nutrients and oxygen (Ejigah et al., 2022). The newly-formed blood vessels are distorted and the endothelial cells are poorly aligned with large openings (Greish, 2012). The tumor's vascular wall also exhibits substantial structural abnormalities due to the absence of perivascular cells and smooth muscle layers (Ejigah et al., 2022)(Greish, 2012). The tumor's leaky vasculature facilitates the transport of macromolecules and nanoparticles into the tumor tissue while the complementary poor lymphatic drainage prevents clearance of the macromolecules and nanoparticles, leading to their accumulation within the tumor tissue (Miao et al., 2017)(Ejigah et al., 2022)(Fang et al., 2011). Thus, the differences in the blood vessels of tumors and healthy tissues make targeting possible (Fang et al., 2011)(Natfji et al., 2017). This phenomenon and passive tumor targeting is referred to as the EPR effect (Ejigah et al., 2022)(Greish, 2012)...Blood vessels in pancreatic adenocarcinoma may collapse or become clogged because of the dense stroma (Figure 2) and various extracellular components which induce stress and constriction, affecting the extravasation of macromolecules and particles into tumor tissues [67,(Rajora et al., 2014)(Fang et al., 2020)(Edwards et al., 2021). This may explain why nanotherapeutics have not demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, other studies have reported that the EPR effect in cancer is not based only on the \"leakiness\" of the vasculature because rigid tumors such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer exhibit EPR [72,73,77]78].",

In addressing this hypothesis, plasmids encoding the secretable TNF-related factor sTRAIL were loaded into lipid-coated protamine DNA complexes and administered by infusion in a murine xenograft model of human desmoplastic bladder carcinoma. Three doses were sufficient to generate approximately 70% of TAFs as sTRAIL-producing cells. sTRAIL triggered apoptosis in tumor cell nests adjacent to TAFs. Furthermore, it reverted residual fibroblasts to a quiescent state due to insufficient activation, further compromising tumor growth and remodeling the microenvironment to favor second-wave nanotherapy. We confirmed the efficacy of this strategy in an orthotopic xenograft model of human pancreatic cancer, where the desmoplastic stroma is well known to be a major barrier to the delivery of therapeutic nanoparticles.

Here, we retrospectively analyse literature data to investigate which tumour types have proved more responsive to polymer-drug conjugates and to determine correlations between the magnitude of the EPR effect and/or expression of cathepsin B. Lung, breast and ovarian cancers showed the highest response rate (30%, 47% and 41%, respectively for cathepsin-activated conjugates and 31%, 43%, 40%, across all conjugates). An analysis of literature data on cathepsin content in various tumour types showed that these tumour types had high cathepsin content (up to 3835 ng/mg for lung cancer), although marked heterogeneity was observed across different studies.

Blood vessels in tumors form quickly and poorly as a result of an increased rate of angiogenesis to meet the increased demands for nutrients and oxygen (Ejigah et al., 2022). The newly-formed blood vessels are distorted and the endothelial cells are poorly aligned with large openings (Greish, 2012). The tumor's vascular wall also exhibits substantial structural abnormalities due to the absence of perivascular cells and smooth muscle layers (Ejigah et al., 2022)(Greish, 2012). The tumor's leaky vasculature facilitates the transport of macromolecules and nanoparticles into the tumor tissue while the complementary poor lymphatic drainage prevents clearance of the macromolecules and nanoparticles, leading to their accumulation within the tumor tissue (Miao et al., 2017)(Ejigah et al., 2022)(Fang et al., 2011). Thus, the differences in the blood vessels of tumors and healthy tissues make targeting possible (Fang et al., 2011)(Natfji et al., 2017). This phenomenon and passive tumor targeting is referred to as the EPR effect (Ejigah et al., 2022)(Greish, 2012)"

The development of cancer nanomedicine has promised highly effective treatment options unprecedented by standard therapeutics. However, the therapeutic efficacy of passively targeted nanomedicine is not always satisfactory because it is largely influenced by the heterogeneity of the intensity of the EPR effect exhibited within a tumor, at different stages of a tumor, and among individual tumors. In addition, limited data on EPR effectiveness in human hinders further clinical translation of nanomedicine. This unsatisfactory therapeutic outcome in mice and humans necessitates novel approaches to improve the EPR effect. This review focuses on current attempts at overcoming the limitations of traditional EPR-dependent nanomedicine by incorporating supplementary strategies, such as additional molecular targeting, physical alteration, or physiological remodeling of the tumor microenvironment.

They showed that tumor tissues had defective blood vessels with aberrant branching and large openings between endothelial cells of around 400 nm due to their rapid proliferation and decreased number of pericytes. This unique characteristic helps macromolecules, such as nanocarriers, easily move into tumor tissues after crossing the endothelium barrier. Furthermore, solid tumors have a poor lymphatic drainage system, leading to extended retention times of nanocarriers in the tumor extracellular matrix. \n\nAlthough the EPR effect has allowed the successful development of some anticancer nanomedicines with a passive tumor-targeting mechanism (Mitchell et al., 2020), many well-designed drug delivery systems fail when tested in patients. Over the last years, the role of the EPR effect has been investigated, focusing on the influence of the TME, heterogeneity of human tumors, and differences between animal models and actual patients (Din et al., 2017)(Maeda et al., 2000)(Zi et al., 2022). These factors may contribute to the observed limited penetration of nanomedicines in human tumors, highlighting the need for further refinement of passive targeting strategies.",

As lipid-based, polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles are engineered in increasingly specified ways, they can begin to be optimized for drug delivery in a more personalized manner, entering the era of precision medicine. In this Review, we discuss advanced nanoparticle designs utilized in both non-personalized and precision applications that could be applied to improve precision therapies. We focus on advances in nanoparticle design that overcome heterogeneous barriers to delivery, arguing that intelligent nanoparticle design can improve efficacy in general delivery applications while enabling tailored designs for precision applications, thereby ultimately improving patient outcome overall.

They showed that tumor tissues had defective blood vessels with aberrant branching and large openings between endothelial cells of around 400 nm due to their rapid proliferation and decreased number of pericytes. This unique characteristic helps macromolecules, such as nanocarriers, easily move into tumor tissues after crossing the endothelium barrier. Furthermore, solid tumors have a poor lymphatic drainage system, leading to extended retention times of nanocarriers in the tumor extracellular matrix. \n\nAlthough the EPR effect has allowed the successful development of some anticancer nanomedicines with a passive tumor-targeting mechanism (Mitchell et al., 2020), many well-designed drug delivery systems fail when tested in patients. Over the last years, the role of the EPR effect has been investigated, focusing on the influence of the TME, heterogeneity of human tumors, and differences between animal models and actual patients (Din et al., 2017)(Maeda et al., 2000)(Zi et al., 2022). These factors may contribute to the observed limited penetration of nanomedicines in human tumors, highlighting the need for further refinement of passive targeting strategies."

Despite the discovery and synthesis of hundreds of thousands of anticancer compounds targeting various crucial units in cancer cell proliferation and metabolism, the fundamental problem is the lack of targeting delivery of these compounds selectively into solid tumor tissue to maintain an effective concentration level for a certain length of time for drug-tumor interaction to execute anticancer activities. The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) describes a universal pathophysiological phenomenon and mechanism in which macromolecular compounds such as albumin and other polymer-conjugated drugs beyond certain sizes (above 40 kDa) can progressively accumulate in the tumor vascularized area and thus achieve targeting delivery and retention of anticancer compounds into solid tumor tissue. Targeting therapy via the EPR effect in clinical practice is not always successful since the strength of the EPR effect varies depending on the type and location of tumors, status of blood perfusion in tumors, and the physical-chemical properties of macromolecular anticancer agents. This review highlights the significance of the concept and mechanism of the EPR effect and discusses methods for better utilizing the EPR effect in developing smarter macromolecular nanomedicine to achieve a satisfactory outcome in clinical applications.",

Nanosized drugs have a large loading capacity, the ability to protect the payload from degradation, a large surface on which to conjugate targeting ligands, and controlled or sustained release. Nanosized drugs also leak preferentially into tumor tissue through permeable tumor vessels and are then retained in the tumor bed due to reduced lymphatic drainage. This process is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, while the EPR effect is widely held to improve delivery of nanodrugs to tumors, it in fact offers less than a 2-fold increase in nanodrug delivery compared with critical normal organs, resulting in drug concentrations that are not sufficient for curing most cancers. In this Review, we first overview various barriers for nanosized drug delivery with an emphasis on the capillary wall's resistance, the main obstacle to delivering drugs. Then, we discuss current regulatory issues facing nanomedicine. Finally, we discuss how to make the delivery of nanosized drugs to tumors more effective by building on the EPR effect."

EPR effect-based drug delivery is an effective strategy for most solid tumors. However, the degree of efficacy depends on the pathophysiological conditions of tumors, drug formulations, and other factors. Areas covered Vascular mediators including nitric oxide, bradykinin , and prostaglandins are vital for facilitating and maintaining EPR effect dynamics. Progression to large, advanced cancers may induce activated blood coagulation cascades, which lead to thrombus formation in tumor vasculature. Rapidly growing tumors cause obstructed or suppressed blood flow in tumor vasculature related to embolism or occluded blood vessels. The resulting limited tumor blood flow leads to less drug delivered to tumors, i.e. no or poor EPR effect. High stromal content also suppresses vascular permeability and drug diffusion. Restoring obstructed tumor blood flow and improving tumor vascular permeability via vascular mediators will improve drug delivery and the EPR effect. Physicochemical features of nanomedicines also influence therapeutic outcomes and are vital for the EPR effect. Expert opinion The tumor microenvironment, especially tumor blood flow, is critical for a potent EPR effect. A rational strategy for circumventing EPR effect barriers must include restoring tumor blood flow."

However, only a small fraction of an intravenously administered anti\u2010cancer drug enters the lymphatic system to reach metastatic lymph nodes (LN). Here, we show that the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is not induced during the early stages of LN metastasis. Luciferase\u2010expressing tumor cells were injected into the subiliac LN of the MXH10/Mo\u2010lpr/lpr mouse to induce metastasis to the proper axillary LN (PALN). In vivo biofluorescence imaging was used to confirm metastasis induction and to quantify the EPR effect, measured as PALN accumulation of intravenously injected indocyanine green (ICG) liposomes. PALN blood vessel volume changes were measured by contrast\u2010enhanced high\u2010frequency ultrasound imaging. The volume and density of blood vessels in the PALN increased until day 29 after inoculation, whereas the LN volume remained constant. ICG retention was first detected on day 29 post\u2010inoculation. While CD31\u2010positive cells increased up to day 29 post\u2010inoculation, \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin\u2010positive cells were detected on day 29 post\u2010inoculation for the first time. These results suggest that the EPR effect was not induced in the early stages of LN metastasis; therefore, systemic chemotherapy would likely not be beneficial during the early stages of LN metastasis. The development of an alternative drug delivery system, independent of the EPR effect, is required for the treatment of LN metastasis.",

The field has been devoted to treatment of cancer by exploiting EPR-based accumulation of nanocarriers in solid tumors, which for many years was considered to be a ubiquitous phenomenon. However, the understanding of differences in the EPR-effect between tumor types, heterogeneities within each patient group, and dependency on tumor development stage in humans is sparse. It is therefore important to enhance our understanding of the EPR-effect in large animals and humans with spontaneously developed cancer. In the present paper, we describe a novel loading method of copper-64 into PEGylated liposomes and use these liposomes to evaluate the EPR-effect in 11 canine cancer patients with spontaneous solid tumors by PET/CT imaging. We thereby provide the first high-resolution analysis of EPR-based tumor accumulation in large animals. We find that the EPR-effect is strong in some tumor types but cannot be considered a general feature of solid malignant tumors since we observed a high degree of accumulation heterogeneity between tumors. Six of seven included carcinomas displayed high uptake levels of liposomes, whereas one of four sarcomas displayed signs of liposome retention. We conclude that nanocarrier-radiotracers could be important in identifying cancer patients that will benefit from nanocarrier-based therapeutics in clinical practice."

The presence of a highly fenestrated blood vasculature in the tumor facilitates the EPR effect allowing the enhanced entry of colloidal nanoparticles into the tumor (Figure 2). Additionally, the poor lymphatic flow in the tumor tissue adds to this effect and results in enhanced retention of nanoparticles within the tumor site. In contrast to tumor tissues, the blood vasculature in normal tissues is intact and less permeable attenuating the uptake of nanoparticles by normal tissues. Furthermore, the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles are critically important for passive targeting of solid tumors. The EPR effect usually applies to particles that are less than 200 nm in size. However, particles less than 50 nm in size frequently undergo extravasation from the tumor through the fenestrations and are thus less likely to be retained in the tumor tissue for extended periods of time. Moreover, active targeting of nanoparticles is accomplished by decorating the surface of the nanoparticle with specific ligands to promote the binding and interaction with overexpressed protein receptors on cancer cell surfaces. This approach leads to preferential binding, uptake, and intracellular accumulation of the drug or gene in the targeted cells. However, the overall tumor accumulation and therapeutic effect of targeted nanoparticles may be principally controlled by the EPR effect (Dinauer et al., 2005).",

The presence of a highly fenestrated blood vasculature in the tumor facilitates the EPR effect allowing the enhanced entry of colloidal nanoparticles into the tumor (Figure 2). Additionally, the poor lymphatic flow in the tumor tissue adds to this effect and results in enhanced retention of nanoparticles within the tumor site. In contrast to tumor tissues, the blood vasculature in normal tissues is intact and less permeable attenuating the uptake of nanoparticles by normal tissues. Furthermore, the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles are critically important for passive targeting of solid tumors. The EPR effect usually applies to particles that are less than 200 nm in size. However, particles less than 50 nm in size frequently undergo extravasation from the tumor through the fenestrations and are thus less likely to be retained in the tumor tissue for extended periods of time. Moreover, active targeting of nanoparticles is accomplished by decorating the surface of the nanoparticle with specific ligands to promote the binding and interaction with overexpressed protein receptors on cancer cell surfaces. This approach leads to preferential binding, uptake, and intracellular accumulation of the drug or gene in the targeted cells. However, the overall tumor accumulation and therapeutic effect of targeted nanoparticles may be principally controlled by the EPR effect (Dinauer et al., 2005)."

This will set the foundation for understanding the more complex relationships discussed later. Quotes [2], [3], [4], [28] and others provide good background information.\n\n2. \"Biological Mechanisms of the EPR Effect\" - This should be a synthesis section explaining the detailed physiological and pathological mechanisms that create the EPR effect in tumors. The quotes discuss fenestrations, leaky vasculature, impaired lymphatic drainage, etc. Quotes [0], [2], [9], [12], [13], and others provide relevant information.\n\n3. \"EPR Effect During Tumor Progression\" - This is the core section addressing the correlation aspect of the query - how the EPR effect changes as tumors progress. A synthesis format is appropriate since this requires explaining the dynamic relationship. Quotes [8], [14], [15], [16], [22], [24] and others discuss how tumor size, stage, and growth affect the EPR effect.\n\n4. \"EPR Effect in Metastatic Tumors\" - This synthesis section will address the specific relationship between the EPR effect and metastasis, which is explicitly mentioned in the query. Quotes [22], [36] and others mention metastasis in relation to the EPR effect.\n\n5. \"Tumor Heterogeneity and EPR Variability\" - This synthesis section will address how the EPR effect varies across different tumors and even within the same tumor, which is crucial for understanding drug delivery challenges. Quotes [1], [4], [5], [11], and others discuss heterogeneity.\n\n6. \"Impact on Drug Delivery Efficacy\" - This synthesis section directly addresses the second part of the query about how the EPR effect impacts drug delivery. Quotes [0], [5], [6], [7], [18], [19], and others discuss the implications for drug delivery.\n\n7. \"Limitations and Challenges of EPR-Based Drug Delivery\" - This synthesis section will discuss the challenges and limitations that affect drug delivery efficacy. Quotes [0], [5], [6], [18], [23], [31], [32] provide information about these challenges.\n\n8. \"Strategies to Enhance EPR-Based Drug Delivery\" - This synthesis section will discuss approaches to improve drug delivery by enhancing or overcoming limitations of the EPR effect. Quotes [6], [15], [24], [29], [35] mention various strategies.\n\nThis organization provides a comprehensive answer to the query by first explaining what the EPR effect is, then addressing how it correlates with tumor progression and metastasis, and finally discussing how these relationships impact drug delivery efficacy, along with challenges and potential solutions.",

They named this the EPR effect (enhanced permeability and retention), the mechanism by which large molecules accumulate in tumors. Based on the EPR effect, pharmaceutical nanoparticles with a higher circulation time in the blood are collected in tumor tissues with enhanced vascular permeability, and this tool is commonly used for selective drug delivery into tumors through passive accumulation. In fact, EPR drug delivery does not work on normal tissues (Torchilin, 2011)."

                            "Passive targeting of nanoparticles refers to the passive accumulation of nanoparticles in the tumor tissue, which is generally attributed to the enhanced permeability and retention effect.The concept of EPR was first introduced more than 30 years ago when Maeda and colleagues found that certain macromolecules accumulate preferentially in the tumor tissue (Matsumura et al., 1986).EPR is mainly the result of leakiness of the discontinuous endothelium of angiogenic tumor vasculature combined with defective lymphatic drainage of the tumor matrix, which facilitates the extravasation and accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor.It has been shown that the number of nanoparticles accumulated in tumor tissue may be 10-200 times higher than in normal tissue as a result of EPR.The EPR effect is considered to be the primary element to improve the efficacy and safety of nanotherapeutics.In fact, most of the nanomedicines marketed thus far base their increased therapeutic index mainly on the EPR effect [5]",

The imperfect lymphatic reflux function of tumour tissue results in the long-term retention of drugs at the tumour site. The EPR effect is known as the \"royal gate\" (Danhier et al., 2010) and is the gold standard for the design of antitumour drugs and the physiological basis for the entry and accumulation of macromolecules and small particles in tumours. The presence of NPs can not only reduce the toxic side effects of chemotherapy drugs but also enhance the EPR effect and improve the targeting ability and efficacy of drugs (Torchilin, 2007a).\n\nExcept for tumours with blood vessels, such as prostate cancer or pancreatic cancer, almost all fast-growing tumours exhibit the EPR effect Din et al., 2017;Fang et al., 2020a)."

The tumor blood vessels differ very much from the ones in healthy tissues (Pautu et al., 2017). In cancer sites, blood vessels are discontinuous, resembling pipes with nano-holes. Therefore, nanoparticles can exit the circulation and penetrate the tumor interstitial space (Pautu et al., 2017). Furthermore, lymphatic filtration is poor within tumors, which facilitates drug accumulation (Pautu et al., 2017). Thus, the high permeability and increased retention processes lead to the accumulation of nanoparticles in solid tumors and to the release of therapeutic agents into malignant cells (Pautu et al., 2017)(Iyer et al., 2006)(Maeda, 2015). Contrarily, in healthy tissues, the blood vessels do not possess the same large fenestrations and the nanoparticles cannot exit the blood circulation and enter healthy tissues (Pautu et al., 2017)."

                            "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is the main mechanism described so far by which nanocarriers are more likely accumulated in solid tumor sites than in normal tissues (Fang et al., 2011)(Kalyane et al., 2019)(Greish, 2012). The EPR effect exploits the proliferation of endothelial cells during rapid and defective angiogenesis (i.e., the formation of new blood vessels from existing ones) and the lack of adequate lymphatic drainage. There is a loss of tight junctions and significant gaps between endothelial cells (Sun et al., 2014) that varies from 100 nm to 2 \u00b5m, depending on the type and stage of a tumor (Sun et al., 2014)(Kalyane et al., 2019). The size of nanocarriers plays the most critical role in EPR-based passive tumor targeting. Only nanocarriers smaller than the gap can extravasate from the vasculature and accumulate in tumor sites [31](Sun et al., 2014)(Peer et al., 2020). The accumulated nanocarriers are retained due to the dysfunctional lymphatic drainage in tumors, which allows them to release drugs into the vicinity or inside the tumor cells (Peer et al., 2020). In general, a higher retention of nanocarriers allows a higher extravasation and accumulation in the tumor sites, which is a better EPR-based passive tumor targeting. Nanocarriers with sizes between 30-200 nm are proposed as optimal for EPR-based passive tumor targeting (Sun et al., 2014). Besides, EPR-based passive tumor targeting is time-dependent and requires a long circulation half-life of nanocarriers."

                            "In medicine, nanotechnology has sparked a rapidly growing interest as it promises to solve a number of issues associated with conventional therapeutic agents, including their poor water solubility (at least, for most anticancer drugs), lack of targeting capability, nonspecific distribution, systemic toxicity, and low therapeutic index. Over the past several decades, remarkable progress has been made in the development and application of engineered nanoparticles to treat cancer more effectively. For example, therapeutic agents have been integrated with nanoparticles engineered with optimal sizes, shapes, and surface properties to increase their solubility, prolong their circulation half-life, improve their biodistribution, and reduce their immunogenicity. Nanoparticles and their payloads have also been favorably delivered into tumors by taking advantage of the pathophysiological conditions, such as the enhanced permeability and retention effect, and the spatial variations in the pH\u2005value. Additionally, targeting ligands (e.g., small organic molecules, peptides, antibodies, and nucleic acids) have been added to the surface of nanoparticles to specifically target cancerous cells through selective binding to the receptors overexpressed on their surface. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that multiple types of therapeutic drugs and/or diagnostic agents (e.g., contrast agents) could be delivered through the same carrier to enable combination therapy with a potential to overcome multidrug resistance, and real-time readout on the treatment efficacy. It is anticipated that precisely engineered nanoparticles will emerge as the next-generation platform for cancer therapy and many other biomedical applications."

                            "The Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect is a phenomenon that occurs in solid tumors, allowing certain nanoparticles to preferentially accumulate and remain within the tumor tissue. It is an important concept in the field of nanoparticle-based drug delivery for cancer treatment. The EPR effect arises from the unique characteristics of tumor blood vessels and the tumor microenvironment. Compared to normal blood vessels, tumor blood vessels are often leaky, irregularly shaped, and have poor lymphatic drainage. These abnormal blood vessels result from the rapid and disorganized growth of tumor cells, leading to incomplete and insufficient vascular networks within the tumor tissue. The leaky blood vessels in tumors allow nanoparticles to extravasate or \"leak out\" into the tumor interstitial space more easily than in healthy tissues. Furthermore, due to the lack of functional lymphatic vessels, the clearance of these extravasated nanoparticles from the tumor tissue is limited. As a result, the nanoparticles can accumulate and persist in the tumor for an extended period, providing an opportunity for effective drug delivery."

This mechanism describes the intrinsic ability of macromolecules to reach and accumulate in the solid tumors' interstitium, based on tumor pathophysiological characteristics such as: (i) neovascularization, characterized by deficient basement membranes and fenestrated structures of endothelial tubes, (ii) upregulation of inflammatory factors and (iii) lack of efficient drainage of lymphatic systems, that together sustain the delivery, accumulation and retention of molecules into solid tumor tissues (Benjamin et al., 1999)(Wu, 2021). Passive targeting exploits the EPR effect on the delivery and retention of drugs at target site. However, in clinical settings, this strategy has not always worked as well as hoped due to a variety of factors, including the tumor type, location, blood perfusion status, physical-chemical characteristics of delivered agents and difficulty in predicting the distribution of drugs."

                            "Chemotherapy for human solid tumors in clinical practice is far from satisfactory. Despite the discovery and synthesis of hundreds of thousands of anticancer compounds targeting various crucial units in cancer cell proliferation and metabolism, the fundamental problem is the lack of targeting delivery of these compounds selectively into solid tumor tissue to maintain an effective concentration level for a certain length of time for drug-tumor interaction to execute anticancer activities. The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) describes a universal pathophysiological phenomenon and mechanism in which macromolecular compounds such as albumin and other polymer-conjugated drugs beyond certain sizes (above 40 kDa) can progressively accumulate in the tumor vascularized area and thus achieve targeting delivery and retention of anticancer compounds into solid tumor tissue. Targeting therapy via the EPR effect in clinical practice is not always successful since the strength of the EPR effect varies depending on the type and location of tumors, status of blood perfusion in tumors, and the physical-chemical properties of macromolecular anticancer agents. This review highlights the significance of the concept and mechanism of the EPR effect and discusses methods for better utilizing the EPR effect in developing smarter macromolecular nanomedicine to achieve a satisfactory outcome in clinical applications."

The EPR effect is a phenomenon that occurs when the blood vessels surrounding a relatively large tumor become highly permeable while there is minimal lymphatic drainage from the tumor (Figure 7). This combination results in increased penetration of nanoparticles into the tumor and insufficient washing away of them by lymph. As a result, the particles accumulate and get retained in the tumor. As substances with high molecular weight, nanoparticles are naturally susceptible to this effect and, therefore, will passively accumulate in solid tumors. However, it has been observed that the use of enhanced EPR effects to transport nanomedicines to tumor sites is not consistently effective and is instead dependent on specific characteristics of the tumor and its physiological conditions (Nakamura et al., 2016). Factors such as the degree of angiogenesis and lymphatic development, the amount of pericyte coverage in the tumor vasculature, the density of the tumor stroma, and intratumoral pressure are principal contributors to the variability in EPR effects."

This improved accumulation results from the tumor vasculature that grows abnormally in order to feed the rapidly growing tumor. This results in leaks in the vasculature, from which nanomedicines can penetrate the tumor. However, the EPR effect is not a universal property of all solid tumors and care should be taken when exploring this route of passive tumor targeting (Lammers et al., 2012). Some tumors have a very dense extracellular matrix with very limited EPR-based accumulation (e.g., pancreatic ductal carcinoma). In addition, analysis from 200 different patient tumors across eight different cancer types have revealed marked differences in the tumor vasculature and morphology, observed between tumor types, between tumors of the same type, and even within the same tumor (Golombek et al., 2018)(Lammers et al., 2012). Despite this large heterogeneity, a good number of patients could still benefit from EPR-based passive targeting, and improvements in diagnostics to identify which patients could benefit from EPR would lead to better treatment outcomes [220]."

                            "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect first coined by Matsumura and Maeda (Matsumura et al., 1986) is defined the phenomenon of macromolecules or high molecular weight drug and nanomedicine accumulation inside solid tumor models compared to healthy tissue counterparts (Kalyane et al., 2019). EPR effect is usually induced by a leaky tumor vasculature by the accelerated angiogenesis and impaired lymphatic drainage by the disorganized growth of tumors (Greish, 2010)(Dhaliwal et al., 2019). In details, NPs with appropriate sizes can evade the tumor capillaries and be retained in the tumor tissues for days due to the lack of lymphatic drainage. Additionally, particles with high positive charges can bind non-specifically to the negatively charged luminal surface due to the presence of sulfate and carboxylate sugar moieties [106]",
                            "In contrast, Jain et al. (Jain, 1987) claimed that elevated interstitial fluid pressure and heterogeneous blood supply limit macromolecular delivery to tumors. Furthermore, a key challenge is the promotion of the EPR effect in patients with EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes since the EPR-insensitive phenotype is known to have smaller endothelial fenestrations, heterogeneously high or low pericyte coverage, more developed and branched vasculatures, a relatively dense ECR, and more developed immune profiles compared to EPR sensitive phenotypes (Dhaliwal et al., 2019). Thus, the role of EPR is still in question in terms of clinical translation and different human tumor types due to their heterogeneity (Dhaliwal et al., 2019)(Golombek et al., 2018)."

                            "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect has underlain the predominant nanomedicine design philosophy for the past three decades. However, growing evidence suggests that it is over-represented in preclinical models, and agents designed solely using its principle of passive accumulation can only be applied to a narrow subset of clinical tumors. For this reason, strategies that can improve upon the EPR effect to facilitate nanomedicine delivery to otherwise non-responsive tumors are required for broad clinical translation. EPR-adaptive nanomedicine delivery comprises a class of chemical and physical techniques that modify tumor accessibility in an effort to increase agent delivery and therapeutic effect. In the present review, we overview the primary benefits and limitations of radiation, ultrasound, hyperthermia, and photodynamic therapy as physical strategies for EPR-adaptive delivery to EPR-insensitive tumor phenotypes, and we reflect upon changes in the preclinical research pathway that should be implemented in order to optimally validate and develop these delivery strategies."

                            "Nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis and therapy. Advances in protein engineering and materials science have contributed to novel nanoscale targeting approaches that may bring new hope to cancer patients. Several therapeutic nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use. However, to date, there are only a few clinically approved nanocarriers that incorporate molecules to selectively bind and target cancer cells. This review examines some of the approved formulations and discusses the challenges in translating basic research to the clinic. We detail the arsenal of nanocarriers and molecules available for selective tumour targeting, and emphasize the challenges in cancer treatment. Cancer remains one of the world's most devastating diseases, with more than 10 million new cases every year 1. However, mortality has decreased in the past two years 2 owing to better understanding of tumour biology and improved diagnostic devices and treatments. Current cancer treatments include surgical intervention, radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs, which often also kill healthy cells and cause toxicity to the patient. It would therefore be desirable to develop chemotherapeutics that can either passively or actively target cancerous cells. Passive targeting exploits the characteristic features of tumour biology that allow nanocarriers to accumulate in the tumour by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect 2. Passively targeting nanocarriers first reached clinical trials in the mid-1980s, and the first products, based on liposomes and polymer\u2013protein conjugates, were marketed in the mid-1990s. Later, therapeutic nanocarriers based on this strategy were approved for wider use (Table 1) and methods of further enhancing targeting of drugs to cancer cells were investigated. Active approaches achieve this by conjugating nanocarriers containing chemotherapeutics with molecules that bind to overexpressed antigens or receptors on the target cells. Recent reviews provide perspective on the use of nanotechnology as a fundamental tool in cancer research and nanomedicine 3,4. Here we focus on the potential of nanocarriers and molecules that can selectively target tumours, and highlight the challenges in translating some of the basic research to the clinic. PaSSive anD aCtive targeting Nanocarriers encounter numerous barriers en route to their target, such as mucosal barriers and non-specific uptake 5,6. To address the challenges of targeting tumours with nanotechnology, it is necessary to combine the rational design of nanocarriers with the fundamental understanding of tumour biology (Box 1). General features of tumours include leaky blood vessels and poor lymphatic drainage. Whereas free drugs may diffuse non-specifically, a nanocarrier can \u2026"

High molecular weight substances or low molecular drugs coupled with high molecular weight carriers penetrate highly vascularized tumour tissues, are inefficiently removed by lymphatic drainage and therefore accumulate in tumours. The existence of the EPR effect was experimentally confirmed for many types of macromolecular anticancer drug delivery systems (Matsumura et al., 1986). Despite the simplicity of the approach it has serious disadvantages. The accumulation of high molecular weight substances occurs only to solid tumours with developed vascularization, high tumour mass and poor lymphatic drainage. However, these types of solid tumours can be relatively easy removed by surgery. The efficiency of this type of passive targeting is low for multifocal metastatic tumours that cannot be removed using surgical procedures and requires chemotherapy. Consequently, the EPR effect cannot be effectively used for overcoming drug resistance in most tumours that badly require it."

The tumor blood vessels differ very much from the ones in healthy tissues (Pautu et al., 2017). In cancer sites, blood vessels are discontinuous, resembling pipes with nano-holes. Therefore, nanoparticles can exit the circulation and penetrate the tumor interstitial space (Pautu et al., 2017). Furthermore, lymphatic filtration is poor within tumors, which facilitates drug accumulation (Pautu et al., 2017). Thus, the high permeability and increased retention processes lead to the accumulation of nanoparticles in solid tumors and to the release of therapeutic agents into malignant cells (Pautu et al., 2017)(Iyer et al., 2006)(Maeda, 2015). Contrarily, in healthy tissues, the blood vessels do not possess the same large fenestrations and the nanoparticles cannot exit the blood circulation and enter healthy tissues (Pautu et al., 2017)."

In order to avoid the imminent consequences of hypoxia, ischemia and toxicity, this process seems to occur very quickly and as a result, the contributions of the angiogenic regulators are largely excluded. This gives rise to highly disorganized and fenestrated tumor vessels, with discontinued endothelial linings and undesirable permeability to particles of up to 700 nm in diameter (Moghimi et al., 2018)(Fang et al., 2011). This pathologically orchestrated phenomenon is referred to as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Matsumura et al., 1986)",

As EVs are a type of nanoparticle, it is plausible that they may be subject to EPR (Phillips et al., 2021). EPR is observed in various solid tumors, and is characterized by abnormal tumor vasculature, tumor permeability, and a lack of effective lymphatic drainage (Wu, 2021). The leaky tumor vasculature allows for nanoparticles to extravasate through surrounding blood vessels (Maeda et al., 2013).

                            "Enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) in cancer therapy leverages the structural and functional abnormalities of solid tumors [66,67]. Blood vessels in tumors form quickly and poorly as a result of an increased rate of angiogenesis to meet the increased demands for nutrients and oxygen (Ejigah et al., 2022). The newly-formed blood vessels are distorted and the endothelial cells are poorly aligned with large openings (Greish, 2012). The tumor's vascular wall also exhibits substantial structural abnormalities due to the absence of perivascular cells and smooth muscle layers (Ejigah et al., 2022)(Greish, 2012). The tumor's leaky vasculature facilitates the transport of macromolecules and nanoparticles into the tumor tissue while the complementary poor lymphatic drainage prevents clearance of the macromolecules and nanoparticles, leading to their accumulation within the tumor tissue (Miao et al., 2017)(Ejigah et al., 2022)(Fang et al., 2011). Thus, the differences in the blood vessels of tumors and healthy tissues make targeting possible (Fang et al., 2011)(Natfji et al., 2017). This phenomenon and passive tumor targeting is referred to as the EPR effect (Ejigah et al., 2022)(Greish, 2012)",
                            "Blood vessels in pancreatic adenocarcinoma may collapse or become clogged because of the dense stroma (Figure 2) and various extracellular components which induce stress and constriction, affecting the extravasation of macromolecules and particles into tumor tissues [67,(Rajora et al., 2014)(Fang et al., 2020)(Edwards et al., 2021). This may explain why nanotherapeutics have not demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, other studies have reported that the EPR effect in cancer is not based only on the \"leakiness\" of the vasculature because rigid tumors such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer exhibit EPR [72,73,77]78]."

                            "The foundation of passive targeting was discovered by Matsumura and Meda around 1986. They found two key observations to passive targeting: (1) spontaneous accumulation of drug carrier in areas of solid tumors with leaky vascular and (2) retention of the carrier due to compromise lymphatic drainage. With these two observations, the concept of enhancing permeability and retention (EPR) effect was formed (Narum et al., 2019). To further understand the basis of the EPR effect, we must first understand the pathophysiology of the tumor. Solid tumors grow at a rapid rate, and this comes with high nutrients and oxygen demand. Thus, new blood vessels and neovasculature were formed, and this is term as angiogenesis. These new blood vessels often exhibit disorganized course, irregular, discontinuous epithelium and structurally different from healthy vessels. Due to this, the nanoparticles can leak between the gaps and enter the tumor. This stage is referring to the enhanced permeability of the EPR effect. It should be noted that solid tumor has poor lymphatic drainage. Molecules smaller than 4 nm can diffuse back to the bloodstream, but the nanoparticles are impeded due to their larger particle size, thus retain in the solid tumor. This part refers to the retention of the EPR effect (Narum et al., 2019)[129]."

My review here describes the history and heterogeneity of the EPR effect, which involves defective tumor blood vessels and blood flow. We reported that restoring obstructed tumor blood flow overcomes impaired drug delivery, leading to improved EPR effects. I also discuss gaps between small animal cancers used in experimental models and large clinical cancers in humans, which usually involve heterogeneous EPR effects, vascular abnormalities in multiple necrotic foci, and tumor emboli. Here, I emphasize arterial infusion of oily formulations of nanodrugs into tumor-feeding arteries, which is the most tumor-selective drug delivery method, with tumor/blood ratios of 100-fold. This method is literally the most personalized medicine because arterial infusions differ for each patient, and drug doses infused depend on tumor size and anatomy in each patient. Future developments in EPR effect-based treatment will range from chemotherapy to photodynamic therapy, boron neutron capture therapy, and therapies for free radical diseases. This review focuses on our own work, which stimulated numerous scientists to perform research in nanotechnology and drug delivery systems, thereby spawning a new cancer treatment era."

Utilizing these pathological properties, macromolecular substances that do not ordinarily leak out of normal blood vessels can leak easily from tumor blood vessels, and macromolecules that leak locally into the cancer tissue stay in place for a long time because of a lack of efficient lymphatic drainage. As a result, highly stable macromolecular substances that are not captured by the reticuloendothelial systems in the body and are not filtered from the renal glomerulus can accumulate selectively in cancer tissue.

As shown in Fig. 3A, due to the EPR effect, nanoformulations in circulation can enter tumor tissues through the gaps between endothelial cells in tumor blood vessels (Kalyane et al., 2019). This effect further enhances the preferential accumulation of nanocarriers within tumor tissues and accelerates intracellular delivery including endocytosis, lysosomal fusion, escape, cytoplasmic release, and combining the target organelle (Fig. 3B) (Wei et al., 2021)(Shinde et al., 2022)(Dai et al., 2017). These properties of tumors provide favorable conditions for designing tumor-targeted antitumor NPs. Drug-carrying NPs can increase the accumulation of chemotherapy drugs in tumor tissues through EPR effect, improve therapeutic effects and reduce toxic and side effects by reducing unnecessary release in normal tissues (Tian et al., 2014)(Deng et al., 2015)."

This is attributed to the unique features of the tumour microenvironment (TME), which is known to create a dense stromal formation and poorly immunogenic condition. In particular, the TME of PC, including the stromal cells and extracellular matrix, plays an essential role in the progression and chemoresistance of PC. Consequently, several promising agents that target key components of the stroma have already been developed and are currently in multiple stages of clinical trials. Therefore, the authors review the latest available evidence on novel stroma-targeting approaches, highlighting the potential impact of the stroma as a key component of the TME in PC."

                            "Chemotherapy for human solid tumors in clinical practice is far from satisfactory. Despite the discovery and synthesis of hundreds of thousands of anticancer compounds targeting various crucial units in cancer cell proliferation and metabolism, the fundamental problem is the lack of targeting delivery of these compounds selectively into solid tumor tissue to maintain an effective concentration level for a certain length of time for drug-tumor interaction to execute anticancer activities. The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) describes a universal pathophysiological phenomenon and mechanism in which macromolecular compounds such as albumin and other polymer-conjugated drugs beyond certain sizes (above 40 kDa) can progressively accumulate in the tumor vascularized area and thus achieve targeting delivery and retention of anticancer compounds into solid tumor tissue. Targeting therapy via the EPR effect in clinical practice is not always successful since the strength of the EPR effect varies depending on the type and location of tumors, status of blood perfusion in tumors, and the physical-chemical properties of macromolecular anticancer agents. This review highlights the significance of the concept and mechanism of the EPR effect and discusses methods for better utilizing the EPR effect in developing smarter macromolecular nanomedicine to achieve a satisfactory outcome in clinical applications."

                            "The EPR effect is dynamic and a phenomenon of tumor blood vessels, which is mostly dependent on blood flow. Animal models of solid tumors rich in blood flow demonstrated enhanced EPR effects. However, many clinical cancers such as late-stage tumors and refractory tumors are associated with poor blood flow due to the coagulation and thrombi formation exhibiting poor EPR effect [7](Wu, 2021)(Islam et al., 2021)(Haider et al., 2021)(Huang et al., 2021)(Subrahmanyam et al., 2021). For such tumors, the improvement of EPR-based drug delivery is necessary by modifying tumor blood vessels, angiogenesis, a vascular edifice, blood flow, etc. The EPR effect can be enhanced by modifying vascular intermediaries such as angiotensin II, nitroglycerin or NO, CO, and enzyme inhibitors [7](Wu, 2021)(Islam et al., 2021)(Haider et al., 2021). An integration of vascular mediators with a nanodrug may be an important strategy for an enhanced EPR effect. Further, targeting tumor stroma and extracellular matrix, and controlling tumor vessels, may improve EPR-targeted drug delivery to tumors (Fang, 2022)",

Enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect-mediated drug delivery is currently regarded as an effective way to bring drugs to tumors, especially macromolecular drugs and drug-loaded pharmaceutical nanocarriers. However, a disordered vessel network, and occluded or embolized tumor blood vessels seriously limit the EPR effect. To augment the EPR effect and improve curative effects, in this review, we focused on the perspective of tumor blood vessels, and analyzed the relationship among abnormal angiogenesis, abnormal vascular structure, irregular blood flow, extensive permeability of tumor vessels, and the EPR effect. In this commentary, nanoparticles including liposomes, micelles, and polymers extravasate through the tumor vasculature, which are based on modulating tumor vessels, to increase the EPR effect, thereby increasing their therapeutic effect."

Sildenafil is a potent inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) through the relaxation of smooth muscles and the modulation of vascular endothelial permeability. Overexpression of PDE-5 has been reported in lung, colon, metastatic breast cancers, and bladder squamous carcinoma. Moreover, sildenafil has been reported to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells of different origins to the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents with augmented apoptosis mediated through inducing the downregulation of Bcl-xL and FAP-1 expression, enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, phosphorylating BAD and Bcl-2, upregulating caspase-3,8,9 activities, and blocking cells at G0/G1 cell cycle phase. Sildenafil has also demonstrated inhibitory effects on the efflux activity of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as ABCC4, ABCC5, ABCB1, and ABCG2, ultimately reversing multidrug resistance. Accordingly, there has been a growing interest in using sildenafil as monotherapy or chemoadjuvant in EPR augmentation and management of different types of cancer. In this review, we critically examine the basic molecular mechanism of sildenafil related to cancer biology and discuss the overall potential of sildenafil in enhancing EPR-based anticancer drug delivery, pointing to the outcomes of the most important related preclinical and clinical studies."

The basic pathophysiological phenomenon of EPR is hyperpermeable tumor vasculature combined with impaired lymphatic drainage, resulting in enhanced permeability and retention of molecules (Nichols et al., 2014)(Azzopardi et al., 2013). Although the conventional EPR effect results in improved delivery to tumors compared with normal tissue, some tumors do not exhibit the EPR effect and the permeability of vessels may not be the same throughout a single tumor (Sriraman et al., 2014)(Jain, 1998). Moreover, the rapid proliferation of cancer cells around the vessels may impede therapeu-tic molecule penetration (Grantab et al., 2006). Therefore, the killing of perivascular cancer cells will help improve the EPR effect."

Strategies to enhance drug penetration have potential to improve therapeutic outcome. The development of multicellular layers (MCLs), in which tumor cells are grown on a semipermeable Teflon support membrane, has facilitated quantification of drug penetration through solid tissue. The goals of the present study were to quantify the penetration of anticancer drugs as a function of cellular adhesion and packing density and to determine the effects of variable penetration on therapeutic efficacy in this model system. We compared the properties of MCLs grown from two epithelioid and round subclones of a colon carcinoma cell line. One pair of epithelioid and round sublines differed in expression of alpha-E-catenin, and both pairs generated MCLs with different packing density. The penetration of commonly used anticancer agents (paclitaxel, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil) through MCLs derived from these cell lines was significantly greater through the round (loosely packed) than through the epithelioid (tightly packed) sublines. In MCLs treated with doxorubicin, we observed greater survival in the tightly packed cell lines than in the loosely packed cell lines. Impaired penetration of anticancer agents through MCLs derived from the tightly packed cell lines and relative resistance to killing of cells within them by doxorubicin treatment strengthen the role of tumor cell adhesion and packing density as contributing to drug resistance."

Drug delivery based on the EPR effect is an effective strategy for most solid tumors (Islam et al., 2021). The vascular mediators including prostaglandins, bradykinin, and nitric oxide play a vital role in facilitating and maintaining EPR effect dynamics. The advanced stage of cancers may induce activated blood coagulation cascades, which cause thrombus formation in tumor vasculature. The drug delivery, as well as the EPR effect, will be enhanced by restoring obstructed tumor blood flow and improving tumor vascular permeability through vascular mediators. Moreover, the efficiency of the EPR effect depends on the pathophysiological conditions of tumors, drug formulations, and other factors such as the tumor microenvironment."

                "text": "\nThe Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect in metastatic tumors presents a complex and somewhat contradictory picture. While some studies have documented the presence of the EPR effect in metastatic lesions, others report significant limitations, creating a nuanced understanding of nanomedicine accumulation in these critical tumor sites. \n\nEvidence suggests that the EPR effect can occur in certain metastatic cancers, including those in lymphatic tissues, liver, and lungs <Paper corpusId=\"255059944\" paperTitle=\"(Islam et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Researchers have verified this phenomenon in various tumor models and cancer patients, indicating potential opportunities for nanomedicine delivery to some metastatic sites <Paper corpusId=\"255059944\" paperTitle=\"(Islam et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"11284381\" paperTitle=\"(Duncan et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHowever, a crucial limitation emerges when examining early-stage metastasis. Studies have reported that the EPR effect is not induced during the early stages of lymph node metastasis <Paper corpusId=\"53104302\" paperTitle=\"(Adjei et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"13578458\" paperTitle=\"(Mikada et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This finding has significant clinical implications, as it suggests that systemic chemotherapy using EPR-dependent nanocarriers would likely not benefit patients during these early stages of metastatic spread, precisely when intervention might be most effective.\n\nThe heterogeneity of the EPR effect in metastatic tumors appears to depend on several factors. Tumor type and the stage of metastatic development play crucial roles, with studies reporting significant variations in EPR manifestation across different tumors <Paper corpusId=\"53104302\" paperTitle=\"(Adjei et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4784007\" paperTitle=\"(Hansen et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, the tumor microenvironment and blood flow patterns in metastatic lesions significantly influence the EPR effect\u2014with poor or absent blood flow resulting in limited or no EPR effect <Paper corpusId=\"255059944\" paperTitle=\"(Islam et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThis variability creates a fundamental challenge for EPR-based drug delivery strategies in treating metastatic cancer. The EPR effect appears most robust in large, well-vascularized solid tumors that can often be surgically removed. However, it shows limited effectiveness precisely in the multifocal metastatic tumors that require systemic chemotherapy and cannot be surgically addressed <Paper corpusId=\"16051895\" paperTitle=\"(Koushik et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This disconnect represents a significant limitation of passive targeting approaches for overcoming drug resistance in metastatic disease.\n\nThe inconsistent presence of the EPR effect in metastatic lesions underscores the need for alternative or complementary drug delivery approaches that do not rely solely on passive accumulation through the EPR effect <Paper corpusId=\"13578458\" paperTitle=\"(Mikada et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. Developing delivery systems that can effectively target metastatic tumors regardless of their EPR status remains a critical challenge for improving outcomes in advanced cancer.",

Fast-growing tumors develop poorly organized vasculature with large endothelial fenestrations that allows NPs to accumulate in the tumor interstitium. Tumors also have impaired lymphatic drainage that enhances NP retention in the tumor (Fang et al., 2011)(Nichols et al., 2014). Although the EPR effect has served as the foundation for most cancer nanomedicines, there is heterogeneity in its presentation based on tumor type and patient population. Furthermore, the size of a tumor and the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment affect the EPR effect (Hansen et al., 2015). The existence of the EPR effect in metastasis is an unresolved question, with studies reporting that metastases exhibit the phenomenon (Maeda, 2015), while others report otherwise, especially in early-stage metastasis (Mikada et al., 2017)."

However, only a small fraction of an intravenously administered anti\u2010cancer drug enters the lymphatic system to reach metastatic lymph nodes (LN). Here, we show that the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is not induced during the early stages of LN metastasis. Luciferase\u2010expressing tumor cells were injected into the subiliac LN of the MXH10/Mo\u2010lpr/lpr mouse to induce metastasis to the proper axillary LN (PALN). In vivo biofluorescence imaging was used to confirm metastasis induction and to quantify the EPR effect, measured as PALN accumulation of intravenously injected indocyanine green (ICG) liposomes. PALN blood vessel volume changes were measured by contrast\u2010enhanced high\u2010frequency ultrasound imaging. The volume and density of blood vessels in the PALN increased until day 29 after inoculation, whereas the LN volume remained constant. ICG retention was first detected on day 29 post\u2010inoculation. While CD31\u2010positive cells increased up to day 29 post\u2010inoculation, \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin\u2010positive cells were detected on day 29 post\u2010inoculation for the first time. These results suggest that the EPR effect was not induced in the early stages of LN metastasis; therefore, systemic chemotherapy would likely not be beneficial during the early stages of LN metastasis. The development of an alternative drug delivery system, independent of the EPR effect, is required for the treatment of LN metastasis."

                            "Since the first report of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, the research in nanocarrier based antitumor drugs has been intense. The field has been devoted to treatment of cancer by exploiting EPR-based accumulation of nanocarriers in solid tumors, which for many years was considered to be a ubiquitous phenomenon. However, the understanding of differences in the EPR-effect between tumor types, heterogeneities within each patient group, and dependency on tumor development stage in humans is sparse. It is therefore important to enhance our understanding of the EPR-effect in large animals and humans with spontaneously developed cancer. In the present paper, we describe a novel loading method of copper-64 into PEGylated liposomes and use these liposomes to evaluate the EPR-effect in 11 canine cancer patients with spontaneous solid tumors by PET/CT imaging. We thereby provide the first high-resolution analysis of EPR-based tumor accumulation in large animals. We find that the EPR-effect is strong in some tumor types but cannot be considered a general feature of solid malignant tumors since we observed a high degree of accumulation heterogeneity between tumors. Six of seven included carcinomas displayed high uptake levels of liposomes, whereas one of four sarcomas displayed signs of liposome retention. We conclude that nanocarrier-radiotracers could be important in identifying cancer patients that will benefit from nanocarrier-based therapeutics in clinical practice."

                            "The EPR effect is the result of the increased permeability of the tumour vascular endothelium to circulating macromolecules combined with limited lymphatic drainage from the tumour interstitium. High molecular weight substances or low molecular drugs coupled with high molecular weight carriers penetrate highly vascularized tumour tissues, are inefficiently removed by lymphatic drainage and therefore accumulate in tumours. The existence of the EPR effect was experimentally confirmed for many types of macromolecular anticancer drug delivery systems (Matsumura et al., 1986). Despite the simplicity of the approach it has serious disadvantages. The accumulation of high molecular weight substances occurs only to solid tumours with developed vascularization, high tumour mass and poor lymphatic drainage. However, these types of solid tumours can be relatively easy removed by surgery. The efficiency of this type of passive targeting is low for multifocal metastatic tumours that cannot be removed using surgical procedures and requires chemotherapy. Consequently, the EPR effect cannot be effectively used for overcoming drug resistance in most tumours that badly require it."

Tumor type plays a crucial role, with some tumors exhibiting very limited EPR-based accumulation due to dense extracellular matrix, as seen in pancreatic ductal carcinoma <Paper corpusId=\"226219426\" paperTitle=\"(Gaspar et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"227260630\" paperTitle=\"(Fu et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Additionally, vascular permeability changes with tumor progression and depends on the tumor's anatomical location <Paper corpusId=\"237459096\" paperTitle=\"(Sedush et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe tumor microenvironment further contributes to EPR variability. High interstitial fluid pressure can reduce the EPR effect by counteracting the movement of nanoparticles from blood vessels into tumor tissue <Paper corpusId=\"268168475\" paperTitle=\"(Arafat et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"259270131\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Cancer stroma formation, resulting from increased blood coagulation, can also interfere with the EPR effect <Paper corpusId=\"235200480\" paperTitle=\"(Matsumura, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4549542\" paperTitle=\"(Matsumura et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSome tumor categories show minimal or no EPR effect regardless of other factors. These include blood cancers, very early-stage tumors, and small metastatic lesions <Paper corpusId=\"227260630\" paperTitle=\"(Fu et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, tumors with poor vasculature, such as prostate cancer, may exhibit limited EPR effects even if they are solid tumors <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">.\n\nThe heterogeneity in the EPR effect has significant implications for the clinical translation of nanomedicines. While experimental models using mouse xenografts often demonstrate strong EPR effects, human tumors frequently show more variable and often reduced EPR effects <Paper corpusId=\"267086100\" paperTitle=\"(Garcia-Dominguez et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"227276558\" paperTitle=\"(Mitchell et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.

                            "The Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect is a phenomenon that leads to the enhanced accumulation and retention of macromolecules and nanoparticles in solid tumors compared to normal tissues (Bertrand et al., 2014)(Lammers et al., 2012). This improved accumulation results from the tumor vasculature that grows abnormally in order to feed the rapidly growing tumor. This results in leaks in the vasculature, from which nanomedicines can penetrate the tumor. However, the EPR effect is not a universal property of all solid tumors and care should be taken when exploring this route of passive tumor targeting (Lammers et al., 2012). Some tumors have a very dense extracellular matrix with very limited EPR-based accumulation (e.g., pancreatic ductal carcinoma). In addition, analysis from 200 different patient tumors across eight different cancer types have revealed marked differences in the tumor vasculature and morphology, observed between tumor types, between tumors of the same type, and even within the same tumor (Golombek et al., 2018)(Lammers et al., 2012). Despite this large heterogeneity, a good number of patients could still benefit from EPR-based passive targeting, and improvements in diagnostics to identify which patients could benefit from EPR would lead to better treatment outcomes [220]."

                            "Enhanced accumulation of macromolecules in solid tumors and its mechanisms were first reported by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 and termed the \"Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect\" (Matsumura et al., 1986). The EPR effect is a phenomenon that occurs when the blood vessels surrounding a relatively large tumor become highly permeable while there is minimal lymphatic drainage from the tumor (Figure 7). This combination results in increased penetration of nanoparticles into the tumor and insufficient washing away of them by lymph. As a result, the particles accumulate and get retained in the tumor. As substances with high molecular weight, nanoparticles are naturally susceptible to this effect and, therefore, will passively accumulate in solid tumors. However, it has been observed that the use of enhanced EPR effects to transport nanomedicines to tumor sites is not consistently effective and is instead dependent on specific characteristics of the tumor and its physiological conditions (Nakamura et al., 2016). Factors such as the degree of angiogenesis and lymphatic development, the amount of pericyte coverage in the tumor vasculature, the density of the tumor stroma, and intratumoral pressure are principal contributors to the variability in EPR effects."

                            "Nanotechnology offers several attractive design features that have prompted its exploration for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Nanosized drugs have a large loading capacity, the ability to protect the payload from degradation, a large surface on which to conjugate targeting ligands, and controlled or sustained release. Nanosized drugs also leak preferentially into tumor tissue through permeable tumor vessels and are then retained in the tumor bed due to reduced lymphatic drainage. This process is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, while the EPR effect is widely held to improve delivery of nanodrugs to tumors, it in fact offers less than a 2-fold increase in nanodrug delivery compared with critical normal organs, resulting in drug concentrations that are not sufficient for curing most cancers. In this Review, we first overview various barriers for nanosized drug delivery with an emphasis on the capillary wall's resistance, the main obstacle to delivering drugs. Then, we discuss current regulatory issues facing nanomedicine. Finally, we discuss how to make the delivery of nanosized drugs to tumors more effective by building on the EPR effect."

                            "Tumors cause the surrounding blood vessels to become less rigid and more permeable.This allows drug-loaded nanoparticles to accumulate in the tumor at a much higher rate than in normal tissue.This phenomenon is known as the enhanced permeability effect.Additionally, the lymphatic system in tumors is often poorly developed, which prevents nanoparticles from being drained away as quickly as they would in normal tissue.This is known as the enhanced retention effect.Together, these two effects are referred to as the EPR effect (Wu, 2021)(Kim et al., 2023).\n\nAlthough passive targeting represents a significant improvement over conventional chemotherapy, several obstacles may hinder the efficacy of this targeting system.For example, the EPR effect tends to be lower in tumors as the interstitial fluid pressure increases.Moreover, the EPR effect can vary significantly within and between tumors, even within the same patient (Kim et al., 2023)(Subhan et al., 2021)."

                            "Over the past few decades, the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of nanomedicine has been a crucial phenomenon in targeted cancer therapy. Specifically, understanding the EPR effect has been a significant aspect of delivering anticancer agents efficiently to targeted tumors. Although the therapeutic effect has been demonstrated in experimental models using mouse xenografts, the clinical translation of the EPR effect of nanomedicine faces several challenges due to dense extracellular matrix (ECM), high interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) levels, and other factors that arise from tumor heterogeneity and complexity. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of the EPR effect of nanomedicine in clinics is essential to overcome the hurdles of the clinical translation of nanomedicine. This paper introduces the basic mechanism of the EPR effect of nanomedicine, the recently discussed challenges of the EPR effect of nanomedicine, and various strategies of recent nanomedicine to overcome the limitations expected from the patients\u2019 tumor microenvironments."

Utilizing these pathological properties, macromolecular substances that do not ordinarily leak out of normal blood vessels can leak easily from tumor blood vessels, and macromolecules that leak locally into the cancer tissue stay in place for a long time because of a lack of efficient lymphatic drainage. As a result, highly stable macromolecular substances that are not captured by the reticuloendothelial systems in the body and are not filtered from the renal glomerulus can accumulate selectively in cancer tissue. Collectively, these ideas are termed the enhanced permeability retention (EPR) effect 15",

This increase in blood coagulation results in formation of cancer stroma, which interferes with the EPR effect. (Matsumura, 2020)"

                            "BACKGROUND\nMCC-465 is an immunoliposome-encapsulated doxorubicin (DXR). The liposome is tagged with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the F(ab')2 fragment of human monoclonal antibody GAH, which positively reacts to >90% of cancerous stomach tissues, but negatively to all normal tissues. In preclinical studies, MCC-465 showed superior cytotoxic activity against several human stomach cancer cells compared with DXR or DXR-incorporated PEG liposomes. The main purpose of this trial was to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting toxicity (DLT), recommended phase II dose and pharmacokinetics (PK) of MCC-465.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nPatients with metastatic or recurrent stomach cancer were eligible for entry. The initial dose was 6.5 mg/m2. MCC-465 was administered as a 1-h infusion every 3 weeks and the treatment continued for up to six cycles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-three patients received a total of 62 cycles at the 6.5-45.5 mg/m2 dose level. DLTs were myelosuppression and appetite loss at the 45.5 mg/m2 dose level. Other toxicities were mild. Neither palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia nor cardiotoxicity was observed. Acute reactions related to infusion were observed commonly in 16 patients over the entire dose range. While no antitumor response was observed, stable disease (SD) was observed in 10 out of 18 evaluable patients. The pharmacokinetic study showed a similar AUC and Cmax to Doxil.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMCC-465 was well tolerated. The recommended dose for a phase II study of MCC-465, for a 3-week schedule, is considered to be 32.5 mg/m2 in an equivalent amount of DXR."

                            "The main mechanism of tumor targeting of anticancer nanomedicines is based on the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, first described by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 (Matsumura et al., 1986) as a passive yet powerful targeting strategy. They showed that tumor tissues had defective blood vessels with aberrant branching and large openings between endothelial cells of around 400 nm due to their rapid proliferation and decreased number of pericytes. This unique characteristic helps macromolecules, such as nanocarriers, easily move into tumor tissues after crossing the endothelium barrier. Furthermore, solid tumors have a poor lymphatic drainage system, leading to extended retention times of nanocarriers in the tumor extracellular matrix. \n\nAlthough the EPR effect has allowed the successful development of some anticancer nanomedicines with a passive tumor-targeting mechanism (Mitchell et al., 2020), many well-designed drug delivery systems fail when tested in patients. Over the last years, the role of the EPR effect has been investigated, focusing on the influence of the TME, heterogeneity of human tumors, and differences between animal models and actual patients (Din et al., 2017)(Maeda et al., 2000)(Zi et al., 2022). These factors may contribute to the observed limited penetration of nanomedicines in human tumors, highlighting the need for further refinement of passive targeting strategies."

                            "In recent years, the development of nanoparticles has expanded into a broad range of clinical applications. Nanoparticles have been developed to overcome the limitations of free therapeutics and navigate biological barriers \u2014 systemic, microenvironmental and cellular \u2014 that are heterogeneous across patient populations and diseases. Overcoming this patient heterogeneity has also been accomplished through precision therapeutics, in which personalized interventions have enhanced therapeutic efficacy. However, nanoparticle development continues to focus on optimizing delivery platforms with a one-size-fits-all solution. As lipid-based, polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles are engineered in increasingly specified ways, they can begin to be optimized for drug delivery in a more personalized manner, entering the era of precision medicine. In this Review, we discuss advanced nanoparticle designs utilized in both non-personalized and precision applications that could be applied to improve precision therapies. We focus on advances in nanoparticle design that overcome heterogeneous barriers to delivery, arguing that intelligent nanoparticle design can improve efficacy in general delivery applications while enabling tailored designs for precision applications, thereby ultimately improving patient outcome overall. Advances in nanoparticle design could make substantial contributions to personalized and non-personalized medicine. In this Review, Langer, Mitchell, Peppas and colleagues discuss advances in nanoparticle design that overcome heterogeneous barriers to delivery, as well as the challenges in translating these design improvements into personalized medicine approaches."

Nanodrugs for cancer therapy administered intravenously escape renal clearance, are unable to penetrate through tight endothelial junctions of normal blood vessels and remain at a high level in plasma. Over time, the concentration of nanodrugs builds up in tumors due to the EPR effect, reaching several times higher than that of plasma due to the lack of lymphatic drainage.

                            "Passive targeting is another important strategy that exploits the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, a phenomenon whereby nanoparticles preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues due to the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage that are characteristic of solid tumors. Although passive targeting does not involve specific ligand-receptor interactions, it allows for the preferential concentration of nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment, thereby increasing the local concentration of the drug and enhancing its efficacy.\n\nWhile passive targeting is inherently less selective than active targeting, it plays a crucial role in delivering nanoparticles to solid tumors, including CRC. The EPR effect is particularly effective for larger nanoparticles, such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, which can accumulate in tumor tissues more readily than smaller particles. However, the effectiveness of the EPR effect can vary significantly between patients and tumor types, leading to variability in therapeutic outcomes. For example, tumors with dense stromal tissue or poor vasculature may exhibit a reduced EPR effect, limiting the accumulation of nanoparticles."

                "tldr": "The EPR effect significantly influences nanomedicine delivery efficacy, but its clinical impact is more modest than initially expected, with only a 2-fold increase in tumor accumulation compared to normal tissues. Despite being the foundation for most marketed nanomedicines, the EPR effect's variable nature across tumor types limits its clinical translation, particularly for treating metastatic disease. (13 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect serves as the primary mechanism underlying the efficacy of passive targeting strategies for nanomedicine-based cancer therapeutics. This phenomenon facilitates the preferential accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor tissues, with studies showing that the number of nanoparticles accumulated in tumor tissue may be 10-200 times higher than in normal tissue as a result of the EPR effect <Paper corpusId=\"227260630\" paperTitle=\"(Fu et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. The EPR effect is considered the fundamental element that improves both the efficacy and safety profiles of nanotherapeutics, with most marketed nanomedicines basing their increased therapeutic index primarily on this phenomenon <Paper corpusId=\"227260630\" paperTitle=\"(Fu et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"229686114\" paperTitle=\"(Gisbert-Garzaran et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"195660377\" paperTitle=\"(Grodzinski et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHowever, the clinical translation of EPR-based drug delivery has revealed significant limitations. Despite the promising preclinical results, the actual tumor accumulation achieved through the EPR effect in clinical settings has been found to result in a mere 2-fold increase compared to critical normal organs <Paper corpusId=\"247886899\" paperTitle=\"(Milligan et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"20466264\" paperTitle=\"(Nakamura et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This modest enhancement is often insufficient for achieving therapeutic concentrations needed to effectively treat most cancers <Paper corpusId=\"247886899\" paperTitle=\"(Milligan et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA fundamental limitation of EPR-based drug delivery is its tumor specificity. While the EPR effect works relatively well for large, well-vascularized solid tumors that can often be surgically removed, it shows limited effectiveness in multifocal metastatic tumors that require systemic chemotherapy and cannot be surgically addressed <Paper corpusId=\"16051895\" paperTitle=\"(Koushik et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This creates a paradoxical situation where nanomedicines that rely on the EPR effect are least effective for the cancer types that most urgently require improved drug delivery strategies <Paper corpusId=\"16051895\" paperTitle=\"(Koushik et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe effectiveness of EPR-based drug delivery varies significantly across tumor types. Blood cancers, very early-stage tumors, and small metastatic lesions exhibit minimal or no EPR effect <Paper corpusId=\"227260630\" paperTitle=\"(Fu et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Tumors with dense stromal tissue, such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma, often show reduced EPR effects due to collapsed or clogged blood vessels caused by the dense stroma and various extracellular components that induce stress and constriction <Paper corpusId=\"258316363\" paperTitle=\"(Olajubutu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"250128369\" paperTitle=\"(Ejigah et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe EPR effect's efficiency is also influenced by the tumor microenvironment. High interstitial fluid pressure can reduce the EPR effect by counteracting the movement of nanoparticles from blood vessels into tumor tissue <Paper corpusId=\"250128369\" paperTitle=\"(Ejigah et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. The impaired lymphatic drainage in tumors plays a crucial role in enhancing the retention of macromolecules and nanoparticles within neoplastic tissues <Paper corpusId=\"257208604\" paperTitle=\"(Yuan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"205924542\" paperTitle=\"(Deng et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe physical properties of nanocarriers significantly impact EPR-based drug delivery. Nanoparticles must typically be between 50-200 nm in size to effectively leverage the EPR effect <Paper corpusId=\"55688965\" paperTitle=\"(Babu et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. Particles smaller than 50 nm may undergo extravasation from the tumor through fenestrations and are less likely to be retained in the tumor tissue for extended periods <Paper corpusId=\"55688965\" paperTitle=\"(Babu et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>, while larger particles may have limited tumor penetration.\n\nThe variability in the EPR effect between patients and tumor types leads to unpredictable therapeutic outcomes in clinical settings <Paper corpusId=\"272525176\" paperTitle=\"(Hasan et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Studies have shown that some imaging contrast agents may correlate more strongly with the EPR effect than actual drug delivery systems, suggesting that the EPR effect may be more relevant for diagnostic applications than therapeutic ones in certain contexts <Paper corpusId=\"230713993\" paperTitle=\"(Svoronos et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor many anti-cancer drugs, particularly chemotherapeutics that are inherently toxic, systemic injection of even nanoparticle formulations must be administered at very high doses to achieve significant drug accumulation via the EPR effect, often resulting in off-target toxicity that limits the therapeutic efficacy <Paper corpusId=\"247886899\" paperTitle=\"(Milligan et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This trade-off between efficacy and toxicity remains a significant challenge for EPR-based drug delivery systems.\n\nDespite these limitations, the EPR effect continues to be a fundamental concept in the design of cancer nanomedicines. Drug-carrying nanoparticles can increase the accumulation of chemotherapy drugs in tumor tissues through the EPR effect, potentially improving therapeutic effects and reducing toxic side effects by limiting unnecessary release in normal tissues <Paper corpusId=\"257208604\" paperTitle=\"(Yuan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"205924542\" paperTitle=\"(Deng et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, recognizing the heterogeneous nature of the EPR effect across different tumor types and patients is essential for developing more effective nanomedicine-based cancer therapies <Paper corpusId=\"229686114\" paperTitle=\"(Gisbert-Garzaran et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is historically one of the most frequently cited advantages of nanoparticle cancer therapeutics (Kalyane et al., 2019). As tumorigenesis occurs, the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) induces the formation of a disordered, complex vascular network feeding tumor cells as they proliferate. High expression of VEGF in tumor tissue has been implicated in the formation of abnormal vascular wall morphology, where the endothelium lining the blood vessels contains large gaps-or \"leaky\" junctions-allowing for enhanced permeability of small particles and cells across the vascular wall. It is this enhanced permeability that is a double-edged sword for cancer: on the one hand, it is believed to enhance tumor metastasis by allowing the escape of tumor cells into the infiltrating vessels, which circulate them across the body to distant metastatic sites (Iyer et al., 2006); on the other hand, the leaky vasculature unique to the tumor microenvironment promotes the accumulation of systemically circulating nanoparticles at the tumor site, a phenomenon that should enhance the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle drugs against solid tumors. Despite the premise of the EPR effect to preferentially enhance the uptake of nanoparticles in tumors, the challenges we have outlined above clearly indicate there remains significant room for improving nanoparticle delivery. Uptake into tumor tissue via the EPR effect alone has been found to result in a mere 2-fold increase in accumulation of systemically injected drugs (Nakamura et al., 2016). While drugs piggybacking on the EPR effect have excelled in preclinical models, they have yet to find clinical success in humans (Danhier, 2016). For many anti-cancer drugs, such as chemotherapeutics that are inherently toxic, systemic injection of even nanoparticle formulations must be done at very high doses to achieve significant drug accumulation via the EPR effect; this occurs, however, at the cost of off-target toxicity that limits the administered dose and therefore, the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs [39]."

                            "Nanotechnology offers several attractive design features that have prompted its exploration for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Nanosized drugs have a large loading capacity, the ability to protect the payload from degradation, a large surface on which to conjugate targeting ligands, and controlled or sustained release. Nanosized drugs also leak preferentially into tumor tissue through permeable tumor vessels and are then retained in the tumor bed due to reduced lymphatic drainage. This process is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, while the EPR effect is widely held to improve delivery of nanodrugs to tumors, it in fact offers less than a 2-fold increase in nanodrug delivery compared with critical normal organs, resulting in drug concentrations that are not sufficient for curing most cancers. In this Review, we first overview various barriers for nanosized drug delivery with an emphasis on the capillary wall's resistance, the main obstacle to delivering drugs. Then, we discuss current regulatory issues facing nanomedicine. Finally, we discuss how to make the delivery of nanosized drugs to tumors more effective by building on the EPR effect."

High molecular weight substances or low molecular drugs coupled with high molecular weight carriers penetrate highly vascularized tumour tissues, are inefficiently removed by lymphatic drainage and therefore accumulate in tumours. The existence of the EPR effect was experimentally confirmed for many types of macromolecular anticancer drug delivery systems (Matsumura et al., 1986). Despite the simplicity of the approach it has serious disadvantages. The accumulation of high molecular weight substances occurs only to solid tumours with developed vascularization, high tumour mass and poor lymphatic drainage. However, these types of solid tumours can be relatively easy removed by surgery. The efficiency of this type of passive targeting is low for multifocal metastatic tumours that cannot be removed using surgical procedures and requires chemotherapy. Consequently, the EPR effect cannot be effectively used for overcoming drug resistance in most tumours that badly require it."

                            "Enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) in cancer therapy leverages the structural and functional abnormalities of solid tumors [66,67]. Blood vessels in tumors form quickly and poorly as a result of an increased rate of angiogenesis to meet the increased demands for nutrients and oxygen (Ejigah et al., 2022). The newly-formed blood vessels are distorted and the endothelial cells are poorly aligned with large openings (Greish, 2012). The tumor's vascular wall also exhibits substantial structural abnormalities due to the absence of perivascular cells and smooth muscle layers (Ejigah et al., 2022)(Greish, 2012). The tumor's leaky vasculature facilitates the transport of macromolecules and nanoparticles into the tumor tissue while the complementary poor lymphatic drainage prevents clearance of the macromolecules and nanoparticles, leading to their accumulation within the tumor tissue (Miao et al., 2017)(Ejigah et al., 2022)(Fang et al., 2011). Thus, the differences in the blood vessels of tumors and healthy tissues make targeting possible (Fang et al., 2011)(Natfji et al., 2017). This phenomenon and passive tumor targeting is referred to as the EPR effect (Ejigah et al., 2022)(Greish, 2012)",
                            "Blood vessels in pancreatic adenocarcinoma may collapse or become clogged because of the dense stroma (Figure 2) and various extracellular components which induce stress and constriction, affecting the extravasation of macromolecules and particles into tumor tissues [67,(Rajora et al., 2014)(Fang et al., 2020)(Edwards et al., 2021). This may explain why nanotherapeutics have not demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, other studies have reported that the EPR effect in cancer is not based only on the \"leakiness\" of the vasculature because rigid tumors such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer exhibit EPR [72,73,77]78]."

As shown in Fig. 3A, due to the EPR effect, nanoformulations in circulation can enter tumor tissues through the gaps between endothelial cells in tumor blood vessels (Kalyane et al., 2019). This effect further enhances the preferential accumulation of nanocarriers within tumor tissues and accelerates intracellular delivery including endocytosis, lysosomal fusion, escape, cytoplasmic release, and combining the target organelle (Fig. 3B) (Wei et al., 2021)(Shinde et al., 2022)(Dai et al., 2017). These properties of tumors provide favorable conditions for designing tumor-targeted antitumor NPs. Drug-carrying NPs can increase the accumulation of chemotherapy drugs in tumor tissues through EPR effect, improve therapeutic effects and reduce toxic and side effects by reducing unnecessary release in normal tissues (Tian et al., 2014)(Deng et al., 2015)."

                            "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) play a crucial role in tumor metastasis, but it is rare for any chemotherapy regimen to focus on killing CTCs. Herein, we describe doxorubicin (Dox) micelles that showed anti-metastatic activity by killing CTCs. Dox micelles with a small particle size and high encapsulation efficiency were obtained using a pH-induced self-assembly method. Compared with free Dox, Dox micelles exhibited improved cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and cellular uptake. In addition, Dox micelles showed a sustained release behavior in vitro, and in a transgenic zebrafish model, Dox micelles exhibited a longer circulation time and lower extravasation from blood vessels into surrounding tissues. Anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities of Dox micelles were investigated in transgenic zebrafish and mouse models. In transgenic zebrafish, Dox micelles inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing zebrafish. Furthermore, Dox micelles suppressed tumor metastasis by killing CTCs. In addition, improved anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities were also confirmed in mouse tumor models, where immunofluorescent staining of tumors indicated that Dox micelles induced more apoptosis and showed fewer proliferation-positive cells. There were decreased side effects in transgenic zebrafish and mice after administration of Dox micelles. In conclusion, Dox micelles showed stronger anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities and decreased side effects both in vitro and in vivo, which may have potential applications in cancer therapy."

                            "In solid tumors, such as lung cancer, the EPR effect plays an important role in determining the efficacy of the nanoparticle-based drug delivery system (Maeda, 2001). The presence of a highly fenestrated blood vasculature in the tumor facilitates the EPR effect allowing the enhanced entry of colloidal nanoparticles into the tumor (Figure 2). Additionally, the poor lymphatic flow in the tumor tissue adds to this effect and results in enhanced retention of nanoparticles within the tumor site. In contrast to tumor tissues, the blood vasculature in normal tissues is intact and less permeable attenuating the uptake of nanoparticles by normal tissues. Furthermore, the size, shape, and surface properties of nanoparticles are critically important for passive targeting of solid tumors. The EPR effect usually applies to particles that are less than 200 nm in size. However, particles less than 50 nm in size frequently undergo extravasation from the tumor through the fenestrations and are thus less likely to be retained in the tumor tissue for extended periods of time. Moreover, active targeting of nanoparticles is accomplished by decorating the surface of the nanoparticle with specific ligands to promote the binding and interaction with overexpressed protein receptors on cancer cell surfaces. This approach leads to preferential binding, uptake, and intracellular accumulation of the drug or gene in the targeted cells. However, the overall tumor accumulation and therapeutic effect of targeted nanoparticles may be principally controlled by the EPR effect (Dinauer et al., 2005)."

                            "Passive targeting is another important strategy that exploits the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, a phenomenon whereby nanoparticles preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues due to the leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage that are characteristic of solid tumors. Although passive targeting does not involve specific ligand-receptor interactions, it allows for the preferential concentration of nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment, thereby increasing the local concentration of the drug and enhancing its efficacy.\n\nWhile passive targeting is inherently less selective than active targeting, it plays a crucial role in delivering nanoparticles to solid tumors, including CRC. The EPR effect is particularly effective for larger nanoparticles, such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, which can accumulate in tumor tissues more readily than smaller particles. However, the effectiveness of the EPR effect can vary significantly between patients and tumor types, leading to variability in therapeutic outcomes. For example, tumors with dense stromal tissue or poor vasculature may exhibit a reduced EPR effect, limiting the accumulation of nanoparticles."

However, the correlations are significantly stronger for the imaging contrast ratio (permeability factor R 2 = 0.20; retention factor R 2 = 0.67) than for the delivery ratio (R 2 = 0.12 and 0.25) or tumor cell delivery (R 2 = 0.09 and 0.27). This is consistent with our previous results, which suggest that the EPR effect is more important for the use of pHLIP as an imaging contrast agent than for its use as a tumor-specific drug delivery system."

                "tldr": "Despite its promise, the EPR effect faces significant limitations including poor efficacy in metastatic and early-stage tumors, substantial variability across tumor types, and modest clinical performance with only a 2-fold increase in tumor accumulation compared to normal tissues. These limitations significantly impact the therapeutic efficacy of nanomedicines in clinical settings. (17 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, while fundamental to nanomedicine design, faces several critical limitations that hinder its clinical translation. A primary challenge is its limited applicability across various tumor types. While the EPR effect works relatively well for large, vascularized solid tumors that can often be surgically removed, it shows limited effectiveness in multifocal metastatic tumors that require systemic chemotherapy and cannot be surgically addressed <Paper corpusId=\"16051895\" paperTitle=\"(Koushik et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This creates a paradoxical situation where nanomedicines that rely on the EPR effect are least effective for the cancer types that most urgently require improved drug delivery strategies <Paper corpusId=\"16051895\" paperTitle=\"(Koushik et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nCertain tumor categories show minimal or no EPR effect regardless of other factors. These include blood cancers, very early-stage tumors, and small metastatic lesions <Paper corpusId=\"227260630\" paperTitle=\"(Fu et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This limitation significantly impacts the potential of EPR-based strategies to treat some of the most clinically relevant forms of cancer.\n\nThe heterogeneity of the EPR effect presents another substantial challenge. The magnitude of the EPR effect varies greatly depending on tumor type, location, blood perfusion status, and the physical-chemical characteristics of delivered agents <Paper corpusId=\"256595759\" paperTitle=\"(Abballe et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"237330183\" paperTitle=\"(Wu, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This variability can occur not only between different tumor types but also between patients and even within the same tumor, leading to unpredictable therapeutic outcomes in clinical settings <Paper corpusId=\"268168475\" paperTitle=\"(Arafat et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"235653150\" paperTitle=\"(Subhan et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"259270131\" paperTitle=\"(Kim et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nTumor microenvironment factors significantly impair the EPR effect. High interstitial fluid pressure can reduce the EPR effect by counteracting the movement of nanoparticles from blood vessels into tumor tissue <Paper corpusId=\"268168475\" paperTitle=\"(Arafat et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, the high density of stromal cells and matrix proteins, combined with elevated interstitial fluid pressure, creates a barrier limiting the delivery of compounds to the tumor core <Paper corpusId=\"267639255\" paperTitle=\"(Haze et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nSpecific tumor types present unique challenges for EPR-based delivery. Blood vessels in pancreatic adenocarcinoma may collapse or become clogged due to dense stroma and various extracellular components that induce stress and constriction, affecting the extravasation of macromolecules and particles into tumor tissues <Paper corpusId=\"258316363\" paperTitle=\"(Olajubutu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"83790147\" paperTitle=\"(Rajora et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"235813308\" paperTitle=\"(Edwards et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, the clinical translation of EPR-based drug delivery has shown more modest results than initially expected from preclinical studies. Despite promising preclinical results, the actual tumor accumulation achieved through the EPR effect in clinical settings has been found to result in a mere 2-fold increase compared to critical normal organs <Paper corpusId=\"247886899\" paperTitle=\"(Milligan et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"20466264\" paperTitle=\"(Nakamura et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This modest enhancement is often insufficient for achieving therapeutic concentrations needed to effectively treat most cancers <Paper corpusId=\"247886899\" paperTitle=\"(Milligan et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor many anti-cancer drugs, particularly chemotherapeutics that are inherently toxic, systemic injection of even nanoparticle formulations must be administered at very high doses to achieve significant drug accumulation via the EPR effect, often resulting in off-target toxicity that limits the therapeutic efficacy <Paper corpusId=\"247886899\" paperTitle=\"(Milligan et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This trade-off between efficacy and toxicity remains a significant challenge for EPR-based drug delivery systems.\n\nThese limitations help explain why many well-designed drug delivery systems fail when tested in patients <Paper corpusId=\"267086100\" paperTitle=\"(Garcia-Dominguez et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4539392\" paperTitle=\"(Din et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. The differences between experimental models using mouse xenografts, which often demonstrate strong EPR effects, and human tumors, which frequently show more variable and often reduced EPR effects, contribute to the challenges in clinical translation <Paper corpusId=\"267086100\" paperTitle=\"(Garcia-Dominguez et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nDespite these limitations, the EPR effect continues to be a fundamental concept in nanomedicine design, with the recognition that complementary strategies beyond passive targeting are needed to enhance efficacy <Paper corpusId=\"229686114\" paperTitle=\"(Gisbert-Garzaran et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"195660377\" paperTitle=\"(Grodzinski et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. The significant variability in the EPR effect has prompted research into alternative approaches and strategies to overcome these limitations for more effective nanomedicine-based cancer therapies.",

                            "The EPR effect is the result of the increased permeability of the tumour vascular endothelium to circulating macromolecules combined with limited lymphatic drainage from the tumour interstitium. High molecular weight substances or low molecular drugs coupled with high molecular weight carriers penetrate highly vascularized tumour tissues, are inefficiently removed by lymphatic drainage and therefore accumulate in tumours. The existence of the EPR effect was experimentally confirmed for many types of macromolecular anticancer drug delivery systems (Matsumura et al., 1986). Despite the simplicity of the approach it has serious disadvantages. The accumulation of high molecular weight substances occurs only to solid tumours with developed vascularization, high tumour mass and poor lymphatic drainage. However, these types of solid tumours can be relatively easy removed by surgery. The efficiency of this type of passive targeting is low for multifocal metastatic tumours that cannot be removed using surgical procedures and requires chemotherapy. Consequently, the EPR effect cannot be effectively used for overcoming drug resistance in most tumours that badly require it."

This mechanism describes the intrinsic ability of macromolecules to reach and accumulate in the solid tumors' interstitium, based on tumor pathophysiological characteristics such as: (i) neovascularization, characterized by deficient basement membranes and fenestrated structures of endothelial tubes, (ii) upregulation of inflammatory factors and (iii) lack of efficient drainage of lymphatic systems, that together sustain the delivery, accumulation and retention of molecules into solid tumor tissues (Benjamin et al., 1999)(Wu, 2021). Passive targeting exploits the EPR effect on the delivery and retention of drugs at target site. However, in clinical settings, this strategy has not always worked as well as hoped due to a variety of factors, including the tumor type, location, blood perfusion status, physical-chemical characteristics of delivered agents and difficulty in predicting the distribution of drugs."

Despite the discovery and synthesis of hundreds of thousands of anticancer compounds targeting various crucial units in cancer cell proliferation and metabolism, the fundamental problem is the lack of targeting delivery of these compounds selectively into solid tumor tissue to maintain an effective concentration level for a certain length of time for drug-tumor interaction to execute anticancer activities. The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) describes a universal pathophysiological phenomenon and mechanism in which macromolecular compounds such as albumin and other polymer-conjugated drugs beyond certain sizes (above 40 kDa) can progressively accumulate in the tumor vascularized area and thus achieve targeting delivery and retention of anticancer compounds into solid tumor tissue. Targeting therapy via the EPR effect in clinical practice is not always successful since the strength of the EPR effect varies depending on the type and location of tumors, status of blood perfusion in tumors, and the physical-chemical properties of macromolecular anticancer agents. This review highlights the significance of the concept and mechanism of the EPR effect and discusses methods for better utilizing the EPR effect in developing smarter macromolecular nanomedicine to achieve a satisfactory outcome in clinical applications."

Nanodrugs for cancer therapy administered intravenously escape renal clearance, are unable to penetrate through tight endothelial junctions of normal blood vessels and remain at a high level in plasma. Over time, the concentration of nanodrugs builds up in tumors due to the EPR effect, reaching several times higher than that of plasma due to the lack of lymphatic drainage.

                            "Over the past few decades, the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of nanomedicine has been a crucial phenomenon in targeted cancer therapy. Specifically, understanding the EPR effect has been a significant aspect of delivering anticancer agents efficiently to targeted tumors. Although the therapeutic effect has been demonstrated in experimental models using mouse xenografts, the clinical translation of the EPR effect of nanomedicine faces several challenges due to dense extracellular matrix (ECM), high interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) levels, and other factors that arise from tumor heterogeneity and complexity. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of the EPR effect of nanomedicine in clinics is essential to overcome the hurdles of the clinical translation of nanomedicine. This paper introduces the basic mechanism of the EPR effect of nanomedicine, the recently discussed challenges of the EPR effect of nanomedicine, and various strategies of recent nanomedicine to overcome the limitations expected from the patients\u2019 tumor microenvironments."

                            "Enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) in cancer therapy leverages the structural and functional abnormalities of solid tumors [66,67]. Blood vessels in tumors form quickly and poorly as a result of an increased rate of angiogenesis to meet the increased demands for nutrients and oxygen (Ejigah et al., 2022). The newly-formed blood vessels are distorted and the endothelial cells are poorly aligned with large openings (Greish, 2012). The tumor's vascular wall also exhibits substantial structural abnormalities due to the absence of perivascular cells and smooth muscle layers (Ejigah et al., 2022)(Greish, 2012). The tumor's leaky vasculature facilitates the transport of macromolecules and nanoparticles into the tumor tissue while the complementary poor lymphatic drainage prevents clearance of the macromolecules and nanoparticles, leading to their accumulation within the tumor tissue (Miao et al., 2017)(Ejigah et al., 2022)(Fang et al., 2011). Thus, the differences in the blood vessels of tumors and healthy tissues make targeting possible (Fang et al., 2011)(Natfji et al., 2017). This phenomenon and passive tumor targeting is referred to as the EPR effect (Ejigah et al., 2022)(Greish, 2012)",
                            "Blood vessels in pancreatic adenocarcinoma may collapse or become clogged because of the dense stroma (Figure 2) and various extracellular components which induce stress and constriction, affecting the extravasation of macromolecules and particles into tumor tissues [67,(Rajora et al., 2014)(Fang et al., 2020)(Edwards et al., 2021). This may explain why nanotherapeutics have not demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, other studies have reported that the EPR effect in cancer is not based only on the \"leakiness\" of the vasculature because rigid tumors such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer exhibit EPR [72,73,77]78]."

However, such promising results have, to date, failed to translate into a marketed product. Polymer-drug conjugates rely on two factors for activity: (i) the presence of a defective vasculature, for passive accumulation of this technology into the tumour tissue (enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect) and (ii) the presence of a specific trigger at the tumour site, for selective drug release (e.g., the enzyme cathepsin B). Here, we retrospectively analyse literature data to investigate which tumour types have proved more responsive to polymer-drug conjugates and to determine correlations between the magnitude of the EPR effect and/or expression of cathepsin B. Lung, breast and ovarian cancers showed the highest response rate (30%, 47% and 41%, respectively for cathepsin-activated conjugates and 31%, 43%, 40%, across all conjugates). An analysis of literature data on cathepsin content in various tumour types showed that these tumour types had high cathepsin content (up to 3835 ng/mg for lung cancer), although marked heterogeneity was observed across different studies. In addition, these tumour types were also reported as having a high EPR effect. Our results suggest that a pre-screening of patient population could bring a more marked clinical benefit."

This is attributed to the unique features of the tumour microenvironment (TME), which is known to create a dense stromal formation and poorly immunogenic condition. In particular, the TME of PC, including the stromal cells and extracellular matrix, plays an essential role in the progression and chemoresistance of PC. Consequently, several promising agents that target key components of the stroma have already been developed and are currently in multiple stages of clinical trials. Therefore, the authors review the latest available evidence on novel stroma-targeting approaches, highlighting the potential impact of the stroma as a key component of the TME in PC."

                            "The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is historically one of the most frequently cited advantages of nanoparticle cancer therapeutics (Kalyane et al., 2019). As tumorigenesis occurs, the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) induces the formation of a disordered, complex vascular network feeding tumor cells as they proliferate. High expression of VEGF in tumor tissue has been implicated in the formation of abnormal vascular wall morphology, where the endothelium lining the blood vessels contains large gaps-or \"leaky\" junctions-allowing for enhanced permeability of small particles and cells across the vascular wall. It is this enhanced permeability that is a double-edged sword for cancer: on the one hand, it is believed to enhance tumor metastasis by allowing the escape of tumor cells into the infiltrating vessels, which circulate them across the body to distant metastatic sites (Iyer et al., 2006); on the other hand, the leaky vasculature unique to the tumor microenvironment promotes the accumulation of systemically circulating nanoparticles at the tumor site, a phenomenon that should enhance the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle drugs against solid tumors. Despite the premise of the EPR effect to preferentially enhance the uptake of nanoparticles in tumors, the challenges we have outlined above clearly indicate there remains significant room for improving nanoparticle delivery. Uptake into tumor tissue via the EPR effect alone has been found to result in a mere 2-fold increase in accumulation of systemically injected drugs (Nakamura et al., 2016). While drugs piggybacking on the EPR effect have excelled in preclinical models, they have yet to find clinical success in humans (Danhier, 2016). For many anti-cancer drugs, such as chemotherapeutics that are inherently toxic, systemic injection of even nanoparticle formulations must be done at very high doses to achieve significant drug accumulation via the EPR effect; this occurs, however, at the cost of off-target toxicity that limits the administered dose and therefore, the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs [39]."

                            "Nanotechnology offers several attractive design features that have prompted its exploration for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Nanosized drugs have a large loading capacity, the ability to protect the payload from degradation, a large surface on which to conjugate targeting ligands, and controlled or sustained release. Nanosized drugs also leak preferentially into tumor tissue through permeable tumor vessels and are then retained in the tumor bed due to reduced lymphatic drainage. This process is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, while the EPR effect is widely held to improve delivery of nanodrugs to tumors, it in fact offers less than a 2-fold increase in nanodrug delivery compared with critical normal organs, resulting in drug concentrations that are not sufficient for curing most cancers. In this Review, we first overview various barriers for nanosized drug delivery with an emphasis on the capillary wall's resistance, the main obstacle to delivering drugs. Then, we discuss current regulatory issues facing nanomedicine. Finally, we discuss how to make the delivery of nanosized drugs to tumors more effective by building on the EPR effect."

                            "The main mechanism of tumor targeting of anticancer nanomedicines is based on the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, first described by Matsumura and Maeda in 1986 (Matsumura et al., 1986) as a passive yet powerful targeting strategy. They showed that tumor tissues had defective blood vessels with aberrant branching and large openings between endothelial cells of around 400 nm due to their rapid proliferation and decreased number of pericytes. This unique characteristic helps macromolecules, such as nanocarriers, easily move into tumor tissues after crossing the endothelium barrier. Furthermore, solid tumors have a poor lymphatic drainage system, leading to extended retention times of nanocarriers in the tumor extracellular matrix. \n\nAlthough the EPR effect has allowed the successful development of some anticancer nanomedicines with a passive tumor-targeting mechanism (Mitchell et al., 2020), many well-designed drug delivery systems fail when tested in patients. Over the last years, the role of the EPR effect has been investigated, focusing on the influence of the TME, heterogeneity of human tumors, and differences between animal models and actual patients (Din et al., 2017)(Maeda et al., 2000)(Zi et al., 2022). These factors may contribute to the observed limited penetration of nanomedicines in human tumors, highlighting the need for further refinement of passive targeting strategies."

Nanocarriers have been used to circumvent the problems associated with conventional antitumor drug delivery systems, including their nonspecificity, severe side effects, burst release and damaging the normal cells. Nanocarriers improve the bioavailability and therapeutic efficiency of antitumor drugs, while providing preferential accumulation at the target site. A number of nanocarriers have been developed; however, only a few of them are clinically approved for the delivery of antitumor drugs for their intended actions at the targeted sites. The present review is divided into three main parts: first part presents introduction of various nanocarriers and their relevance in the delivery of anticancer drugs, second part encompasses targeting mechanisms and surface functionalization on nanocarriers and third part covers the description of selected tumors, including breast, lungs, colorectal and pancreatic tumors, and applications of relative nanocarriers in these tumors. This review increases the understanding of tumor treatment with the promising use of nanotechnology."

The field has become a cradle of multidisciplinary investigations bringing together physicists, chemists, and engineers working with clinicians and biologists to address paramount problems in cancer care and treatment. Some have argued that the explosion in the number of research papers has not been followed by sufficient clinical activity in nanomedicine. However, three new nanodrugs have now been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the past three years, confirming the validity of nanotechnology approaches in cancer. Excitingly, translational pipelines contain several additional intriguing candidates. In this Nano Focus article, we discuss potential barriers inhibiting further incorporation of nanomedicines into patient care, possible strategies to overcome these barriers, and promising new directions in cancer interventions based on nanotechnology. Insights presented herein are outcomes of discussions held at a recent strategic workshop hosted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which brought together research, clinical, and commercial leaders of the nanomedicine field."

Animal models of solid tumors rich in blood flow demonstrated enhanced EPR effects. However, many clinical cancers such as late-stage tumors and refractory tumors are associated with poor blood flow due to the coagulation and thrombi formation exhibiting poor EPR effect [7](Wu, 2021)(Islam et al., 2021)(Haider et al., 2021)(Huang et al., 2021)(Subrahmanyam et al., 2021). For such tumors, the improvement of EPR-based drug delivery is necessary by modifying tumor blood vessels, angiogenesis, a vascular edifice, blood flow, etc. The EPR effect can be enhanced by modifying vascular intermediaries such as angiotensin II, nitroglycerin or NO, CO, and enzyme inhibitors [7](Wu, 2021)(Islam et al., 2021)(Haider et al., 2021). An integration of vascular mediators with a nanodrug may be an important strategy for an enhanced EPR effect. Further, targeting tumor stroma and extracellular matrix, and controlling tumor vessels, may improve EPR-targeted drug delivery to tumors (Fang, 2022)",

                            "Chemotherapy for human solid tumors in clinical practice is far from satisfactory. Despite the discovery and synthesis of hundreds of thousands of anticancer compounds targeting various crucial units in cancer cell proliferation and metabolism, the fundamental problem is the lack of targeting delivery of these compounds selectively into solid tumor tissue to maintain an effective concentration level for a certain length of time for drug-tumor interaction to execute anticancer activities. The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) describes a universal pathophysiological phenomenon and mechanism in which macromolecular compounds such as albumin and other polymer-conjugated drugs beyond certain sizes (above 40 kDa) can progressively accumulate in the tumor vascularized area and thus achieve targeting delivery and retention of anticancer compounds into solid tumor tissue. Targeting therapy via the EPR effect in clinical practice is not always successful since the strength of the EPR effect varies depending on the type and location of tumors, status of blood perfusion in tumors, and the physical-chemical properties of macromolecular anticancer agents. This review highlights the significance of the concept and mechanism of the EPR effect and discusses methods for better utilizing the EPR effect in developing smarter macromolecular nanomedicine to achieve a satisfactory outcome in clinical applications."

                            "The EPR effect was first demonstrated in mouse tumor models in which the tumor size was usually smaller than 10 mm and the tumors were highly vasculated; nanomedicines thus had high permeability. In contrast, human tumors diagnosed in clinical situations are frequently larger than 3 mm and up to 10 cm or more. In such large tumors, blood flow is often suppressed or blood vessels are occluded because of the formation of vascular clots or thrombi [9](Seki et al., 2009)(Maeda, 2012)[12](Maeda et al., 2018)(Strongman et al., 2019)(Salama, 2004)(Navi et al., 2019). This blood-flow suppression thus results in little or no drug delivery and, therefore, a highly limited EPR effect [9,12](Maeda et al., 2018)(Strongman et al., 2019)(Salama, 2004)(Navi et al., 2019)."

Sildenafil is a potent inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) through the relaxation of smooth muscles and the modulation of vascular endothelial permeability. Overexpression of PDE-5 has been reported in lung, colon, metastatic breast cancers, and bladder squamous carcinoma. Moreover, sildenafil has been reported to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells of different origins to the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents with augmented apoptosis mediated through inducing the downregulation of Bcl-xL and FAP-1 expression, enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, phosphorylating BAD and Bcl-2, upregulating caspase-3,8,9 activities, and blocking cells at G0/G1 cell cycle phase. Sildenafil has also demonstrated inhibitory effects on the efflux activity of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as ABCC4, ABCC5, ABCB1, and ABCG2, ultimately reversing multidrug resistance. Accordingly, there has been a growing interest in using sildenafil as monotherapy or chemoadjuvant in EPR augmentation and management of different types of cancer. In this review, we critically examine the basic molecular mechanism of sildenafil related to cancer biology and discuss the overall potential of sildenafil in enhancing EPR-based anticancer drug delivery, pointing to the outcomes of the most important related preclinical and clinical studies."

The development of cancer nanomedicine has promised highly effective treatment options unprecedented by standard therapeutics. However, the therapeutic efficacy of passively targeted nanomedicine is not always satisfactory because it is largely influenced by the heterogeneity of the intensity of the EPR effect exhibited within a tumor, at different stages of a tumor, and among individual tumors. In addition, limited data on EPR effectiveness in human hinders further clinical translation of nanomedicine. This unsatisfactory therapeutic outcome in mice and humans necessitates novel approaches to improve the EPR effect. This review focuses on current attempts at overcoming the limitations of traditional EPR-dependent nanomedicine by incorporating supplementary strategies, such as additional molecular targeting, physical alteration, or physiological remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. This review will provide valuable insight to researchers who seek to overcome the limitations of relying on the EPR effect alone in cancer nanomedicine and go \"beyond the EPR effect\"."

                            "Generally, these agents can be passively distributed to target cancer cells in tumors, and passive targeting relies mostly on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect derived from the leaky nature of tumor vasculature (Maeda, 2010). The basic pathophysiological phenomenon of EPR is hyperpermeable tumor vasculature combined with impaired lymphatic drainage, resulting in enhanced permeability and retention of molecules (Nichols et al., 2014)(Azzopardi et al., 2013). Although the conventional EPR effect results in improved delivery to tumors compared with normal tissue, some tumors do not exhibit the EPR effect and the permeability of vessels may not be the same throughout a single tumor (Sriraman et al., 2014)(Jain, 1998). Moreover, the rapid proliferation of cancer cells around the vessels may impede therapeu-tic molecule penetration (Grantab et al., 2006). Therefore, the killing of perivascular cancer cells will help improve the EPR effect."

Strategies to enhance drug penetration have potential to improve therapeutic outcome. The development of multicellular layers (MCLs), in which tumor cells are grown on a semipermeable Teflon support membrane, has facilitated quantification of drug penetration through solid tissue. The goals of the present study were to quantify the penetration of anticancer drugs as a function of cellular adhesion and packing density and to determine the effects of variable penetration on therapeutic efficacy in this model system. We compared the properties of MCLs grown from two epithelioid and round subclones of a colon carcinoma cell line. One pair of epithelioid and round sublines differed in expression of alpha-E-catenin, and both pairs generated MCLs with different packing density. The penetration of commonly used anticancer agents (paclitaxel, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil) through MCLs derived from these cell lines was significantly greater through the round (loosely packed) than through the epithelioid (tightly packed) sublines. In MCLs treated with doxorubicin, we observed greater survival in the tightly packed cell lines than in the loosely packed cell lines. Impaired penetration of anticancer agents through MCLs derived from the tightly packed cell lines and relative resistance to killing of cells within them by doxorubicin treatment strengthen the role of tumor cell adhesion and packing density as contributing to drug resistance."

The field has become a cradle of multidisciplinary investigations bringing together physicists, chemists, and engineers working with clinicians and biologists to address paramount problems in cancer care and treatment. Some have argued that the explosion in the number of research papers has not been followed by sufficient clinical activity in nanomedicine. However, three new nanodrugs have now been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the past three years, confirming the validity of nanotechnology approaches in cancer. Excitingly, translational pipelines contain several additional intriguing candidates. In this Nano Focus article, we discuss potential barriers inhibiting further incorporation of nanomedicines into patient care, possible strategies to overcome these barriers, and promising new directions in cancer interventions based on nanotechnology. Insights presented herein are outcomes of discussions held at a recent strategic workshop hosted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which brought together research, clinical, and commercial leaders of the nanomedicine field."

The advanced stage of cancers may induce activated blood coagulation cascades, which cause thrombus formation in tumor vasculature. The drug delivery, as well as the EPR effect, will be enhanced by restoring obstructed tumor blood flow and improving tumor vascular permeability through vascular mediators.
