            "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) are in high demand because of their widespread applications in natural language processing, image processing, and a lot of other domains. However, due to their computational expense, over-parameterization, and large memory requirements, DNN applications often require the use of substantial model resources. This strict requirement of latency and limited memory availability are hurdles in the device deployment of these technologies. Therefore, a common idea could be to mitigate the DNN-based models\u2019 size without any performance degradation using different compression techniques. During the last few years, a great deal of progress has been made in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using deep learning approaches. The objective of this research is to offer a thorough overview of the various pruning methods applied in the context of NLP. In this paper, we review several recent pruning-based schemes used for converting standard networks into their compact and accelerated versions. Traditionally, pruning is a technique for improving latency, reducing model size, and computational complexity which is a viable approach to deal with the above-mentioned challenges. In general, these techniques are divided into two main categories: structural and unstructured pruning methods. Structural pruning methods are further classified into filter, channel, layer, block, and movement pruning. Whereas, neuron, magnitude-based, and iterative pruning lie in the category of unstructured pruning. For each method, we discuss the related metrics and benchmarks. Then recent work on each method is discussed in detail, which provides insightful analysis of the performance, related applications, and pros and cons. Then, a comparative analysis is provided to analyze the differences among approaches. Finally, the paper concludes with possible future directions and some technical challenges.",

[4] introduced the concept of deep compression, which involves a combination of Huffman coding, pruning and quantization for the compression of neural networks.Their study demonstrated that pruning can achieve significant compression (up to 90% on the weights) without a substantial loss in accuracy.\n\nIslam and Alawad propose [5] a novel method for reducing the complexity of deep learning models in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, making them more suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.\n\nThe approach combines compressive sensing and Bayesian learning to identify and represent the most important weights in the model in a compressed form.By stochastically pruning non-critical weights, the model's accuracy is preserved.The authors evaluate their approach on various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis and text classification, comparing it with other compression methods like weight pruning and knowledge distillation.Results indicate that their method can significantly reduce model complexity (90% compression) while maintaining high accuracy (<1% drop).The proposed technique offers a promising solution for deploying large language models in resource-limited settings, striking a favorable trade-off between model size and accuracy compared to other methods.\n\nMolchanov et al. [6] built upon structured pruning with the Group-wise Brain Damage (GBD) algorithm, which prunes filters within convolutional layers based on their importance.",

[42] introduce a method called Greedy-layer pruning for shrinking transformer models in NLP tasks.The authors aim to achieve a customizable tradeoff between performance and speed without the need for additional pre-training phases, unlike knowledge distillation methods.Greedy-layer pruning operates through iterative layer pruning using a greedy approach.The algorithm dynamically adjusts the model size for specific downstream tasks, allowing precise customization without sacrificing performance.The method focuses on reducing computational costs while maintaining high performance.Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of Greedy-layer pruning.For BERT and RoBERTa models, the approach achieves 95.3% and 95.4% performance retention, respectively, while pruning 50% of the layers.",

                    "text": "Unstructured pruning is a NLP approach used to minimise the size and complexity of neural networks used for language modelling, text classification, machine translation, and other NLP applications.This pruning technique involves selectively removing individual weights or parameters from the network, typically based on their magnitudes or importance scores.By eliminating redundant or less significant parameters, unstructured pruning aims to achieve model compression, improved efficiency, and reduced computational requirements without significantly sacrificing performance.The process of unstructured pruning involves two main steps: identification and removal.In the identification step, each weight or parameter in the network is evaluated based on a predefined criterion, such as magnitude or sensitivity analysis.Magnitude-based pruning, for example, ranks the weights according to their absolute values, allowing the removal of those with the smallest magnitudes.Depending on the pruning approach, this rating can be done globally or layer-by-layer.Once the weights or parameters are ranked, the removal step involves discarding a certain percentage of the least important ones.This removal can be performed by setting the corresponding weights to zero or by completely eliminating the associated connections.In some cases, a threshold is applied to determine the cutoff point for pruning, allowing finer control over the sparsity level of the pruned model.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of unstructured pruning is its flexibility in targeting specific weights or parameters, making it suitable for reducing the model size while preserving important network structures.However, this flexibility comes at the cost of irregular sparsity patterns, as individual weights are pruned independently.Consequently, unstructured pruning can lead to inefficient memory access and inefficient deployment on hardware accelerators optimized for dense matrix operations.To address these issues, additional techniques such as structured pruning and weight sharing can be applied in conjunction with unstructured pruning [7], [30], [50], [51], [52], [53].\n\nIn the context of NLP, unstructured pruning can be applied to various components of neural network models, including word embeddings, recurrent connections, and fully connected layers.",

                    "text": "Channel pruning in natural language processing (NLP) refers to a method for reducing the computational complexity and memory requirements of neural models by eliminating excess or redundant channels.In many tasks of NLP, like text classification or sentiment analysis, neural networks often employ convolutional layers to extract meaningful features from textual data.These convolutional layers consist of multiple channels, each responsible for detecting specific patterns or linguistic features.However, not all channels contribute equally to the network's performance, and some may even be redundant.Channel pruning aims to identify and remove these redundant channels, thereby reducing the model's overall complexity without significantly sacrificing accuracy.Channel pruning extends the idea of filter pruning to the entire channels of convolutional layers.A channel in a convolutional layer refers to the output of a single filter applied to the entire input.Instead of pruning individual filters, channel pruning prunes entire sets of filters (channels) from the network, leading to a more significant reduction in computational cost.In NLP models, channel pruning involves removing entire sets of learned features.The process of channel pruning is shown in Fig. 4.\n\nThe process typically involves evaluating the importance or contribution of each channel through methods like magnitude-based pruning or sensitivity analysis.Pruned models can generate significant computational reductions, making them more effective for use in large-scale NLP applications or on devices with limited resources.\n\nYu and Wu [37] introduces Unified Pruning Framework for Vision Transformers (UP-ViTs), a unified pruning framework for vision transformers, to address issues like large model sizes, memory consumption, and computational costs.Existing vision transformer pruning methods involve token sampling, which hampers generalization and is challenging to apply to NLP tasks.UP-ViTs prunes channels in a unified manner, covering all transformer components.It evaluates the importance scores of each filter in a pre-trained ViT and removes redundant channels based on compression goals.The approach maintains token representation consistency, ensuring generalization to downstream tasks.UP-ViTs outperform previous ViTs with higher throughput and can be extended to transformers in NLP tasks, showing improvements on language modeling benchmarks.",

Ayub\n## Abstract\nDeep neural networks (DNN) are in high demand because of their widespread applications in natural language processing, image processing, and a lot of other domains. However, due to their computational expense, over-parameterization, and large memory requirements, DNN applications often require the use of substantial model resources. This strict requirement of latency and limited memory availability are hurdles in the device deployment of these technologies. Therefore, a common idea could be to mitigate the DNN-based models\u2019 size without any performance degradation using different compression techniques. During the last few years, a great deal of progress has been made in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using deep learning approaches. The objective of this research is to offer a thorough overview of the various pruning methods applied in the context of NLP. In this paper, we review several recent pruning-based schemes used for converting standard networks into their compact and accelerated versions. Traditionally, pruning is a technique for improving latency, reducing model size, and computational complexity which is a viable approach to deal with the above-mentioned challenges. In general, these techniques are divided into two main categories: structural and unstructured pruning methods. Structural pruning methods are further classified into filter, channel, layer, block, and movement pruning. Whereas, neuron, magnitude-based, and iterative pruning lie in the category of unstructured pruning. For each method, we discuss the related metrics and benchmarks. Then recent work on each method is discussed in detail, which provides insightful analysis of the performance, related applications, and pros and cons. Then, a comparative analysis is provided to analyze the differences among approaches. Finally, the paper concludes with possible future directions and some technical challenges.\n## I. INTRODUCTION\nBy removing unnecessary or less impactful components, pruning can lead to a more compact network that requires fewer resources for training, inference, and deployment.Pruning can also help mitigate issues such as over-fitting and improve the network's interpretability and generalization capabilities.After pruning, the pruned network may undergo further fine-tuning or retraining to restore or even improve its performance.The overall goal of pruning is to achieve a more efficient and effective neural network by selectively removing redundant or less influential components while maintaining or improving its desired functionality.\n\nIn addition to allowing the use of NLP models on devices with limited resources such as smartphones and embedded systems, pruning also facilitates faster inference and reduced memory usage.The effectiveness and implications of pruning techniques in NLP have been extensively investigated in numerous research works.Han et al. [4] introduced the concept of deep compression, which involves a combination of Huffman coding, pruning and quantization for the compression of neural networks.Their study demonstrated that pruning can achieve significant compression (up to 90% on the weights) without a substantial loss in accuracy.\n\nIslam and Alawad propose [5] a novel method for reducing the complexity of deep learning models in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, making them more suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.\n\nThe approach combines compressive sensing and Bayesian learning to identify and represent the most important weights in the model in a compressed form.By stochastically pruning non-critical weights, the model's accuracy is preserved.The authors evaluate their approach on various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis and text classification, comparing it with other compression methods like weight pruning and knowledge distillation.Results indicate that their method can significantly reduce model complexity (90% compression) while maintaining high accuracy (<1% drop).The proposed technique offers a promising solution for deploying large language models in resource-limited settings, striking a favorable trade-off between model size and accuracy compared to other methods.\n\nMolchanov et al. [6] built upon structured pruning with the Group-wise Brain Damage (GBD) algorithm, which prunes filters within convolutional layers based on their importance.\n...\nMolchanov et al. [6] built upon structured pruning with the Group-wise Brain Damage (GBD) algorithm, which prunes filters within convolutional layers based on their importance.GBD pruning significantly reduces the amount of parameters (up to 95%) while maintaining accuracy.Li et al. [7] improved upon magnitude pruning with iterative magnitude pruning, which combines many pruning and fine-tuning processes.Their experiments demonstrated that iterative magnitude pruning can achieve high sparsity (up to 80%) while maintaining comparable performance.Combining pruning techniques with other model compression methods has also garnered attention.Zhu and Gupta [8] proposed combining pruning with low-rank matrix factorization, achieving higher compression rates.Their experiments on language models demonstrated significant model size reduction (up to 20 times) with minimal performance loss.\n\nIn addition to model compression, pruning techniques have been utilized to increase the interpretability of many NLP models.Voita et al. [9] explored pruning as a tool for interpretability in neural machine translation (NMT) models.By pruning the attention mechanism, they were able to identify important features and gain insights into the decision-making process of the model.Pruning methods, in general, present potential approaches for lowering the size and computing complexities of DNNs in NLP. of DNNs in NLP.Through the exploration of various pruning methods and their combinations with other compression techniques, researchers aim to develop more efficient and compact models without compromising performance or interpretability.\n\nOnan et al. [10] presented in the text is focused on the novel concept of text augmentation in the field of NLP.Text augmentation is a powerful concept that can significantly improve the performance of a wide range of downstream tasks.GTR-GA, the proposed approach, utilizes graph-based neural networks and genetic algorithms to create diverse and high-quality augmented text data.The model utilizes a graph attention network model, called HetGAPN, to obtain node representation of a heterogeneous graph over text features.\n\n## IV. METHODS\nTheir objective was to reduce model size by removing redundant parameters while preserving speech recognition performance.The authors propose a structured pruning method to lessen the size and complexity of self-supervised pre-trained models while maintaining their performance on speech-related tasks.The key contributions and findings of the paper include the following:\n\n1) Pruning Strategy: The authors present a specific pruning strategy tailored for self-supervised pre-trained models in the speech domain.This strategy identifies and removes less important structures or components, such as layers or neurons, based on their significance to the model's overall performance.2) Performance Analysis: The paper evaluates the impact of structured pruning on speech recognition and understanding tasks.It assesses the model's accuracy and efficiency before and after pruning, demonstrating the potential benefits of structured pruning in reducing model size and computational requirements while preserving task performance.3) Comparison with Baselines: The authors compare their proposed structured pruning approach with other baseline methods commonly used for model compressions, such as unstructured pruning or weight quantization.The comparison highlights the advantages and effectiveness of structured pruning specifically for selfsupervised pre-trained models in the speech domain.The results show significant compression and improved accuracy compared to the original model, as validated by experiments on LibriSpeech and SLURP datasets.\n\nMa et al. [29] proposes Large Language Model-Pruner (LLM-Pruner), a task-agnostic compression method, aiming to maintain the multi-task solving and language generation abilities of the original LLM while minimizing reliance on the extensive training dataset.LLM-Pruner adopts structural pruning, removing non-critical coupled structures based on gradient information to preserve most of the LLM's functionality.The pruned models can be efficiently recovered through tuning techniques in a short time and with minimal data.Experimental results on three LLMs, Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), Vicuna, and General Language Model (ChatGLM), demonstrate that the compressed models perform well in zero-shot classification and generation tasks.\n...\nExperimental results on three LLMs, Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), Vicuna, and General Language Model (ChatGLM), demonstrate that the compressed models perform well in zero-shot classification and generation tasks.\n\nMcCarley et al. [30] investigate the utilization of structured pruning in a Bidirectional Encoder Representations 89422 VOLUME 12, 2024 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE.Restrictions apply.\n\nfrom Transformers (BERT)-based Question Answering (QA) model.The primary objective is to reduce the model's size by removing redundant parameters while preserving its QA performance.They present a novel approach to optimize the computational efficiency of BERT-based question-answering models through structured pruning.BERT is a popular transformer-based approach for applications involving natural language processing.Deploying it on devices with limited resources or in situations where real-time inference is necessary, however, is difficult due to its vast size and computing requirements.The proposed method focuses on identifying and removing redundant parameters in BERT by leveraging the structured sparsity pattern present in the model's attention heads.By pruning attention heads that contribute minimally to the model's performance, significant model size reduction is achieved without sacrificing accuracy.When compared to the original BERT model, the suggested technique gains considerable pruning ratios while keeping comparable performance, which is demonstrated by testing on benchmarks for answering questions.This work contributes to the development of more efficient and deployable BERT-based question-answering systems.\n\nYang et al. [31] address the computational resource limitations associated with pre-trained language models used in NLP by introducing TextPruner which is a dedicated open-source toolkit developed to facilitate model pruning, aiming to enable efficient and straightforward compression of models.It provides structured post-training pruning techniques, such as vocabulary pruning and transformer pruning, for streamlined implementation.These methods enable the reduction of the model size without the need for retraining, thus making the pruning process more efficient.The toolkit is flexible and may be used for a variety of applications including pre-trained language models and NLP tasks.\n...\nThe toolkit is flexible and may be used for a variety of applications including pre-trained language models and NLP tasks.In addition to structured pruning, the authors propose a self-supervised pruning technique that does not need any kind of labeled data.This method allows for further reduction of the model size by removing unnecessary parameters without compromising performance.For the effective evaluation of TextPruner, the authors conduct experiments on several NLP tasks.The results demonstrate that TextPruner effectively reduces the model size without retraining, thus addressing the computational resource limitations.The toolkit proves to be valuable in enabling the wider application of pre-trained language models by making them more resource-efficient.\n\nIn their paper Wang et al. [32] explore the need for large language models and proposes a structured pruning approach to reduce their size without sacrificing performance.As language models have become larger, their resource requirements and latency have also increased, leading to higher costs.The authors address this issue by investigating model compression techniques.Their purposed method focuses on structured pruning, which entails parameterizing each weight matrix with a low-rank factorization and deleting rank-1 components selectively during training.By doing so, the authors achieve significant compression levels while outperforming unstructured and block-structured pruning techniques in language modeling tasks.Moreover, their approach offers notable speed improvements during both training and inference stages.The paper also highlights the applicability of their method to other aspects of large language models.They demonstrate its effectiveness in pruning adaptive word embeddings, which are crucial for language understanding.Furthermore, they apply their structured pruning approach to the BERT model and evaluate its performance on various downstream fine-tuning classification benchmarks.\n\n## 2) CHANNEL PRUNING\nChannel pruning in natural language processing (NLP) refers to a method for reducing the computational complexity and memory requirements of neural models by eliminating excess or redundant channels.In many tasks of NLP, like text classification or sentiment analysis, neural networks often employ convolutional layers to extract meaningful features from textual data.These convolutional layers consist of multiple channels, each responsible for detecting specific patterns or linguistic features.However, not all channels contribute equally to the network's performance, and some may even be redundant.Channel pruning aims to identify and remove these redundant channels, thereby reducing the model's overall complexity without significantly sacrificing accuracy.Channel pruning extends the idea of filter pruning to the entire channels of convolutional layers.A channel in a convolutional layer refers to the output of a single filter applied to the entire input.Instead of pruning individual filters, channel pruning prunes entire sets of filters (channels) from the network, leading to a more significant reduction in computational cost.In NLP models, channel pruning involves removing entire sets of learned features.The process of channel pruning is shown in Fig. 4.\n\nThe process typically involves evaluating the importance or contribution of each channel through methods like magnitude-based pruning or sensitivity analysis.Pruned models can generate significant computational reductions, making them more effective for use in large-scale NLP applications or on devices with limited resources.\n\nYu and Wu [37] introduces Unified Pruning Framework for Vision Transformers (UP-ViTs), a unified pruning framework for vision transformers, to address issues like large model sizes, memory consumption, and computational costs.Existing vision transformer pruning methods involve token sampling, which hampers generalization and is challenging to apply to NLP tasks.UP-ViTs prunes channels in a unified manner, covering all transformer components.It evaluates the importance scores of each filter in a pre-trained ViT and removes redundant channels based on compression goals.The approach maintains token representation consistency, ensuring generalization to downstream tasks.UP-ViTs outperform previous ViTs with higher throughput and can be extended to transformers in NLP tasks, showing improvements on language modeling benchmarks.\n\n## 3) LAYER PRUNING\nThe pruning process involves removing the least informative layers, which helps streamline the network and improve its efficiency.To evaluate the effectiveness of their approach, the authors ran trials on a variety of benchmark datasets, comparing the performance of their pruned models to that of the original complete models.\n\nThe results of their experiments demonstrated that their layer-wise model pruning technique effectively reduces the computational complexity and memory requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy levels.When compared to the original models, the pruned models achieved considerable reductions in the number of parameters and FLOPs, with no appreciable deterioration in performance.Moreover, the authors explored the impact of different pruning ratios on the performance of the pruned models.They observed that even with aggressive pruning ratios, the pruned models maintained relatively high accuracy levels, indicating the usefulness of the proposed approach in achieving significant compression while preserving performance.The experiments involve WMT14 En-Fr and WMT14 En-DE datasets and include extra-large, large, base, and tiny models.The models are trained on 16 V100 graphics processing units (GPUs) with 32G memories, using Adam optimizer with specific parameters.Beam search is employed for evaluation, and BLEU scores, FLOPs, and practical speedup are reported for single models without ensembling.The results demonstrate that mutual information-based layer-wise model pruning outperforms these strategies in terms of attaining larger pruning ratios with equivalent or superior accuracy.\n\nPeer et al. [42] introduce a method called Greedy-layer pruning for shrinking transformer models in NLP tasks.The authors aim to achieve a customizable tradeoff between performance and speed without the need for additional pre-training phases, unlike knowledge distillation methods.Greedy-layer pruning operates through iterative layer pruning using a greedy approach.The algorithm dynamically adjusts the model size for specific downstream tasks, allowing precise customization without sacrificing performance.The method focuses on reducing computational costs while maintaining high performance.Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of Greedy-layer pruning.For BERT and RoBERTa models, the approach achieves 95.3% and 95.4% performance retention, respectively, while pruning 50% of the layers.\n\n## B. UNSTRUCTURED PRUNING\nUnstructured pruning is a NLP approach used to minimise the size and complexity of neural networks used for language modelling, text classification, machine translation, and other NLP applications.This pruning technique involves selectively removing individual weights or parameters from the network, typically based on their magnitudes or importance scores.By eliminating redundant or less significant parameters, unstructured pruning aims to achieve model compression, improved efficiency, and reduced computational requirements without significantly sacrificing performance.The process of unstructured pruning involves two main steps: identification and removal.In the identification step, each weight or parameter in the network is evaluated based on a predefined criterion, such as magnitude or sensitivity analysis.Magnitude-based pruning, for example, ranks the weights according to their absolute values, allowing the removal of those with the smallest magnitudes.Depending on the pruning approach, this rating can be done globally or layer-by-layer.Once the weights or parameters are ranked, the removal step involves discarding a certain percentage of the least important ones.This removal can be performed by setting the corresponding weights to zero or by completely eliminating the associated connections.In some cases, a threshold is applied to determine the cutoff point for pruning, allowing finer control over the sparsity level of the pruned model.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of unstructured pruning is its flexibility in targeting specific weights or parameters, making it suitable for reducing the model size while preserving important network structures.However, this flexibility comes at the cost of irregular sparsity patterns, as individual weights are pruned independently.Consequently, unstructured pruning can lead to inefficient memory access and inefficient deployment on hardware accelerators optimized for dense matrix operations.To address these issues, additional techniques such as structured pruning and weight sharing can be applied in conjunction with unstructured pruning [7], [30], [50], [51], [52], [53].\n\nIn the context of NLP, unstructured pruning can be applied to various components of neural network models, including word embeddings, recurrent connections, and fully connected layers.\n\n## B. HYBRID PRUNING TECHNIQUES\nHybrid pruning techniques expand beyond a single pruning strategy.They use several pruning techniques and may merge them with additional compression approaches such as quantization or knowledge distillation.This multi-pronged approach intends to achieve greater levels of model compression (lowering size and computing cost) while limiting performance loss in NLP tasks.\n\nHybrid pruning can drastically reduce model size and computational cost, making NLP models more suitable for use on resource-constrained devices like smartphones.Hybrid pruning can improve NLP task processing speed by lowering model size and perhaps performing lower precision computations (quantization).Combining various pruning strategies may raise the risk of performance degradation.Careful examination and fine-tuning are essential to achieve the best combination of compression and accuracy.Following are the examples of hybrid pruning techniques employed for NLP:\n\n1) Structured Pruning and Magnitude-based Pruning This approach might first remove whole filters or channels based on their low significance (structured pruning).The remaining network might then be pruned to remove individual weights with very low magnitudes.This combination takes advantage of the benefits of both methods: structured pruning for coarsegrained reduction [70] and magnitude-based pruning for finer-grained optimization [71].Guo and Li [72] introduces a hybrid pruning technique that combines coarse-and fine-grained strategies to balance accuracy and computational efficiency in neural networks.Initially, coarse-grained pruning recognizes channels for removal while maintaining an acceptable accuracy decrease, followed by fine-grained pruning, which deletes weights below predicted thresholds, lowering network size and computational load.This hybrid technique outperforms single pruning strategies in models like as AlexNet and ResNet, reducing FLOPs by 60% and parameter count by almost 80% on the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n\n## C. TRANSFERABILITY OF PRUNED MODELS\nThere are various pre-trained models available in the literature that have been fine-tuned for NLP related tasks.Some of them are discussed below:\n\n1) BERT for Named Entity Recognition (NER) Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models, which were previously trained for tasks like as language modeling and sentence classification, have been pruned and fine-tuned for NER tasks [76].They have obtained competitive performance in identifying named items such as person names, organization names, and places by removing specific layers or parameters and fine-tuning the model using NER datasets.2) GPT for Text Summarization Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) models, which are recognized for producing coherent text, have been pruned and fine-tuned for text summarization tasks [77].They developed efficient models capable of producing short summaries of larger texts by deleting extraneous parameters and fine-tuning summarization datasets.approach, which compresses neural networks using pruning, quantization, and Huffman coding.They showed that compressed models might achieve similar or even higher accuracy than original models on a variety of image classification tasks while being much smaller and more computationally efficient [4].3) Pruning decreases the size of the model, resulting in greater computing efficiency.This efficiency may result in speedier training and inference durations, allowing the model to generalize more successfully across diverse datasets or tasks [6].The negative impacts of pruning are enumerated below: 1) Loss of Information: Pruning can remove connections or parameters that are significant for the model's performance on unseen data.If pruning is too aggressive or not done appropriately, it might result in the loss of critical information and diminished generalization [81].2) Certain pruning approaches may produce models that are sensitive to initial parameter values or pruning thresholds.This sensitivity might make it difficult to attain consistent performance across different runs or datasets, reducing the model's resilience [82].\n\n3) The effect of pruning on resilience and generalization varies depending on the task and dataset.",

            "abstract": "Large language models have driven significant progress in natural language processing, but their deployment requires substantial compute and memory resources. As models scale, compression techniques become essential for balancing model quality with computational efficiency. Structured pruning, which removes less critical components of the model, is a promising strategy for reducing complexity. However, one-shot pruning often results in significant quality degradation, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To recover lost quality, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly applied, but it can lead to catastrophic forgetting by shifting the model's learned data distribution. Therefore, addressing the degradation from both pruning and SFT is essential to preserve the original model's quality. In this work, we utilize self-data distilled fine-tuning to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the original, unpruned model to generate a distilled dataset that preserves semantic richness and mitigates catastrophic forgetting by maintaining alignment with the base model's knowledge. Empirically, we demonstrate that self-data distillation consistently outperforms standard SFT, improving average accuracy by up to 8% on the HuggingFace OpenLLM Leaderboard v1. Specifically, when pruning six decoder blocks on Llama3.1-8B Instruct (i.e., 32 to 26 layers, reducing the model size from 8.03B to 6.72B parameters), our method retains 91.2% of the original model's accuracy compared to 81.7% with SFT, while reducing real-world FLOPs by 16.3%. Furthermore, combining self-data distilled models through model merging yields enhanced quality retention. Additionally, leveraging these pruned models in speculative decoding increases token acceptance rates, thereby improving inference efficiency in applied settings.",

                    "text": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2024), Gemini (Gemini et al., 2024), and Llama 3 (Dubey et al., 2024) has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), driving significant advancements across various tasks through extensive pre-training on textual data. These models, enhanced by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrate impressive instruction-following abilities (Ouyang et al., 2022;Touvron et al., 2023a), but come with high compute costs for both training and inference (Kaplan et al., 2020;Hoffmann et al., 2022). To address diverse deployment requirements across varying model scales, sizes, and compute budgets, compressing models for efficient inference is essential, particularly given the significant time, data, and resource constraints associated with training multiple multi-billion parameter models from scratch. \n\nMost model compression techniques can be grouped into four main categories: knowledge distillation (KD) (Hinton et al., 2015), factorization (Hu et al., 2022), pruning (Le-Cun et al., 1989), and quantization (Han et al., 2015). In our work, we focus on pruning, though we aim for our method to inspire further developments across these other compression methods. Structured pruning, which selectively removes less critical components of a neural network, has emerged as a promising method for improving LLM efficiency (Ma et al., 2023). This method has gained attention for its ability to reduce memory and compute requirements, making inference more efficient. Recent works have shown that LLMs exhibit significant redundancy, particularly in the middle layers, where removing these layers has a minimal impact on overall model quality (Men et al., 2024;Gromov et al., 2024). The residual stream of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) architecture is only slightly modified by the output of non-essential layers, enabling the removal of these layers without drastically harming model quality. \n\nDespite its potential advantages, depth-wise structured pruning presents inherent challenges.",

As models scale, compression techniques become essential for balancing model quality with computational efficiency. Structured pruning, which removes less critical components of the model, is a promising strategy for reducing complexity. However, one-shot pruning often results in significant quality degradation, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To recover lost quality, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly applied, but it can lead to catastrophic forgetting by shifting the model's learned data distribution. Therefore, addressing the degradation from both pruning and SFT is essential to preserve the original model's quality. In this work, we utilize self-data distilled fine-tuning to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the original, unpruned model to generate a distilled dataset that preserves semantic richness and mitigates catastrophic forgetting by maintaining alignment with the base model's knowledge. Empirically, we demonstrate that self-data distillation consistently outperforms standard SFT, improving average accuracy by up to 8% on the HuggingFace OpenLLM Leaderboard v1. Specifically, when pruning six decoder blocks on Llama3.1-8B Instruct (i.e., 32 to 26 layers, reducing the model size from 8.03B to 6.72B parameters), our method retains 91.2% of the original model's accuracy compared to 81.7% with SFT, while reducing real-world FLOPs by 16.3%. Furthermore, combining self-data distilled models through model merging yields enhanced quality retention. Additionally, leveraging these pruned models in speculative decoding increases token acceptance rates, thereby improving inference efficiency in applied settings.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2024), Gemini (Gemini et al., 2024), and Llama 3 (Dubey et al., 2024) has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), driving significant advancements across various tasks through extensive pre-training on textual data. These models, enhanced by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrate impressive instruction-following abilities (Ouyang et al., 2022;Touvron et al., 2023a), but come with high compute costs for both training and inference (Kaplan et al., 2020;Hoffmann et al., 2022). To address diverse deployment requirements across varying model scales, sizes, and compute budgets, compressing models for efficient inference is essential, particularly given the significant time, data, and resource constraints associated with training multiple multi-billion parameter models from scratch. \n\nMost model compression techniques can be grouped into four main categories: knowledge distillation (KD) (Hinton et al., 2015), factorization (Hu et al., 2022), pruning (Le-Cun et al., 1989), and quantization (Han et al., 2015). In our work, we focus on pruning, though we aim for our method to inspire further developments across these other compression methods. Structured pruning, which selectively removes less critical components of a neural network, has emerged as a promising method for improving LLM efficiency (Ma et al., 2023). This method has gained attention for its ability to reduce memory and compute requirements, making inference more efficient. Recent works have shown that LLMs exhibit significant redundancy, particularly in the middle layers, where removing these layers has a minimal impact on overall model quality (Men et al., 2024;Gromov et al., 2024). The residual stream of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) architecture is only slightly modified by the output of non-essential layers, enabling the removal of these layers without drastically harming model quality. \n\nDespite its potential advantages, depth-wise structured pruning presents inherent challenges.",

In this paper, we propose CliqueParcel, a method designed to improve the efficiency of LLMs via prompt batching. Existing strategies to optimize inference efficiency often compromise on output quality, leading to a discounted output problem. This issue might result in reduced accuracy or outputs that are less detailed. CliqueParcel is our answer to this challenge. While ensuring accuracy and minimizing deviations from the original outputs (i.e., faithfulness), our method significantly improves efficiency during inference. To lay the groundwork, we first redefine efficiency measurements by excluding the reduction in running time due to shorter lengths. Then, we provide a comprehensive trade-off between efficiency and faithfulness to clarify the nature of the 'discounted output' problem. Within the CliqueParcel framework, we suggest multiple batching sub-methods and discuss the specific scenarios in which they can be applied. During evaluation, CliqueParcel is tested on eight widely recognized datasets, which can be classified into three types: reading comprehension, open-source question-answering, and reasoning. Our experiments explore the performance of CliqueParcel, including efficiency, faithfulness, and the trade-off between them. This work provides novel insights into inference efficiency and demonstrates promising performance.",

                    "text": "There exist numerous methodologies aiming at enhancing the eciency of large language models post-training. Current literature in this domain can be broadly categorized into two main areas: model compression and prompt compression. Within the realm of model compression, three prominent techniques have garnered signi cant attention: quantization, distillation, and pruning. Quantization is a widely employed approach in the compression of post-training large language models [9,40,42]. By reducing the bit precision, quantization methods necessitate lower memory utilization, thus facilitating faster computations and, consequently, higher e ciency. Distillation methods distill the knowledge from larger models and embed it into smaller models to approach model compression [5,15,17]. Another noteworthy method for model compression is pruning [21,26]. Pruning achieves reduced complexity by eliminating relatively less impactful model components, e ectively reducing the model's size. On the other hand, prompt-based techniques contribute to eciency enhancement by modifying the prompts used in interactions with large language models [6,38,41]. These approaches seek to optimize the prompts to yield improved results in terms of e ciency. Xu et al. attach a prompt to get less accurate outputs, which helps in nding the e ciency-accuracy trade-o [38]. Yin et al. focus on nding the task de nition to shorten prompts [41]. Cheng et al. use a batching method to improve e ciency. However, all those prompt-based techniques has a common problem: they improve their e ciency mainly due to an incompleteness of the outputs.",

However, during the inference process, LLMs still require substantial resources. In this paper, we propose CliqueParcel, a method designed to improve the efficiency of LLMs via prompt batching. Existing strategies to optimize inference efficiency often compromise on output quality, leading to a discounted output problem. This issue might result in reduced accuracy or outputs that are less detailed. CliqueParcel is our answer to this challenge. While ensuring accuracy and minimizing deviations from the original outputs (i.e., faithfulness), our method significantly improves efficiency during inference. To lay the groundwork, we first redefine efficiency measurements by excluding the reduction in running time due to shorter lengths. Then, we provide a comprehensive trade-off between efficiency and faithfulness to clarify the nature of the 'discounted output' problem. Within the CliqueParcel framework, we suggest multiple batching sub-methods and discuss the specific scenarios in which they can be applied. During evaluation, CliqueParcel is tested on eight widely recognized datasets, which can be classified into three types: reading comprehension, open-source question-answering, and reasoning. Our experiments explore the performance of CliqueParcel, including efficiency, faithfulness, and the trade-off between them. This work provides novel insights into inference efficiency and demonstrates promising performance.\n## E ciency of post-training large language models\nThere exist numerous methodologies aiming at enhancing the eciency of large language models post-training. Current literature in this domain can be broadly categorized into two main areas: model compression and prompt compression. Within the realm of model compression, three prominent techniques have garnered signi cant attention: quantization, distillation, and pruning. Quantization is a widely employed approach in the compression of post-training large language models [9,40,42]. By reducing the bit precision, quantization methods necessitate lower memory utilization, thus facilitating faster computations and, consequently, higher e ciency. Distillation methods distill the knowledge from larger models and embed it into smaller models to approach model compression [5,15,17]. Another noteworthy method for model compression is pruning [21,26]. Pruning achieves reduced complexity by eliminating relatively less impactful model components, e ectively reducing the model's size. On the other hand, prompt-based techniques contribute to eciency enhancement by modifying the prompts used in interactions with large language models [6,38,41]. These approaches seek to optimize the prompts to yield improved results in terms of e ciency. Xu et al. attach a prompt to get less accurate outputs, which helps in nding the e ciency-accuracy trade-o [38]. Yin et al. focus on nding the task de nition to shorten prompts [41]. Cheng et al. use a batching method to improve e ciency. However, all those prompt-based techniques has a common problem: they improve their e ciency mainly due to an incompleteness of the outputs.",

However, it is difficult to deploy them for real-world applications where computation and memory resources are limited. Reducing the pre-trained model size and speeding up the inference have become a critical issue.\n\nPruning is a common technique for model compression. It identifies and removes redundant or less important neurons from the networks. From the view of the model structure, pruning methods can be categorized into unstructured pruning and structured pruning. In the unstructured pruning, each model parameter is individually removed if it reaches some criteria based on the magnitude or importance score (Han et al., 2015;Zhu and Gupta, 2018;. The unstructured pruning results in sparse matrices and allows for significant model compression, but the inference speed can hardly be improved without specialized devices. While in the structured pruning, rows or columns of the parameters are removed from the weight matrices (McCarley, 2019;Michel et al., 2019;Voita et al., 2019;Lagunas et al., 2021;Hou et al., 2020). Thus, the resulting model speeds up on the common CPU and GPU devices.\n\nPruning methods can also be classified into optimization-free methods (Michel et al., 2019) and the ones that involve optimization (Frankle and Carbin, 2019;Lagunas et al., 2021). The latter usually achieves higher performance, but the former runs faster and is more convenient to use.\n\nPruning PLMs has been of growing interest. Most of the works focus on reducing transformer size while ignoring the vocabulary (Abdaoui et al., 2020). Pruning vocabulary can greatly reduce the model size for multilingual PLMs.\n\nIn this paper, we present TextPruner, a model pruning toolkit for PLMs. It combines both transformer pruning and vocabulary pruning. The purpose of TextPruner is to offer a universal, fast, and easy-to-use tool for model compression. We expect it can be accessible to users with little model training experience. Therefore, we implement the structured optimization-free",

In this paper, we introduce TextPruner, an open-source model pruning toolkit designed for pre-trained language models, targeting fast and easy model compression. TextPruner offers structured post-training pruning methods, including vocabulary pruning and transformer pruning, and can be applied to various models and tasks. We also propose a self-supervised pruning method that can be applied without the labeled data. Our experiments with several NLP tasks demonstrate the ability of TextPruner to reduce the model size without re-training the model.\n## Introduction\nLarge pre-trained language models (PLMs) (Devlin et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2019) have achieved great success in a variety of NLP tasks. However, it is difficult to deploy them for real-world applications where computation and memory resources are limited. Reducing the pre-trained model size and speeding up the inference have become a critical issue.\n\nPruning is a common technique for model compression. It identifies and removes redundant or less important neurons from the networks. From the view of the model structure, pruning methods can be categorized into unstructured pruning and structured pruning. In the unstructured pruning, each model parameter is individually removed if it reaches some criteria based on the magnitude or importance score (Han et al., 2015;Zhu and Gupta, 2018;. The unstructured pruning results in sparse matrices and allows for significant model compression, but the inference speed can hardly be improved without specialized devices. While in the structured pruning, rows or columns of the parameters are removed from the weight matrices (McCarley, 2019;Michel et al., 2019;Voita et al., 2019;Lagunas et al., 2021;Hou et al., 2020). Thus, the resulting model speeds up on the common CPU and GPU devices.\n\nPruning methods can also be classified into optimization-free methods (Michel et al., 2019) and the ones that involve optimization (Frankle and Carbin, 2019;Lagunas et al., 2021). The latter usually achieves higher performance, but the former runs faster and is more convenient to use.\n\nPruning PLMs has been of growing interest. Most of the works focus on reducing transformer size while ignoring the vocabulary (Abdaoui et al., 2020). Pruning vocabulary can greatly reduce the model size for multilingual PLMs.\n\nIn this paper, we present TextPruner, a model pruning toolkit for PLMs. It combines both transformer pruning and vocabulary pruning. The purpose of TextPruner is to offer a universal, fast, and easy-to-use tool for model compression. We expect it can be accessible to users with little model training experience. Therefore, we implement the structured optimization-free",

            "abstract": "Deploying pre-trained transformer models like BERT on downstream tasks in resource-constrained scenarios is challenging due to their high inference cost, which grows rapidly with input sequence length. In this work, we propose a constraint-aware and ranking-distilled token pruning method ToP, which selectively removes unnecessary tokens as input sequence passes through layers, allowing the model to improve online inference speed while preserving accuracy. ToP overcomes the limitation of inaccurate token importance ranking in the conventional self-attention mechanism through a ranking-distilled token distillation technique, which distills effective token rankings from the final layer of unpruned models to early layers of pruned models. Then, ToP introduces a coarse-to-fine pruning approach that automatically selects the optimal subset of transformer layers and optimizes token pruning decisions within these layers through improved L0 regularization. Extensive experiments on GLUE benchmark and SQuAD tasks demonstrate that ToP outperforms state-of-the-art token pruning and model compression methods with improved accuracy and speedups. ToP reduces the average FLOPs of BERT by 8.1X while achieving competitive accuracy on GLUE, and provides a real latency speedup of up to 7.4X on an Intel CPU.

However, the superior performance comes at the cost of increasingly larger model sizes and computation overhead, making it difficult to efficiently deploy them on different downstream tasks in various latency-critical scenarios such as online servers and edge devices. \n\nAccelerating transformer inference is often achieved through model compression methods such as pruning [19,30], quantization [4,17,31], and knowledge distillation [15,29]. These techniques aim to reduce the size of the model, with quantization and distillation resulting in a smaller, fixed model. Structured pruning, which eliminates redundant heads or dimensions, can effectively meet deployment requirements [40,44]. However, structured pruning may not guarantee optimal accuracy, particularly for small transformers or long input sequences, as the attention mechanism has a  ( 2 ) computation complexity with input token length . This means a significant portion of the model must be pruned to meet tight deployment constraints, potentially compromising accuracy. \n\nRecently, a promising subfield in NLP has emerged that focuses on reducing latency during model inference by pruning input tokens. It's based on the intuition that not all tokens in the input sequence are critical for making a final prediction. As tokens pass through the encoder layers, some tokens have been captured by other tokens via attention in the early layer and do not require future modeling in a higher layer [9,28]. Pruning these uninformative tokens within each layer can increase the model's inference speed without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, the removal of these tokens in each layer will also reduce the computation and memory requirements in its subsequent layers, resulting in linear or even quadratic reductions and providing greater compression benefits. \n\nSome prior works [9,10,16,18,42] have examined the potential of layer-wise token pruning of input sequences. However, these approaches face several limitations. First, they treat all layers equally, leading to a vast design space, as pruning decisions must be made for each token at every layer through the use of token-level masks.",

In this work, we propose a constraint-aware and ranking-distilled token pruning method ToP, which selectively removes unnecessary tokens as input sequence passes through layers, allowing the model to improve online inference speed while preserving accuracy. ToP overcomes the limitation of inaccurate token importance ranking in the conventional self-attention mechanism through a ranking-distilled token distillation technique, which distills effective token rankings from the final layer of unpruned models to early layers of pruned models. Then, ToP introduces a coarse-to-fine pruning approach that automatically selects the optimal subset of transformer layers and optimizes token pruning decisions within these layers through improved L0 regularization. Extensive experiments on GLUE benchmark and SQuAD tasks demonstrate that ToP outperforms state-of-the-art token pruning and model compression methods with improved accuracy and speedups. ToP reduces the average FLOPs of BERT by 8.1X while achieving competitive accuracy on GLUE, and provides a real latency speedup of up to 7.4X on an Intel CPU.

However, the superior performance comes at the cost of increasingly larger model sizes and computation overhead, making it difficult to efficiently deploy them on different downstream tasks in various latency-critical scenarios such as online servers and edge devices. \n\nAccelerating transformer inference is often achieved through model compression methods such as pruning [19,30], quantization [4,17,31], and knowledge distillation [15,29]. These techniques aim to reduce the size of the model, with quantization and distillation resulting in a smaller, fixed model. Structured pruning, which eliminates redundant heads or dimensions, can effectively meet deployment requirements [40,44]. However, structured pruning may not guarantee optimal accuracy, particularly for small transformers or long input sequences, as the attention mechanism has a  ( 2 ) computation complexity with input token length . This means a significant portion of the model must be pruned to meet tight deployment constraints, potentially compromising accuracy. \n\nRecently, a promising subfield in NLP has emerged that focuses on reducing latency during model inference by pruning input tokens. It's based on the intuition that not all tokens in the input sequence are critical for making a final prediction. As tokens pass through the encoder layers, some tokens have been captured by other tokens via attention in the early layer and do not require future modeling in a higher layer [9,28]. Pruning these uninformative tokens within each layer can increase the model's inference speed without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, the removal of these tokens in each layer will also reduce the computation and memory requirements in its subsequent layers, resulting in linear or even quadratic reductions and providing greater compression benefits. \n\nSome prior works [9,10,16,18,42] have examined the potential of layer-wise token pruning of input sequences. However, these approaches face several limitations. First, they treat all layers equally, leading to a vast design space, as pruning decisions must be made for each token at every layer through the use of token-level masks.\n\n## RELATED WORKS 2.1 Model Compression\nTo reduce the inference cost of pre-trained transformer models, a variety of compression techniques have been proposed, including weight pruning [8,19,30], quantization [4,17,31] and distillation [15,29]. Token-level pruning has been shown to complement knowledge distillation and quantization [18]. Here, we focus on pruning and distillation and briefly discuss the related work. \n\nWeight pruning is categorized into 1) unstructured and 2) structured pruning. Unstructured methods [8,30] achieve high sparsity without accuracy drop but offer minimal latency benefits due to irregular sparse patterns. In contrast, structured pruning removes coherent weight groups, reducing latency without special hardware support.

However, their considerable size incurs significant computational and storage costs. Modern pruning strategies employ one-shot techniques to compress PLMs without the need for retraining on task-specific or otherwise general data; however, these approaches often lead to an indispensable reduction in performance. In this paper, we propose SDS, a Sparse-Dense-Sparse pruning framework to enhance the performance of the pruned PLMs from a weight distribution optimization perspective. We outline the pruning process in three steps. Initially, we prune less critical connections in the model using conventional one-shot pruning methods. Next, we reconstruct a dense model featuring a pruning-friendly weight distribution by reactivating pruned connections with sparse regularization. Finally, we perform a second pruning round, yielding a superior pruned model compared to the initial pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that SDS outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning techniques SparseGPT and Wanda under an identical sparsity configuration. For instance, SDS reduces perplexity by 9.13 on Raw-Wikitext2 and improves accuracy by an average of 2.05% across multiple zero-shot benchmarks for OPT-125M with 2:4 sparsity.",

Table 7 indicates that the pruned models can achieve 1.19x \u223c 1.87x speedup compared to their dense counterparts. This significant boost in inference speed underscores the critical importance of model pruning in practical applications. Pruning for Language Model Compression. The surging complexity of Transformer-based language models, which now feature hundreds of billions of parameters, has accentuated the urgent need for effective and efficient model pruning methods [6,8,9]. These pruning methods can be broadly classified into structured and unstructured approaches. Structured pruning is more hardware-friendly, as it directly prunes entire segments of weights, thereby removing consecutive computations [17,14]. Unstructured pruning (sparsification) is also receiving interest, particularly as hardware advancements increasingly support the acceleration of sparse patterns such as 2:4 or 4:8 sparse [20]. Techniques such as SparseGPT [3] extend the OBS [9] methodology to column-wise prune weights, allowing the modification of values in the unpruned columns to compensate for the pruning errors.

Barsoum\n## Abstract\nPre-trained language models (PLMs) are engineered to be robust in contextual understanding and exhibit outstanding performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, their considerable size incurs significant computational and storage costs. Modern pruning strategies employ one-shot techniques to compress PLMs without the need for retraining on task-specific or otherwise general data; however, these approaches often lead to an indispensable reduction in performance. In this paper, we propose SDS, a Sparse-Dense-Sparse pruning framework to enhance the performance of the pruned PLMs from a weight distribution optimization perspective. We outline the pruning process in three steps. Initially, we prune less critical connections in the model using conventional one-shot pruning methods. Next, we reconstruct a dense model featuring a pruning-friendly weight distribution by reactivating pruned connections with sparse regularization. Finally, we perform a second pruning round, yielding a superior pruned model compared to the initial pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that SDS outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning techniques SparseGPT and Wanda under an identical sparsity configuration. For instance, SDS reduces perplexity by 9.13 on Raw-Wikitext2 and improves accuracy by an average of 2.05% across multiple zero-shot benchmarks for OPT-125M with 2:4 sparsity.\n## Efficiency Analysis\nTo illustrate the enhanced efficiency of pruned models, we present the inference speed of dense and sparse models on AMD CPU. We use the DeepSparse library [12] and apply 50% unstructured pruning on OPTs and LLaMAs in this experiment. Table 7 indicates that the pruned models can achieve 1.19x \u223c 1.87x speedup compared to their dense counterparts. This significant boost in inference speed underscores the critical importance of model pruning in practical applications. Pruning for Language Model Compression. The surging complexity of Transformer-based language models, which now feature hundreds of billions of parameters, has accentuated the urgent need for effective and efficient model pruning methods [6,8,9]. These pruning methods can be broadly classified into structured and unstructured approaches. Structured pruning is more hardware-friendly, as it directly prunes entire segments of weights, thereby removing consecutive computations [17,14]. Unstructured pruning (sparsification) is also receiving interest, particularly as hardware advancements increasingly support the acceleration of sparse patterns such as 2:4 or 4:8 sparse [20]. Techniques such as SparseGPT [3] extend the OBS [9] methodology to column-wise prune weights, allowing the modification of values in the unpruned columns to compensate for the pruning errors. Aaquib et al. [28] enhance SparseGPT by incorporating minimal iterative task fine-tuning during the pruning process, demonstrating performance improvements at high sparsity levels. Wanda [27] introduces a simple yet effective no-retraining-needed pruning strategy that prunes weights based on their magnitudes and corresponding activations. OWL [39] considers the inhomogeneous distribution of interlayer outliers and further extends Wanda to a non-uniform sparsity distribution, achieving better performance. DS\u2205T [42] and SPP [16], as fine-tuning methods designed for sparse models, can improve the performance of pruned PLMs within limited complexity. \n\nWeight Distribution Optimization.

In this paper, we propose a model accelaration approaches for large language models that incorporates dynamic token downsampling and static pruning, optimized by the information bottleneck loss.

                    "text": "Large language models based on Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) architectures, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2020) , and GPT models (Radford et al., Brown et al., 2020), have gained prominence in recent years for their remarkable state-of-the-art performance in various tasks related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). These works rely on deep networks with millions or even billions of parameters, and the availability of high computation and large storage capability plays a key role in their success. In this regard, there has been a proliferation of studies aimed at improving the efficiency of large language models, including knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015, Sanh et al., 2019, Jiao et al., 2020), quantization (Shen et al., 2020), low-rank factorization (Ben Noach and Goldberg, 2020), weight sharing (Lan et al., 2020), and weight pruning (Sanh et al., 2020, Xia et al., 2022) and dynamic accelerating (Xin et al., 2020, Goyal et al., 2020). \n\nPruning has emerged as a promising approach to compress and accelerate DNN models, significantly reducing storage and computational costs. Structured pruning method delivers a static compact model by removing structured blocks of weights, e.g. heads (Voita et al., 2019, Michel et al., 2019) and encoder layers (Fan et al., 2020). However, removing a large proportion of parameters may result in noticeable accuracy loss. To address this, the distillation paradigm is commonly adopted for recovery training, where the pruned model learns the knowledge delivered from the unpruned model. (Sanh et al., 2020) While these pruning methods achieve compelling results, they are static and have a fixed computation route for all inputs, regardless of the differing information redundancy of various sequences. \n\nAnother pruning approach that we consider in this paper is token pruning, a dynamic pruning method that reduces computation by progressively dropping unimportant tokens in the sequence, allocating adaptive computational budget to different samples.",

However, their excessive overhead leads to large latency and computational costs. The statically compression methods allocate fixed computation to different samples, resulting in redundant computation. The dynamic token pruning method selectively shortens the sequences but are unable to change the model size and hardly achieve the speedups as static pruning. In this paper, we propose a model accelaration approaches for large language models that incorporates dynamic token downsampling and static pruning, optimized by the information bottleneck loss. Our model, Infor-Coef, achieves an 18x FLOPs speedup with an accuracy degradation of less than 8\\% compared to BERT. This work provides a promising approach to compress and accelerate transformer-based models for NLP tasks.\n## Introduction\nLarge language models based on Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) architectures, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2020) , and GPT models (Radford et al., Brown et al., 2020), have gained prominence in recent years for their remarkable state-of-the-art performance in various tasks related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). These works rely on deep networks with millions or even billions of parameters, and the availability of high computation and large storage capability plays a key role in their success. In this regard, there has been a proliferation of studies aimed at improving the efficiency of large language models, including knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015, Sanh et al., 2019, Jiao et al., 2020), quantization (Shen et al., 2020), low-rank factorization (Ben Noach and Goldberg, 2020), weight sharing (Lan et al., 2020), and weight pruning (Sanh et al., 2020, Xia et al., 2022) and dynamic accelerating (Xin et al., 2020, Goyal et al., 2020). \n\nPruning has emerged as a promising approach to compress and accelerate DNN models, significantly reducing storage and computational costs. Structured pruning method delivers a static compact model by removing structured blocks of weights, e.g. heads (Voita et al., 2019, Michel et al., 2019) and encoder layers (Fan et al., 2020). However, removing a large proportion of parameters may result in noticeable accuracy loss. To address this, the distillation paradigm is commonly adopted for recovery training, where the pruned model learns the knowledge delivered from the unpruned model. (Sanh et al., 2020) While these pruning methods achieve compelling results, they are static and have a fixed computation route for all inputs, regardless of the differing information redundancy of various sequences. \n\nAnother pruning approach that we consider in this paper is token pruning, a dynamic pruning method that reduces computation by progressively dropping unimportant tokens in the sequence, allocating adaptive computational budget to different samples.",

Thus, it can only find the local optimal pruning solution, but not the global optimal solution. Empirical evidence also suggests that certain layers are more critical than others, and uniformly pruning across all layers may lead to the removal of essential parameters, ultimately impairing the pruned model's performance [11; 12].",

            "abstract": "The remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) in various language tasks has attracted considerable attention. However, the ever-increasing size of these models presents growing challenges for deployment and inference. Structured pruning, an effective model compression technique, is gaining increasing attention due to its ability to enhance inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most previous optimization-based structured pruning methods sacrifice the uniform structure across layers for greater flexibility to maintain performance. The heterogeneous structure hinders the effective utilization of off-the-shelf inference acceleration techniques and impedes efficient configuration for continued training. To address this issue, we propose a novel masking learning paradigm based on minimax optimization to obtain the uniform pruned structure by optimizing the masks under sparsity regularization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can maintain high performance while ensuring the uniformity of the pruned model structure, thereby outperforming existing SOTA methods.",

These models exhibit robust capabilities in language understanding and generation, facilitated by extensive pre-training and fine-tuning. However, as the size of these models continues to expand, their computational and storage demands increase sharply, presenting significant challenges for practical applications. Model compression, a vital approach to reducing memory footprint and computational load during model deployment, offers unique benefits across various domains. Techniques such as pruning (Frantar and Figure 1: Compresso/NutePrune results in heterogeneous inter-layer structures, whereas MaskPrune achieves uniform inter-layer structures, which is friendly to inference deployment and continual training. Alistarh, 2023;Ma et al., 2023;Sun et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2023;Xiao et al., 2023;Lin et al., 2024), knowledge distillation (Gu et al., 2024;Agarwal et al., 2023), and low-rank factorization (Yuan et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024) can significantly decrease the number of model parameters and computational complexity, thereby enabling large-scale language models to function efficiently in resource-constrained environments. \n\nThe pruning technique reduces the size and computational complexity of the models by eliminating redundant parameters, which can generally be categorized into unstructured pruning (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2023;Dong et al., 2024), semi-structured pruning (Mishra et al., 2021), and structured pruning (Ma et al., 2023;Xia et al., 2023;An et al., 2023).

However, the ever-increasing size of these models presents growing challenges for deployment and inference. Structured pruning, an effective model compression technique, is gaining increasing attention due to its ability to enhance inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most previous optimization-based structured pruning methods sacrifice the uniform structure across layers for greater flexibility to maintain performance. The heterogeneous structure hinders the effective utilization of off-the-shelf inference acceleration techniques and impedes efficient configuration for continued training. To address this issue, we propose a novel masking learning paradigm based on minimax optimization to obtain the uniform pruned structure by optimizing the masks under sparsity regularization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can maintain high performance while ensuring the uniformity of the pruned model structure, thereby outperforming existing SOTA methods.\n## Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), such as Ope-nAI's GPT series (Achiam et al., 2023) and Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a,b), have made substantial advancements in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). These models exhibit robust capabilities in language understanding and generation, facilitated by extensive pre-training and fine-tuning. However, as the size of these models continues to expand, their computational and storage demands increase sharply, presenting significant challenges for practical applications. Model compression, a vital approach to reducing memory footprint and computational load during model deployment, offers unique benefits across various domains. Techniques such as pruning (Frantar and Figure 1: Compresso/NutePrune results in heterogeneous inter-layer structures, whereas MaskPrune achieves uniform inter-layer structures, which is friendly to inference deployment and continual training. Alistarh, 2023;Ma et al., 2023;Sun et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2023;Xiao et al., 2023;Lin et al., 2024), knowledge distillation (Gu et al., 2024;Agarwal et al., 2023), and low-rank factorization (Yuan et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024) can significantly decrease the number of model parameters and computational complexity, thereby enabling large-scale language models to function efficiently in resource-constrained environments. \n\nThe pruning technique reduces the size and computational complexity of the models by eliminating redundant parameters, which can generally be categorized into unstructured pruning (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2023;Dong et al., 2024), semi-structured pruning (Mishra et al., 2021), and structured pruning (Ma et al., 2023;Xia et al., 2023;An et al., 2023). Unstructured pruning compresses models by removing individual parameters, resulting in sparse weight matrices that consume less memory.",

However, stringent throughput and latency requirements in industrial applications are limiting their adoption. To mitigate the gap, model compression techniques such as structured pruning are being used to improve inference efficiency. However, most existing neural network inference runtimes lack adequate support for structured sparsity. In this paper, we propose an efficient sparse deep learning inference software stack for Transformer-based language models where the weights are pruned with constant block size. Our sparse software accelerator leverages Intel Deep Learning Boost to maximize the performance of sparse matrix - dense matrix multiplication (commonly abbreviated as SpMM) on CPUs. Our SpMM kernel outperforms the existing sparse libraries (oneMKL, TVM, and LIBXSMM) by an order of magnitude on a wide range of GEMM shapes under 5 representative sparsity ratios (70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%). Moreover, our SpMM kernel shows up to 5x speedup over dense GEMM kernel of oneDNN, a well-optimized dense library widely used in industry. We apply our sparse accelerator on widely-used Transformer-based language models including Bert-Mini, DistilBERT, Bert-Base, and BERT-Large. Our sparse inference software shows up to 1.5x speedup over Neural Magic's Deepsparse under same configurations on Xeon on Amazon Web Services under proxy production latency constraints. We also compare our solution with two framework-based inference solutions, ONNX Runtime and PyTorch, and demonstrate up to 37x speedup over ONNX Runtime and 345x over PyTorch on Xeon under the latency constraints.

Structured pruning is gaining popularity to prune the weights with a pre-defined sparsity pattern such as block-wise pruning (Lagunas et al., 2021) and fine-grained 2:4 (Pool & Yu, 2021) or N:M structured sparsity (Zhou et al., 2021). Recent works (Zafrir et al., 2021;Kurtic et al., 2022) proposed pruning Transformer models at pre-training to create sparse pre-trained LMs and fine-tuning on downstream tasks. \n\nQuantization is another widely-used model compression technique that can improve the inference latency (Jacob et al., 2018) (Zafrir et al., 2019) (Bhandare et al., 2019). \n\nThere are two typical quantization approaches: post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT), where PTQ requires an offline calibration process on representative samples to collect the tensor statistics and generate the scale and zero point used for quantization, and QAT requires an additional fine-tuning phase simulating the quantization inference during training. \n\nKnowledge distillation is a popular compression technique (Hinton et al., 2015) (Sanh et al., 2019) (Tang et al., 2019).

Wang, Guy Boudoukh, Moshe Wasserblat\n## Abstract\nIn recent years, Transformer-based language models have become the standard approach for natural language processing tasks. However, stringent throughput and latency requirements in industrial applications are limiting their adoption. To mitigate the gap, model compression techniques such as structured pruning are being used to improve inference efficiency. However, most existing neural network inference runtimes lack adequate support for structured sparsity. In this paper, we propose an efficient sparse deep learning inference software stack for Transformer-based language models where the weights are pruned with constant block size. Our sparse software accelerator leverages Intel Deep Learning Boost to maximize the performance of sparse matrix - dense matrix multiplication (commonly abbreviated as SpMM) on CPUs. Our SpMM kernel outperforms the existing sparse libraries (oneMKL, TVM, and LIBXSMM) by an order of magnitude on a wide range of GEMM shapes under 5 representative sparsity ratios (70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%). Moreover, our SpMM kernel shows up to 5x speedup over dense GEMM kernel of oneDNN, a well-optimized dense library widely used in industry. We apply our sparse accelerator on widely-used Transformer-based language models including Bert-Mini, DistilBERT, Bert-Base, and BERT-Large. Our sparse inference software shows up to 1.5x speedup over Neural Magic's Deepsparse under same configurations on Xeon on Amazon Web Services under proxy production latency constraints. We also compare our solution with two framework-based inference solutions, ONNX Runtime and PyTorch, and demonstrate up to 37x speedup over ONNX Runtime and 345x over PyTorch on Xeon under the latency constraints. All the source code is publicly available on Github: https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers.\n## Model Compression\nTransformer-based LMs have demonstrated SoTA accuracy on a variety range of NLP tasks while the model size is growing rapidly. However, those models are hard to deploy for production due to the limited computation resources and strict latency constraints. There has been a growing interest in the compression of Transformer-based LMs to improve the inference efficiency. \n\nPruning has been proven to be an effective way of reducing model size while maintaining the similar model quality (Le-Cun et al., 1989) (Sanh et al., 2020) (Wang, 2021). Structured pruning is gaining popularity to prune the weights with a pre-defined sparsity pattern such as block-wise pruning (Lagunas et al., 2021) and fine-grained 2:4 (Pool & Yu, 2021) or N:M structured sparsity (Zhou et al., 2021). Recent works (Zafrir et al., 2021;Kurtic et al., 2022) proposed pruning Transformer models at pre-training to create sparse pre-trained LMs and fine-tuning on downstream tasks. \n\nQuantization is another widely-used model compression technique that can improve the inference latency (Jacob et al., 2018) (Zafrir et al., 2019) (Bhandare et al., 2019). \n\nThere are two typical quantization approaches: post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT), where PTQ requires an offline calibration process on representative samples to collect the tensor statistics and generate the scale and zero point used for quantization, and QAT requires an additional fine-tuning phase simulating the quantization inference during training. \n\nKnowledge distillation is a popular compression technique (Hinton et al., 2015) (Sanh et al., 2019) (Tang et al., 2019). It has been used to produce a much smaller BERT model (Jiao et al., 2019) (Sun et al., 2020) while achieving high accuracy.",

Several research works focus on incorporating different sparse attention mechanism into Transformer models, e.g., Longformer (ETC) [4], Extended Transformer Construction (ETC) [2], BigBird [62], Global Memory Augmentation for Transformers (GMAT) [25] and LongLoRA [6].",

We introduce an innovative framework for model compression that combines knowledge distillation, pruning, and fine-tuning to achieve enhanced compression while providing control over the degree of compactness. Our research is conducted on popular datasets, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, employing diverse model architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet. We could calibrate the amount of compression achieved. This allows us to produce models with different degrees of compression while still being just as accurate, or even better. Notably, we demonstrate its efficacy by producing two compressed variants of ResNet 101: ResNet 50 and ResNet 18. Our results reveal intriguing findings.

Xie et al.'s study [17], ventures into the realm of person re-identification. Employing a sequence of pruning followed by knowledge distillation, they strike a balance between effective parameter reduction and accurate performance. Cui and Li, the architects of [18], unveil a complex model compression approach that combines structural pruning with dense knowledge distillation for large language models. Kim et al. [19] address the needs of edge devices with PQK, an innovative combination of pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. A structured progression of pruning, quantization, and distillation provides a comprehensive strategy for efficient edge-based model deployment. \n\nFinally, Wang et al. [20] introduce an innovative approach that combines structured pruning with multilevel distillation. By using pre-and post-pruning networks as teacherstudent pairs, they reduce the loss of accuracy through distillation and highlight the synergy between the two techniques. \n\nIn previous approaches, knowledge distillation is often used for fine-tuning after pruning. This involves using the pruned model as a learner and transferring knowledge from a larger model to modify it. However, this method does not lead to a significant increase in compression. Our approach takes strength from its flexibility and enables a more intelligent design that can increase the compression rate while maintaining or even increasing performance. \n\nHowever, starting with pruning before distilling knowledge has its drawbacks. This risks losing essential information that distillation can provide, limiting the depth of understanding. In addition, pruning may change the structure of the network, harm teacherstudent communication, and affect student learning. On the other hand, starting to distill knowledge before pruning has two clear advantages. First, the learner model takes advantage of advanced knowledge for efficient pruning and improved compression, while preserving important features. Second, distillation provides deep insight and enables finer pruning that preserves accuracy.",

This has led to the exploration of methods such as knowledge distillation and network pruning to compress models and increase their performance. In this study, we investigate the potential synergy between knowledge distillation and network pruning to achieve optimal model efficiency and improved generalization. We introduce an innovative framework for model compression that combines knowledge distillation, pruning, and fine-tuning to achieve enhanced compression while providing control over the degree of compactness. Our research is conducted on popular datasets, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, employing diverse model architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet. We could calibrate the amount of compression achieved. This allows us to produce models with different degrees of compression while still being just as accurate, or even better. Notably, we demonstrate its efficacy by producing two compressed variants of ResNet 101: ResNet 50 and ResNet 18. Our results reveal intriguing findings. In most cases, the pruned and distilled student models exhibit comparable or superior accuracy to the distilled student models while utilizing significantly fewer parameters.\n## Combination of Pruning and Knowledge Distillation\nAghli and Ribeiro's work [16] pioneered the integration of weighted pruning and knowledge distillation, coordinating selective pruning on ResNet layers and subsequent distillation for enhanced model compression without loss of accuracy. Xie et al.'s study [17], ventures into the realm of person re-identification. Employing a sequence of pruning followed by knowledge distillation, they strike a balance between effective parameter reduction and accurate performance. Cui and Li, the architects of [18], unveil a complex model compression approach that combines structural pruning with dense knowledge distillation for large language models. Kim et al. [19] address the needs of edge devices with PQK, an innovative combination of pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. A structured progression of pruning, quantization, and distillation provides a comprehensive strategy for efficient edge-based model deployment. \n\nFinally, Wang et al. [20] introduce an innovative approach that combines structured pruning with multilevel distillation. By using pre-and post-pruning networks as teacherstudent pairs, they reduce the loss of accuracy through distillation and highlight the synergy between the two techniques. \n\nIn previous approaches, knowledge distillation is often used for fine-tuning after pruning. This involves using the pruned model as a learner and transferring knowledge from a larger model to modify it. However, this method does not lead to a significant increase in compression. Our approach takes strength from its flexibility and enables a more intelligent design that can increase the compression rate while maintaining or even increasing performance. \n\nHowever, starting with pruning before distilling knowledge has its drawbacks. This risks losing essential information that distillation can provide, limiting the depth of understanding. In addition, pruning may change the structure of the network, harm teacherstudent communication, and affect student learning. On the other hand, starting to distill knowledge before pruning has two clear advantages. First, the learner model takes advantage of advanced knowledge for efficient pruning and improved compression, while preserving important features. Second, distillation provides deep insight and enables finer pruning that preserves accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their recent impressive accomplishments, are notably cost-prohibitive to deploy, particularly for applications involving long-content generation, such as dialogue systems and story writing. Often, a large amount of transient state information, referred to as the KV cache, is stored in GPU memory in addition to model parameters, scaling linearly with the sequence length and batch size. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for implementing the KV cache which significantly reduces its memory footprint. Our approach is based on the noteworthy observation that a small portion of tokens contributes most of the value when computing attention scores. We call these tokens Heavy Hitters (H$_2$). Through a comprehensive investigation, we find that (i) the emergence of H$_2$ is natural and strongly correlates with the frequent co-occurrence of tokens in the text, and (ii) removing them results in significant performance degradation. Based on these insights, we propose Heavy Hitter Oracle (H$_2$O), a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens. We formulate the KV cache eviction as a dynamic submodular problem and prove (under mild assumptions) a theoretical guarantee for our novel eviction algorithm which could help guide future work. We validate the accuracy of our algorithm with OPT, LLaMA, and GPT-NeoX across a wide range of tasks. Our implementation of H$_2$O with 20% heavy hitters improves the throughput over three leading inference systems DeepSpeed Zero-Inference, Hugging Face Accelerate, and FlexGen by up to 29$\\times$, 29$\\times$, and 3$\\times$ on OPT-6.7B and OPT-30B. With the same batch size, H2O can reduce the latency by up to 1.9$\\times$. The code is available at https://github.com/FMInference/H2O.",

Previously, model compression algorithms have been extensively investigated as a viable approach for mitigating the computational resource requirements of model inference. These algorithms can be broadly categorized into three groups: \n\n(1) quantization [55,56,57,58], which involves mapping model parameters or activations from high-precision data types to low-precision counterparts, such as using 8-bit integers instead of the commonly employed 32-bit floating point format; (2) pruning or sparsity [59,60,61,62], which aims to eliminate unnecessary neurons or weights within the models; (3) and distillation [63,64,65,66] where predictions from larger models are utilized as supervised information to train smaller models. \n\nTransformer in NLP. Transformers [67] as a popular option have been frequently adopted by plenty of natural language processing (NLP) applications with prevailing successes [68,69,70,71,72,46,73,13,74,75]. Roughly, modern transformer-based networks can be categorized into two groups: \n\n(1) Encoder-Decoder or Encoder-only (i.e., BERT-style models [76]). This type of transformers commonly leverages the Masked Language Modeling task which encourages models to capture the intrinsic relationship between words and their context. Notable examples include BERT [76], RoBBERTa [69] and T5 [77]. (2) Decoder-only (i.e., GPT-style models [78]). Usually, this group of transformers adopts the Casual Language Modeling task, which is optimized to generate the next word/token in a sequence based on the preceding words/tokens. Such an autoregressive manner is highly preferred by downstream tasks like text generation and question answering. GPT-3 [79], OPT [39], PaLM [13], and BLOOM [80] are representative architectures within this huge family.",

Barrett, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen\n## Abstract\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), despite their recent impressive accomplishments, are notably cost-prohibitive to deploy, particularly for applications involving long-content generation, such as dialogue systems and story writing. Often, a large amount of transient state information, referred to as the KV cache, is stored in GPU memory in addition to model parameters, scaling linearly with the sequence length and batch size. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for implementing the KV cache which significantly reduces its memory footprint. Our approach is based on the noteworthy observation that a small portion of tokens contributes most of the value when computing attention scores. We call these tokens Heavy Hitters (H$_2$). Through a comprehensive investigation, we find that (i) the emergence of H$_2$ is natural and strongly correlates with the frequent co-occurrence of tokens in the text, and (ii) removing them results in significant performance degradation. Based on these insights, we propose Heavy Hitter Oracle (H$_2$O), a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens. We formulate the KV cache eviction as a dynamic submodular problem and prove (under mild assumptions) a theoretical guarantee for our novel eviction algorithm which could help guide future work. We validate the accuracy of our algorithm with OPT, LLaMA, and GPT-NeoX across a wide range of tasks. Our implementation of H$_2$O with 20% heavy hitters improves the throughput over three leading inference systems DeepSpeed Zero-Inference, Hugging Face Accelerate, and FlexGen by up to 29$\\times$, 29$\\times$, and 3$\\times$ on OPT-6.7B and OPT-30B. With the same batch size, H2O can reduce the latency by up to 1.9$\\times$. The code is available at https://github.com/FMInference/H2O.\n## B.1 Extended Related Works\nQuantization, Pruning, Distillation for Inference. Previously, model compression algorithms have been extensively investigated as a viable approach for mitigating the computational resource requirements of model inference. These algorithms can be broadly categorized into three groups: \n\n(1) quantization [55,56,57,58], which involves mapping model parameters or activations from high-precision data types to low-precision counterparts, such as using 8-bit integers instead of the commonly employed 32-bit floating point format; (2) pruning or sparsity [59,60,61,62], which aims to eliminate unnecessary neurons or weights within the models; (3) and distillation [63,64,65,66] where predictions from larger models are utilized as supervised information to train smaller models. \n\nTransformer in NLP. Transformers [67] as a popular option have been frequently adopted by plenty of natural language processing (NLP) applications with prevailing successes [68,69,70,71,72,46,73,13,74,75]. Roughly, modern transformer-based networks can be categorized into two groups: \n\n(1) Encoder-Decoder or Encoder-only (i.e., BERT-style models [76]). This type of transformers commonly leverages the Masked Language Modeling task which encourages models to capture the intrinsic relationship between words and their context. Notable examples include BERT [76], RoBBERTa [69] and T5 [77]. (2) Decoder-only (i.e., GPT-style models [78]). Usually, this group of transformers adopts the Casual Language Modeling task, which is optimized to generate the next word/token in a sequence based on the preceding words/tokens. Such an autoregressive manner is highly preferred by downstream tasks like text generation and question answering. GPT-3 [79], OPT [39], PaLM [13], and BLOOM [80] are representative architectures within this huge family.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid growth in the size and complexity of large language models (LLMs), the costs associated with their training and inference have escalated significantly. Research indicates that certain layers in LLMs harbor substantial redundancy, and pruning these layers has minimal impact on the overall performance. While various layer pruning methods have been developed based on this insight, they generally overlook the finer-grained redundancies within the layers themselves. In this paper, we delve deeper into the architecture of LLMs and demonstrate that finer-grained pruning can be achieved by targeting redundancies in multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) blocks. We propose a novel, training-free structured pruning approach called BlockPruner. Unlike existing layer pruning methods, BlockPruner segments each Transformer layer into MHA and MLP blocks. It then assesses the importance of these blocks using perplexity measures and applies a heuristic search for iterative pruning. We applied BlockPruner to LLMs of various sizes and architectures and validated its performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. Experimental results show that BlockPruner achieves more granular and effective pruning compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

However, their growing size and complexity have led to substantial computational demands and increased memory usage, creating obstacles for deployment in resourceconstrained environments. Model compression techniques (Gao et al., 2020;Li et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024) have emerged as a promising solution Figure 1: Block Influence (BI) scores (Men et al., 2024) for the Llama2-7B model (Touvron et al., 2023b) computed at both layer and block levels, where blocks/layers with lower BI scores indicate less importance. The model has 32 Transformer layers, each containing one MHA and one MLP block, totaling 64 blocks. Blocklevel BI scores are generally lower than layer-level scores, indicating finer-grained redundancies. \n\nto address the challenges of deploying large, computationally intensive models. These techniques aim to transform large models into more compact versions that require less storage and execute with lower latency, while minimizing performance degradation. Model compression methods typically involve knowledge distillation (Huang et al., 2022;Gu et al., 2024), quantization (Yao et al., 2022;Dettmers et al., 2023), and pruning (van der Ouderaa et al., 2024;Ashkboos et al., 2024). In this study, we primarily focus on pruning, a technique that can be combined with these other methods to achieve more effective and efficient compression. \n\nRecent research on layer redundancy has shown that LLMs contain a substantial number of redundant layers (Yang et al., 2024;Men et al., 2024;Chen et al., 2024). Removing these layers does not severely impact the model's performance. To quantify this redundancy, researchers have investigated various similarity-based measurement methods and developed corresponding pruning strategies, includ-ing layer merging (Yang et al., 2024) and layer removal (Men et al., 2024).",

Research indicates that certain layers in LLMs harbor substantial redundancy, and pruning these layers has minimal impact on the overall performance. While various layer pruning methods have been developed based on this insight, they generally overlook the finer-grained redundancies within the layers themselves. In this paper, we delve deeper into the architecture of LLMs and demonstrate that finer-grained pruning can be achieved by targeting redundancies in multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) blocks. We propose a novel, training-free structured pruning approach called BlockPruner. Unlike existing layer pruning methods, BlockPruner segments each Transformer layer into MHA and MLP blocks. It then assesses the importance of these blocks using perplexity measures and applies a heuristic search for iterative pruning. We applied BlockPruner to LLMs of various sizes and architectures and validated its performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. Experimental results show that BlockPruner achieves more granular and effective pruning compared to state-of-the-art baselines.\n## Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) (Zhao et al., 2023;Minaee et al., 2024) have demonstrated outstanding performance across a diverse array of natural language processing tasks. However, their growing size and complexity have led to substantial computational demands and increased memory usage, creating obstacles for deployment in resourceconstrained environments. Model compression techniques (Gao et al., 2020;Li et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024) have emerged as a promising solution Figure 1: Block Influence (BI) scores (Men et al., 2024) for the Llama2-7B model (Touvron et al., 2023b) computed at both layer and block levels, where blocks/layers with lower BI scores indicate less importance. The model has 32 Transformer layers, each containing one MHA and one MLP block, totaling 64 blocks. Blocklevel BI scores are generally lower than layer-level scores, indicating finer-grained redundancies. \n\nto address the challenges of deploying large, computationally intensive models. These techniques aim to transform large models into more compact versions that require less storage and execute with lower latency, while minimizing performance degradation. Model compression methods typically involve knowledge distillation (Huang et al., 2022;Gu et al., 2024), quantization (Yao et al., 2022;Dettmers et al., 2023), and pruning (van der Ouderaa et al., 2024;Ashkboos et al., 2024). In this study, we primarily focus on pruning, a technique that can be combined with these other methods to achieve more effective and efficient compression. \n\nRecent research on layer redundancy has shown that LLMs contain a substantial number of redundant layers (Yang et al., 2024;Men et al., 2024;Chen et al., 2024). Removing these layers does not severely impact the model's performance. To quantify this redundancy, researchers have investigated various similarity-based measurement methods and developed corresponding pruning strategies, includ-ing layer merging (Yang et al., 2024) and layer removal (Men et al., 2024).",

While pruning and quantization have shown promise, their combined potential remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine joint compression and how strategically combining pruning and quantization could yield superior performance-to-compression ratios compared to single-method approaches. Recognizing the challenges in accurately assessing LLM performance, we address key limitations of previous evaluation frameworks and introduce the Semantic Retention Compression Rate (SrCr), a novel metric that quantifies the trade-off between model compression and semantic preservation, facilitating the optimization of pruning-quantization configurations. Experiments demonstrate that our recommended combination achieves, on average, a 20% performance increase compared to an equivalent quantization-only model at the same theoretical compression rate.\n## I.

            "abstract": "The emergence of Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs has significantly advanced the development of language models. Compared to traditional LLMs, MoE LLMs outperform traditional LLMs by achieving higher performance with considerably fewer activated parameters. Despite this efficiency, their enormous parameter size still leads to high deployment costs. In this paper, we introduce a two-stage compression method tailored for MoE to reduce the model size and decrease the computational cost. First, in the inter-expert pruning stage, we analyze the importance of each layer and propose the Layer-wise Genetic Search and Block-wise KT-Reception Field with the non-uniform pruning ratio to prune the individual expert. Second, in the intra-expert decomposition stage, we apply the low-rank decomposition to further compress the parameters within the remaining experts. Extensive experiments on Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, DeepSeek-V2-Lite, and Mixtral-8$\\times$7B demonstrate that our proposed methods can both reduce the model size and enhance inference efficiency while maintaining performance in various zero-shot tasks.

                    "text": "Recent advancements in large language models have underscored the need to reduce parameter sizes and latency (Ma et al., 2023). Compression techniques for language models include network pruning (Xu et al., 2021), knowledge distillation (Sun et al., 2019(Sun et al., , 2020)), quantization (Yao et al., 2022), decomposition (Hsu et al., 2022;Yuan et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024), and methods like early exit (Xin et al., 2020). Building on these techniques, pruning, and sparsity is crucial for MoE models, which often have up to 95% of parameters dedicated to experts. Pruning MoE models involves removing less important experts or neurons to reduce the number of active parameters during inference. For example, (Kim et al., 2021) retains the most activated experts to enhance machine translation MoE models, while (Koishekenov et al., 2022) introduces gate statistics-based pruning during decoding. Although effective, these methods are mostly confined to linguistic models in machine translation. (Chen et al., 2022) dropping-while-training approach progressively removes non-essential experts for specific tasks, tested on Switch Transformers (Fedus et al., 2022). The merge-compression (Li et al., 2024) method and EPP (Lu et al., 2024) approach, which is similar to ours, consider pruning and skipping in MoE models but face challenges in reducing computational costs. Given a pruned or sparse model, finetuning aims to restore performance on original tasks. Recent studies on LLMs (Sun et al., 2023;Ma et al., 2023) focus on pruning linear layers, but these methods often fail to reduce computing costs without specialized hardware or libraries. Efficient post-finetuning expert pruning and sparsity methods for task-agnostic MoE LLMs remain underexplored. This gap highlights the need for advanced techniques to effectively balance pruning and sparsity while maintaining or enhancing performance across various tasks.",

Compared to traditional LLMs, MoE LLMs outperform traditional LLMs by achieving higher performance with considerably fewer activated parameters. Despite this efficiency, their enormous parameter size still leads to high deployment costs. In this paper, we introduce a two-stage compression method tailored for MoE to reduce the model size and decrease the computational cost. First, in the inter-expert pruning stage, we analyze the importance of each layer and propose the Layer-wise Genetic Search and Block-wise KT-Reception Field with the non-uniform pruning ratio to prune the individual expert. Second, in the intra-expert decomposition stage, we apply the low-rank decomposition to further compress the parameters within the remaining experts. Extensive experiments on Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, DeepSeek-V2-Lite, and Mixtral-8$\\times$7B demonstrate that our proposed methods can both reduce the model size and enhance inference efficiency while maintaining performance in various zero-shot tasks. The code will be available at \\url{https://github.com/xiaochengsky/MoEI-2.git}\n## Compression on MoE LLMs\nRecent advancements in large language models have underscored the need to reduce parameter sizes and latency (Ma et al., 2023). Compression techniques for language models include network pruning (Xu et al., 2021), knowledge distillation (Sun et al., 2019(Sun et al., , 2020)), quantization (Yao et al., 2022), decomposition (Hsu et al., 2022;Yuan et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024), and methods like early exit (Xin et al., 2020). Building on these techniques, pruning, and sparsity is crucial for MoE models, which often have up to 95% of parameters dedicated to experts. Pruning MoE models involves removing less important experts or neurons to reduce the number of active parameters during inference. For example, (Kim et al., 2021) retains the most activated experts to enhance machine translation MoE models, while (Koishekenov et al., 2022) introduces gate statistics-based pruning during decoding. Although effective, these methods are mostly confined to linguistic models in machine translation. (Chen et al., 2022) dropping-while-training approach progressively removes non-essential experts for specific tasks, tested on Switch Transformers (Fedus et al., 2022). The merge-compression (Li et al., 2024) method and EPP (Lu et al., 2024) approach, which is similar to ours, consider pruning and skipping in MoE models but face challenges in reducing computational costs. Given a pruned or sparse model, finetuning aims to restore performance on original tasks. Recent studies on LLMs (Sun et al., 2023;Ma et al., 2023) focus on pruning linear layers, but these methods often fail to reduce computing costs without specialized hardware or libraries. Efficient post-finetuning expert pruning and sparsity methods for task-agnostic MoE LLMs remain underexplored. This gap highlights the need for advanced techniques to effectively balance pruning and sparsity while maintaining or enhancing performance across various tasks.",

However, their high computational demands result in significant environmental impacts, particularly in terms of energy and water consumption. This paper addresses these issues by proposing an innovative compression approach to reducing LLM sizes. We focus on compressing the internal transformer layers, which are critical contributors to LLMs\u2019 computational complexity. Our approach combines new mathematical and structural key methods for model compression. We begin by applying Forward Propagation Pruning (FPP) to compress the embedding and feed-forward layers, utilizing a weight freezing and zeroing technique for suspected unused parameters. This reduces the number of trainable parameters, accelerating the overall training process and enabling faster convergence. Second, the Weight Matrix Folding method is introduced to efficiently prune the self-attention layer matrices in a simple and efficient mathematical model. This method integrates Identical Row Compression (IRC) to optimize the compression of the Query and Key matrices, alongside Diagonal Weight Compression (DWC), which reformulates the Value matrix into a diagonal structure. Consequently, this technique significantly diminishes parameter variability across the three metrics, enhancing consistency and performance while simplifying complexity. The compression approach is evaluated on three language modeling datasets and eight widely used classification datasets, comparing it to various pruning methods. Our method successfully compresses transformer layers by 99% and linear layers by 70%, resulting in an overall model compression of around 70%, while maintaining nearly the same accuracy. Notably, with moderate compression rates of 20% to 40%, model performance not only remained stable but even improved. This leads to substantial reductions in memory usage and computational demands, making LLMs more resource-efficient and highlighting the potential to optimize them for a more sustainable AI future.",

LLM-Pruner 14 and FLAP 15 aim to reduce network width by pruning coupled structures. Sheared-LLaMA 16 takes a more comprehensive approach, reducing network width and depth by removing entire layers. While methods that address both width and depth aspects exist 17,18 , there is still a need for in-depth analysis comparing the impact of these factors on LLM inference efficiency. Applying traditional pruning techniques to LLMs presents unique challenges due to their vast number of parameters and substantial computational requirements 19 . Pruning methods for LLMs can be broadly categorized into unstructured and structured approaches. \n\nStructured pruning methods 20 focus on removing entire groups of parameters, maintaining dense weight matrices, and improving hardware efficiency. Techniques such as LLM-Pruner 14 and LoRAPrune 11 emphasize efficient deployment and inference acceleration. Sheared-LLaMA 16 aims to prune models to a target architecture and train them dynamically. The work of Tao introduces a novel compression technique called QuantGPT. This method focused on quantization and module adaptation, allowing for systematic compression while maintaining the integrity of the model's architecture and performance 25 . LightPAFF focuses on transferring knowledge from a more prominent (teacher) model to a smaller (student) model. This process inherently involves structuring the model to retain important features learned by the teacher rather than simply removing individual weights, as seen in unstructured pruning 21 . Unstructured pruning methods 22 target individual weights, maintaining performance. Notable examples include SparseGPT 23 , which employs sophisticated weight updates and pruning without retraining. Edalati et al. developed KnGPT2 for compressing the linear mappings of the GPT-2 model, focusing on reducing the number of parameters flexibly without drastically altering the overall architecture. This technique allows for representing weight matrices in a more compact form while maintaining performance, which aligns with the characteristics of unstructured pruning 24 . \n\nStructure pruning typically removes entire groups of parameters, such as whole neurons, channels, or even layers, which can limit its flexibility 25 .",

Belhaouari, Insaf Kraidia\n## Abstract\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling multitasking across diverse fields. However, their high computational demands result in significant environmental impacts, particularly in terms of energy and water consumption. This paper addresses these issues by proposing an innovative compression approach to reducing LLM sizes. We focus on compressing the internal transformer layers, which are critical contributors to LLMs\u2019 computational complexity. Our approach combines new mathematical and structural key methods for model compression. We begin by applying Forward Propagation Pruning (FPP) to compress the embedding and feed-forward layers, utilizing a weight freezing and zeroing technique for suspected unused parameters. This reduces the number of trainable parameters, accelerating the overall training process and enabling faster convergence. Second, the Weight Matrix Folding method is introduced to efficiently prune the self-attention layer matrices in a simple and efficient mathematical model. This method integrates Identical Row Compression (IRC) to optimize the compression of the Query and Key matrices, alongside Diagonal Weight Compression (DWC), which reformulates the Value matrix into a diagonal structure. Consequently, this technique significantly diminishes parameter variability across the three metrics, enhancing consistency and performance while simplifying complexity. The compression approach is evaluated on three language modeling datasets and eight widely used classification datasets, comparing it to various pruning methods. Our method successfully compresses transformer layers by 99% and linear layers by 70%, resulting in an overall model compression of around 70%, while maintaining nearly the same accuracy. Notably, with moderate compression rates of 20% to 40%, model performance not only remained stable but even improved. This leads to substantial reductions in memory usage and computational demands, making LLMs more resource-efficient and highlighting the potential to optimize them for a more sustainable AI future.\n## Related work\nThe compression of language models has gained significant attention, leading to the development of various methods, including network pruning 12 , knowledge distillation, and quantization 13 . LLM-Pruner 14 and FLAP 15 aim to reduce network width by pruning coupled structures. Sheared-LLaMA 16 takes a more comprehensive approach, reducing network width and depth by removing entire layers. While methods that address both width and depth aspects exist 17,18 , there is still a need for in-depth analysis comparing the impact of these factors on LLM inference efficiency. Applying traditional pruning techniques to LLMs presents unique challenges due to their vast number of parameters and substantial computational requirements 19 . Pruning methods for LLMs can be broadly categorized into unstructured and structured approaches. \n\nStructured pruning methods 20 focus on removing entire groups of parameters, maintaining dense weight matrices, and improving hardware efficiency. Techniques such as LLM-Pruner 14 and LoRAPrune 11 emphasize efficient deployment and inference acceleration. Sheared-LLaMA 16 aims to prune models to a target architecture and train them dynamically. The work of Tao introduces a novel compression technique called QuantGPT. This method focused on quantization and module adaptation, allowing for systematic compression while maintaining the integrity of the model's architecture and performance 25 . LightPAFF focuses on transferring knowledge from a more prominent (teacher) model to a smaller (student) model. This process inherently involves structuring the model to retain important features learned by the teacher rather than simply removing individual weights, as seen in unstructured pruning 21 . Unstructured pruning methods 22 target individual weights, maintaining performance. Notable examples include SparseGPT 23 , which employs sophisticated weight updates and pruning without retraining. Edalati et al. developed KnGPT2 for compressing the linear mappings of the GPT-2 model, focusing on reducing the number of parameters flexibly without drastically altering the overall architecture. This technique allows for representing weight matrices in a more compact form while maintaining performance, which aligns with the characteristics of unstructured pruning 24 . \n\nStructure pruning typically removes entire groups of parameters, such as whole neurons, channels, or even layers, which can limit its flexibility 25 .",

However, general-purpose LM compression methods can negatively affect performance in specialized domains (e.g. biomedical or legal). Recent work has sought to address this, yet requires computationally expensive full-parameter fine-tuning. To this end, we propose cross-calibration, a novel training-free approach for improving the domain performance of compressed LMs. Our approach effectively leverages Hessian-based sensitivity to identify weights that are influential for both in-domain and general performance. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that cross-calibration substantially outperforms existing approaches on domain-specific tasks, without compromising general performance. Notably, these gains come without additional computational overhead, displaying remarkable potential towards extracting domain-specialized compressed models from general-purpose LMs.",

Behind this success lies a recipe with two key ingredients: highly parameterized models and extensive training. However, the vast scale of these models presents substantial challenges in their deployment and application (Treviso et al., 2023;Zhu et al., 2024). Luccioni et al. (2024) suggest that the trend towards generalpurpose models has introduced substantial yet potentially unnecessary inference costs. \n\nModel compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, are foundational approaches aimed at reducing the computational footprint of LMs during inference (Zhu et al., 2024). Quantization represents weights (and/or activations) with lower precision, while pruning removes less important weights. Notably, recent work has shown the successful application of quantization (Frantar et al., 2023;Lin et al., 2024) and pruning (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2024) to generalpurpose LMs without any additional training. \n\nLM compression studies typically focus on preserving general-purpose performance, i.e. language modeling and commonsense reasoning capabilities (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Ma et al., 2023;Sun et al., 2024). However, in practice, LMs may be deployed within only one particular domain, e.g. biomedical or legal (Labrak et al., 2024;Colombo et al., 2024;Ling et al., 2024;Chen et al., 2024). This scenario unlocks new paths towards improving inference efficiency by extracting domain-specific LMs from general-purpose models (Figure 1). \n\nRecently, Zhang et al. (2024) proposed D-Pruner, a pruning method aiming to preserve weights that are influential to both domain-specific and general capabilities. To identify such weights, D-Pruner leverages the gradient information from a composite loss function which incorporates general weight importance scores.",

Chrysostomou, Vitor Jeronymo, Nikolaos Aletras\n## Abstract\nCompression techniques such as pruning and quantization offer a solution for more efficient deployment of language models (LMs), albeit with small performance drops in benchmark performance. However, general-purpose LM compression methods can negatively affect performance in specialized domains (e.g. biomedical or legal). Recent work has sought to address this, yet requires computationally expensive full-parameter fine-tuning. To this end, we propose cross-calibration, a novel training-free approach for improving the domain performance of compressed LMs. Our approach effectively leverages Hessian-based sensitivity to identify weights that are influential for both in-domain and general performance. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that cross-calibration substantially outperforms existing approaches on domain-specific tasks, without compromising general performance. Notably, these gains come without additional computational overhead, displaying remarkable potential towards extracting domain-specialized compressed models from general-purpose LMs.\n## Introduction\nLanguage models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across tasks from a range of domains (Grattafiori et al., 2024;Groeneveld et al., 2024;Yang et al., 2024). Behind this success lies a recipe with two key ingredients: highly parameterized models and extensive training. However, the vast scale of these models presents substantial challenges in their deployment and application (Treviso et al., 2023;Zhu et al., 2024). Luccioni et al. (2024) suggest that the trend towards generalpurpose models has introduced substantial yet potentially unnecessary inference costs. \n\nModel compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, are foundational approaches aimed at reducing the computational footprint of LMs during inference (Zhu et al., 2024). Quantization represents weights (and/or activations) with lower precision, while pruning removes less important weights. Notably, recent work has shown the successful application of quantization (Frantar et al., 2023;Lin et al., 2024) and pruning (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2024) to generalpurpose LMs without any additional training. \n\nLM compression studies typically focus on preserving general-purpose performance, i.e. language modeling and commonsense reasoning capabilities (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Ma et al., 2023;Sun et al., 2024). However, in practice, LMs may be deployed within only one particular domain, e.g. biomedical or legal (Labrak et al., 2024;Colombo et al., 2024;Ling et al., 2024;Chen et al., 2024). This scenario unlocks new paths towards improving inference efficiency by extracting domain-specific LMs from general-purpose models (Figure 1). \n\nRecently, Zhang et al. (2024) proposed D-Pruner, a pruning method aiming to preserve weights that are influential to both domain-specific and general capabilities. To identify such weights, D-Pruner leverages the gradient information from a composite loss function which incorporates general weight importance scores.",

Chrysostomou, Nikolaos Aletras\n## Abstract\nQuantization and pruning are fundamental approaches for model compression, enabling efficient inference for language models. In a post-training setting, state-of-the-art quantization and pruning methods require calibration data, a small set of unlabeled examples. Conventionally, this is randomly sampled web text, aiming to reflect the model training data. However, this poses two key problems: (1) unrepresentative calibration examples can harm model performance, and (2) organizations increasingly avoid releasing model training data. In this paper, we propose self-calibration as a solution. Our approach requires no external data, instead leveraging the model itself to generate synthetic calibration data, with a view to better approximating the pre-training data distribution. We extensively compare the performance of self-calibration with several baselines, across a variety of models, compression methods, and tasks. Our approach proves consistently competitive in maximizing downstream task performance, frequently outperforming even using real data.\n## Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) trained using vast corpora have delivered remarkable advances across a variety of domains and tasks (Touvron et al., 2023a;Jiang et al., 2023;Mesnard et al., 2024). However, they demand extensive computational resources for inference (Wu et al., 2022;Luccioni et al., 2023), presenting a limiting factor for their practical use. Consequently, this has prompted the development of an extensive collection of methods to improve inference efficiency (Treviso et al., 2023). In particular, model compression aims to reduce the size of a model while retaining downstream task performance (Wan et al., 2024). \n\nQuantization and pruning have emerged as prominent model compression approaches for LLMs (Gholami et al., 2021;Wan et al., 2024). Pruning removes less important weights from the model, while quantization represents the weights (and possibly activations) using fewer bits. Both quantization and pruning can be effectively applied in a post-training setting, retaining comparable performance across a range of downstream tasks (Frantar et al., 2023;Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2024;Lin et al., 2024). \n\nPost-training quantization and pruning typically depend upon calibration data, a small set of unlabeled examples (Nagel et al., 2020;Hubara et al., 2021) used to generate layer activations throughout the model. Conventionally, LLM calibration data consists of randomly sampled web text (Frantar et al., 2023;Sun et al., 2024;Lin et al., 2024), aiming to reflect the model training data distribution. \n\nHowever, recent work has questioned the influence of calibration data in LLM compression. Jaiswal et al. (2024) hint that the careful selection of calibration data may benefit high-sparsity pruning. Concurrently, Williams and Aletras (2024) illustrate the impact of calibration data in quantization and pruning.",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) Touvron et al. [2023], OpenAI [2023] have recently transformed the field of natural language processing (NLP) by delivering exceptional results across a variety of intricate language benchmarks Wei et al. [2022], Bommarito II and Katz [2022], Bubeck et al. [2023]. Nonetheless, these models, with billions of parameters, generally necessitate significant computational resources. To make LLMs more accessible, extensive efforts have been devoted to model compression of LLMs Xu and McAuley [2023], Bai et al. [2024a], including pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and low-rank factorization. Pruning, by introducing sparsity, jointly enhances memory and computational efficiency and offers unparalleled flexibility, seamlessly integrating with any LLMs, thus standing out as a highly effective and widely adopted compression strategy. \n\nModel pruning has a long history LeCun et al. [1989] and has proven effective in applications related to vision and smaller language models Hoefler et al. [2021]. However, conventional pruning techniques, which rely on global pruning and require loading the entire model into the same GPU Mallya and Lazebnik [2018], Singh and Alistarh [2020], become impractical for today's LLMs due to their vast size. Recently, several local pruning methods have been proposed for billion-scale LLMs. These methods compress each layer separately, and the overall compressed model is then obtained by \"stitching together\" the individually compressed layers. SparseGPT Frantar and Alistarh [2023], an efficient unstructured pruning method for LLMs with hundreds of billions of parameters, achieves parameter reduction of up to 60% with minimal performance loss. Another approach, Wanda Sun et al. [2023], introduces a novel pruning criterion that evaluates weights by considering both magnitude 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024). arXiv:2402.17946v4 [cs.CL] 31 Oct 2024 and related input activations.",

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Ope-nAI's GPT series (Achiam et al., 2023) and Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a,b), have made substantial advancements in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). These models exhibit robust capabilities in language understanding and generation, facilitated by extensive pre-training and fine-tuning. However, as the size of these models continues to expand, their computational and storage demands increase sharply, presenting significant challenges for practical applications. Model compression, a vital approach to reducing memory footprint and computational load during model deployment, offers unique benefits across various domains. Techniques such as pruning (Frantar and Figure 1: Compresso/NutePrune results in heterogeneous inter-layer structures, whereas MaskPrune achieves uniform inter-layer structures, which is friendly to inference deployment and continual training. Alistarh, 2023;Ma et al., 2023;Sun et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2023;Xiao et al., 2023;Lin et al., 2024), knowledge distillation (Gu et al., 2024;Agarwal et al., 2023), and low-rank factorization (Yuan et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024) can significantly decrease the number of model parameters and computational complexity, thereby enabling large-scale language models to function efficiently in resource-constrained environments. \n\nThe pruning technique reduces the size and computational complexity of the models by eliminating redundant parameters, which can generally be categorized into unstructured pruning (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2023;Dong et al., 2024), semi-structured pruning (Mishra et al., 2021), and structured pruning (Ma et al., 2023;Xia et al., 2023;An et al., 2023). Unstructured pruning compresses models by removing individual parameters, resulting in sparse weight matrices that consume less memory.",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs), such as the state-of-the-art GPT-3 model (Brown et al., 2020) with up to 175 billion parameters, have achieved remarkable performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, training and deploying such massive models also poses significant challenges in terms of computational cost, energy consumption, and environmental impact. Therefore, it is crucial to develop effective methods to reduce the size of LLMs without compromising their quality. \n\nNeural network pruning is a long-standing model compression method (Janowsky, 1989;Mozer & Smolensky, 1988;Frankle & Carbin, 2018;Karnin, 1990;Blalock et al., 2020). It can be broadly classified into two types: unstructured and structured. Unstructured pruning removes individual weights from the network based on some criteria, resulting in sparse weight matrices that can be stored and processed more efficiently. Structured pruning, on the other hand, eliminates whole components, such as neurons, channels, or blocks, leading to smaller architectures to reduce end-to-end inference latency. While unstructured pruning has been extensively studied and applied to LLMs (Wang et al., 2020b;Xu et al., 2021;Zafrir et al., 2021;Li et al., 2022), structured pruning is more challenging and less explored. However, structured pruning is also more desirable in many practical scenarios, such as deploying these models on resource-constrained devices or providing fast services based on LLMs. \n\nExisting work on structured pruning for LMs focuses on BERT-like networks (Devlin et al., 2018) that consist of an encoder-decoder or an encoder-only architecture (Li et al., 2020;Xia et al., 2022;Zhang et al., 2022;Yao et al., 2021). These models are mainly used for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, or natural language inference. Among the various methods, Block Movement Pruning (Lagunas et al., 2021) is a recent and popular technique that removes weight blocks based on movement.",

            "text": "Language Model Compression. With the advancement of NLP, LMs have grown in size, making it difficult to deploy them on edge devices and resulting in slower inference speed. As a result, there has been active research on language model compression which has three main approaches: quantization, knowledge distillation, pruning. Quantization (He et al., 2016;Alom et al., 2018;Zafrir et al., 2019;Shen et al., 2020;Yao et al., 2022) minimizes the storage requirements for weight values by reducing the number of bits needed to represent them. Knowledge distillation (Sanh et al., 2019;Jiao et al., 2019;Sun et al., 2019Sun et al., , 2020;;Wang et al., 2020b,a) transfers the knowledge of a large-scale teacher model with high performance to a smaller-scale student model, enabling the student model to replicate the behavior of the teacher model. Pruning (Chen et al., 2020;Sanh et al., 2020;Kwon et al., 2022;Frantar and Alistarh, 2023) reduces the size of a model by removing unnecessary parts of large networks such as neurons, weights, or layers. \n\nPruning. Pruning can be categorized into two parts: (1) unstructured pruning and (2) structured pruning. In unstructured pruning (Chen et al., 2020;Prasanna et al., 2020), weights, which are connections between neurons, are removed from the network based on various criteria. However, this line of methods produces sparse weight matrices, requiring specific hardware support. On the other hand, structured pruning (Xia et al., 2022;Kwon et al., 2022;Kurtic et al., 2023), prunes away structures such as neurons, weight matrix blocks, or layers.",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in natural language processing (NLP) due to their impressive performance on various tasks. However, as these models increase in size and complexity, their deployment poses significant challenges due to extensive computational and storage demands. For instance, models such as GPT-175B (Brown et al. 2020), with 175 billion parameters, require vast resources, making it impractical for many applications. Therefore, efficient model compression strategies are crucial for deploying these powerful models in practical applications. \n\nModel compression techniques commonly employ quantization and pruning to enhance model efficiency. Quantization reduces the precision of model parameters, while pruning removes less critical parameters. Traditional pruning methods, such as magnitude-based pruning (Han et al. 2015), directly trim weights based on their absolute values. While effective for smaller models, these methods often struggle with large-scale LLMs, resulting in suboptimal sparsity due to their inability to capture the complex interactions and importance of weights in such massive scalability. To address these limitations, recent post-training pruning techniques such as SparseGPT and Wanda have emerged. \n\nCurrent pruning methods face two major challenges. First, as depicted in Figure 1(a), traditional layer-aware pruning methods focus on individual layers and neglect inter-layer dependencies within, leading to higher error accumulation (represented by blue arrows). In contrast, block-aware pruning, by considering groups of layers, captures inter-layer interactions to reduce error accumulation (represented by orange arrows). Second, as shown in Figure 1(b), conventional methods typically build the pruning mask once, ignoring the changes of weight significance in post-pruning stage. This oversight can lead to improper identification of salient weights, resulting in performance degradation. \n\nTo address these limitations, we propose LLM-Barber, a novel and straightforward approach designed to rebuild sparsity mask of pruned networks without requiring for retraining or weight reconstruction. Firstly, unlike layer-aware methods that are confined to local optimization and thus arXiv:2408.10631v1",

            "text": "Large Language Model. \n\nLarge Language Models (Zhao et al., 2023) like GPT-4(OpenAI et al., 2024), LLaMA(Touvron et al., 2023) and OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), which have revolutionized Natural Language Processing through their ability   to understand and generate nuanced text. Alongside, multilingual language models (Doddapaneni et al., 2021) such as BLOOM(BigScience Workshop, 2022) and XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) are breaking language barriers by learning universal representations from texts across numerous languages. These developments underscore a significant shift towards creating more versatile and inclusive NLP systems, with research focusing on architectural innovations, training efficiencies, and cross-lingual capabilities to enhance global digital interaction. \n\nWe would like to emphasize that MBS can be applied to any model compression method that utilizes calibration data, particularly methods based on the OBS/OBD framework, where the approximation of Figure 6: Distance map of different languages associated with their corresponding language families. We can see that languages with the same family cluster together from this map. second-derivative information is required. Thanks to a survey on model compression for large language models by (Zhu et al., 2023), we examined the state-of-the-art model compression methods for large language models, and we found that our MBS is useful for almost all of them. \n\nPruning and quantization are two major model compression methods for LLMs. \n\nPruning. Pruning reduces model size and complexity by eliminating unnecessary or redundant components. It can be categorized into structured pruning, where higher-granularity structures like rows or columns of weight matrices are removed, and unstructured pruning, which eliminates in- dividual weights, leading to irregular sparse structures. In the domain of unstructured pruning, MBS can be applied to Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and SparseGPT (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023) that we presented in the background section, and also LoRAPrune (Zhang et al., 2023).",

The success of LLMs is closely tied to scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020;Hoffmann et al., 2022): training language models with more parameters, using more data and greater computational resources leads to more powerful capabilities. However, LLMs with more parameters increase the difficulty and cost of deployment and inference. Therefore, much work has been devoted to compressing LLMs to achieve a trade-off between efficiency and performance, such as pruning (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Ma et al., 2023;Xia et al., 2024) and quantization (Frantar et al., 2023;Huang et al., 2024;Shao et al., 2024). \n\nPruning is a model compression technique that has evolved over many years (LeCun et al., 1989) and remains full of potential and challenges. Based on the over-parameterization of neural networks, it aims to remove redundant parameters while minimizing the degradation of model performance. Pruning has been successfully applied to compress small to medium-sized neural networks. Through sparse training (Lee et al., 2019;Frankle & Carbin, 2019;Yuan et al., 2021;Lasby et al., 2024) or pruning-aware training (Sanh et al., 2020;Lagunas et al., 2021;Jiang et al., 2023) methods, it can achieve performance comparable to dense models with a high sparsity ratio (\u226570%). However, these methods require iterative training, which is costly and time-consuming for LLMs with billions of parameters. As a result, post-training pruning that does not require iterative training has become the preferred approach for pruning LLMs. \n\nThe challenge of post-training pruning is how to perform training-free parameter importance estimation.",

            "text": "Compression of Large Language Models. Numerous technologies aim to mitigate the memory and computation demands of Large Language Models (LLMs). These techniques can be broadly categorized into two primary types: quantization (Frantar et al., 2022;Lin et al., 2023;Shao et al., 2023) and pruning (Sun et al., 2023;Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Ma et al., 2023). Quantization converts full-precision values to low-bit representations, while pruning selectively eliminates insignificant weights. These two compression strategies are distinct but can be synergistically combined to enhance the compression ratio (Frantar et al., 2022;Kim et al., 2023). In this paper, we focus on impelling the performance of LLM pruning. \n\nPruning of Large Language Models. Pruning methods for neural networks can be broadly classified into structured pruning (Ma et al., 2023;Huang et al., 2020) and unstructured pruning (Frantar et al., 2022;Sun et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2023;2022b). Conventional techniques such as those in (Huang et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2023) are ill-suited for LLMs due to their reliance on extensive retraining, a challenge amplified within the context of LLMs. In contrast, LLM-specific pruning methods emphasize data and time efficiency. Regarding structured pruning, LLMpruner (Ma et al., 2023) delves into the structured pruning of LLMs and employs LoRA to recuperate the performance of pruned models. In the realm of unstructured pruning, SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023) introduces an efficient technique for estimating the Hessian matrix, thereby adapting the traditional OBS approach (Hassibi et al., 1993) to large-scale models. Furthermore, Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) adopts a straightforward strategy, eliminating weights based on the product of weight and activation values.",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) (Zhao et al., 2023;Minaee et al., 2024) have demonstrated outstanding performance across a diverse array of natural language processing tasks. However, their growing size and complexity have led to substantial computational demands and increased memory usage, creating obstacles for deployment in resourceconstrained environments. Model compression techniques (Gao et al., 2020;Li et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024) have emerged as a promising solution Figure 1: Block Influence (BI) scores (Men et al., 2024) for the Llama2-7B model (Touvron et al., 2023b) computed at both layer and block levels, where blocks/layers with lower BI scores indicate less importance. The model has 32 Transformer layers, each containing one MHA and one MLP block, totaling 64 blocks. Blocklevel BI scores are generally lower than layer-level scores, indicating finer-grained redundancies. \n\nto address the challenges of deploying large, computationally intensive models. These techniques aim to transform large models into more compact versions that require less storage and execute with lower latency, while minimizing performance degradation. Model compression methods typically involve knowledge distillation (Huang et al., 2022;Gu et al., 2024), quantization (Yao et al., 2022;Dettmers et al., 2023), and pruning (van der Ouderaa et al., 2024;Ashkboos et al., 2024). In this study, we primarily focus on pruning, a technique that can be combined with these other methods to achieve more effective and efficient compression. \n\nRecent research on layer redundancy has shown that LLMs contain a substantial number of redundant layers (Yang et al., 2024;Men et al., 2024;Chen et al., 2024). Removing these layers does not severely impact the model's performance. To quantify this redundancy, researchers have investigated various similarity-based measurement methods and developed corresponding pruning strategies, includ-ing layer merging (Yang et al., 2024) and layer removal (Men et al., 2024).",

Many industries have integrated LLMs into their workflow, such as in chatbots (OpenAI, 2023), code completion tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) (Chen et al., 2021), and assistive technologies (Zdravkova et al., 2022), etc. While enjoying impressive generalization capabilities, LLMs come with a set of challenges and disadvantages. The presence of abundant parameters, large memory consumption, and high computational cost during inference present several concerns in real-world applications. Previous literature proposed multiple solutions to address these disadvantages, such as distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), quantization (Jacob et al., 2018), pruning (Han et al., 2016), hardware acceleration (Chen et al., 2020), etc. \n\nAmong them, pruning refers to the removal of certain weights or entire neurons/layers based on some criteria, e.g., the smallest weights. A pruned model can maintain similar performance with fewer parameters, resulting in a reduction in storage and computational requirements. Inducing nonstructural sparsity in pruning is a widely embraced method aimed at minimizing the memory requirements of neural networks with only a minimal sacrifice in accuracy. Pruning methods stand out as notably simple and efficient mechanisms for model compression, serving to eliminate weights contingent on their significance.",

            "text": "There exist numerous methodologies aiming at enhancing the eciency of large language models post-training. Current literature in this domain can be broadly categorized into two main areas: model compression and prompt compression. Within the realm of model compression, three prominent techniques have garnered signi cant attention: quantization, distillation, and pruning. Quantization is a widely employed approach in the compression of post-training large language models [9,40,42]. By reducing the bit precision, quantization methods necessitate lower memory utilization, thus facilitating faster computations and, consequently, higher e ciency. Distillation methods distill the knowledge from larger models and embed it into smaller models to approach model compression [5,15,17]. Another noteworthy method for model compression is pruning [21,26]. Pruning achieves reduced complexity by eliminating relatively less impactful model components, e ectively reducing the model's size. On the other hand, prompt-based techniques contribute to eciency enhancement by modifying the prompts used in interactions with large language models [6,38,41]. These approaches seek to optimize the prompts to yield improved results in terms of e ciency. Xu et al. attach a prompt to get less accurate outputs, which helps in nding the e ciency-accuracy trade-o [38]. Yin et al. focus on nding the task de nition to shorten prompts [41]. Cheng et al. use a batching method to improve e ciency. However, all those prompt-based techniques has a common problem: they improve their e ciency mainly due to an incompleteness of the outputs.",

[32] explore the need for large language models and proposes a structured pruning approach to reduce their size without sacrificing performance.As language models have become larger, their resource requirements and latency have also increased, leading to higher costs.The authors address this issue by investigating model compression techniques.Their purposed method focuses on structured pruning, which entails parameterizing each weight matrix with a low-rank factorization and deleting rank-1 components selectively during training.By doing so, the authors achieve significant compression levels while outperforming unstructured and block-structured pruning techniques in language modeling tasks.Moreover, their approach offers notable speed improvements during both training and inference stages.The paper also highlights the applicability of their method to other aspects of large language models.They demonstrate its effectiveness in pruning adaptive word embeddings, which are crucial for language understanding.Furthermore, they apply their structured pruning approach to the BERT model and evaluate its performance on various downstream fine-tuning classification benchmarks.",

            "text": "Large pre-trained language models (PLMs) (Devlin et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2019) have achieved great success in a variety of NLP tasks. However, it is difficult to deploy them for real-world applications where computation and memory resources are limited. Reducing the pre-trained model size and speeding up the inference have become a critical issue.\n\nPruning is a common technique for model compression. It identifies and removes redundant or less important neurons from the networks. From the view of the model structure, pruning methods can be categorized into unstructured pruning and structured pruning. In the unstructured pruning, each model parameter is individually removed if it reaches some criteria based on the magnitude or importance score (Han et al., 2015;Zhu and Gupta, 2018;. The unstructured pruning results in sparse matrices and allows for significant model compression, but the inference speed can hardly be improved without specialized devices. While in the structured pruning, rows or columns of the parameters are removed from the weight matrices (McCarley, 2019;Michel et al., 2019;Voita et al., 2019;Lagunas et al., 2021;Hou et al., 2020). Thus, the resulting model speeds up on the common CPU and GPU devices.\n\nPruning methods can also be classified into optimization-free methods (Michel et al., 2019) and the ones that involve optimization (Frankle and Carbin, 2019;Lagunas et al., 2021). The latter usually achieves higher performance, but the former runs faster and is more convenient to use.\n\nPruning PLMs has been of growing interest. Most of the works focus on reducing transformer size while ignoring the vocabulary (Abdaoui et al., 2020). Pruning vocabulary can greatly reduce the model size for multilingual PLMs.\n\nIn this paper, we present TextPruner, a model pruning toolkit for PLMs. It combines both transformer pruning and vocabulary pruning. The purpose of TextPruner is to offer a universal, fast, and easy-to-use tool for model compression. We expect it can be accessible to users with little model training experience. Therefore, we implement the structured optimization-free",

These remarkable capabilities typically come with a huge-scale model size with high inference costs. This makes it harder for more people to benefit from LLMs. Due to the computational resource constraints, most of the model compression methods in the pre-LLM era are no longer feasible for LLMs. Model compression methods for LLMs to date focus on model quantization (Dettmers et al. 2022;Xiao et al. 2023;Frantar et al. 2023;Dettmers et al. 2023) and unstructured pruning (Sun et al. 2023;Frantar and Alistarh 2023). \n\nStructured pruning (He and Xiao 2023), which prunes entire rows or columns of weights, offers a promising solution to the deployment challenges of LLMs. Unlike unstructured pruning, structured pruning reduces both parameters and inference time without relying on specific hardware, making it more widely applicable (Anwar, Hwang, and Sung 2017). For effective structured pruning, it's crucial to have a metric that captures the collective significance of an entire row or column. However, current unstructured pruning techniques for LLMs, as seen in methods like (Sun et al. 2023;Frantar and Alistarh 2023), primarily focus on the importance of individual elements of each row in isolation. This absence of structured metrics that evaluate entire rows or columns makes them less suitable for structured pruning. The recent LLM-Pruner (Ma, Fang, and Wang 2023) attempted structured pruning for LLMs, but its dependence on LoRA finetuning (Hu et al. 2021) creates a tough trade-off between high computation and effective pruning, limiting its use in larger models.",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) (Zhang et al., 2022a;Touvron et al., 2023a;Brown et al., 2020) have recently emerged as the new favorite in various domains of natural language processing (NLP) (Wei et al., 2022b;a;Bubeck et al., 2023). Nevertheless, LLMs face a significant constraint: their extensive parameterization and computational demands present substantial challenges in terms of storage and deployment. For example, the GPT-175B model (Brown et al., 2020) eats up 320G of memory to load its parameters in FP16 precision, requiring at least five A100-80G GPUs for inference (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023). In response to this issue, there has been a surge of interest in compressing LLMs, as it holds the promise of LLMs while remarkably reducing memory usage and computational costs. To date, the majority of current effort for LLM compression falls into quantization (Yao et al., 2022;Lin et al., 2023;Frantar et al., 2022;Dettmers et al., 2023;2022;Xiao et al., 2023;Shao et al., 2024;Ma et al., 2024), which compresses LLMs by diminishing the number of bits employed to represent weights or hidden states. On the other hand, network pruning (LeCun et al., 1989;Han et al., 2015;Mocanu et al., 2018), a technique that removes superfluous weights to create a sparse and lightweight model, has received relatively little attention (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2023). The plausible reason is that, network pruning usually appreciates at least one, usually many, iterations of fine-tuning or re-training to guarantee top performance (Frankle & Carbin, 2019;Yin et al., 2023). This fine-tuning step would cause a significant amount of compute and memory footprints due to the colossal model size and massive training data of modern LLMs, which even unnerves large corporations, let alone individual researchers.",

In this paper, we introduce TextPruner, an open-source model pruning toolkit designed for pre-trained language models, targeting fast and easy model compression. TextPruner offers structured post-training pruning methods, including vocabulary pruning and transformer pruning, and can be applied to various models and tasks. We also propose a self-supervised pruning method that can be applied without the labeled data. Our experiments with several NLP tasks demonstrate the ability of TextPruner to reduce the model size without re-training the model.",

            "text": "In recent years, the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have experienced explosive growth. However, this advancement comes at the cost of exponential expansion in model scale, resulting in significant financial and energy expenditures (Zhao et al., 2023). Consequently, there has been growing effort to mitigate these costs through model compression. (Frantar et al., 2022;Lin et al., 2024;Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Ma et al., 2023b;Sun et al., 2024;Dong et al., 2024). Among these, pruning has emerged as one of the most widely adopted techniques, with its fundamental principle involving the elimination of redundant parameters by selectively zeroing out network weights. \n\nContemporary pruning methods for large language models primarily eliminate retraining requirements through Hessian-based loss analysis (Frantar and Alistarh, 2022;Fang et al., 2023;Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Sawmya et al., 2024;Shao et al., 2024). While mathematically elegant, these methods face persistent implementation challenges due to slow pruning speeds. Specifically, computing second-order derivatives across all network weights creates a Hessian matrix whose dimensionality scales quadratically with parameter count, leading to intractable computational complexity. This limitation becomes critical in emerging real-time pruning scenarios such as training sparse models from scratch (Evci et al., 2020), finding the optimal sparsity (Jin et al., 2022) and other scenarios requiring frequent pruning operations (Shen et al., 2022;Kwon et al., 2022a;Fu et al., 2024;Le et al., 2025). With existing methods requiring hundreds of seconds per pruning iteration (see Table 1), conventional approaches fail to meet real-time operational demands, making the development of efficient pruning algorithms imperative for practical deployment.",

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing by leveraging deep learning techniques to process and generate human-like text. Compared to smaller models, LLMs exhibit unique characteristics and demonstrate remarkable abilities in tackling a wide range of complex tasks [40]. Despite their impressive capabilities, the vast number of parameters in LLMs often hinders their deployment on resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones. Consequently, there is significant interest in reducing the computational and memory requirements of LLMs. \n\nExisting compression techniques for large language models (LLMs) include weight sparsification [9], structural pruning [30], and quantization [10]. In this work, we focus on structural pruning and \u02daPart of this project was completed at Samsung Research America. Correspondence to sgao@cs.fsu.edu 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024). address the limitations of previous methods in this category. Structural pruning [30] is a generalpurpose compression solution that maintains LLM performance across various tasks, facilitates deployment on devices, and is computationally efficient. However, existing methods may restrict pruning flexibility or add significant overhead to the compressed model. For instance, LLM-Pruner [30] follows structural dependence during pruning, requiring different layers to use the same subset of feature maps, which limits pruning flexibility. SliceGPT [2] alleviates this issue by applying orthogonal projections for each layer but introduces a non-trivial number of additional parameters (e.g., 5% to 13% of the parameters of the original model for LLaMA-2 7B). Our approach aims to overcome these drawbacks and offer a better performance-cost trade-off for structural pruning. \n\nWe aim to increase the flexibility of current structural pruning methods and consequently improve performance. Our method provides different sub-spaces or subsets of features to different layers, but unlike SliceGPT, it doesn't introduce additional parameters. To achieve this, we break the structural dependence of regular structural pruning methods, allowing different layers to have different subsets of features along the embedding dimension and an example is given in Fig. 1.",

Pruning, as an optimization technique, can effectively reduce model complexity to enhance generalization ability and operational efficiency. Pruning techniques include structured pruning He and Xiao (2023); Fang et al. (2023); Sun et al. (2020); Liu et al. (2021a); Hou et al. (2020a); Iandola et al. (2020); Kitaev et al.

Particularly, structured pruning has become a key technology for addressing size and speed issues in encoder-based language models, systematically removing redundancies without significantly impairing model performance. \n\nDespite this, existing pruning methods still have limitations in practical applications. For example, Kwon et al. (2022) avoided the high costs associated with retraining by employing three techniques: mask search, mask rearrangement, and mask tuning. However, this greedy-based pruning method has been proved to be effective only in the short term and faced challenges in finding global optima, particularly when applied to complex or dynamically changing tasks.",

However, as the model size increases, the growing number of parameters leads to significant computational and memory requirements, which significantly hinder the practical deployment of LLMs. Consequently, it is urgent to develop methods that can reduce model size while maintaining performance. \n\nTo address these challenges, several methods have been proposed, including pruning (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2023;Ma et al., 2023;An et al., 2024), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022;Xiao et al., 2023), knowledge distillation (Shridhar et al., 2022;Hsieh et al., 2023), and low-rank decomposition (Saha et al., 2023). In this work, we mainly focus on pruning-an efficient and highly generalizable approach that can be seamlessly integrated with other model compression strategies. Pruning techniques are generally classified into two primary categories: unstructured pruning (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2023) and structured pruning (Ma et al., 2023;An et al., 2024). Compared to unstructured pruning, structured pruning offers the flexibility to do recovery fine-tuning (RFT) for specific downstream tasks without relying on specialized hardware (Zhu et al., 2024). Moreover, the model obtained through structured pruning typically achieves much faster inference speed due to the regular data patterns. Despite these advancements, existing structured pruning methods still have some limitations. They all follow the paradigm of first selecting channels or layers to prune based on a designed metric, and then performing RFT (Chavan et al., 2024).",

            "text": "Recent advancements in large language models have underscored the need to reduce parameter sizes and latency (Ma et al., 2023). Compression techniques for language models include network pruning (Xu et al., 2021), knowledge distillation (Sun et al., 2019(Sun et al., , 2020)), quantization (Yao et al., 2022), decomposition (Hsu et al., 2022;Yuan et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024), and methods like early exit (Xin et al., 2020). Building on these techniques, pruning, and sparsity is crucial for MoE models, which often have up to 95% of parameters dedicated to experts. Pruning MoE models involves removing less important experts or neurons to reduce the number of active parameters during inference. For example, (Kim et al., 2021) retains the most activated experts to enhance machine translation MoE models, while (Koishekenov et al., 2022) introduces gate statistics-based pruning during decoding. Although effective, these methods are mostly confined to linguistic models in machine translation. (Chen et al., 2022) dropping-while-training approach progressively removes non-essential experts for specific tasks, tested on Switch Transformers (Fedus et al., 2022). The merge-compression (Li et al., 2024) method and EPP (Lu et al., 2024) approach, which is similar to ours, consider pruning and skipping in MoE models but face challenges in reducing computational costs. Given a pruned or sparse model, finetuning aims to restore performance on original tasks. Recent studies on LLMs (Sun et al., 2023;Ma et al., 2023) focus on pruning linear layers, but these methods often fail to reduce computing costs without specialized hardware or libraries. Efficient post-finetuning expert pruning and sparsity methods for task-agnostic MoE LLMs remain underexplored. This gap highlights the need for advanced techniques to effectively balance pruning and sparsity while maintaining or enhancing performance across various tasks.",

            "text": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as BERT/RoBERTa (Devlin et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2019), have demonstrated exceptional performance across various natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, these models typically comprise hundreds of millions of parameters, presenting a substantial challenge for researchers due to their massive scale. As a result, the full potential of large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) remains untapped. To tackle this challenge, a multitude of model compression techniques have been proposed, encompassing knowledge distillation (Sanh et al., 2019;Jiao et al., 2020;Passban et al., 2021), network pruning (Liang et al., 2021a;Gordon et al., 2020), quantization (Zhang et al., 2020;Tao et al., 2022) and weight sharing (Lan et al., 2020). \n\nHowever, these model compression methods are not directly applicable to scenarios requiring high compression ratios, such as knowledge distillation. In such cases, the introduction of assistant models (Mirzadeh et al., 2020;Son et al., 2021) often leads to decreased and unstable performance. Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) (Touvron et al., 2023;Zeng et al., 2022;Ouyang et al., 2022;Scao et al., 2022) that possess extensive language knowledge and can be effectively employed in various downstream tasks. Consequently, it is essential to explore methods for transferring this knowledge to small-scale models. Nonetheless, existing approaches are inadequate for compressing LLMs due to their exceptionally high compression ratios. Some prior research (Wang et al., 2022;Dai et al., 2023;Ubani et al., 2023) has suggested utilizing LLMs for data augmentation and knowledge transfer to small-scale models, which allows the latter to demonstrate improved performance on lowresource datasets. However, when tackling more challenging tasks like the SuperGLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a), the limited parameter size of small-scale models becomes a hindrance, preventing them from effectively retaining the knowledge transferred by LLMs.",

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs), characterized by their massive scale, often consist of billions to trillions of parameters, enabling them to perform a wide range of complex tasks with remarkable proficiency (Kevian et al., 2024;Touvron et al., 2023;Team et al., 2023;Jiang et al., 2023). However, the deployment of these models poses significant challenges, primarily due to the extensive computational resources requirements. As the scale of these models grows, so does the urgency to develop more efficient methods for their deployment. This has led to increased interest in model compression techniques that aim to reduce the computational burden without substantially sacrificing performance. Techniques such as knowledge distillation, quantization, or pruning variants have emerged as viable solutions (Wan et al., 2023), each offering a different approach to streamlining model architecture and operations (Wang et al., 2024). \n\nIn this paper, we improve the work on model pruning introduced by SliceGPT (Ashkboos et al., 2024), a pruning technique via a constant slicing percentage of each layer. While this approach reduces computational demands and maintains a level of performance, it does not account for the varying significance of different layers within the network. We propose a more nuanced, dynamic pruning method that adapts the degree of pruning based on the individual characteristics and contributions of each layer. Our method aims to optimize both the efficiency and the efficacy of the pruning process by preserving more functionality in critical areas of the model, leading to better performance and less degradation in tasks. \n\nMore specifically, we develop a new metric, namely Layer Redundancy (LR) score, to quantify the impact of each layer on the model's overall performance. This evaluation is essential, as it guides the order in which layers are pruned, ensuring that the most influential layers are preserved while less critical layers are removed. Our approach involves generating slicing functions tailored to the importance of each layer, allowing for a dynamic and informed pruning strategy. Our results from the extensive empirical studies across various datasets and base models show a substantial improvement in model accuracy across all datasets tested, accompanied by a notable reduction in perplexity.",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) refer to natural language processing (NLP) models with a massive number of parameters [1]- [5], commonly based on the Transformer architecture [5]. These models have also found widespread applications in fields such as speech processing [6]- [8] and computer vision [9]- [11]. In recent years, LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex tasks in applications like dialogue systems [12], [13] and knowledge-based question answering [14]- [16], significantly accelerating the development of downstream applications. However, as model sizes continue to grow, the challenges related to inference efficiency have become more pronounced. \n\nCurrently, optimization methods for large models include pruning (structured pruning [17]- [19] and unstructured pruning [20], [21]), quantization [22]- [24], and distillation [25], [26]. This work focuses on structured pruning, making it more deployment-friendly and hardware-friendly. In modern structured pruning algorithms for LLMs, LLM-Pruner [17] achieves model size reduction by removing inter-group dependencies in the network. Sheared-LLaMA [19] not only removes structures within groups but also prunes less important blocks to achieve compression. \n\nThese methods can employ LoRA [27] to recover performance, but the gains in runtime memory efficiency and inference performance are still minimal. Shortened-LLM [18] aggressively removes entire blocks to speed up inference, but The top left compares perplexity(PPL) across different strategies under the same pruning ratio and fine-tuning steps, where our method demonstrates superior performance. The bottom left shows the keyvalue (KV) cache usage, where our approach achieves more significant KV memory pruning at both strategy-level and model parameter-level pruning ratios. Right side: Under the same model parameter settings, KVPruner achieves faster inference speeds compared to Shortened-LLM [18] and LLM-Pruner [17] pruning method. \n\nit shows that directly removing blocks requires retraining with CPT [18], which can take several weeks to restore the pruned model.",

However, substantial model size poses challenges to training, inference, and deployment so that it is necessary to compress the model. At present, most model compression for LLMs requires manual design of pruning features, which has problems such as complex optimization pipeline and difficulty in retaining the capabilities of certain parts of the model.Therefore, we propose a novel pruning approach: firstly, a training set of a certain number of architecture-accuracy pairs is established, and then a non-neural model is trained as an accuracy predictor. Using the accuracy predictor to further optimize the search space and search, the optimal model can be automatically selected. Experiments show that our proposed approach is effective and efficient.

            "text": "In recent years, the emergence of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) has led to a significant breakthrough in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The introduction of Transformers and unsupervised pre-training on enormous unlabeled data are the two main factors that contribute to this success. \n\nTransformer-based models (Devlin et al., 2018;Radford et al., 2019;Yang et al., 2019;Shoeybi et al., 2019) are powerful yet highly overparameterized. The enormous size of these models does not meet the constraints imposed by edge devices on memory, latency, and energy consumption. Therefore there has been a growing interest in developing new methodologies and frameworks for the compression of these large PLMs. Similar to other deep learning models, the main directions for the compression of these models include low-bit quantization (Gong et al., 2014;Prato et al., 2019), network pruning (Han et al., 2015), matrix decomposition (Yu et al., 2017;Lioutas et al., 2020) and Knowledge distillation (KD) (Hinton et al., 2015). These methods are either used in isolation or in combination to improve compression-performance trade-off. \n\nRecent works have been relatively successful in compressing Transformer-based PLMs to a certain degree (Sanh et al., 2019;Sun et al., 2019;Jiao et al., 2019;Sun et al., 2020;Xu et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020;Kim et al., 2021); however, moderate and extreme compression of these models (compression factors >5 and 10 resepctively) is still quite challenging. In particular, several works (Mao et al., 2020;Zhao et al., 2019aZhao et al., , 2021) ) that have tried to go beyond the compression factor of 10, have done so at the expense of a significant drop in performance.",

These models, enhanced by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrate impressive instruction-following abilities (Ouyang et al., 2022;Touvron et al., 2023a), but come with high compute costs for both training and inference (Kaplan et al., 2020;Hoffmann et al., 2022). To address diverse deployment requirements across varying model scales, sizes, and compute budgets, compressing models for efficient inference is essential, particularly given the significant time, data, and resource constraints associated with training multiple multi-billion parameter models from scratch. \n\nMost model compression techniques can be grouped into four main categories: knowledge distillation (KD) (Hinton et al., 2015), factorization (Hu et al., 2022), pruning (Le-Cun et al., 1989), and quantization (Han et al., 2015). In our work, we focus on pruning, though we aim for our method to inspire further developments across these other compression methods. Structured pruning, which selectively removes less critical components of a neural network, has emerged as a promising method for improving LLM efficiency (Ma et al., 2023). This method has gained attention for its ability to reduce memory and compute requirements, making inference more efficient. Recent works have shown that LLMs exhibit significant redundancy, particularly in the middle layers, where removing these layers has a minimal impact on overall model quality (Men et al., 2024;Gromov et al., 2024). The residual stream of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) architecture is only slightly modified by the output of non-essential layers, enabling the removal of these layers without drastically harming model quality. \n\nDespite its potential advantages, depth-wise structured pruning presents inherent challenges.",

[87] propose the LLM-Pruner approach to optimize large language models by selectively removing non-critical coupling structures based on gradient information to achieve efficient compression while preserving functionality and task agnosticism.Gholami et al.

However, this series of models is restricted by its massive memory storage and computational cost at inference: for example, BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) are hardly possible to deploy in practical scenarios, with no mention for edge devices. To alleviate this problem, many approaches have been invented to compress large language models, such as Knowledge Distillation, Parameter Sharing (Jiao et al., 2020;Sachan and Neubig, 2018), Quantization, and Model Pruning. Moreover, works also show that training a large but sparse model leads to better results than a small but dense model (Gomez et al., 2019).

            "text": "Recent literature has shown that increasing the size of neural network language models (NNLMs) can improve accuracy for several natural language processing tasks [1,2,3]. Employing large models on applications with memory and complexity constraints can be challenging. For such cases, the default strategy is to estimate small footprint models that meet the given constraints. However, better accuracy levels can be obtained by starting from a large model and shrinking it to the target size [4,5,6]. Popular model size reduction strategies include, among others, knowledge distillation [7], weight quantization [8], low rank layer factorization [9] or model pruning [10,11]. \n\nModel pruning has long been investigated as a way to effectively compress large models [12]. Defining which parameters to remove is one of the aspects to consider. One of the first criteria proposed is to remove low-magnitude parameters, following the intuition that parameter relevance correlates well with their magnitude [13,14]. Other works take the data distribution into account to define the parameter importance, making such methods suitable for joint pruning and task-adaptation [12,15]. \n\nAnother aspect to consider is the pruning method. Unstructured pruning, or sparsification, works by removing a certain number of neuron connections presumed to be redundant. Such process yields regularization effects similar to dropout [16]. Instead of removing individual connections, structured pruning enforces the presence of block sparsity patterns, which can improve memory consumption and latency [17]. Low-rank approximation methods [18], on the other hand, rely on factorizing the layer projections into the multiplication of two or more smaller matrices. Then, the inner channels that carry less information to reconstruct the original matrices are removed. \n\nThe pruning scheduling is another aspect to take into account. Usually, the straightforward choice is to remove parameters in a single step (hereafter one-shot). More recently, [10] showed that inducing sparsity incrementally while training can let the model recover from pruning losses, yielding better classification rates.",

            "text": "In recent years, the emergence and application of large language models (LLMs) have served as a powerful stimulant for natural language processing and artificial intelligence (OpenAI, 2022(OpenAI, , 2023;;Bubeck et al., 2023;Yang et al., 2023). Adhering to the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020;Hoffmann et al., 2022), researchers are continually seeking LLMs with more parameters and training data, aiming to achieve general models closer to human capabilities. However, larger language models imply a larger overhead of computing resources. Therefore, when deploying LLMs, it is necessary to strike a balance between efficiency and performance (Wan et al., 2024). To achieve efficient LLMs, many compression techniques for LLMs are proposed, such as pruning (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023a;Sun et al., 2024;Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2023;Lin et al., 2023;Liu et al., 2023) and knowledge distillation (Gu et al., 2024). \n\nAmong these methods, unstructured pruning and quantization can reduce the number of parameters or memory requirements by half or even more without significant performance degradation, but they require specialized GPU kernels to fully realize their acceleration potential. In contrast, structured pruning can produce lightweight models that do not rely on specialized hardware. Despite extensive research, the performance of structured pruning still lags significantly behind that of the original model. Low-rank compression (LRC) (Ben Noach and Goldberg, 2020;Li et al., 2023) is another promising compression technique. It decomposes the weight matrix into the product of two dense low-rank matrices, discarding unimportant parameter information during the decomposition process. However, LRC remains under-explored in LLMs. \n\nThe keys to LRC are low-rank decomposition methods and low-rank dimension allocation. Existing decomposition methods can generally be categorized into two types: weight-based and featurebased decomposition.",

For a comprehensive survey on NLP model compression, we refer readers to the survey [24]. \n\nCompressing learned models: 1) Pruning: Pruning is a technique to remove parts of a large model, including weights, nodes, blocks, and layers, to make the model lighter. Pruning can be performed as a one-time operation or gradually interspersed with training. [26,27] showed 2\u00d7-3\u00d7 compression on the BERT model on certain textual entailment, question answering, and sentiment analysis datasets with similar or better quality. 2) Quantization: Quantization can involve reducing the precision of the parameters of a model. Mixed precision models are sometimes used where different precision is used with different weights. Another way to quantize is KMeans quantization, where weights of the models are clustered using KMeans, and each cluster's centroid replaces a quantized weight. Product quantization [28] is a particular type of KMeans quantization. [29] showed \u223c16\u00d7 compression with mixed precision quantization on BERT. However, the compression yields a significantly worse model quality on textual entailment, question answering, and named entity recognition task. 3) Knowledge distillation: Knowledge distillation [15] is widely applied in NLP model compression with a focus on distilled architectures. Knowledge distillation involves first training a teacher \u03bb is the module-specific GMS scaling factor model; then, a student model is trained using logits of the teacher model. Many variations exist on this basic idea of knowledge distillation. An example in literature for BERT distillation is DistilBERT [30] with 2.25\u00d7 compression and similar or better quality.",

            "text": "Pruning. Structured pruning has been extensively studied as a model compression technique in computer vision and natural language processing, where task-specific models like classification ones are often overparameterized and can be pruned significantly with minimal impact on performance (Han et al., 2016;Wen et al., 2016;Liu et al., 2017;Luo et al., 2017;Cai et al., 2019;Deng et al., 2020;Hou et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020;Lagunas et al., 2021;Xia et al., 2022;Kurtic et al., 2023). Unstructured pruning (Frankle & Carbin, 2018;Li et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2020;Sanh et al., 2020) prunes individual neurons instead of structured blocks. Though unstructured pruning usually achieve higher compression rates, they are not practical for model speedup. \n\nIn the era of LLMs, the prevalent NLP pipeline has shifted from task-specific models to generalpurpose LMs, which leaves little room for redundancy. Both unstructured pruning, semi-structured pruning (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2023), and structured pruning (Ma et al., 2023) lead to significant performance drops on LLM even at a modest sparsity. Noticeably, all previous works fix the original models or tune them minimally. We see pruning as an initialization and consider it necessary to expend substantial compute to continually pre-training the model to recover performance. \n\nEfficient pre-training approaches. As orthogonal to our pruning approach, There is an extensive body of work on improving efficiency of training LLMs. For example, quantization reduces the numeric precision of model weights and activations and speeds up training and inference (Dettmers et al., 2022;2023;Xiao et al., 2023).",

            "text": "While many methods to improve model efficiency exist, the same goal generally underpins them: given an original model \u03b8 with an accuracy of acc(\u03b8) and an inference cost of c(\u03b8) minimize the inference cost. While the methods used for compression can be highly optimized and specialized, they can commonly be used together to deliver massive improvements in inference speeds with minimal losses in accuracy.\n\nTransformer Based Language Models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) provide contextual language representations built on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) which can be specialized and adapted for specific tasks and domains (Lee et al., 2020). Using these models, it becomes relatively easy to excel at a broad range of natural languages processing tasks such as Question Answering, Text Classification, and sentiment analysis. Unstructured Pruning is a compression approach that removes individual weights or groups of weights in a model by applying a mask or setting the weight values to 0. This compression approach has been broadly studied in computer vision (Han et al., 2015), and many methods can remove 70% or more of model weights with little to no loss in accuracy. Models pruned can be 20x smaller in terms of pure model size and, when paired with a sparsity-aware inference engine such as DeepSparse (Magic, 2023), provide 3-5x speedups in inference throughput. Focused on language models, recent work has shown that it is possible to prune models during pre-training with little to no loss in accuracy (Sanh et al., 2020) (Kurti\u0107 et al., 2022  As applied to language models, the approach has been used to improve the performance of structurally pruned language models resulting in models like DistilBERT (Sanh et al., 2019b) and TinyBERT (Jiao et al., 2020). Quantization reduces the precision for the model weights and activations to lower the computational requirements of model execution. While researchers have explored reducing representation to binary representations (Pouransari and Tuzel, 2020), current hardware limits inference speedups to 8 or 4-bit representations. Quantization can be applied after the model is trained in a one-shot fashion, but this can",

Structured pruning methods (Chen et al., 2021b(Chen et al., , 2023) ) remove entire groups of parameters, maintaining dense weight matrices and improving hardware efficiency. Techniques such as LLM-Pruner (Ma et al., 2023) and LoRAPrune (Zhang et al., 2023) focus on efficient deployment and inference acceleration, with Sheared-LLaMA (Xia et al., 2023) aiming to prune models to a target architecture and train them dynamically. Furthermore, the compression of language models has garnered significant attention, leading to various methods like network pruning, knowledge distillation, and quantization (Bai et al., 2020;Brown et al., 2020;Devlin, 2018). Pruning, especially structural pruning, remains a crucial focus due to its hardware-friendly nature, with methods varying from l1-dependent pruning (Zafrir et al., 2021) to more advanced techniques like the optimal brain surgeon (LeCun et al., 1989). Efficient compression and low-resource strategies are increasingly essential, with advancements in layer-wise optimal brain surgeon and data-free pruning approaches aiming to optimize the balance between compression efficiency and training data availability (Kurti\u0107 et al., 2024;Srinivas and Babu, 2015).",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative technology, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation tasks [1]. LLMs have showcased significant adaptability through fine-tuning, enabling their deployment in highly specialized applications. These advantages underscore the critical role of LLMs in solving real-world challenges [2]. Despite these capabilities, the deployment of LLMs has been hindered by their immense computational demands. Modern LLMs often consist of billions or even trillions of parameters [3], as seen in models like GPT-3 (175 billion parameters) and PaLM (540 billion parameters). The immense scale incurs significant memory, storage and power costs, making it challenging to run these models on resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, researchers have increasingly turned to model compression techniques, particularly pruning, to reduce the size and computational requirements of LLMs, while retaining their performance [4]. Pruning [5; 6; 7] is one of the most prominent model compression techniques. It aims to remove redundant or less important parameters from neural networks, thereby reducing their sizes and computational complexity. Recent advances in pruning have progressed from unstructured sparsity (i.e., individual weight removal) to structured sparsity (i.e., eliminating entire neurons, heads or layers), thereby enabling hardware-efficient implementation [4; 8; 9; 10]. For LLMs, several stateof-the-art methods have been proposed, including magnitude pruning, lottery ticket hypothesis approaches, and structured pruning based on attention mechanisms. These methods demonstrate the potential of pruning to enable LLM deployment on resource-constrained devices without causing substantial performance degradation. \n\nExisting pruning methods often use a layer-wise strategy that applies uniform sparsity across all layers, ignoring their varying importance. While simple to implement, this approach overlooks the inherent differences in the contributions of different layers to the overall performance of the model. Thus, it can only find the local optimal pruning solution, but not the global optimal solution. Empirical evidence also suggests that certain layers are more critical than others, and uniformly pruning across all layers may lead to the removal of essential parameters, ultimately impairing the pruned model's performance [11; 12].",

            "text": "To reduce the inference cost of large language models and increase their practical applications, there have been many recent works on compressing models, which can be classified into two categories: model pruning and quantization. Besides, there are some works aim to study the redundancy of model which is essential for compressing models. \n\nModel pruning: model pruning (LeCun et al., 1989;Han et al., 2015) is a classic and effective method of reducing model redundancy modules to compress models. The model pruning methods mainly include unstructured pruning and structured pruning. The unstructured pruning simplifies an LLM by removing specific parameters without considering its internal structure, such as SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023) and LoRAPrune (Zhang et al., 2023). However, this method disregards the overall LLM structure, resulting in an irregular sparse model composition. Another more practical approach is structured pruning, GUM (Syed et al., 2023) makes an analysis of several structured pruning methods for decoder-only LLMs. LLM-Pruner (Ma et al., 2024) selectively removes non-critical structures according to gradient information. ShearedLLaMA (Xia et al., 2023) employs targeted structured pruning and dynamic batch loading. LaCo (Yang et al., 2024) used layer merging to compress the model. Compared to the previous method, our method is a simple and efficient structured pruning method. \n\nQuantization: quantization (Liu et al., 2021;Gholami et al., 2022;Dettmers et al., 2022;2024) is a widely accepted technique in the field of model compression, which can significantly save the storage and computational costs of deep learning models. Traditional models are generally stored as floating-point numbers, but quantization converts them into integers or other discrete forms. LUT-GEMM (Park et al., 2022) quantifies only weights and optimizes matrix multiplication in LLM using BCQ format.",

            "text": "While quantization and pruning have been well studied as applied to language models, work has studied the compression BERT base or BERT large . Despite existing research, we find that a clear case study that explores how best to create a family of compressed models is lacking, and this work seeks to remedy that. As part of our research, we compare the impact of varying pruning methods, pruning stage, teachers for KD, and freezing portions of the model as applied to the RoBERTa language model. While performing task-specific compression allows NLP practitioners to broadly adopt improvements in inference efficiency, having access to pre-optimized models is key. We produce a family of 8 general purpose language models, collectively called oBERTa, which progressively get smaller and faster with minimal losses in accuracy. The oBERTa models leverage a combination of structured and unstructured pruning to provide a set of compressed models which can meet a wide set of latency needs. This compression approach has not been extensively documented nor discussed. Our approach to producing the oBERTA models builds on prior explorations of the combination of compression methods (Kurti\u0107 et al., 2022) and addresses compression approaches in a staged manner as shown in Figure 2. First, we create three structural variants starting with a RoBERTa base model. The base uses 12 transformer layers, the medium uses 6, and the small uses 3. Following prior work, we select interleaved layers for the 6-layer model and the first, middle, and last layers for the 3-layer model. Then, each of these 3 models is further pre-trained using masked language modeling on the Wikipedia-Bookcorpus text dataset, leveraging KD from a RoBERTa large teacher. After that, each model is pruned using gradual magnitude pruning (GMP) to a desired sparsity level (90% and 95%) during additional pre-training based on masked language modeling, similar to Zafir et al. (Zafrir et al., 2021). Further background on the RoBERTA model and why we did not prune using the WebText corpus can be found in the appendix. After pre-training, the sparsity profile is fixed, and models are fine-tuned and quantized on their target task with a small set of variable hyperparameters. Experimentation on",

            "text": "Although scaling up Large Language Models (LLMs) brings remarkable performance (Brown et al., 2020;OpenAI, 2023;Gemini Team et al., 2023;Meta, 2024;DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024;Yang et al., 2024a), increasing parameters brings more computations and memory consumption, posing a significant challenge of deploying in practical applications. To address this, various model compression methods for LLMs are proposed (Dettmers et al., 2022;Frantar et al., 2022;Lin et al., 2023;Muralidharan et al., 2024). Existing LLM pruning work (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2023;Xu et al., 2024a;Zhang et al., 2024b) focuses mainly on unstructured or semi-structured sparsity. However, these paradigms require specific hardware to achieve practical acceleration. \n\nIn contrast, structured pruning, which imposes structured sparsity by removing groups of consecutive parameters (Louizos et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2020;Xia et al., 2022), is more hardware-friendly on general devices. However, there are some challenges involved in existing structured pruning methods for LLMs: (1) They typically introduce learnable masks to search (Xia et al., 2023;Dery et al., 2024) or utilize gradients to guide pruning (Ma et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2023a). Unfortunately, they require significant computational overhead, especially for large-scale (e.g., 70B) models. (2) It is also worth noting that they usually assign a uniform sparsity budget per block, which is suboptimal since LLM blocks have different significance in the representation functionality (Gromov et al., 2024a). Moreover, they usually involve a recovery fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2022) to enhance pruned models, which also introduce training overhead and overlook the varying importance of blocks.",

            "text": "With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) Brown et al. (2020); Achiam et al. (2023) and their expanding multitude of applications across various domains, the efficiency of LLMs with vast parameters and complex architectures becomes crucial for practical deployment. In this paper, we aim to compress the LLM through structural pruning, which removes certain structural components such as channels or layers to reduce the model size with hardware-friendly acceleration. \n\nPioneering structural pruning in the pre-LLM era involves pruning channels or layers through optimization, which determines the structures to prune by back-propagating the task loss through the networks Liu et al. (2018); Blalock et al. (2020); Zhu & Gupta (2017); Louizos et al. (2017); Gale et al. (2019); Frankle & Carbin (2018). These methods operate at the in-training Huang & Wang (2018); Evci et al. (2020); Zhao et al. (2019); He et al. (2018a) or post-training Molchanov et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2021); Liu et al. (2021) phase, where the latter exhibit better efficiency without model weights update. We thus focus on post-training pruning in the following to ensure efficiency. \n\nFigure 1: The taxonomy of our method among the LLM Pruning. Methods without weight update are used for comparison in our experiments (highlighted with \u2660), due to the constraints on time and memory efficiency, as well as the accessibility of large-scale finetuning datasets. \n\nHowever, the heavy computational and memory demands of LLMs make existing optimizationbased pruning methods (even post-training ones) less appropriate for LLM pruning in terms of efficiency. Metric-based pruning is introduced to alleviate this issue, which directly prunes specific network components based on carefully designed criteria, such as the importance score Sun et al. (2023); Das et al. (2023). Nonetheless, those criteria are often based on heuristics.",

For example, quantization (Shen et al., 2020;Zafrir et al., 2019;Jacob et al., 2018) lowers bit precision of network weights to reduce memory usage and accelerate inference (Krashinsky et al., 2020). Knowledge distillation (KD; Hinton et al. (2015)), which trains a student neural network using the logits (or representations) of a teacher network, is used widely to transfer knowledge to smaller models (Sanh et al., 2019;Jiao et al., 2020;Sun et al., 2019Sun et al., , 2020)). Pruning identifies weights which can be omitted at test time without significantly degrading performance. Some pruning methods remove individual weights according to magnitudes or other heuristics (Gordon et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2020;Sanh et al., 2020), while others remove structured blocks of weights or entire attention heads (Wang et al., 2020;Hou et al., 2020;Voita et al., 2019;Michel et al., 2019). \n\nRecent work has begun combining these compression methods for improved results. Sanh et al. (2020), Zhang et al. (2020), and Bai et al. (2021) have used knowledge distillation with pruning or low-bit quantization to fine-tune BERT. As practitioners look to combine methods more generally, new research is needed to compare their empirical value and study interactions. This work addresses the questions: (1) Which popular compression methods or combinations of methods are usually most effective? (2) When combining methods, are their benefits complementary or diminishing?",

Some studies have focused on the data side, e.g., showing how smart downsampling of available datasets can result in equal or improved performance compared to using the entire dataset [16], [17]. On the other hand, efforts to enhance efficiency through model designs include questioning the necessity of full attention heads in large language models and demonstrating that removing certain attention heads does not significantly impact test performance [18], [19]. Several previous works have also investigated model pruning methods to improve the efficiency of learning large-scale language models, which identify and remove non-essential portions of networks. Earlier work focused mainly on unstructured pruning, where weights are pruned individually [20], [21]. More recently, structured pruning removes groups of consecutive parameters or structured blocks of weights, leading to significant speedups [22], [23]. Compared to these works, motivated by the recent demand for FL in NLP, we focus on communication efficiency in federated multilingual NMT and design a strategy that selectively transmits only the essential parameters of NMT engines for learning.",

Fan et al. (2019) randomly drops layers at training time, which enables structured pruning on transformer layers at inference time. Michel et al. (2019) prunes less important attention heads at inference time. Other works (Goyal et al., 2020;Kim et al., 2021) focus on pruning less important tokens and progressively remove them during inference. However, many of the pruning methods (Goyal et al., 2020;Kim et al., 2021;Chen et al., 2020) require a following fine-tuning step of the model parameters after fixing the configuration of a pruned network, which makes such methods undesirable for efficient task-specific compression. \n\nOn the knowledge distillation side, Sun et al.  2020) applies low-rank approximation to increase inference speed. However, such works sparsify the full self-attention matrix according to attention score, which does not directly reduce the dimension of the matrices in the model such as query, key, value, and feed-forward matrices.",

            "text": "Compression techniques such as pruning, distillation, and quantization have proven effective at reducing the size of models while maintaining their performance. Pruning can be done in two ways, via structured and unstructured pruning. While structured pruning involves removing groups of neurons, unstructured pruning removes individual neurons by zeroing out their values. Structured pruning methods generally achieve faster inference speeds, along with a reduction in parameter size. Knowledge distillation techniques are another alternative that have been demonstrated to effectively transfer knowledge from a teacher model to a smaller student model, using a loss function designed to minimize the distance between the features or the outputs of the student and teacher models. We also incorporate a third form of model compression -quantization, where model weights and/or activations are represented using lower-bit precisions. There are two main approaches to quantization: post-training quantization, which is applied to a pre-trained model, and quantization-aware training (Zafrir et al., 2019a), which incorporates quantization into the training process in order to mitigate the loss of accuracy that can occur with post-training quantization. Although several techniques for pruning and quantization have been developed, we acknowledge that our work consists only of models compressed using post-training dynamic quantization and the pruning method proposed in Zafrir et al. (2021). Whilst there has been research at the confluence of fairness and efficiency in natural language processing (NLP), the results from these studies can be inconclusive, limited in their research design, and at times, contradict the results from previous analyses. Talat et al. (2022); Orgad and Belinkov (2022); Field et al. (2021); Blodgett et al. (2020) provide critical insights into the current state of fairness in NLP and delve into the details of what research studies must consider when conducting work in this area. The discussion thus far concerning fair-ness, in general, has mainly been Anglo-centric, but recent forays (Kaneko et al., 2022;Huang et al., 2020b;Gonen et al., 2019;Zhao et al., 2020)",

There has been a renewed focus on efficiency techniques (Gale et al., 2019;Ogueji et al., 2022;Ahia et al., 2021). Quantization as a form of model compression of large language models has become increasingly relevant as a way to minimize memory requirements and minimize compute intensity (Dettmers et al., 2022;Xiao et al., 2022;Frantar et al., 2022;Park et al., 2022a;Kim et al.). \n\nModel Efficiency at Inference Time Research in model compression mostly falls in the categories of quantization techniques (Jacob et al., 2018;Courbariaux et al., 2014;Hubara et al., 2016;Gupta et al., 2015), efforts to start with a network that is more compact with fewer parameters, layers or computations (architecture design) (Howard et al., 2017;Iandola et al., 2016;Kumar et al., 2017), student networks with fewer parameters that learn from a larger teacher model (model distillation) (Hinton et al., 2015) and finally pruning by setting a subset of weights or filters to zero (Louizos et al., 2017;Wen et al., 2016;LeCun et al., 1990;Hassibi et al., 1993a;Str\u00f6m, 1997;Hassibi et al., 1993b;See et al., 2016;Narang et al., 2017;Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Sanh et al., 2020).

            "text": "Pruning for Model Compression Pruning is a wellestablished method for reducing the complexity of overparameterized models in both computer vision and NLP (Le-Cun et al., 1989;Hassibi et al., 1993). It is typically classified into structured and unstructured pruning. Unstructured pruning removes individual weights and can achieve high compression rates in LLMs, particularly when paired with hardware accelerators like the Cerebras CS-3 (Lie, 2022;Thangarasa et al., 2024a) or Neural Magic DeepSparse (Neural Magic, 2021), which exploit sparsity for significant speedups. However, without specialized infrastructure, unstructured pruning can result in inefficient acceleration. Structured pruning, which removes entire channels, layers, or attention heads, is more effective in models with architectural redundancy, but can degrade model quality, especially in complex tasks which require multi-step reasoning (Kurtic et al., 2023;Ma et al., 2023;Sun et al., 2024). \n\nTo address these challenges, several metrics have been developed to guide pruning decisions more effectively. For instance, Shortened Llama (Kim et al., 2024) demonstrated that depth pruning (removing layers) can be as effective as width pruning (removing units within layers), or even a combination of both. The Block Influence (BI) score (Men et al., 2024), applied in Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), measures block importance by evaluating changes in hidden state magnitudes. Additionally, the angular cosine similarity metric (Gromov et al., 2024) identifies layers with redundant activations, allowing for selective pruning in models such as Llama-2 and Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023). Gromov et al. (2024) also proposed a healing method using low-rank adapters (Hu et al., 2022) to recover lost quality.",

            "text": "Traditional pruning techniques are a type of model compression that aim to decrease the number of parameters in a model (Zhu et al., 2023). There have been several studies conducted on this topic, both in the era of pretrained language models and before (Hubara et al., 2021;Mozer and Smolensky, 1988;Han et al., 2015a;Lin et al., 2019). However, progress in these studies has been relatively slow in the era of large language models, as pruning requires a substantial amount of data for fine-tuning, which is not feasible for such models. To tackle this issue, LORA fine-tuning was proposed by Ma et al. (2023) to restore the original performance. Recently, some studies have shifted their focus to pruning methods that do not necessitate fine-tuning. For instance, SparseGPT (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023) utilizes the Hessian matrix for pruning and reduces reconstruction error through subsequent weight updates. Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) combines weight magnitudes with input activations to retain parameters that better align with the current data distribution. DSOT (Zhang et al., 2023c) proposes a parameter adjustment method to minimize the discrepancy between the source model parameters and the pruned model parameters. OWL (Yin et al., 2023) introduces nonuniform layered sparsity, which is advantageous for higher pruning rates.",

However, there are challenges such as immense memory usage as well as their implementation, especially when we consider their implementation on resource-constrained edge/embedded devices due to their considerable size and computational demands [3]. Pruning and quantization are effective techniques for compression and optimization of machine learning models especially in the domain of NLP where the ultimate goal is to implement these systems/models on the edge/embedded devices. These techniques involve removal of redundant connections to achieve reduced model size, and reduction of memory along with computational requirements by reducing the precision of model weights and activation functions, respectively [4], [5]. \n\nIn this paper, pruning and quantization techniques designed for NLP models are explored. A detailed summary of the current literature is provided, highlighting the main ideas, methodologies, and empirical findings. By gaining knowledge of the advantages and drawbacks of these techniques, NLP developers and practitioners can make well-informed choices when creating and improving their models. At the outset, the basic principles of pruning and quantization of NLP models will be explained. The reasons why these techniques are employed and the advantages they can offer will be delved into. Then, the latest pruning techniques, both structured and unstructured, will be examined to explore how they can be utilized in various NLP-specific neural networks as well as in transformer networks. After discussing pruning, quantization techniques for NLP models will be explored. Different quantization methods, including traditional fixedpoint quantization, neural network-based quantization, and adaptive quantization, will be covered. Furthermore, we will examine the challenges and compromises faced during quantization within the realm of NLP. \n\nThroughout the paper, the focus is on the factual outcomes presented in the existing research, which offers valuable information about the success rate of pruning and quantization methods used in various NLP downstream tasks.",

            "text": "Despite the superior performance, it is challenging to deploy foundation models or large language models (LLMs) due to their massive parameters and computations. While pruning is a promising technique to reduce model size and accelerate the inference, the traditional pruning techniques can hardly be applied for LLMs as they need to finetune the model on the full dataset with multiple epochs consuming massive data and hardware resources. To deal with this problem, post-training pruning methods are proposed to prune LLMs in one-shot without retraining. However, their accuracy after pruning may suffer from certain performance degradation due to the lack of retraining with massive data. To address this issue, in this paper, we first formulate the post-training problem for layer-wise LLM compression to simultaneously prune multiple weights in LLMs. Next, we provide an optimal solution for this problem and design our post-training pruning algorithm for both unstructured and semi-structured sparsity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods in comparison to SOTA baselines across various LLM families including transformer-based LLMs and Mamba-based LLMs. Code link: https://github.com/piuzha/APT",

            "text": "Large language models (Brown et al., 2020;OpenAI, 2023) have recently reshaped the field of NLP with their remarkable performance across a range of complex language benchmarks (Bommarito & Katz, 2022;Wei et al., 2022a;Bubeck et al., 2023). However, these models, with their billions of parameters, usually require significant computational resources. To democratize LLMs, considerable efforts have been taken to mitigate their high computational cost. Many of the notable advancements to date have centered on model quantization, a process where parameters are quantized into lower bit-level representations. The fast pace of LLM quantization research (Dettmers et al., 2022;Frantar et al., 2023a;Xiao et al., 2023;Ahmadian et al., 2023) has led to substantial resource savings for these models (Sheng et al., 2023;Lin et al., 2023). \n\nNetwork pruning (LeCun et al., 1989;Hassibi et al., 1993;Han et al., 2015), on the other hand, shrinks network sizes by removing specific weights from the model -essentially setting them to zero. Along with quantization, it is often considered another popular approach for compressing neural networks. However, it has received relatively little focus in compressing LLMs. This seems to contradict the trend of model compression in the pre-LLM era, where both approaches have received large amounts of research effort. A quick review of existing pruning methods reveals a possible reason: they typically require retraining (Liu et al., 2019;Blalock et al., 2020), training from random initializations (Zhu & Gupta, 2017;Louizos et al., 2018;Gale et al., 2019) or even an extensive iterative process (Frankle & Michael, 2019;Renda et al., 2020). The sheer amount of computational resources required by LLMs limits these methods. A recent LLM pruning approach, SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023), does not require traditional retraining, but still demands a computationally intensive weight update process.",

            "text": "Large Language Model Compression. LLM compression methods aim to make LLMs more efficient for deployment (Wan et al., 2023;Zhu et al., 2023). Common techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation, and low-rank decomposition. Quantization reduces the precision of model weights and activations, thereby decreasing memory usage and computational load. (Dettmers et al., 2022;Kim et al., 2024;Shen et al., 2024;Lin et al., 2024). Pruning involves removing less significant weights or neurons from the model to create a sparser architecture. However, pruning often necessitates retraining to recover potential performance degradation (Ma et al., 2023;Ashkboos et al., 2024;Zhong et al., 2024a;Hsieh et al., 2023). Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a large \"teacher\" model to a smaller \"student\" model by training the latter to replicate the former's outputs. This approach enables the student model to achieve performance comparable to the teacher model while being more efficient (Zhong et al., 2024b;Muralidharan et al., 2024;Hsieh et al., 2023). Low-rank decomposition compresses weight matrices by factorizing them into smaller, computationally efficient components (Hsu et al., 2022;Yuan et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024). \n\nLow-rank Decomposition Compression. A significant portion of existing low-rank compression techniques (Li et al., 2023;Noach and Goldberg, 2020;Chen et al., 2023;Hsu et al., 2022;Yuan et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024) relies on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (Stewart, 1993;Wall et al., 2003) to factorize and compress model parameters. Although original SVD (Stewart, 1993;Wall et al., 2003) decomposes weight matrices into lower-rank components for reconstruction, its objective may lead to information loss if not tailored for downstream tasks. Improved SVD-based methods address these limitations.",

However, preserving performance while compressing models remains challenging. \n\nBlock pruning is a straightforward compression approach for reducing LLM size, motivated by the layer redundancy found in LLM architectures (Men et al., 2024;Dumitru et al., 2024;Chen et al., 2025). While detecting redundant or unimportant blocks can minimize performance degradation from pruning, some loss is inevitable. Although post-finetuning can help recover performance, simultaneous pruning of multiple blocks may still cause unrecoverable damage. One possible solution is to take an iterative approach. Muralidharan et al., 2024 proposes iterative pruning with knowledge distillation to recover from performance loss. This work successfully compresses a 15B LLM into smaller 8B and 4B versions, achieving competitive results compared to other LLMs of similar size. However, this approach may be impractical for those with limited computational resources, as it employs a computedependent method in the pruning process and requires 8T tokens for the recovery process. \n\nThis leads us to ask: Can we develop an exhustive, efficient and effective iterative block pruning method for model compression? We investigate this question by introducing IteRABRe, a straightforward iterative pruning approach. We choose layer pruning for its simplicity and enhanced interpretability in preservation. To test efficiency, we perform recovery using only 2.5M tokens of data. Our method outperforms other baselines by approximately 3% on average for Llama3.1-8B and Qwen2.5-7B models. Furthermore, our approach shows particular strength in preserving linguistic tasks, demonstrating 5% better performance than arXiv:2503.06291v1 [cs.CL] 8 Mar 2025 baselines. Additionally, this approach also exhibits zero-shot cross-lingual capabilities, such as retaining the German language using solely English data recovery.",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) trained using vast corpora have delivered remarkable advances across a variety of domains and tasks (Touvron et al., 2023a;Jiang et al., 2023;Mesnard et al., 2024). However, they demand extensive computational resources for inference (Wu et al., 2022;Luccioni et al., 2023), presenting a limiting factor for their practical use. Consequently, this has prompted the development of an extensive collection of methods to improve inference efficiency (Treviso et al., 2023). In particular, model compression aims to reduce the size of a model while retaining downstream task performance (Wan et al., 2024). \n\nQuantization and pruning have emerged as prominent model compression approaches for LLMs (Gholami et al., 2021;Wan et al., 2024). Pruning removes less important weights from the model, while quantization represents the weights (and possibly activations) using fewer bits. Both quantization and pruning can be effectively applied in a post-training setting, retaining comparable performance across a range of downstream tasks (Frantar et al., 2023;Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2024;Lin et al., 2024). \n\nPost-training quantization and pruning typically depend upon calibration data, a small set of unlabeled examples (Nagel et al., 2020;Hubara et al., 2021) used to generate layer activations throughout the model. Conventionally, LLM calibration data consists of randomly sampled web text (Frantar et al., 2023;Sun et al., 2024;Lin et al., 2024), aiming to reflect the model training data distribution. \n\nHowever, recent work has questioned the influence of calibration data in LLM compression. Jaiswal et al. (2024) hint that the careful selection of calibration data may benefit high-sparsity pruning. Concurrently, Williams and Aletras (2024) illustrate the impact of calibration data in quantization and pruning.",

One-shot pruning techniques offer a way to alleviate these burdens by removing redundant weights without the need for retraining.

In this paper, we introduce ALPS, an optimization-based framework that tackles the pruning problem using the operator splitting technique and a preconditioned conjugate gradient-based post-processing step. Our approach incorporates novel techniques to accelerate and theoretically guarantee convergence while leveraging vectorization and GPU parallelism for efficiency. ALPS substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the pruning objective and perplexity reduction, particularly for highly sparse models. On the OPT-30B model with 70% sparsity, ALPS achieves a 13% reduction in test perplexity on the WikiText dataset and a 19% improvement in zero-shot benchmark performance compared to existing methods.",

Despite their successes, LLMs like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023;Brown et al., 2020) possess hundreds of billions of parameters that entail enormous computational cost by design. Traditional model compression methods such as Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), Pruning (Michel et al., 2019;Zhu and Gupta, 2017), and Quantization (Shen et al., 2020;Gupta et al., 2015) have focused on creating lighter models either by shrinking the architectural size or by reducing the number of FLOPs. \n\nRecently, LLMs have been shown to produce impressive performance on inputs that have been carefully designed to contain all the necessary information for a given instruction. As such, there is an increasing trend in designing longer and longer prompts that has led to a significant rise in computational cost. To address this, interest has grown in compressing the input sequences from the tokenizer (Gee et al., 2022;Mu et al., 2023;Petrov et al., 2023). Indeed, various works have shown the importance of tokenization in determining the length of a sequence in specialized domains (Gee et al., 2022) or on underrepresented languages (Petrov et al., 2023). \n\nIn this paper, we propose a method for reducing the computational cost of a LLM by compressing the textual inputs using Multi-Word Tokenizers (MWTs). To achieves this, we enrich the vocabulary of the tokenizer with statistically determined multi-word expressions. By encoding the frequent n-grams with single tokens, the sequences produced are both shorter and more informative, thus allowing for major speedups via early sequence truncation. Additionally, MWTs are shown to be compatible with the aforementioned traditional compression methods. Experimentally, we assess MWTs on three text classification datasets.",

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the best and simplest solution for achieving state-ofthe-art results in many natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, the increasing use of neural networks (NNs) and transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) has resulted in a rise in computational cost due to the complexity of arithmetic calculations, larger matrices and the addition of more layers. Consequently, the weight and structure of these models become more complex, requiring high demands in computation and memory. \n\nOne of the best approaches to address the overwhelming size of LLMs is to reduce their resources through pruning algorithms. These algorithms can eliminate parameters or entire components in a NN, making it lighter without compromising its original performance. Pruning algorithms emerged in parallel with the earliest use of NNs (Mozer and Smolensky, 1989;Janowsky, 1989;LeCun et al., 1989), but they have gained significant importance in the last decade due to the widespread use of these networks in various fields. There are many pruning algorithms in literature (Blalock et al., 2020), each with a unique approach or adapted old algorithms for these new architectures (Benbaki et al., 2023). However, the complexity of neural networks can pose a challenge when creating pruning algorithms, as these may require new complex theorems to make the models lightweight (Dong et al., 2017;Malach et al., 2020). Additionally, existing pruning algorithms often exhibit shortcomings in their completeness (Blalock et al., 2020) and fail to consider a critical aspect: the efficient storage of the pruned result. Some algorithms compress models at runtime but lack mechanisms to preserve the reduced NN for future use. Consequently, most algorithms prioritize the speed of reduction and execution, neglecting this critical final stage essential in resource-limited environments (Yang et al., 2017;Sze et al., 2017). This paper presents KEN (Kernel density Estimator for Neural network compression): a universal, simple, magnitude-based transformer pruning algorithm that leverages Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for parameter pruning.",

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) with their remarkable performance. However, their colossal size and computational demands necessitate effective Model Compression (MC) techniques for practical use. In the case of multilingual LLMs, the vast size is crucial for retaining information from various languages and mitigating the curse of multilinguality (Conneau et al., 2020;Goyal et al., 2021). Moreover, wide language coverage and interference among languages pose a harder challenge for compressing multilingual LLMs. \n\nExisting approaches for MC have predominantly focused on model quantization (Frantar et al., 2023;Dettmers et al., 2022;Xiao et al., 2023;Yao et al., 2022), where model parameters are mapped to lower bit-level representations, and network pruning, which reduces the size of neural networks by eliminating unnecessary connections. Inspired by the classic Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) and Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) pruning framework (Hassibi et al., 1993;Le Cun et al., 1989), various approaches, namely GPTQ (Frantar et al., 2023) for model quantization, SparseGPT (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023) and Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) for network pruning, have been proposed to compress \u2020Lu Chen and Kai Yu are the corresponding authors. \n\nLLMs. These compression methods utilize a calibration dataset to determine the priority of parameters and thus are retraining-free, avoiding expensive fine-tuning cost especially for LLMs. \n\nHowever, neither of these methods has considered the multilingual scenario: all of them use a single-language (e.g., English) calibration dataset to determine the priority of parameters for multilingual models. A significant performance drop on multilingual tasks is observed due to this Englishcentric approach, especially in the case of lowresource languages.",

This approach enables rapid pruning on a single GPU with minimal accuracy loss, achieving 50-60% on large models. \n\n\u2022 Wanda (Sun et al., 2023): is another popular method for pruning large language models that relies on a pruning metric that combines a weight's magnitude with the norm of its corresponding input activations, determined from a small calibration dataset. The method focuses on selectively pruning weights within individual outputs of linear layers, aiming for high sparsity levels without modifying unpruned weights.

            "text": "How can we accurately compress pretrained encoder-based language models without retraining? Transformer-based PLMs dominate (Devlin et al., 2019;Clark et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2019;Brown et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2022) the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) based on their remarkable performance. The superiority of PLMs comes with a massive increase in their size, and the unaffordably scaled models necessitate compression algorithms that effectively reduce the size of PLMs without compromising accuracy. \n\nRetraining-free structured pruning algorithms (Kwon et al., 2022b;Nova et al., 2023) are prominent for compressing pretrained language models (PLMs) since they require dramatically lower computational costs and a smaller amount of data than existing retraining-based algorithms (Hou et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2021;Lin et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020b;Sajjad et al., 2023;Xia et al., 2022;Lagunas et al., 2021). Retraining-free algorithms achieve remarkable efficiency by replacing an expensive retraining process with a one-shot mask search process followed by a lightweight mask-tuning process. However, when it comes to the high compression rate, retraining-free algorithms exhibit severe accuracy degradation. The accuracy degradation comes from a failure of handling pruning errors which represent the distortion of the model's prediction by the accumulated deformations of the outputs of the pruned intermediate layers. \n\nIn this paper, we propose K-prune (Knowledge-preserving pruning), an accurate retraining-free structured pruning algorithm for encoder-based PLMs. We conceptualize pruning error as the loss of useful knowledge to explicitly measure the amount of pruning error. We observe that the main reason of severe accuracy degradation in previous retraining-free pruning algorithms is an unrecoverable knowledge loss from multiple layers. Therefore, we carefully design an iterative pruning process that distributes the knowledge loss across multiple iterations to overcome the accuracy degradation problem.",

            "text": "A previously accurate model can \"break\" when compression is applied too heavily or broadly, resulting in low performance and nonsensical outputs. However, it can be challenging for users to determine which components of a model are causing its performance to degrade after compression (Sec. 6.2.2). We demonstrate how COMPRESS AND COM-PARE can help practitioners identify and resolve breakages (C4) in the context of a generative language model for question answering. \n\nWe use an off-the-shelf T5-Large model [46] that achieves an F1 score of 90.5% on the Stanford Question Answering dataset [47] (Fig. 6A). The model's original performance is competitive with humans', but since the model is large (775 million parameters), we'd like to compress it to improve its speed and space utilization. Following common compression workflows from our participants (Sec. 6.2) and the literature (Sec. 2), we apply magnitude pruning across all of the model's parameters. However, this causes steep performance drops even at low levels of compression (e.g., 4% F1 after pruning only 10% of parameters). Looking at the top changes in predicted answers in the Behaviors view (Fig. 6B), we see that magnitude pruning has broken the model's generation. The 10% pruned model repeats words from the context paragraph (e.g., \"Super Bowl LII LII LII ...\"), and the 30% pruned model's output is meaningless (\"a a ...\"). \n\nCOMPRESS AND COMPARE can help us understand why magnitude pruning has negatively affected the model. There are many possible reasons this compression strategy could have failed -the model may have low compressibility, essential weights may have been inadvertently pruned, or magnitude pruning may not be well-suited to this task. Since it is challenging to determine the cause using performance alone, we use the Layers view to inspect parts of the model that have been pruned. Sorting the models' layers by how much their weights have changed, we see that the most changed layers are all normalization layers (Fig. 6C).",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) from the GPT family have demonstrated exceptional performances across a wide range of tasks. However, due to their large sizes and high computational costs, model deployment face new challenges upon GPU memory consumption as well as inference latency. Consequently, there's a prominent need to compress LLM models to a feasible range in order to make use of them in real applications. In the literature, there have been various mainstream model compression techniques available, for pre-trained models in particular, including knowledge distillation [1][2][3][4], model quantization [5][6][7][8][9], model sparsity pruning [10][11][12][13][14], and etc. \n\nKnowledge distillation focuses on transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model by predicting pseudolabels or leveraging the knowledge from intermediate hidden layers. This process enables the compact student model to achieve approximate accuracy comparable to that of the teacher model. Model quantization involves replacing high-precision floating-point parameters with lower-precision integer parameters, thereby reducing the model's storage capacity and inference latency. Quantization methods can be categorized into Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) [15] and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) [16] approaches. At present, 4-bit quantization [6] and mixed-precision quantization [9] techniques are able to reduce memory cost of each weight element from 16-bit as a float point number to equivalently 3-4 bits. \n\nIn addition, Model sparsity pruning method mainly involves removing network elements by individual weights (unstructured pruning) or by entire rows and columns of weight matrices (structured pruning). Pruning can also be applied to various parts of the model, including entire layers [17], heads, intermediate dimensions [18], and blocks of weight matrices [19]. The study of model pruning emerged since the 1980s' [20][21][22], and it has demonstrated favorable outcomes across Computer Vision and NLP tasks.",

            "text": "The compression of language models has gained significant attention, leading to the development of various methods, including network pruning 12 , knowledge distillation, and quantization 13 . LLM-Pruner 14 and FLAP 15 aim to reduce network width by pruning coupled structures. Sheared-LLaMA 16 takes a more comprehensive approach, reducing network width and depth by removing entire layers. While methods that address both width and depth aspects exist 17,18 , there is still a need for in-depth analysis comparing the impact of these factors on LLM inference efficiency. Applying traditional pruning techniques to LLMs presents unique challenges due to their vast number of parameters and substantial computational requirements 19 . Pruning methods for LLMs can be broadly categorized into unstructured and structured approaches. \n\nStructured pruning methods 20 focus on removing entire groups of parameters, maintaining dense weight matrices, and improving hardware efficiency. Techniques such as LLM-Pruner 14 and LoRAPrune 11 emphasize efficient deployment and inference acceleration. Sheared-LLaMA 16 aims to prune models to a target architecture and train them dynamically. The work of Tao introduces a novel compression technique called QuantGPT. This method focused on quantization and module adaptation, allowing for systematic compression while maintaining the integrity of the model's architecture and performance 25 . LightPAFF focuses on transferring knowledge from a more prominent (teacher) model to a smaller (student) model. This process inherently involves structuring the model to retain important features learned by the teacher rather than simply removing individual weights, as seen in unstructured pruning 21 . Unstructured pruning methods 22 target individual weights, maintaining performance. Notable examples include SparseGPT 23 , which employs sophisticated weight updates and pruning without retraining. Edalati et al. developed KnGPT2 for compressing the linear mappings of the GPT-2 model, focusing on reducing the number of parameters flexibly without drastically altering the overall architecture. This technique allows for representing weight matrices in a more compact form while maintaining performance, which aligns with the characteristics of unstructured pruning 24 . \n\nStructure pruning typically removes entire groups of parameters, such as whole neurons, channels, or even layers, which can limit its flexibility 25 .",

Consequently, many conventional model compression techniques have become infeasible for LLMs (Frantar and Alistarh 2023). For instance, knowledge distillation (Hinton, Vinyals, and Dean 2015), once a practical approach, now faces implementation challenges due to high training costs. Existing compression methods for LLMs mainly include post-training quantization (Dettmers et al. 2022;Xiao et al. 2023;Frantar et al. 2023;Dettmers et al. 2023) andpost-training pruning (Sun et al. 2023;Frantar and Alistarh 2023). Our method also falls into the category of post-training pruning. It utilizes bias compensation to recover model performance, effectively avoiding the high computational cost of retraining. Unlike the past posttraining pruning methods, our method is designed for the features of structured pruning of LLMs.",

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, sentiment classification, machine translation, and question answering. The success of LLMs, such as GPT-3 and 4 (Achiam et al., 2023), BERT (Devlin, 2018), and LLaMA families (Touvron et al., 2023), has been a key milestone in the development of AI. These models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to understand and generate human-like text, significantly improving applications in various industries, including healthcare, finance, customer support, and content creation. The advancements made by LLMs are not only transformative for the AI community but also promising in improving productivity, enabling new technologies, and improving decision making in many sectors. \n\nHowever, despite their extraordinary capabilities, LLMs come with a clear drawback-high computational cost during inference. Deploying these models for inference is 1 Fudan University 2 University of Bristol. \n\nPreliminary work. Under review by the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). Do not distribute. resource-intensive, requiring substantial memory and processing power. This results in high energy consumption, making it difficult for those with limited resources to fully leverage these models for practical applications. \n\nGiven the high costs associated with LLMs, reducing the computational burden while preserving their performance is critical. \n\nTo address this challenge, model pruning (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2024) is an effective way of accelerating LLMs. It involves removing unnecessary weights or neurons from the model, thereby reducing its size and computational cost. Based on the granularity of the components being removed, pruning methods can be categorized as structured and unstructured pruning. Structured pruning removes entire components of the model, such as attention heads, channels, or even layers, resulting in a smaller and more efficient architecture. This approach is easier to implement on hardware since it reduces the overall computational graph. Unstructured pruning, on the other hand, operates at the individual weight level, selectively removing parameters that contribute the least to the model's performance.",

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks, including language modeling, understanding, and generation. However, the increased memory and computational costs associated with these models pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-limited devices. Structural pruning has emerged as a promising solution to reduce the costs of LLMs without requiring post-processing steps. Prior structural pruning methods either follow the dependence of structures at the cost of limiting flexibility, or introduce non-trivial additional parameters by incorporating different projection matrices. In this work, we propose a novel approach that relaxes the constraint imposed by regular structural pruning methods and eliminates the structural dependence along the embedding dimension. Our dimension-independent structural pruning method offers several benefits. Firstly, our method enables different blocks to utilize different subsets of the feature maps. Secondly, by removing structural dependence, we facilitate each block to possess varying widths along its input and output dimensions, thereby significantly enhancing the flexibility of structural pruning. We evaluate our method on various LLMs, including OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA-2, Phi-1.5, and Phi-2. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, showing for the first time that structural pruning can achieve an accuracy similar to semi-structural pruning.",

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Llama (Touvron et al., 2023b) and OPT (Zhang et al., 2022a), have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks (Touvron et al., 2023a;Zhang et al., 2022a;Scao et al., 2022;Chowdhery et al., 2023;Thoppilan et al., 2022;Zeng et al., 2023;Chowdhery et al., 2023). However, the success of these models comes at a significant computational cost. LLM consists of billions of parameters, requiring substantial memory, storage, and energy resources. This computational burden limits their deployment in resource-constrained environments. \n\nTo address these challenges, network pruning (LeCun et al., 1989) has emerged as a critical technique for optimizing LLMs by reducing their size while preserving their performance. Pruning involves selectively removing redundant or less important parameters (e.g., elements (Sun et al., 2024), channels (Ashkboos et al., 2024), or layers (Song et al., 2024)) from a pre-trained model, which enables faster inference and lower energy consumption. Importantly, pruning is feasible in LLMs because these models are often overparameterized, containing more parameters than necessary to achieve their performance. \n\nUnfortunately, existing pruning techniques still face different challenges. Element-wise pruning achieves the finest-grained pruning to obtain a quite high sparsity, e.g., 50%, but requires specific computation kernels and hardware support to accelerate the inference. Channel-wise pruning trades off the hardware efficiency and sparsity. However, the complex channel dependency increases the difficulty of determining the pruning channel, thus resulting in performance drops. Layer-wise pruning adopts heuristic algorithms to search the pruning pattern and maintain the hardware friendliness for faster inference. But it often fails to find the optimal pruning patterns.",

            "text": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown superior performance in various NLP applications. \n\nDespite their impressive success, these transformerbased models typically contain hundreds of millions of parameters. Massive model scale is becoming an increasing burden, preventing researchers from making full use of large-scale PLMs. According to a recent study, only 0.5% to 4% of research papers published at the recent five NLP conferences tend to adopt large PLMs (PLMs with over a billion parameters) (Ding et al., 2022). This suggests that the inefficiency of deploying large PLMs is hampering the development of NLP research. Therefore, compressing PLMs becomes an urgent and important problem. \n\nVarious model compression methods have been proposed, such as knowledge distillation (Jiao et al., 2020;Sanh et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2021;Passban et al., 2021), weight sharing (Lan et al., 2019), network pruning (Liang et al., 2021;Gordon et al., 2020;Li et al., 2021), and quantization (Tao et al., 2022;Zhang et al., 2020;Bai et al., 2021;Kim et al., 2021). Among these compression methods, quantization is a promising solution. The core idea of quantization is to use low bit precision to store weight and activation tensors, and use fixed-point arithmetic to speed up inference. There are some prior works on quantizing PLMs covering different strategies and granularities. However, these quantization methods generally neglect the characteristics of PLMs -the distinction between fine-tuning a model and training a model from scratch -but treat quantizing PLMs no different from quantizing regular neural networks. In other words, these methods are task-specific, which design customized quantization for PLMs. There are two main limitations: first, these task-specific methods need to conduct both quantization and fine-tuning for each downstream task, with the quantization being applied either during or after the fine-tuning stage, which is inefficient; Second, the number of trainable parameters are still very large during fine-tuning, which is computational expensive.",

This has led to the development of several pruning approaches for reducing model size, such as magnitude pruning (Han et al., 2015;Gale et al., 2019), movement pruning (fine-pruning) (Sanh et al., 2020), block movement pruning (Lagunas et al., 2021) and lottery ticket hypothesis for BERT (Chen et al., 2020). Although model pruning is effective at reducing the inference time after deployment, the actual pruning procedure is computationally intensive and unsuitable to be performed in resource-constrained settings. For example, BERT requires six iterations to reach 40% sparsity with Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP) -requiring training to convergence, pruning, and retraining to recover the lost accuracy (Chen et al., 2020(Chen et al., , 2021)). Recent work (Chen et al., 2021) attempts to decrease the training time by identifying structured winning tickets early in training but the implementation does not allow general application to other model pruning algorithms. \n\nIn contrast, we examine the problem of increasing the efficiency of model pruning techniques through the lens of reducing data requirements and thus ask the following questions -How much data is superfluous in fine-pruning language models for machine translation? Can we develop a metric for identifying the informative training examples and significantly prune training data to decrease the training time and memory requirements during language model pruning? \n\nIn this work, we develop a dataset pruning algorithm for efficient movement pruning of T5 language model (Raffel et al., 2020) on the task of neural machine translation (NMT) across two datasets, WMT16 En-Ro and En-Tr.

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) [7,34,35] have revolutionized not only the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) but also numerous real-world applications that affect everyday life. Their ability to generate coherent text, perform complex reasoning, and support a variety of conversational and decision-making tasks has led to widespread adoption in both research and industry. With the advent of increasingly autonomous systems [16,24,42], these models now assist with tasks ranging from content creation and translation to automated customer support and strategic decision making. \n\nDespite these impressive capabilities, LLMs are notorious for their substantial computational requirements [25]. The high memory footprint, extensive processing power, and significant energy consumption often preclude their deployment on devices with limited resources, such as mobile phones or embedded edge devices. In addition, the large-scale training of these models contributes to increased operational costs and a non-negligible environmental impact. Consequently, the drive to reduce the computational and storage demands of LLMs has become a central focus in the field. \n\nTo mitigate these computational challenges, a variety of approaches have been explored. One prominent strategy involves reducing the storage requirements of model weights through quantization [29,41]. Quantization techniques lower the numerical precision of weights and activations, resulting in reduced memory usage and accelerated inference speeds, often with minimal degradation in performance. Another effective approach is to remove unimportant weight parameters through pruning [27]. Pruning methods seek to eliminate redundancies in the network by removing weights that contribute little to overall model performance, thereby decreasing both the computational load and the inference latency. \n\nPruning techniques can be applied during training [37] or after the model has been fully trained, in what is known as posttraining pruning [3]. The latter approach is particularly appealing when the goal is to adapt a pre-trained model for deployment on resource-constrained devices, as the main challenge is not the training process but rather fitting the model into a limited hardware environment. Although some post-training pruning strategies involve costly retraining steps [2,43], previous studies [19,38] have demonstrated that a model can maintain a large fraction of its original performance even when up to 50% of its weights are pruned without any retraining.",

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling multitasking across diverse fields. However, their high computational demands result in significant environmental impacts, particularly in terms of energy and water consumption. This paper addresses these issues by proposing an innovative compression approach to reducing LLM sizes. We focus on compressing the internal transformer layers, which are critical contributors to LLMs\u2019 computational complexity. Our approach combines new mathematical and structural key methods for model compression. We begin by applying Forward Propagation Pruning (FPP) to compress the embedding and feed-forward layers, utilizing a weight freezing and zeroing technique for suspected unused parameters. This reduces the number of trainable parameters, accelerating the overall training process and enabling faster convergence. Second, the Weight Matrix Folding method is introduced to efficiently prune the self-attention layer matrices in a simple and efficient mathematical model. This method integrates Identical Row Compression (IRC) to optimize the compression of the Query and Key matrices, alongside Diagonal Weight Compression (DWC), which reformulates the Value matrix into a diagonal structure. Consequently, this technique significantly diminishes parameter variability across the three metrics, enhancing consistency and performance while simplifying complexity. The compression approach is evaluated on three language modeling datasets and eight widely used classification datasets, comparing it to various pruning methods. Our method successfully compresses transformer layers by 99% and linear layers by 70%, resulting in an overall model compression of around 70%, while maintaining nearly the same accuracy. Notably, with moderate compression rates of 20% to 40%, model performance not only remained stable but even improved. This leads to substantial reductions in memory usage and computational demands, making LLMs more resource-efficient and highlighting the potential to optimize them for a more sustainable AI future.",

To mitigate the poor generalization at high sparsity levels, we propose a self-regularization scheme where model prediction is regularized by the latest checkpoint with increasing sparsity throughout pruning.

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various NLP tasks and resulted in impressive user-facing demonstrations such as ChatGPT.2 However, their large size necessitates the use of enormous amounts of compute and memory at inference time, which limits their widespread use. \n\nTwo types of techniques have been explored to reduce the cost of model inference. The first is model compression including network pruning (Le-Cun et al., 1989;Han et al., 2015b;Frankle and Carbin, 2019), quantization (Han et al., 2016), knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), combinations of multiple methods (Xia et al., 2022). The  (Devlin et al., 2018) on the MNLI task (Williams et al., 2017). The sparsity for a CoFi's data point is labeled as s. The width of multiplexing for a DataMUX's data point is labeled as N . The parameter pair for a PruMUX's data point is labeled as (N , s). \n\nsecond is recently proposed data multiplexing (Murahari et al., 2023), which multiplexes multiple inputs into a single input for model inference. \n\nWhile both types of methods leverage the overparameterization effect (Allen- Zhu et al., 2019;Radhakrishnan et al., 2020) in modern deep neural networks to improve the throughput-to-compute cost ratio, the manner in which they do so is different. Model compression aims at reducing the number of parameters in the model, hence reducing the overall compute cost (denominator) to improve the ratio. Data multiplexing, on the other hand, compresses multiple inputs into one to improve throughput (numerator) while keeping the model size fixed. This observation naturally leads us to hypothesize that the two types of methods could be complementary and can be combined for maximal gain in the throughput-to-compute cost ratio. \n\nThere are two challenges to this hypothesis. The first is that both model compression and data multiplexing aim at trading a small accuracy loss for large throughput improvement.",

The work builds upon classic neural network compression approaches originating from the early 1990's that aim to find optimal pruning by expanding the curvature of the loss landscape. The method utilises modern Fisher approximations to scale accurate pruning to the realm of large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters, while remaining practical in both memory and compute. Unlike most prior work on data-based LLM compression, we not only use weight magnitude and activations from forward passes, but also use gradient information from backward passes to relate weight removal costs to the true final objective. We improve upon prior work through more accurate approximations to the loss landscape curvature and considering more weight correlations to update remaining weights. Increasing the number of correlations and using multiple shots allows us trading off additional compute for better accuracy. Lastly, LLM Surgeon gives the first practically usable results for structured pruning of LLMs and achieves state-of-the-art results in unstructured and semi-structured large language model pruning.",

We report test performance after 50 % (2:4) semi-structured compression on wikitext-2 data in table 3. We empirically find that considering more weight correlations results in improved final performance after compression. Our proposed LLM Surgeon is competitive with prior work outperforming all baselines in terms of test set perplexity (PPL). \n\nTable 3: Semi-structured 2:4 compression for large language models on wikitext-2 data. The proposed method can dynamically allocate sparsity across layers through global thresholds described in section 3.3. In Fig. 4.5, we compare total allocated sparsity levels per layer depth and per layer type after compressing a pretrained OPT-125m model. We find that the LLM Surgeon prunes relatively more in the first layer and less in middle layers. Further, we observe that a larger portions of weights are removed in fully-connected compared to attention blocks, but deviations are less compared to other methods. Dynamic allocation allows for most pruning where it hurts least.",

            "text": "Transformer-based (Vaswani et al., 2017) pretrained language models (PLMs) have achieved great success and become the backbones of various natural language processing tasks. However, PLMs are computationally expensive and slow in inference due to their large sizes, which limits their applications in real-world scenarios. Hence, a growing interest has been in developing compression and acceleration methodologies for PLMs.\n\nA common approach to model compression is structured pruning, which compresses the model by removing groups of consecutive parameters, namely the pruning units. In applying structured 1 Code is available at https://github.com/airaria/ GRAIN. pruning on PLMs, recent works have investigated removing units such as hidden dimensions in feedforward layers, attention heads in the multi-head attention (Michel et al., 2019;Li et al., 2022), and coarse-grained units such as multi-head attention layers and feed-forward layers (Xia et al., 2022). However, these pruning units only span a small space of model structures and limit the exploration for better structures. For example, in the pruning of BERT base (Devlin et al., 2019), which contains 144 attention heads, the possible choices of attention heads for the pruned model are limited. Block Pruning (Lagunas et al., 2021) extends pruning units by considering blocks in the weight matrices, but Block Pruning is not a fully structured pruning method and can not achieve large speedups.\n\nIn this work, we propose GRAIN (Gradientbased Intra-attention pruning), a structured pruning method that prunes PLMs with finer pruning units. In the following, we present the method from three aspects: pruning units, pruning algorithm, and training objectives. Pruning Units Unlike attention heads pruning where the pruning unit is a single head, we propose intra-attention pruning, which inspects and prunes the structures inside attention heads. Intra-attention pruning greatly expands the search space of model structures, making the resulting models more likely to find better structures. However, directly applying intra-attention pruning yields fragmented models, i.e.",

            "text": "The recent success of applying pretrained deep Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2017) on different NLP tasks (Devlin et al. 2019;Raffel et al. 2020;Le Scao et al. 2022) has raised concerns about its efficiency. The high computational cost also prevents these pretrained language models (PLMs) from being deployed in production . To address this problem, efficient inference refers to techniques that aim to make inference of an ML model faster (time-efficient), consume fewer computational resources (computation-efficient), less memory (memory-efficient) and less disk space (storageefficient). One popular class of techniques is model compression and acceleration, where a large and slow model is compressed to a lightweight model that can be stored with limited disk space on a mobile device, or accelerated to run with low latency (or both). Also, training a large model and then compressing it to a small one can be efficient for training and good for generalization (Li et al. 2020).\n\nIn addition to technical considerations, large models also raise environmental and ethical concerns (Bender et al. 2021). Large models have a high carbon footprint which a compressed model can reduce, potentially with little sacrifice in performance. Meanwhile, large models set obstacles for engineers and researchers from developing countries who cannot afford the necessary hardware for running the model (Bender et al. 2021). Thus, model compression and acceleration can be critical to make state-of-the-art NLP techniques more accessible and facilitate inclusiveness.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

We explore three aspects of the pruning frame work, namely criterion, method and scheduler, analyzing their contribution in terms of accuracy and inference speed. To the best of our knowledge, such in-depth analyses on large-scale recognition systems has not been reported in the literature. In addition, we propose a variant of low-rank approximation suitable for incrementally compressing models, and delivering multiple models with varied target sizes. Among other results, we show that a) data-driven pruning outperforms magnitude-driven in several scenarios; b) incremental pruning achieves higher accuracy compared to one-shot pruning, especially when targeting smaller sizes; and c) low-rank approximation presents the best trade-off between size reduction and inference speed-up for moderate compression.",

            "text": "Recent advances in hardware, modeling, and optimization for deep neural networks have enabled training of substantially larger models on massive amounts of unlabeled data, leading to corresponding improvements in accuracy across a variety of tasks in NLP (Devlin et al., 2019;Brown et al., 2020;Raffel et al., 2020). Unfortunately, this sudden increase in scale of state-of-the-art models also has adverse consequences, such as reducing equity of access (Yu, 2020;Ahmed and Wahed, 2020) and increasing computational and energy requirements (Strubell et al., 2019;Dodge et al., 2022). In response, model compression has emerged as a dominant approach to improving memory and inference efficiency in neural network models, including approaches such as knowledge distillation (Bucilu\u01ce et al., 2006;Hinton et al., 2014;Jiao et al., 2020), model quantization (Vanhoucke et al., 2011;Shen et al., 2020) and pruning (LeCun et al., 1989;Chen et al., 2020;Xia et al., 2022). \n\nThe vast majority of work on model compression focuses on methods for selecting how and where to reduce (via quantization or distillation) or remove (by pruning) model parameters without sacrificing end-task accuracy. While these approaches are usually simple to implement and work relatively well for maintaining overall accuracy on considered benchmarks, recent work has revealed that these commonly used compression methods can result in negative impacts on model behavior that are not necessarily captured by current performance met-rics. For example, in the field of computer vision, pruning has been shown to sacrifice performance on long-tail examples in order to preserve accuracy on more frequent phenomena (Hooker et al., 2020) and reduce robustness to out-of-distribution examples (Liebenwein et al., 2021). At the same time, it has also been shown that compression can sometimes have a regularizing effect, improving generalization in some settings (Ahia et al., 2021). Clearly, more work is needed better understand the relationship between compression and generalizability, and to develop improved compression methods that are informed by this knowledge.",

            "text": "Aghli and Ribeiro's work [16] pioneered the integration of weighted pruning and knowledge distillation, coordinating selective pruning on ResNet layers and subsequent distillation for enhanced model compression without loss of accuracy. Xie et al.'s study [17], ventures into the realm of person re-identification. Employing a sequence of pruning followed by knowledge distillation, they strike a balance between effective parameter reduction and accurate performance. Cui and Li, the architects of [18], unveil a complex model compression approach that combines structural pruning with dense knowledge distillation for large language models. Kim et al. [19] address the needs of edge devices with PQK, an innovative combination of pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. A structured progression of pruning, quantization, and distillation provides a comprehensive strategy for efficient edge-based model deployment. \n\nFinally, Wang et al. [20] introduce an innovative approach that combines structured pruning with multilevel distillation. By using pre-and post-pruning networks as teacherstudent pairs, they reduce the loss of accuracy through distillation and highlight the synergy between the two techniques. \n\nIn previous approaches, knowledge distillation is often used for fine-tuning after pruning. This involves using the pruned model as a learner and transferring knowledge from a larger model to modify it. However, this method does not lead to a significant increase in compression. Our approach takes strength from its flexibility and enables a more intelligent design that can increase the compression rate while maintaining or even increasing performance. \n\nHowever, starting with pruning before distilling knowledge has its drawbacks. This risks losing essential information that distillation can provide, limiting the depth of understanding. In addition, pruning may change the structure of the network, harm teacherstudent communication, and affect student learning. On the other hand, starting to distill knowledge before pruning has two clear advantages. First, the learner model takes advantage of advanced knowledge for efficient pruning and improved compression, while preserving important features. Second, distillation provides deep insight and enables finer pruning that preserves accuracy.",

Specifically, oBERTa extends existing work on pruning, knowledge distillation, and quantization and leverages frozen embeddings improves distillation and model initialization to deliver higher accuracy on a broad range of transfer tasks. In generating oBERTa, we explore how the highly optimized RoBERTa differs from the BERT for pruning during pre-training and finetuning. We find it less amenable to compression during fine-tuning. We explore the use of oBERTa on seven representative NLP tasks and find that the improved compression techniques allow a pruned oBERTa model to match the performance of BERTbase and exceed the performance of Prune OFA Large on the SQUAD V1.1 Question Answering dataset, despite being 8x and 2x, respectively faster in inference. We release our code, training regimes, and associated model for broad usage to encourage usage and experimentation",

            "text": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation (Zhang, Haddow, and Birch 2023;Sato et al. 2020), sentiment analysis (Zhang et al. 2023a;Deng et al. 2023), and speech recognition (Min and Wang 2023). Despite their impressive capabilities, the resource consumption required to obtain a fine-tuned model suitable for specific tasks remains substantial due to the large number of parameters and high computational demands of LLMs (Frantar and Alistarh 2023). To address these issues, various compression techniques, including pruning (Ma, Fang, and Wang 2023;Xia et al. 2023), quantization (Shao et al. 2023;Lee et al. 2023), anddistillation (Gu et al. 2023;Tan et al. 2023), have been proposed. These methods have shown that compressing large models can lead to better performance at a lower cost compared to direct training. \n\nCompared to methods that directly compress model parameters, another memory-efficient fine-tuning method is Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al. 2021), which can efficiently add additional knowledge while retaining the original model's capabilities. Previous works (Ma, Fang, and Wang 2023;Xia et al. 2023) have logically combined these two approaches. They first use structured pruning to remove less important parameters from the model and then apply LoRA fine-tuning to quickly recover performance. The resulting compressed model closely approximates the performance of the pre-pruned model. Recent studies, including QLoRA (Dettmers et al. 2024) and LoftQ (Li et al. 2023), have adopted quantization techniques during LoRA finetuning to further reduce memory consumption, but they have not combined these techniques with pruning. To achieve further memory savings by combining pruning and quantization in LoRA fine-tuning, one must address the suboptimality of using fixed configurations across all layers, as existing research (Zhang et al. 2023c) shows that layer importance varies.",

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020;Radford et al., 2019) are transformative for natural language understanding and generation (Suzgun et al., 2022;Zhou et al., 2023); however, their extensive parameter count leads to large memory footprints and longer inference times, making them expensive to execute. Model compression methods, such as sparsity and quantization, have shown promising results in reducing the inference costs of LLMs. However, these methods often require costly retraining on large amounts of data to restore the original model accuracy (Sanh et al., 2020;Park et al., 2018), while facing numerical and optimization stability challenges when dealing with quantized weights in quantization-aware-training (Gholami et al., 2022). \n\nTo address these issues, one-shot pruning methods have emerged, eliminating the need for the retraining. They achieve high accuracy using only a small set of calibration data. Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) (LeCun et al., 1989) pioneered the use of second-order information of the loss function for model compression (Singh & Alistarh, 2020;Mozaffari et al., 2023), though at a high computational cost. Subsequent methods like Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) (Hassibi et al., 1993) and modern approaches such as SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023) and WANDA (Sun et al., 2023) build on these ideas, and introduce computationally feasible alternatives for LLMs. While these methods perform well with unstructured sparsity, they struggle with semi-structured sparsity patterns like the NVIDIA 2:4 sparsity pattern (Mishra et al., 2021), which are necessary for hardware-accelerated inference. \n\nPost-training quantization (Rokh et al., 2023) methods are an effective compression strategy for reducing both memory usage and computation costs. SmoothQuant (Xiao et al., 2023) preserves accuracy by leaving the more salient weight channels unquantized, but this results in inefficient de-quantization during inference.",

The prevalence of high-quality open-source models, such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) and Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023), is exacerbating the trend of researchers from various fields being engaged. Particularly, with the scaling of language models, the emerging capabilities empower language models to be generalized across different fields with appropriate prompts. Nevertheless, scaling language models poses considerable challenges. In addition to the substantial hardware costs involved, the training of large language models necessitates complex distributed systems due to memory constraints. \n\nTo break through the bottlenecks posed by GPU memory and computational speed, a variety of techniques have emerged, with Quantization (Park et al., 2018;Dettmers et al., 2023;Lin et al., 2023;Shen et al., 2019;Yao et al., 2022) and Pruning (Jha et al., 2023;Xia et al., 2023;Ma et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2023;Sun et al., 2023;Frantar & Alistarh, 2023) being representatives, extensively researched for their commendable performance. These methods typically employ numerical approximations and other strategies to operate the target LLMs with minimal computational cost. However, to attain comparable performance, on the one hand, these techniques necessitate fine-tuning for calibration, and on the other hand, the ensuing fine-tuning may introduce bias towards the distribution of the additional datasets, thereby compromising the model's generalization capability. \n\nIs there an effective approach to compress model parameters without the need for additional data? Let us delve into this step by step. The weight parameters of existing language models are organized and contribute to fundamental operations in a matrix manner, which naturally inspires us to introduce matrix approximation for compressing model parameters. Notably, parameter compression based on matrix approximation is inherently well-grounded in a data-free context.",

However, despite high prediction accuracy and scalability of fine-tuning (Peters et al., 2018), the users have to suffer from a large computational Figure 1: NTK matrix approximation error of compression methods on the validation set of SST2. cost, both on time and space, due to the huge size of a pretrained language model: the sizes of popular PLMs recently increase from hundreds of millions (Brown et al., 2020) to trillion (Fedus et al., 2021) parameters. Even for the smallest BERT model (Devlin et al., 2018), there are over 110 million parameters. \n\nTo harness the large-scale PLMs, efforts have been made in various fields. A popular techniques in model compression is knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015, KD), which train a smaller student network with the information obtained from the original teacher model. KD serves to compress the pre-trained model and eases the subsequent fine-tuning on downstream tasks, while the distillation procedure requires comparable computational resources to pre-training. The burden is sometimes unbearable for users who cannot afford the cost of regular fine-tuning. \n\nIn addition to the directions above, there were some previous attempts to establish one-shot model compression methods. Single-shot pruning methods (Han et al., 2015;Lee et al., 2018;Wang et al., 2020a;Tanaka et al., 2020, sparsification) identify sub-networks at initialization concerning certain criteria of weight magnitude or gradient flow. However, most works on (entry-wise) pruning focuses on reducing the conceptual training or inference FLOPs, while sparse matrix multiplication is not well supported on modern hardware (e.g. GPUs) and even slows down the training in wall-clock time (Dao et al., 2022).",

However, the significant memory and computational costs incurred during the inference process make it challenging to deploy large models on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we investigate compression and efficient inference methods for large language models from an algorithmic perspective. Regarding taxonomy, similar to smaller models, compression and acceleration algorithms for large language models can still be categorized into quantization, pruning, distillation, compact architecture design, dynamic networks. However, Large language models have two prominent characteristics compared to smaller models: (1) Most of compression algorithms require finetuning or even retraining the model after compression. The most notable aspect of large models is the very high cost associated with model finetuning or training. Therefore, many algorithms for large models, such as quantization and pruning, start to explore tuning-free algorithms. (2) Large models emphasize versatility and generalization rather than performance on a single task. Hence, many algorithms, such as knowledge distillation, focus on how to preserving their versatility and generalization after compression. Since these two characteristics were not very pronounced in early large models, we further distinguish large language models into medium models and ``real'' large models. Additionally, we also provide an introduction to some mature frameworks for efficient inference of large models, which can support basic compression or acceleration algorithms, greatly facilitating model deployment for users.",

            "text": "Large language models based on Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) architectures, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2020) , and GPT models (Radford et al., Brown et al., 2020), have gained prominence in recent years for their remarkable state-of-the-art performance in various tasks related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). These works rely on deep networks with millions or even billions of parameters, and the availability of high computation and large storage capability plays a key role in their success. In this regard, there has been a proliferation of studies aimed at improving the efficiency of large language models, including knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015, Sanh et al., 2019, Jiao et al., 2020), quantization (Shen et al., 2020), low-rank factorization (Ben Noach and Goldberg, 2020), weight sharing (Lan et al., 2020), and weight pruning (Sanh et al., 2020, Xia et al., 2022) and dynamic accelerating (Xin et al., 2020, Goyal et al., 2020). \n\nPruning has emerged as a promising approach to compress and accelerate DNN models, significantly reducing storage and computational costs. Structured pruning method delivers a static compact model by removing structured blocks of weights, e.g. heads (Voita et al., 2019, Michel et al., 2019) and encoder layers (Fan et al., 2020). However, removing a large proportion of parameters may result in noticeable accuracy loss. To address this, the distillation paradigm is commonly adopted for recovery training, where the pruned model learns the knowledge delivered from the unpruned model. (Sanh et al., 2020) While these pruning methods achieve compelling results, they are static and have a fixed computation route for all inputs, regardless of the differing information redundancy of various sequences. \n\nAnother pruning approach that we consider in this paper is token pruning, a dynamic pruning method that reduces computation by progressively dropping unimportant tokens in the sequence, allocating adaptive computational budget to different samples.",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) have experienced rapid development in recent years, achieving surprising success in various domains. Researchers have been scaling up the size of language models to pursue better performance, just as the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020) suggests. However, the increasing size of models leads to massive computational costs, posing a challenge to practical deployment and usage. \n\nModel compression techniques have since been proposed as a solution to relieving computational stress, which would assist in the deployment of large models. Different approaches have been explored to compress language models into more compact versions, including quantization (Liu et al., 2021;Dettmers et al., 2022Dettmers et al., , 2024)), knowledge distillation (Gou et al., 2021;Gu et al., 2023;Ko et al., 2024) and pruning (Ma et al., 2023;Yang et al., 2024;Ashkboos et al., 2024;Men et al., 2024). \n\nRelevant research (Men et al., 2024) reveals that a fair portion of parameters in large language models are redundant, and removing these parameters would not bring severe damage to the performance of models. Based on the observation, different methods have been designed to identify and remove redundant parameters from LLMs, like layer merging (Yang et al., 2024), width compression (Ashkboos et al., 2024), layer removal (Men et al., 2024) and component removal (Ma et al., 2023). These methods maintain the majority of performance, proving the feasibility of model pruning. \n\nResearch on model interpretability has shown evidence that language models may develop internal representations for various features like color (Patel and Pavlick, 2022), truthfulness (Burns et al., 2022), chessboard states (Nanda et al., 2023), numbers (Zhu et al., 2024) or even abstract concepts like code errors (Templeton, 2024). These features typically start to form on middle layers and will be carried to subsequent layers (Stolfo et al., 2023).",

            "title": "LORD: Low Rank Decomposition Of Monolingual Code LLMs For One-Shot Compression",
            "text": "There is a growing interest in compressing pretrained Large Language Models. Several recent attempts have been dedicated to the quantization of weights of LLMs (Frantar et al., 2023;Lin et al., 2023;Yuan et al., 2023;Park et al., 2022;Kim et al., 2023b;Chee et al., 2023;Li et al., 2023a) with tricks such as outlier separation (Dettmers et al., 2022;Dettmers & Zettlemoyer, 2022;Dettmers et al., 2023c;Wei et al., 2022;Kim et al., 2023a;Lee et al., 2023). Some attempts also quantize the activations (intermediate representations) in addition to weights to speed up computation time (Shao et al., 2023;Xiao et al., 2023). The works in quantization that are closest to us is the Low-Rank Compensation (LoRC) Strategy (Yao et al., 2023;Wu et al., 2023), where the difference of the quantized matrix to the original matrix is approximated by a product of low-rank matrices. Our work decomposes the entire matrix for compression. \n\nPruning neural networks Liang et al. (2021), unlike quantization, reduces the number of parameters in a model by removing unimportant weights or connections. Several techniques have been proposed to scale pruning methods for LLMs (Sun et al., 2023a;Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Ma et al., 2023). However, pruning as a means of compression is yet to become viable due to no speedups over sparse matrices without significant performance drop at extreme levels of sparsity or structured sparsity (Zhu et al., 2023). With low-rank decomposition, we propose an alternate method for reducing model parameters that offer speedup even at a little reduction in parameter count. Certain works have also attempted to (Ren & Zhu, 2023;Li et al., 2023b) to split a dense matrix as a sum of lowrank matrices and a sparse matrix.",

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various NLP tasks. However, their massive computational costs limit their widespread use, particularly in real-time applications. Structured pruning offers an effective solution by compressing models and directly providing end-to-end speed improvements, regardless of the hardware environment. Meanwhile, different components of the model exhibit varying sensitivities towards pruning, calling for non-uniform model compression. However, a pruning method should not only identify a capable substructure, but also account for post-compression training. To this end, we propose DarwinLM, a method for training-aware structured pruning. DarwinLM builds upon an evolutionary search process, generating multiple offspring models in each generation through mutation, and selecting the fittest for survival. To assess the effect of post-training, we incorporate a lightweight, multistep training process within the offspring population, progressively increasing the number of tokens and eliminating poorly performing models in each selection stage. We validate our method through extensive experiments on Llama-2-7B, Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct, achieving state-of-the-art performance for structured pruning. For instance, DarwinLM surpasses ShearedLlama while requiring 5x less training data during post-compression training. Code is at: https://github.com/IST-DASLab/DarwinLM",

(2021) and experiment with the following model compression techniques in this study: Layer Pruning (Sajjad et al., 2022) is a simple yet effective strategy that discards a certain number of layers from transformer-based language models before fine-tuning the pruned models on downstream tasks. We apply the top-layer pruning strategy which deletes the top N encoder or decoder layers before the start of any training. Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) is a method that compresses deep neural network models by distilling useful knowledge from a larger model (teacher) to a smaller model (student). We follow Jiao et al. (2020) and distill smaller language models from larger ones such as BERT-large, before fine-tuning Text-to-SQL models on those distilled models. For WikiSQL and Spider, we experiment with the distilled English language models from MiniLM1 (Wang et al., 2020b), while for TableQA, we use the Chinese TinyBERT models2 . Token Pruning For PICARD model, We also apply token pruning (Goyal et al., 2020;Kim et al., 2022), which is a different pruning strategy that gradually removes redundant token encodings from the outputs of each encoder layer before feeding the reduced number of tokens to the next encoder layer. We follow Goyal et al. (2020) and implement an attention scoring mechanisms which weights the significance of each token by the sum of attention weights it gets from other tokens. The tokens with the lowest significance scores (based on predetermined thresholds) for each encoder layer are dropped.",

            "text": "Large pretrained transformer models have emerged as powerful tools for a variety of downstream natural language processing tasks, from natural language generation to question answering (Radford et al., 2019;Brown et al., 2020). These pretrained models have grown exponentially in size, often comprising hundreds of millions, or even billions, of parameters (Devlin et al., 2019;He et al., 2021;Lewis et al., 2019;Touvron et al., 2023). While their capabilities are undeniably impressive, the computational and storage requirements for such large models are becoming increasingly prohibitive (Strubell et al., 2020). \n\nScore-based pruning, a technique that involves removal of non-expressive parameters based on their importance score rankings, presents a promising avenue for model compression. It has the potential to significantly reduce model size with minimal impact on performance. Based on the definition of pruning scores, the pruning methods can be classified into distinct categories, such as magnitude-based (zeroth-order) pruning methods (Han et al., 2015a,b;Zhu and Gupta, 2017;Louizos et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2020) and sensitivity-based (higher-order) pruning methods (Molchanov et al., 2019;Ding et al., 2019;Sanh et al., 2020;Liang et al., 2021;Zhang et al., 2022;Kurtic et al., 2022;Li et al., 2023). On the other hand, if the classification is made based on the strategies employed, the methods fall into categories such as one-shot pruning (Lee et al., 2018;Frankle and Carbin, 2018;Chen et al., 2020;Liang et al., 2021;Zafrir et al., 2021) Sensitivity-Based Methods (Sanh et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2022;Kurtic et al., 2022;Li et al., 2023), which incorporate higher-order information, such as gradients and Hessian, to assess the impact of pruning on the loss function L. The first-order pruning methods utilize gradientbased information.",

            "title": "ShortGPT: Layers in Large Language Models are More Redundant Than You Expect",
            "text": "The field of large language models (LLMs) has witnessed rapid development recently, with LLMs achieving impressive performance across various domains. Guided by the scaling laws identified in prior work (Kaplan et al., 2020;Hoffmann et al., 2022), current LLM research tend to increase model parameters to boost performance. As a result, modern LLMs, which can comprise billions to trillions of parameters, require significant hardware resources for deployment, creating substantial barriers to their practical use. \n\nTo mitigate the hardware demands of large models, model compression techniques have become a critical area of focus (Zhu et al., 2023). These techniques are generally divided into quantization (Liu et al., 2021;Gholami et al., 2022;Dettmers et al., 2022;2024) and pruning (LeCun et al., 1989;Han et al., 2015;Frantar & Alistarh, 2023). Quantization reduces the precision of model parameters, but its effectiveness often requires specific hardware support. In contrast, pruning method removes redundant parameters to decrease the model's size and computation, offering a more flexible and hardware-agnostic approach. Despite its advantages, many existing pruning methods are complex; for example, some require gradient information (Ma et al., 2024), which limits their practicality. \n\nIn this paper, we focus on the issue of layer redundancy in LLMs and propose a novel approach for simplifying these models. We introduce Block Influence (BI), a metric that quantifies how much the hidden state changes after passing through each layer, providing a more direct measure of a layer's importance. Leveraging  yet effective pruning method ShortGPT, which identifies and removes layers with lower BI scores, significantly reducing model size without sacrificing much performance. \n\nTo evaluate our approach, we conducted evaluation across comprehensive benchmarks. Our experiments revealed that our method exhibits a smaller performance decrement compared to the previous methods. For instance, removing 10 layers (25% of the total 40 layers) from the LLaMA 2-13B model resulted in only a slight drop in performance on the MMLU benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2020), from 55.0 to 52.2.",

            "text": "In recent years, transformer-based (Vaswani et al., 2017) language models especially large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in the field of natural language processing, demonstrating exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks. However, the self-attention mechanism in LLMs leads to high inference costs. Previous work (Child et al., 2019;Beltagy et al., 2020;Bulatov et al., 2022;Zheng et al., 2022;Wu et al., 2022;Ding et al., 2023;Dai et al., 2019;Choromanski Figure 1: Compressing long contexts into short soft prompts (vectors in embedding space) to improve inference efficiency. et al., 2020;Borgeaud et al., 2022) has explored various approaches to reduce computational complexity by improving the self-attention mechanism of language models. Although these strategies mitigate the overhead of long context processing, they inevitably introduce modifications to the original structure of LLMs, potentially impacting the capabilities of the original model (Liu et al., 2024). \n\nTo better avoid modifications to the LLM structure, a more intuitive approach is to introduce a preliminary context compression process. These methods are based on a core assumption: most natural language texts contain redundant information, which makes context compression feasible. In early exploration, Mu et al. (2024) have attempted to compress the instructions into short soft prompts. This method offers a novel perspective but still has limitations in long context compression. Later works (Chevalier et al., 2023;Ge et al., 2024) aim to further extend compression abilities for document-level long contexts, and achieved considerable results. As illustrated in Figure 1, these methods design compression models to condense lengthy contexts into short, context-rich soft prompts, which then serve as substitutes for the original context when input into the LLM. However, these methods still suffer the issue of expensive time costs during the compression process. This limitation restricts their application in realtime compression scenarios, such as compressing retrieved (Guu et al., 2020;Lyu et al., 2024) or real-time Internet documents (Asai et al., 2023) immediately.",

            "text": "Pruning, a prevalent technique for model compression method, seeks to discard non-essential parameters within language models, thereby reducing computational and storage costs while maintaining performance [13], [31], [35]. Pruning methods can be broadly categorized into unstructured pruning, which removes individual weights, and structured pruning, which removes higher-granularity structures such as neurons, attention heads, or entire layers. Layer-wise pruning, a specific form of structured pruning, has been explored in several studies. Fan et al. (2019) [5] introduced LayerDrop, a structured dropout method that randomly drops layers during training to improve robustness to layer reduction at inference time. Additionally, several studies have investigated the disparities in representations across different layers, highlighting the significance of updating the last few layers for language models [12], [14], [18]. Building on this foundation, Peer et al. (2022) [22] and Sajjad et al. (2023) [24] aimed to identify and remove an optimal subset of layers directly from the pretrained models for use in downstream tasks. These works focus on pruning layers to reduce model size while preserving taskspecific performance within the standard fine-tuning paradigm. However, they do not explore the interaction between layer pruning and prompt-based fine-tuning, which is the focus of our work. \n\nRecent studies have explored the application of pruning techniques to large language models, such as Sheared LLMs [34] and SparseGPT [6], which aims to sparsify or prune LLMs for efficient inference. These methods often involve complex optimization strategies or require additional training steps [1], [4], [11]. In contrast, our approach is a simple top-layer pruning strategy that directly removes layers from LLMs and evaluates their performance in prompt-based fine-tuning scenarios. Unlike prior work, we quantitatively investigate the impact of layer pruning on LLMs in few-shot learning settings, demonstrating that even drastic reductions in layers can maintain or improve performance.",

Structured pruning is an effective method to balance model performance with efficiency, but performance restoration under computational resource constraints is a principal challenge in pruning LLMs. Therefore, we present a low-cost and fast structured pruning method for LLMs named SlimGPT based on the Optimal Brain Surgeon framework. We propose Batched Greedy Pruning for rapid and near-optimal pruning, which enhances the accuracy of head-wise pruning error estimation through grouped Cholesky decomposition and improves the pruning efficiency of FFN via Dynamic Group Size, thereby achieving approximate local optimal pruning results within one hour. Besides, we explore the limitations of layer-wise pruning from the perspective of error accumulation and propose Incremental Pruning Ratio, a non-uniform pruning strategy to reduce performance degradation. Experimental results on the LLaMA benchmark show that SlimGPT outperforms other methods and achieves state-of-the-art results.",

            "text": "T HE past decade has witnessed a revolution in the data processing paradigm due to the proliferation of machine learning techniques. However, many successful machine-learning approaches rely on training models with millions or even billions of parameters. For example, the popular convolutional model VGG16 [1] has about 10 8 parameters, and the powerful language model Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) [2], has a capacity of 175 billion parameters. This demand for computational resources and data makes the deployment of AI to mobile phones or smart devices challenging. To reduce computational Manuscript  loading, model compression [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] explores the low-dimensional structures of the learning models to efficiently compress the high-dimensional model weights.\n\nModel compression techniques can be categorized along many lines, including parameter quantization [3], [4], network pruning [5], [6], 1 regularization [7], [8], low-rank model compression [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], etc. Parameter quantization compresses the original network by reducing the number of bits required to represent each weight. However, this method can only achieve limited compression. Network pruning aims to remove redundant, non-informative weights in the models. A typical procedure of network pruning requires training a large, overparameterized model first, then pruning the trained large model into a sparse model according to a certain criterion. Although it can reduce the computation load during inference, the requirement of the large pre-trained model costs huge computational resources during training [5]. The 1 regularization method [8] imposes the 1 regularization of model weights to obtain a sparse model. Unlike classical network pruning, this method can support training from scratch, avoiding the computation of a pre-trained model. However, the resulting weight matrices of both network pruning and 1 regularization will be randomly sparse, making the datapath design very challenging [14]. Low-rank model compression aims to learn low-rank model weights and has the efficiency advantage in both compression and computation.",

            "text": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation (Zhang et al., 2023a;Sato et al., 2020), sentiment analysis (Zhang et al., 2023b;Deng et al., 2023), and speech recognition (Min and Wang, 2023). Despite their impressive capabilities, the resource consumption required to obtain a fine-tuned model suitable for specific tasks remains substantial due to the large number of parameters and high computational demands of LLMs (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023). To address these issues, various compression techniques, including pruning (Molchanov et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2018), quantization (Shao et al., 2023;Lee et al., 2023), and distillation (Gu et al., 2023;Tan et al., 2023), have been proposed. \n\nStructured pruning (Ma et al., 2023;Xia et al., 2023) is a widely used approach that reduces model size by removing less important parameters in a structured manner, preserving the overall architecture compatibility with hardware requirements. However, the disruption of computational graph uniformity and the removal of parameters can significantly reduce the accuracy of LLMs, which are inherently information-dense networks. To mitigate this degradation, fine-tuning is often used to recover the accuracy of pruned models. This finetuning step, while effective, is memory-intensive and presents substantial challenges in terms of resource consumption. \n\nTo further reduce memory usage during the finetuning and inference phases, we introduce quantization into the structured pruning framework. Specifically, after performing structured pruning, we quantize the pruned model and then apply different fine-tuning strategies. Quantization effectively reduces the bit-width of model parameters, thereby lowering the resource consumption during both fine-tuning and inference. However, integrating quantization with structured pruning introduces additional complexities.

However, their excessive overhead leads to large latency and computational costs. The statically compression methods allocate fixed computation to different samples, resulting in redundant computation. The dynamic token pruning method selectively shortens the sequences but are unable to change the model size and hardly achieve the speedups as static pruning. In this paper, we propose a model accelaration approaches for large language models that incorporates dynamic token downsampling and static pruning, optimized by the information bottleneck loss. Our model, Infor-Coef, achieves an 18x FLOPs speedup with an accuracy degradation of less than 8\\% compared to BERT.

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language tasks (OpenAI, 2023;Touvron et al., 2023;Thoppilan et al., 2022;Scao et al., 2022), but their substantial size poses deployment and inference challenges (Frantar et al., 2022). Techniques like model pruning (Molchanov et al., 2016), knowledge distillation (Jiao et al., 2019), and quantization (Dettmers    \u2020    et al., 2023) have been proposed to address computational demands. The exploration of LLM pruning, especially structured pruning (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023), holds great significance. Structured pruning reduces model size by removing coherent parameter groups, cutting inference costs on standard hardware. But it is more challenging than unstructured pruning in retaining the capabilities of LLMs (Hoefler et al., 2021). Existing methods either adopt data-efficient approaches, causing a performance decline (Ma et al., 2023), or require extensive posttraining to recover model performance (Xia et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate efficient methods to prune the model to higher sparsity without significant performance decline. \n\nKnowledge distillation (KD) aims to train a more compact student model with supervision from a larger teacher model (Sanh et al., 2019;Gou et al., 2021). It's widely adopted and proven highly effective in the field of LLMs. Progressive learning, utilizing intermediate teachers with a reduced gap in capabilities, has been demonstrated to improve performance in KD (Xiang et al., 2020). Previous work has shown that pruning with a distillation objective can improve performance (Xia et al., 2022). Distillation is particularly suitable for pruning since the full original model inherently serves as an excellent teacher for the pruned model (Sanh et al., 2020), which can offer a more detailed supervisory signal than conventional supervised training, enhancing the effectiveness of pruning with limited data (Lagunas et al., 2021). \n\nHowever, applying this method in the realm of LLMs proves challenging.",

Developers and third parties can now employ these trained models and create custom versions tailored to their particular applications. Customization makes these models applicable to a wider variety of use cases, but this, even more, highlights the need for efficient inference models. \n\nMany efforts have been being made to reduce computational cost through model compression techniques specialized for Transformers, including structured pruning (Xia et al., 2022; Proceedings of the 40 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. PMLR 202, 2023. Copyright 2023 by the author(s). Hou et al., 2020;Sajjad et al., 2023;Liu et al., 2021a;Xia et al., 2022), efficient architecture design (Kitaev et al., 2020;Iandola et al., 2020;Sun et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020b), neural architecture search (So et al., 2021;Xu et al., 2021;Yin et al., 2021), knowledge distillation (Sun et al., 2020;Jiao et al., 2019;Sanh et al., 2019), quantization (Kim et al., 2021;Shen et al., 2020;Zadeh et al., 2020;Zafrir et al., 2019), and hardware-software co-design (Gu et al., 2022;Ham et al., 2021). Among these techniques, structured pruning shows promising results in reducing model size, while also improving inference time because the resulting model remains compatible with the underlying hardware. However, most existing approaches are quite complex and require significant engineering effort to implement. Moreover, the process of compression is time-consuming and requires retraining the compressed model to regain accuracy. These limitations make effective compression difficult to realize in practice. Recently, Kwon et al. (2022) proposed a post-training pruning for Transformers that does not require any retraining of the model. Even though this approach avoids expensive retraining, it requires labeled data in the pruning pipeline.",

            "text": "Our primary aim was to identify layering configurations that reduce complexity while maintaining strong performance in terms of embedding similarity scores. Our experiments demonstrated that pruned SBERT models, with fewer layers, can achieve performance comparable to their fully layered counterparts. Thus with comparative scores obtained from pruned models we can conclude that pruned models have outperform models i.e. MahaBERT-Small and MahaBERT-Smaller, which are built from scratch. Therefore, instead of developing new models from the ground up, it is more effective to start with a larger model and apply pruning techniques. \n\nBy reducing computational demand and maintaining high-quality embeddings, our approach makes advanced NLP tools more accessible and operationally feasible, particularly for languages with fewer technological resources. \n\nThis work paves the way towards building efficient SBERT models through layer pruning, making it easier to deploy them effectively in real-world scenarios. Our findings support the increased utilization and advancement of NLP technologies in languages with limited resources, guaranteeing that advanced language processing tools can be used",

            "text": "Model compression: Model compression in machine learning (ML) refers to the process of reducing the size of an ML model while maintaining its performance as much as possible.Smaller models require fewer computational resources and usually have lower inference times, making them more efficient for deployment on resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices.\n\nPruning (Gorodkin et al., 1993) is a technique that removes a certain number of parameters of the model that has least effects to the performance.Generally speaking, pruning can be categorized as unstructured and structured pruning.In unstructured pruning, individual parameters can be removed.While for structured pruning, groups of parameters that are connected (weights of a kernel) are removed.Quantization (Hubara et al., 2018;Wang et al., 2022) reduces the precision of stored model weights or of intermediate activation maps (Eliassen and Selvan, 2024) from high to lower precision (32 bit to fewer, in modern computers).Quantization can yield large reductions in memory usage and inference time, and can be adapted to particular hardware devices for acceleration.\n\nWhile it is not always apparent as to which of the model compression methods should be used, some recent works have tried to characterize the difference in their performances.In (Kuzmin et al., 2024) an empirical comparison between the effectiveness of pruning and quantization was presented and in most settings quantization was reported to be better than pruning.\n\nIn addition to model pruning and quantization, knowledge distillation has shown potential in compressing large networks into smaller networks (Hinton et al., 2014).For large-scale models the gains of distillation are shown to be substantial, as observed with vision (Chen et al., 2017) and large language models (Sanh et al., 2019).\n\nAnother successful approach to compressing neural networks is tensor factorization of the model weights (Novikov et al., 2015).Techniques such as tensor trains (Oseledets, 2011) have been used to factorize weights of neural networks resulting in considerable reduction in the overall number of trainable parameters (Yin et al., 2021).",

            "text": "Pruning In early pruning methods like magnitude-based tuning, scalability is achieved but often at the cost of reduced effectiveness in large language models (LLMs) (Hagiwara, 1994;Han et al., 2015;Li et al., 2017;Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;van der Ouderaa et al., 2023). To improve  performance while managing computational demands, frameworks such as Optimal Brain Damage (LeCun et al., 1989) and Surgeon (Hassibi et al., 1993;Yu et al., 2022;van der Ouderaa et al., 2023) incorporate second-order loss information, necessitating substantial resources for Hessian calculations. Recent adaptations like WoodFisher (Singh & Alistarh, 2020), Kronecker factorization (Wang et al., 2019a;van der Ouderaa et al., 2023), and layer-wise compression (Dong et al., 2017;Frantar & Alistarh, 2022) aim to streamline these intensive methods. Concurrently, learnable parameters for pruning in vision and language models have been investigated (Liu et al., 2017;Huang & Wang, 2018;Xia et al., 2022), although these techniques generally demand significant computational resources for intensive backward propagation. Other approaches, such as feature-mimic-based methods (An et al., 2024;Ji et al., 2024), have not matched the performance of gradient-based methods like LLM Surgeon (van der Ouderaa et al., 2023). Alternatives like SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023), Wanda (Sun et al., 2024), and ZeroPruner (Dong et al., 2024), exploring unstructured and semi-structured pruning, offer scalability but often compromise runtime speed. Additional research has utilized layer importance scores for layer pruning and sparsity distribution, as demonstrated by ShortGPT (Men et al., 2024), OWL (Yin et al., 2023), LaCo (Yang et al., 2024), and others (Chen et al., 2024).",

            "text": "Scaling is an essential component for unlocking new capabilities and improved performance in large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020;Chowdhery et al., 2023;Touvron et al., 2023). However, the pursuit of scale has led to models that demand significant energy and computational resources (Strubell et al., 2019;Schwartz et al., 2020;Wu et al., 2022;Luccioni et al., 2023). Consequently, LLMs can be challenging to deploy, especially in resource-constrained environments (Dehghani et al., 2022;Menghani, 2023). These challenges have ultimately motivated a substantial body of research on model compression techniques, aiming to reduce computational demands while maintaining performance (Treviso et al., 2023). Quantization and pruning are two of the most popular model compression techniques (Gholami et al., 2021;Hoefler et al., 2021). Pruning aims to remove redundant weights, while quantization seeks to represent weights (and possibly activations) in lower precision. Most recently, several quantization and pruning methods have demonstrated outstanding performance in a post-training setting (Frantar et al., 2023;Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Dettmers et al., 2024;Sun et al., 2024). \n\nPost-training compression techniques rely upon calibration data (Nagel et al., 2020;Hubara et al., 2021) to determine the distribution of layer activations. This process requires only a small number of examples, with further examples offering diminishing gains (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2024). In the case of LLMs, the calibration set is routinely sampled from web text (Frantar et al., 2023;Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2024) or model pre-training data (Xiao et al., 2023;Dettmers et al., 2024). Notably, the calibration examples are sampled randomly.",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, but their high computational and memory demands pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Binarization, as an efficient compression method that reduces model weights to just 1 bit, significantly lowers both computational and memory requirements. Despite this, the binarized LLM still contains redundancy, which can be further compressed. Semi-structured pruning provides a promising approach to achieve this, which offers a better trade-off between model performance and hardware efficiency. However, simply combining binarization with semi-structured pruning can lead to a significant performance drop. To address this issue, we propose a Progressive Binarization with Semi-Structured Pruning (PBS$^2$P) method for LLM compression. We first propose a Stepwise semi-structured Pruning with Binarization Optimization (SPBO). Our optimization strategy significantly reduces the total error caused by pruning and binarization, even below that of the no-pruning scenario. Furthermore, we design a Coarse-to-Fine Search (CFS) method to select pruning elements more effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PBS$^2$P achieves superior accuracy across various LLM families and evaluation metrics, noticeably outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) binary PTQ methods.

            "text": "Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), the massive size poses significant deployment challenges, particularly on resource-constrained hardware. While existing LLM compression methods focus on quantization, pruning remains relatively unexplored due to the high cost of training-based approaches and data collection challenges. One-shot pruning methods, although cost-effective and data-free, have become dominant in LLM pruning, but lead to performance decline under the structured pruning setting. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm for structurally pruning LLMs, called Compresso. Our approach, through the collaboration of the proposed resource-efficient pruning algorithm and the LLM itself, learns optimal pruning decisions during the training process. Compresso addresses the challenges of expensive training costs and data collection by incorporating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the $L_0$ regularization during the instruction tuning process. Then, we further augment the pruning algorithm by introducing a collaborative prompt that fosters collaboration between the LLM and the pruning algorithm, significantly boosting the overall performance. To this end, Compresso prunes LLaMA-7B to 5.4B, maintaining original performance and even surpassing LLaMA-7B in reading comprehension by 2.62%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Compresso significantly outperforms one-shot pruning baselines across various sparsity ratios, achieving up to 2.21%, 11.43%, 7.04%, and 4.81% higher scores on the commonsense reasoning, reading comprehension, MMLU, and BBH benchmarks, respectively.",

However, those models are hard to deploy for production due to the limited computation resources and strict latency constraints. There has been a growing interest in the compression of Transformer-based LMs to improve the inference efficiency. \n\nPruning has been proven to be an effective way of reducing model size while maintaining the similar model quality (Le-Cun et al., 1989) (Sanh et al., 2020) (Wang, 2021). Structured pruning is gaining popularity to prune the weights with a pre-defined sparsity pattern such as block-wise pruning (Lagunas et al., 2021) and fine-grained 2:4 (Pool & Yu, 2021) or N:M structured sparsity (Zhou et al., 2021). Recent works (Zafrir et al., 2021;Kurtic et al., 2022) proposed pruning Transformer models at pre-training to create sparse pre-trained LMs and fine-tuning on downstream tasks. \n\nQuantization is another widely-used model compression technique that can improve the inference latency (Jacob et al., 2018) (Zafrir et al., 2019) (Bhandare et al., 2019). \n\nThere are two typical quantization approaches: post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT), where PTQ requires an offline calibration process on representative samples to collect the tensor statistics and generate the scale and zero point used for quantization, and QAT requires an additional fine-tuning phase simulating the quantization inference during training. \n\nKnowledge distillation is a popular compression technique (Hinton et al., 2015) (Sanh et al., 2019) (Tang et al., 2019).

Identifying and removing unnecessary weights of PLMs. The size of activation is also decreased when we use large group of parameters as a pruning granularity. \u2022 Quantization (Section 4). Reducing the bit-length for representing weights. We achieve acceleration in matrix multiplications when we reduce the bit-length of the activations as well. \n\n\u2022 Knowledge distillation (Section 5.1). Improving the accuracy of compressed models by transferring useful knowledge of the PLM. We combine knowledge distillation (KD) with other compression algorithms to improve the accuracy of the compressed models. \n\n\u2022 Low-rank approximation (Section 5.2). Reducing the cost of PLMs by substituting the weights with the multiplication of low-dimensional matrices based on the low-rank assumption. \n\n\u2022 Parameter sharing (Section 5.3). Sharing weights in different modules in PLMs. It is crucial to find a pair of weights that do not decrease accuracy after the sharing. \n\n\u2022 Efficient architecture design (Section 5.4). Designing a cost-efficient architecture that requires low costs for memorization and computation. \n\nWe additionally classify PLM compression algorithms into low-cost and high-cost ones considering the importance of compressing massive large language models (LLMs), independently of the aforementioned classification criterion. \n\nHigh-cost compression algorithms require extensive retraining processes on large datasets. They consequently generate more accurately compressed models but require intractable time to compress LLMs. On the other hand, low-cost compression algorithms perform only a simple weight-tuning process on small calibration data. Low-cost compression algorithms are applicable to LLMs; however, they suffer from severe accuracy degradation, and improving the accuracy is their main concern.",

            "text": "Transformer-based models [49,31,45,5] have achieved state-of-the-art results in sequence analysis tasks [17,16,9], e.g., RoBERTa [39] in natural language processing and ViT [17] in computer vision. However, it becomes more and more challenging to apply these architectures to downstream tasks efficiently, given the large model sizes, increasingly complex datasets, demand for realtime inference and limited computing resources. Most language models, not only Transformer-based models, utilize the pipeline as illustrated in Figure 2 to conduct classification or regression on downstream tasks. As illustrate in Figure 2, model inference in Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the process of using a pre-trained and fine-tuned model to make predictions or generate outputs based on new and unseen data. This stage follows the pre-training and fine-tuning phases and involves applying the learned patterns and parameters to accomplish specific tasks, such as text classification, translation, or question answering. Since pre-training is a time-consuming and GPU-demanding stage, our empirical study leverages only the fine-tuning and inference stages. Various methodologies are proposed to enhance the model efficiency during the inference stage. Pruning proposed by Lecun et al. [36] is one of the popular approaches in the compression of Transformer models. Generally, by getting rid of trial or unimportant weights in neural networks, pruning can reduce inference time and memory requirement with limited performance loss by avoiding unnecessary computation with limited performance loss [47]. \n\nPrevious studies [4,6,62] have shown the computation cost (e.g., memory requirement) grows quadratically with the input sequence length in the attention layers of Transformer models. This research topic has increasingly garnered attention from both the industrial sector and the research community. Several research works focus on incorporating different sparse attention mechanism into Transformer models, e.g., Longformer (ETC) [4], Extended Transformer Construction (ETC) [2], BigBird [62], Global Memory Augmentation for Transformers (GMAT) [25] and LongLoRA [6].",

            "text": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, leading to significant achievements in various tasks such as dialogue generation, code generation, text summarization, and machine translation (OpenAI, 2023;Touvron et al., 2023;Jiang et al., 2023;Bai et al., 2023;Li et al., 2023b).However, their extensive demand for computing resources makes them impractical in resource-limited scenarios, such as PCs or mobile phones (Thawakar et al., 2024).Furthermore, the high costs of inference and storage impede their widespread application across various industries (Bai et al., 2024).\n\nTo address these challenges, many researchers attempt to reduce the computational and storage requirements of LLMs by designing smaller models.These smaller models are usually obtained by training from scratch (Geng & Liu, 2023;Zhang et al., 2024;Li et al., 2023c;mic, 2024) or compressing larger models (Xia et al., 2024;Ma et al., 2023a).Some previous works (Li et al., 2023c;Bai et al., 2023) emphasize the importance of prioritizing data quality over quantity when training smaller models from scratch.They demonstrate that small models can potentially outperform their larger counterparts with lower training costs.This insight offers a promising approach to training more powerful models with fewer resources.From another perspective, model compression, which includes pruning, distillation, and quantization, are presented as a method to strike a balance between efficiency and performance for existing LLMs.Pruning accelerates LLMs by removing non-essential parameters of the network with specialized hardware (Ma et al., 2023a;Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2024).Distillation enables the model to acquire knowledge rapidly from a teacher model by mimicking the teacher's behavior (Wu et al., 2023;Hsieh et al., 2023).",

However, the resource demands of these models pose substantial challenges. Structured pruning is an effective approach to reducing model size, but it often results in significant accuracy degradation, necessitating parameter updates to adapt. Unfortunately, such fine-tuning requires substantial memory, which limits its applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce quantization into the structured pruning framework to reduce memory consumption during both fine-tuning and inference. However, the combined errors from pruning and quantization increase the difficulty of fine-tuning, requiring a more refined quantization scheme. To this end, we propose QPruner, a novel framework that employs structured pruning to reduce model size, followed by a layer-wise mixed-precision quantization scheme. Quantization precisions are assigned to each layer based on their importance to the target task, and Bayesian optimization is employed to refine precision allocation strategies, ensuring a balance between model accuracy and memory efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that QPruner significantly outperforms existing methods in memory savings while maintaining or improving model performance.",

These Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to adapt to novel domains through pretraining resulting in models like BioBERT (Lee et al., 2020), LegalBERT (Chalkidis et al., 2020), and SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019) have become a popular strategy for improving performance further. While accurate and robust, LLMs are not without drawbacks. They commonly have hundreds of millions or billions of parameters requiring large specialized computer clusters to run inference at scale. Several approaches have been successfully used to improve the performance of these LLMs, such as approximating attention (Peng et al., 2021), removing portions of the models (Sridhar and Sarah, 2020), and reducing the precision of activation and weight values. Recent work (Zafrir et al., 2021) (Kurti\u0107 et al., 2022) has shown that the application of unstructured and semistructured (block) pruning mechanisms on LLMs can significantly compress models with little to no loss in accuracy. While these approaches are successful and applicable during model general domain pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, prior work has not studied how pruned models transfer to new domains nor the impact of pretraining stage pruning on transfer accuracy. Given that most applications would require the transfer of the general domain LLMs to a specific application domain, it is important to study the generality and robustness of the pruned LLMs when applied to multiple tasks in an application domain. While existing pruning research has found it possible to prune models heavily without loss in accuracy, most approaches have focused on the compression of individual tasks or textual domains. These specialized models match or exceed the accuracy of the dense model but commonly require vast amounts of hyperparameter turning and task-specific optimization to achieve this result.",

            "text": "Pre-trained transformer models [7,20,22,25] have achieved great success for a wide variety of NLP tasks. However, the superior performance comes at the cost of increasingly larger model sizes and computation overhead, making it difficult to efficiently deploy them on different downstream tasks in various latency-critical scenarios such as online servers and edge devices. \n\nAccelerating transformer inference is often achieved through model compression methods such as pruning [19,30], quantization [4,17,31], and knowledge distillation [15,29]. These techniques aim to reduce the size of the model, with quantization and distillation resulting in a smaller, fixed model. Structured pruning, which eliminates redundant heads or dimensions, can effectively meet deployment requirements [40,44]. However, structured pruning may not guarantee optimal accuracy, particularly for small transformers or long input sequences, as the attention mechanism has a  ( 2 ) computation complexity with input token length . This means a significant portion of the model must be pruned to meet tight deployment constraints, potentially compromising accuracy. \n\nRecently, a promising subfield in NLP has emerged that focuses on reducing latency during model inference by pruning input tokens. It's based on the intuition that not all tokens in the input sequence are critical for making a final prediction. As tokens pass through the encoder layers, some tokens have been captured by other tokens via attention in the early layer and do not require future modeling in a higher layer [9,28]. Pruning these uninformative tokens within each layer can increase the model's inference speed without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, the removal of these tokens in each layer will also reduce the computation and memory requirements in its subsequent layers, resulting in linear or even quadratic reductions and providing greater compression benefits. \n\nSome prior works [9,10,16,18,42] have examined the potential of layer-wise token pruning of input sequences. However, these approaches face several limitations. First, they treat all layers equally, leading to a vast design space, as pruning decisions must be made for each token at every layer through the use of token-level masks.",

            "text": "The popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT1 or BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) has recently prompted an active area of research around the notion of 'alignment', i.e. the ability of NLP models to meet human expectations (see Wang et al., 2023 for a survey). While techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) have become de facto standards to steer models towards human behaviour, the structural differences that make models in need of alignment are not fully elucidated. Why is it that NLP systems organise their knowledge the way they do? And which operations might increase their similarity to human cognition? These questions remain unsolved, not only for LLMs but also for simple word embedding models such as GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) or Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013). \n\nAlongside the question of alignment, a range of model compression techniques have recently been proposed, including pruning, distillation and quantization (Xu and McAuley, 2023), to increase system efficiency at runtime. Many distilled models perform on a par with their larger counterparts (Sanh et al., 2019;Jiao et al., 2020), prompting questions about the nature of semantic encoding in both the original and the compressed architecture. Some investigations have focused on the increased (or decreased) fairness of distilled models, in particular their ability to faithfully reproduce reality, with inconclusive results so far (Ramesh et al., 2023). Others have concentrated instead on the correlation between compression and a model's ability to reproduce human behaviour itself (Tarigopula et al., 2021). Most importantly, there is evidence that pruned networks develop different internal representations (Ansuini et al., 2020). \n\nIn this paper, we bring together the question of alignment and the methodological toolbox given by pruning techniques.",

            "text": "Network Pruning. With the growth in the size of language models, the pruning technique has been proposed to eliminate unnecessary weights or structures in language models, thus accelerating language models. The pruning methods can be generally categorized into two types: unstructured pruning and structured pruning. \n\nUnstructured pruning methods focus on the level of individual weights, which try to speed up models by increasing the sparsity level of model weights. SparseGPT (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023) reduces the pruning problem to layer-wise sparse regression and incrementally prunes each column in the weight matrix with a sequence of Hessian inverses. Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) enhances the magnitude pruning approach with input activation norms, effectively reducing the complexity of pruning algorithms. RIA (Zhang et al., 2024a) notices that previous methods tend to prune away entire channels of network weights, and mitigates the issue by jointly considering input and output channels. \n\nStructured pruning methods operate at the level of network structures instead, which compress language models by removing redundant model components. LLMPruner (Ma et al., 2023) employs gradient information as a reference to remove noncritical structures. SliceGPT (Ashkboos et al., 2024) removes rows or columns corresponding to small principal components in the weight matrix to achieve smaller weight matrices. LaCo (Yang et al., 2024) proposes the layer collapse algorithm, which merges adjacent layers while ensuring the representation similarity on few-shot calibration examples. ShortGPT (Men et al., 2024) finds that deep layers of language models are not as effective as expected, and proposes the block importance metric to identify and remove redundant layers. BlockPruner (Zhong et al., 2024) decomposes each Transformer layer into two minimal residual blocks and performs fine-grained block pruning to avoid significant performance loss. \n\nProbing Language Models. The impressive capability of language models raises the hypothesis that language models have gone beyond mere memorization of surface correlations. learn the principles behind the training data and develop internal representations for features (Belinkov, 2022).",

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency across a wide array of NLP tasks. However, the escalation in model size also engenders substantial deployment costs. While few efforts have explored model pruning techniques to reduce the size of LLMs, they mainly center on general or task-specific weights. This leads to suboptimal performance due to lacking specificity on the target domain or generality on different tasks when applied to domain-specific challenges. This work introduces an innovative unstructured dual-pruning methodology, D-Pruner, for domain-specific compression on LLM. It extracts a compressed, domain-specific, and task-agnostic LLM by identifying LLM weights that are pivotal for general capabilities, like linguistic capability and multi-task solving, and domain-specific knowledge. More specifically, we first assess general weight importance by quantifying the error incurred upon their removal with the help of an open-domain calibration dataset. Then, we utilize this general weight importance to refine the training loss, so that it preserves generality when fitting into a specific domain. Moreover, by efficiently approximating weight importance with the refined training loss on a domain-specific calibration dataset, we obtain a pruned model emphasizing generality and specificity. Our comprehensive experiments across various tasks in healthcare and legal domains show the effectiveness of D-Pruner in domain-specific compression.

This task predicts the probability distributions of a sequence of tokens. Perplexity (PPL) is used to evaluate performance. The results under three different sparsity levels are shown in Table 1. For all pruning methods and datasets, the performance drops as the sparsity level increases. Among the three comparison methods, loss-aware pruning performs better than magnitude-based and movement pruning when the compression ratio is relatively small. However, when the compression becomes more aggressive, loss-aware pruning's performance becomes similar or even worse compared to the other two methods. In contrast, our proposed method, SIMPLE, consistently outperforms all three baseline pruning methods at each of the three sparsity levels. \n\nComparison with GUM (Anonymous, 2023). \n\nIn Table 2, we compare our proposed SIMPLE method with GUM, the latest work that considers pruning the width of FFN in GPT-like models. \n\nThe GUM does not prune other modules like attention heads or hidden dimension, and the reduction in model size is only 22.7% even when half of the FFN neurons are pruned away. For a fair comparison, we also prune away half of the FFN neurons. \n\nAs shown, the proposed SIMPLE improves the language modeling compared to GUM by a significant margin. In addition, considering also the attention heads and hidden stage dimension as compressible components enables SIMPLE to achieve a better tradeoff between model size and performance (refer to Section 4.3.1).",

            "text": "Model compression has become a standard way of reducing the deployment costs of large language models (LLMs). Current post-training compression techniques can be roughly categorized into quantization-based, which reduce the bit-width of weights or activations, e.g. (Frantar et al., 2022;Lin et al., 2023;Dettmers & Zettlemoyer, 2022;Tseng et al., 2024), pruning-based, which sparsify the weight matrices, e.g. (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Yin et al., 2024), or structured pruning / layer dropping, which drop entire model components, e.g. (Kim et al., 2024;Men et al., 2024). While constantly improving their performance, existing compression methods are reaching diminishing returns in terms of accuracy-vs-compression (Dettmers et al., 2023;Tseng et al., 2024). \n\nIn this context, a new direction is dynamic, or non-uniform, layer-wise compression, in which different layers can be compressed to various levels, according to their \"sensitivity\" relative to the model output. Dynamic compression allows to maximize model accuracy while satisfying a given compression requirement, e.g. a target model size. Instance-specific solutions for this problem have already been proposed for essentially every compression type: sparsity (Yin et al., 2024), quantization (Frantar & Alistarh, 2022), or layer dropping (Kim et al., 2024;Men et al., 2024). Broadly, these approaches work by assigning an error/sensitivity score to each layer and compression level, which measures the impact of its compression on output loss increase. Then, one Table 1: Depth pruning is not monotone. In this example (Llama-3-8B with Fineweb-Edu calibration), removing strictly more blocks (depicted in orange) can improve perplexity across sources. Left half of block corresponds to attention layer, right half to MLP. calculates a compression assignment which minimizes the sum of error scores, while still satisfying the global compression constraint.",

            "text": "Language Model (LM) pruning compresses the model by removing weights, nodes, or other parts of its architecture. Typically, pruning focuses on the resulting efficiency gains at the cost of effectiveness. However, when looking at how individual data points are affected by pruning, it turns out that a particular subset of data points always bears most of the brunt (in terms of reduced accuracy) when pruning, but this effect goes unnoticed when reporting the mean accuracy of all data points. These data points are called PIEs and have been studied in image processing, but not in NLP. In a study of various NLP datasets, pruning methods, and levels of compression, we find that PIEs impact inference quality considerably, regardless of class frequency, and that BERT is more prone to this than BiLSTM. We also find that PIEs contain a high amount of data points that have the largest influence on how well the model generalises to unseen data. This means that when pruning, with seemingly moderate loss to accuracy across all data points, we in fact hurt tremendously those data points that matter the most. We trace what makes PIEs both hard and impactful to inference to their overall longer and more semantically complex text. These findings are novel and contribute to understanding how LMs are affected by pruning. The code is available at: https://github.com/pietrotrope/AsEasyAsPIE",

            "text": "Language Models Compression. There are several main techniques for language model compression: knowledge distillation (Sun et al., 2020;Touvron et al., 2021;Pan et al., 2021), quantization (Yao et al., 2022;Gholami et al., 2021;Xiao et al., 2023), network pruning or sparsity, (He et al., 2024;Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Ashkboos et al., 2024;Sun et al., 2024;Zhang et al., 2024b;Song et al., 2024;Liu et al., 2023) and early exit (Huang et al., 2024;Li et al., 2023;Xin et al., 2020). Knowledge distillation methods transfer knowledge from a large, complex model (called the teacher model) to a smaller, simpler model (called the student model). They must either learn the output distribution of teacher models (Agarwal et al., 2024) or design multi-task approaches (Liang et al., 2023) to ensure that student models retain the knowledge and generative capabilities of the teacher models. Quantization methods compress language models by reducing the precision of the numerical values representing the model's parameters (e.g., weights and activations). For example, OneBit quantized the weight matrices of LLMs to 1-bit (Xu et al., 2024). Early exit methods allow a model to terminate its processing early during inference if it has already made a confident prediction, avoiding the need for additional layers of computation (Chen et al., 2024). Network pruning, also known as sparsity techniques, refers to methods employed to compress language models by eliminating less significant structures within the network, such as individual weights, neurons, or layers (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Ashkboos et al., 2024;Song et al., 2024). The primary objectives  are to reduce the model's size, enhance inference speed, and decrease memory consumption while preserving or only marginally affecting its performance.",

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) from the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) family have shown remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks, but are difficult to deploy because of their massive size and computational costs. For illustration, the top-performing GPT-175B models have 175 billion parameters, which total at least 320GB (counting multiples of 1024) of storage in half-precision (FP16) format, leading it to require at least five A100 GPUs with 80GB of memory each for inference. It is therefore natural that there has been significant interest in reducing these costs via model compression. To date, virtually all existing GPT compression approaches have focused on quantization (Dettmers et al., 2022;Yao et al., 2022;Xiao et al., 2022;Frantar et al., 2022a), that is, reducing the precision of the model's numerical representation. \n\nA complementary approach for compression is pruning, which removes network elements, from individual weights (unstructured pruning) to higher-granularity structures such as rows/columns of the weight matrices (structured pruning). 1 Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) 2 Neural Magic Inc. Corresponding author: elias.frantar@ist.ac.at Pruning has a long history (LeCun et al., 1989;Hassibi et al., 1993), and has been applied successfully in the case of vision and smaller-scale language models (Hoefler et al., 2021). Yet, the best-performing pruning methods require extensive retraining of the model to recover accuracy. In turn, this is extremely expensive for GPT-scale models. While some accurate one-shot pruning methods exist (Hubara et al., 2021a;Frantar et al., 2022b), compressing the model without retraining, unfortunately even they become very expensive when applied to models with billions of parameters. Thus, to date, there is essentially no work on accurate pruning of billion-parameter models. \n\nOverview.",

            "text": "Transformer plays a vital role in the realms of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), specially for constructing large language models (LLM) and large vision models (LVM). Model compression methods reduce the memory and computational cost of Transformer, which is a necessary step to implement large language/vision models on practical devices. Given the unique architecture of Transformer, featuring alternative attention and feedforward neural network (FFN) modules, specific compression techniques are usually required. The efficiency of these compression methods is also paramount, as retraining large models on the entire training dataset is usually impractical. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent compression methods, with a specific focus on their application to Transformer-based models. The compression methods are primarily categorized into pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and efficient architecture design (Mamba, RetNet, RWKV, etc.). In each category, we discuss compression methods for both language and vision tasks, highlighting common underlying principles. Finally, we delve into the relation between various compression methods, and discuss further directions in this domain.",

            "text": "Prompt compression for LLMs. Prompt compression shortens the input prompt to improve the inference efficiency of LLMs over long context. The form of the compressed prompts can vary, including token pruning, abstractive summarization, prompt paraphrasing, or soft prompt tuning. For example, token pruning trims less important tokens from the prompt (Li et al., 2023), while abstractive summarization or prompt paraphrasing aims to condense the semantics into shorter concise text (Xu et al., 2024). Soft prompt tuning, on the other hand, converts the original prompt into a vector (Mu et al., 2024). Among these methods, token pruning has proven to be particularly effective due to its flexibility and smaller computational overhead compared to other methods. Prior work on prompt pruning, such as Selective Context (Li et al., 2023) and LLMLingua (Jiang et al., 2023(Jiang et al., , 2024)), use heuristic metrics to compute token importance and trim less important tokens. LLMLingua-2 (Pan et al., 2024) trains a transformer-based classifier on compression data distilled from GPT-4 to decide whether to prune a token. While these task-agnostic prompt compression methods are effective and generalize to some tasks, they still struggle to model token importance in specific tasks or domains. \n\nRL-based prompt compression. RL-based methods have also been applied to prompt compression. For example, Jung and Kim (2024) leverage RL to train an MLP classifier conditioned on the task language model for token pruning. However, their compressor depends on the hidden representations of a white-box model, and the prompts they consider are usually short instructions rather than long contexts.",

            "text": "To illustrate the enhanced efficiency of pruned models, we present the inference speed of dense and sparse models on AMD CPU. We use the DeepSparse library [12] and apply 50% unstructured pruning on OPTs and LLaMAs in this experiment. Table 7 indicates that the pruned models can achieve 1.19x \u223c 1.87x speedup compared to their dense counterparts. This significant boost in inference speed underscores the critical importance of model pruning in practical applications. Pruning for Language Model Compression. The surging complexity of Transformer-based language models, which now feature hundreds of billions of parameters, has accentuated the urgent need for effective and efficient model pruning methods [6,8,9]. These pruning methods can be broadly classified into structured and unstructured approaches. Structured pruning is more hardware-friendly, as it directly prunes entire segments of weights, thereby removing consecutive computations [17,14]. Unstructured pruning (sparsification) is also receiving interest, particularly as hardware advancements increasingly support the acceleration of sparse patterns such as 2:4 or 4:8 sparse [20]. Techniques such as SparseGPT [3] extend the OBS [9] methodology to column-wise prune weights, allowing the modification of values in the unpruned columns to compensate for the pruning errors. Aaquib et al. [28] enhance SparseGPT by incorporating minimal iterative task fine-tuning during the pruning process, demonstrating performance improvements at high sparsity levels. Wanda [27] introduces a simple yet effective no-retraining-needed pruning strategy that prunes weights based on their magnitudes and corresponding activations. OWL [39] considers the inhomogeneous distribution of interlayer outliers and further extends Wanda to a non-uniform sparsity distribution, achieving better performance. DS\u2205T [42] and SPP [16], as fine-tuning methods designed for sparse models, can improve the performance of pruned PLMs within limited complexity. \n\nWeight Distribution Optimization. Various techniques have been employed to understand and optimize weight distributions in the quest for more efficient neural networks.",

The compelling performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrated in various applications triggers an unprecedented competition of building billion-level LLMs among tech giants and academic institutions (Brown et al., 2020;Touvron et al., 2023a;b;Brown et al., 2020). While their exceptional capabilities are undeniable, the colossal size and computational demands of these models have also raised substantial concerns, particularly in terms of financial expenditure and environment (Luccioni et al., 2022;Patterson et al., 2021). \n\nNetwork pruning (Mozer & Smolensky, 1989;Janowsky, 1989;LeCun et al., 1989;Han et al., 2015), as a longestablished model compression method, is expected to serve as an effective solution for reducing the size of LLMs. However, network pruning usually favors a certain time of finetuning or re-training to reacquire the original optimal performance. Given the extensive text corpus and model size associated with LLMs, conventional fine-tuning becomes exceedingly challenging and less desirable. Fortunately, recent endeavors have explored the possibility of LLM pruning without the need for fine-tuning, showcasing that LLMs contain a substantial number of parameters that can be removed in a single step with minimal performance degra- dation (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2023;Jaiswal et al., 2023b;Ma et al., 2023). SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023) addresses the challenge of LLM pruning from the perspective of layerwise reconstruction problem. In this context, the primary goal is to minimize the output discrepancy in terms of the reconstruction error between dense and sparse LLMs. It adopts an iterative strategy to handle the computational hurdle posed by the row-Hessian problem.",

            "text": "Unstructured pruning can achieve some of the highest sparsity levels using various criteria and schedules for determining which parameters to prune (Frankle and Carbin, 2019;Chen et al., 2020;Sanh et al., 2020;Guo et al., 2021), though sparsity patterns resulting from unstructured pruning often do not result in latency reduction on modern accelerator hardware. Work in structured pruning has explored removing entire parameter matrices such as self-attention heads, hidden units, and entire layers (Michel et al., 2019;Lagunas et al., 2021;Xia et al., 2022), with basic underlying hardware constraints in mind. Pruning is often combined with a distillation objective, which provides complementary gains, likely by reducing complexity of the dataset (Zhou et al., 2020). \n\nDistillation is a prominent, practical method for compression that is widely used in NLP. Work on distillation in NLP has focused largely on the taskagnostic setting of compressing general-purpose pre-trained models such as BERT (Sanh et al., 2019;Sun et al., 2019Sun et al., , 2020) ) but task-specific distillation has also been reported to work well (Jiao et al., 2020). \n\nApproaches for model quantization can be categorized into post-training quantization, where general-purpose models are quantized at test-time (Jacob et al., 2018;Bhandare et al., 2019;Kim et al., 2021), and quantization-aware training, where models incorporate simulated quantization error during training in order to learn more quantizable parameters (Zafrir et al., 2019;Bai et al., 2021). Quantization-aware training tends to lead to higher accuracy quantized inference, but post-training quantization can be applied on-the-fly to any model at inference time.",

            "text": "Pruning and LLM Pruning. Since the 1980s, network pruning has been a well-established technique for simplifying neural networks in various applications while maintaining accuracy (Mozer & Smolensky, 1989;Han et al., 2015;Mocanu et al., 2018;Wen et al., 2017;Lin et al., 2019). However, when it comes to pruning Large Language Models (LLMs), progress has been limited. Traditional pruning typically requires a round of re-training to restore performance, which can be challenging for LLMs. To address this challenge, researchers have developed pruning algorithms specifically tailored for LLM compression. For example, Ma et al. (2023) explored structured sparse LLMs using Taylor pruning to remove entire weight rows, followed by LoRA fine-tuning (Hu et al., 2021). Recent research has shifted toward unstructured pruning without the need for fine-tuning, showing substantial advancements. SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023) utilizes the Hessian inverse for pruning and with subsequent weight updates to reduce reconstruction error of dense and sparse weights, while Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) produces a criterion incorporating weight magnitude with their input activations, aiming to preserve outlier features. Zhang et al. (2023) extended dynamic sparsity (Mocanu et al., 2018;Evci et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2021b) to efficiently fine-tune sparse LLM without weight updating. Our work for the first time probes the crucial role of non-uniform layerwise sparsity for LLM pruning, making good progress in this field. \n\nLayerwise Sparsity for Pruning. While it is common to use uniform layerwise sparsity (Zhu & Gupta, 2017;Gale et al., 2019) to prune language models (Sanh et al., 2020;Kurtic et al., 2022), there is a well-established line of work that explore non-uniform layerwise sparsity in terms of pruning vision models.",

Especially, there have been three main types of research, e.g.,encoder-only LMs (Devlin et al., 2019;He et al., 2023), decoder-only LMs (Touvron et al., 2023;OpenAI, 2023), and encoder-decoder LMs (Lewis et al., 2020;Raffel et al., 2020;Chung et al., 2022b;Tay et al., 2023), which aim for their specific expertise. Among these various types of LMs, we will focus on the widely studied and utilized encoder-decoder LMs due to their flexibility in application across a range of tasks (Guo et al., 2022;Wang et al., 2023b). On the other perspective of LM researches rather than performances, efficiency of LMs (e.g.,computational and memory cost) have been intensively studied because of their huge computational requirements. This research direction is called model compression. Among the various model compression techniques (Jiao et al., 2020;Yao et al., 2022), pruning (Frankle and Carbin, 2018;Sanh et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020c;Xia et al., 2022) is a promising method that aims to remove redundant weights from networks, resulting in improved efficiency by saving storage capacity and enhancing inference speed. Between structured pruning and unstructured pruning approaches, structured pruning is typically preferred in practice due to its relative ease of deployment on various types of hardware platforms compared to unstructured pruning (Han et al., 2016;Gupta and Agrawal, 2020). \n\nTherefore, we focus on the structured pruning method specifically tailored for encoder-decoder LMs. Despite the remarkable advancements in encoder-decoder models, little attention has been given to structured pruning methods for encoderdecoder LMs.",

            "text": "Model compression is an effective approach to reduce model size and improve computation efficiency. It requires fewer computing resources and memory and can better meet the needs of various applications than the original model, where its strategies can be divided into two categories: parameter compression and structure compression. Parameter compression methods include parameter pruning, parameter quantization, low-rank decomposition, and parameter sharing. Parameter pruning deletes redundant parameters based on a sizeable PFM, while parameter quantization reduces model parameters to lower-order numbers without significant impact on model performance. Low-rank decomposition reduces the dimension of a high-dimensional parameter vector, and parameter sharing maps model parameters to reduce their number. Structure compression refers to designing new compact network structures and employing knowledge distillation, where the knowledge learned from a larger teacher model is transferred to a smaller student model through soft labels, among other techniques. DistilBERT [214], for instance, uses knowledge distillation to compress BERT, reducing its size by 40% while maintaining 97% of its language comprehension. ALBERT uses decomposition-embedded parameterization and cross-layer parameter sharing to reduce the number of model parameters.",

Further, we dig deep into the efficiency bottleneck of the training phase, and evaluate in detail the contribution of adaptive optimization algorithms (such as AdamW), massively parallel computing techniques, and mixed precision training strategies to accelerate convergence and reduce memory footprint. By analyzing the mathematical principles and implementation details of these algorithms, we reveal how they effectively improve training efficiency in practice. In terms of model deployment and inference optimization, this paper systematically reviews the latest advances in model compression techniques, focusing on strategies such as quantification, pruning, and knowledge distillation. By comparing the theoretical frameworks of these techniques and their effects in different application scenarios, we demonstrate their ability to significantly reduce model size and inference delay while maintaining model prediction accuracy. In addition, this paper critically examines the limitations of current efficiency optimization methods, such as the increased risk of overfitting, the control of performance loss after compression, and the problem of algorithm generality, and proposes some prospects for future research. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the efficiency optimization of large-scale language models.",

            "text": "Building on the efforts to address the challenges posed by resource-intensive BERT models, our research delves into reducing the complexity of SBERT models without compromising performance. Layer pruning, which involves selectively removing less critical parts of the neural network, offers a promising solution for enhancing the efficiency of SBERT models. This is especially important for processing languages within environments constrained by limited computing infrastructure. \n\nModel pruning, specifically layer pruning, seeks to address the inefficiencies related to the size and complexity of models like BERT, SBERT. The objective is to reduce the model's size and computational demands while maintaining or enhancing its performance. Techniques vary from removing individual neurons to whole layers. In the context of transformer-based models, a study (Fan et al., 2019) demonstrated that strategic layer removal could reduce model size substantially with minimal impact on performance. \n\nIn our research, we delve into recent developments in adapting Sentence-BERT (SBERT) models for low-resource languages, focusing particularly on Marathi and Hindi. The L3Cube-MahaSBERT and HindSBERT (Joshi et al., 2022) models were established as benchmarks for generating high-quality sentence embeddings in Marathi and Hindi, respectively. These specialized models are highlighted for their effectiveness in processing these low-resource languages. These models have been rigorously trained and evaluated across various NLP tasks, including text classification and semantic similarity. \n\nOur research aims to extend these foundational models by applying layer-pruning techniques to enhance their efficiency without compromising the quality of the embeddings. By integrating layer pruning, we seek to reduce the computational demand and improve the operational feasibility of deploying SBERT models in real-world applications, making advanced NLP tools more accessible for languages that traditionally have fewer technological resources. \n\n\u2022 A research (Sajjad et al., 2022) has showcased a range of layer pruning strategies, under-scoring their effectiveness. These techniques maintain an impressive 98% of the original performance even after removing 40% of the layers from BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet models.",

The applied fields include text mining and others. In particular, the success of LLMs on text understanding and text generation draws attention from researchers who have worked on NLP and related areas for years or even decades. On the side, LLMs may suffer from problems like model overfitting, hallucination, and device limitation to name a few. In this work, we suggest a model pruning technique specifically focused on LLMs. The proposed methodology emphasizes the explainability of deep learning models. By having the theoretical foundation, we obtain a trustworthy deep model so that huge models with a massive number of model parameters become not quite necessary. A mutual information-based estimation is adopted to find neurons with redundancy to eliminate. Moreover, an estimator with well-tuned parameters helps to find precise estimation to guide the pruning procedure. At the same time, we also explore the difference between pruning on large-scale models vs. pruning on small-scale models. The choice of pruning criteria is sensitive in small models but not for large-scale models. It is a novel finding through this work. Overall, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model to the state-of-the-art models.",

            "text": "Uniform Pruning. Traditional pruning requires a round of re-training to restore performance, which poses significant challenges for LLMs. Researchers have developed pruning algorithms specifically tailored for LLM compression. For instance, [9] investigated structured sparse LLMs by applying Taylor pruning to remove entire weight rows, followed by LoRA fine-tuning [13]. In recent years, the focus has shifted toward unstructured pruning which eliminates the need for fine-tuning. SparseGPT [4] employs the Hessian inverse for pruning, followed by weight updates to reduce reconstruction errors between dense and sparse weights. Wanda [14] introduced a criterion that incorporates weight magnitude and input activations to preserve outlier features. \n\nNon-uniform Pruning. Uniform layerwise sparsity is commonly used for pruning language models [36; 42], with several studies demonstrating its effectiveness in LLM pruning [43; 44]. However, there is a growing body of work exploring non-uniform layerwise sparsity, primarily in the context of vision models. For example, [15] proposed a non-uniform, scale-free topology inspired by graph theory, which outperforms dense counterparts when applied to restricted Boltzmann machines. Subsequent work has improved the scalability of this approach by leveraging Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs [16], extending the method to fully connected layers [11] and convolutional layers [17; 18] to achieve data-free and feedforward-free layerwise sparsity. Another approach to non-uniform sparsity involves applying a global threshold across all layers [19; 20; 21; 22]. However, global pruning has been found to be computationally expensive and ineffective when applied to LLMs. \n\nAnalyzing LLMs. The authors in [23] analyzed the contributions of various components in LLMs and their impact on overall performance. [24] explored the role of deep layers in LLMs through layer pruning, providing insights into how different layers in relation to model performance. [25] examined the redundancy of attention heads in transformer-based models, demonstrating that many attention heads can be pruned without significant performance degradation.",

            "text": "Large language models. Before the advent of LLMs, transformer-based language models [52,53,54,55] demonstrated their ability to effectively analyze relationships among tokens in complex input sequences, facilitated by the attention mechanism [52]. These models also exhibit notable scalability [56,57,58] with respect to model size and the scale of pre-training datasets. This decent scalability has led to the emergence of LLMs, such as GLM [59], OPT [60], BLOOM [61], the Llama family [1,1,2], Gemma [3], and GPT-4 [4], which exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning capabilities. However, these LLMs often feature billions of parameters and prohibitive computation complexity, which limits their widespread use across diverse platforms. \n\nLarge language model compression. To facilitate efficient deployment of LLMs in real-world applications, existing works primarily focus on compressing LLMs by extending traditional compression techniques such as knowledge distillation [62,63], quantization [64,65,66,67,68,69], system acceleration [70,71], and pruning [6,5,72]. Our work is most closely related to LLM pruning. Along this direction, early works [5,6] employ unstructured and semi-structured pruning [73] by zeroing out connections among neurons. Despite their plausible performance, these methods require specialized support to achieve real-device speedup. To benefit commodity platforms, structured LLM pruning methods remove more coarse-grained components, such as all connections related to a single neuron [7,8,10] or even entire layers [9,33]. For instance, LLM-Pruner [7] and FLAP [8] reduce LLM width by eliminating identified redundant neurons, while Sheared-LLaMA [10] learns a set of binary masks to reduce both the width and depth of LLMs. However, these methods either focus on a single dimension of compression (i.e., depth or width) with limited efficiency improvements, or they require a costly fine-tuning process for each target configuration and platform.",

Nevertheless, the scalability of model parameters faces constraints due to limitations in GPU memory and computational speed. To address these constraints, various weight compression methods have emerged, such as Pruning and Quantization. Given the low-rank nature of weight matrices in language models, the reduction of weights through matrix decomposition undoubtedly holds significant potential and promise. In this paper, drawing upon the intrinsic structure of LLMs, we propose a novel approach termed Data-free Joint Rank-k Approximation for compressing the parameter matrices. Significantly, our method is characterized by without necessitating additional involvement of any corpus, while simultaneously preserving orthogonality in conjunction with pruning and quantization methods. We achieve a model pruning of 80% parameters while retaining 93.43% of the original performance without any calibration data. Additionally, we explore the fundamental properties of the weight matrix of LLMs undergone Rank-k Approximation and conduct comprehensive experiments to elucidate our hypothesis.",

Distinct from these approaches, the paradigm of low-rank matrix decomposition is less explored in LLMs but holds significant promise. Decomposition involves approximating the weight matrices in neural networks with matrices of lower rank, effectively reducing the model size. Given the massive number of parameters in LLMs, low-rank decomposition offers significant potential for memory reduction. Furthermore, low-rank decomposition can complement existing LLM compression techniques by further compressing quantized or pruned models, enhancing overall efficiency [Cheng et al., 2017]. \n\nFrom the perspective of network compression, traditional low-rank decomposition methods typically adhere to a straightforward process: initially training the original model and subsequently fine-tuning the decomposed model [Jaderberg et al., 2014, Khodak et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021, Hsu et al., 2022]. While this approach is effective, it is resource-intensive and requires the entire training dataset and substantial computational power for end-to-end backpropagation. Applying this method to LLMs would encounter major challenges. Firstly, the training data for LLMs may not always be readily available, often restricted by privacy and commercial considerations. Secondly, the training process for these models is notoriously expensive, both in terms of time and computational resources.",

            "text": "This paper introduces a novel model compression approach through dynamic layer-specific pruning in Large Language Models (LLMs), enhancing the traditional methodology established by SliceGPT. By transitioning from constant to dynamic slicing, our method leverages the newly proposed Layer Redundancy (LR) score, which assesses how much change each layer changes its input by measuring the cosine similarity of the input to the output of the layer. We use this score to prune parts of individual layers based on redundancy in such a way that the average pruned percentage for all layers is a fixed value. We conducted extensive experiments using models like Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B on multiple datasets, evaluating different slicing bases and percentages to determine optimal configurations that balance efficiency and performance. Our findings show that our dynamic slicing approach not only maintains but, in many cases, enhances model performance compared to the baseline established by constant slicing methods. For instance, in several settings, we see performance improvements of up to 5% over the SliceGPT baseline. Additionally, a perplexity decrease by as much as 7% was observed across multiple benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our method.

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of NLP tasks, including language modeling, code generation, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question answering (Zhang et al., 2022a;Touvron et al., 2023a;b;Xu et al., 2023;Team, 2023;Zeng et al., 2022). However, LLMs have a vast number of parameters, resulting in high memory consumption and slow inference speed (Dettmers et al., 2022). For example, it requires 335GB GPU memory (i.e. five A100 GPU with 80G memory) to load its parameters in FP16 of Falcon-180B (Penedo et al., 2023), which corresponds to the inference speed of merely 4 tokens per second. Thus, there has been considerable interest in compressing LLMs to make LLMs more efficient and practical for deployment in various applications. \n\nOne of the approaches to compress a network is weight pruning. Although it has a long history in model compression (Hassibi et al., 1993;Hassibi & Stork, 1992), few pieces of work can be used to prune LLMs due to the requirement of extensive retraining. Recent studies, such as SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023) and Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) aim to tackle this challenge by reconstructing the layer-wise output of LLMs, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c). Specifically, SparseGPT proposes to prune unimportant with an importance metric derived from the hessian matrix. and then reconstruct layer-wise output. Moreover, Wanda removes intricate computation in SparseGPT by only leveraging the product of weight and activation magnitudes. \n\nWhile these approaches can eliminate considerable unnecessary weights, they typically operate within each weight by minimizing each layer's pruning error, which has two drawbacks.",

Given that structured pruning and quantization typically require performance recovery steps, integrating them provides a more holistic approach to mitigating the errors introduced by both techniques while further compressing the model. To address the uneven importance distribution across layers and precision loss caused by pruning and quantization, we adopt a fine-grained method to preserve the capacity of critical layers, enhancing their performance further during the fine-tuning process. After pruning, we first allocate mixed-precision quantization based on task relevance, followed by Bayesian optimization to iteratively refine decisions and probabilistically select the optimal quantization configuration. Experimental results demonstrate that QPruner significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of memory efficiency while achieving superior accuracy across multiple NLP benchmarks. By striking a balance between efficiency and performance, shows that QPruner is a powerful solution for deploying LLM in resource-limited environments.",

Still, their growing scale has increased the computational burden, necessitating a balance between efficiency and performance. Low-rank compression, a promising technique, reduces non-essential parameters by decomposing weight matrices into products of two low-rank matrices. Yet, its application in LLMs has not been extensively studied. The key to low-rank compression lies in low-rank factorization and low-rank dimensions allocation. To address the challenges of low-rank compression in LLMs, we conduct empirical research on the low-rank characteristics of large models. We propose a low-rank compression method suitable for LLMs. This approach involves precise estimation of feature distributions through pooled covariance matrices and a Bayesian optimization strategy for allocating low-rank dimensions. Experiments on the LLaMA-2 models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing strong structured pruning and low-rank compression techniques in maintaining model performance at the same compression ratio.",

Subsequently, we employ CoFi, a state-of-the-art Transformer compression method to compress the model. Unlike in Melas-Kyriazi Figure 2: Illustration of our method. Off-the-shelf generative language models are adopted to generate new utterances according to the few labeled data. These new data are combined with the few data to compress a large teacher model into a small student model, and also to extract a small vocabulary. et al. (2020) where the student model is trained from scratch, CoFi gradually prunes the teacher model parameters to derive the student model, and thus yields superior performance. Finally, we devise a novel vocabulary pruning method, namely V-Prune. V-Prune selectively retains task-relevant tokens in the original vocabulary, and complements the performance drop due to missing tokens during inference via nearest neighbor replacement. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. For instance, under the 5shot scenario, our method reduces the size of the BERT model and its vocabulary size by a factor of 20 and 30 respectively, while almost no loss in the performance is observed over various benchmarks, as shown in Fig. 1.

            "text": "Quantization, Pruning, Distillation for Inference. Previously, model compression algorithms have been extensively investigated as a viable approach for mitigating the computational resource requirements of model inference. These algorithms can be broadly categorized into three groups: \n\n(1) quantization [55,56,57,58], which involves mapping model parameters or activations from high-precision data types to low-precision counterparts, such as using 8-bit integers instead of the commonly employed 32-bit floating point format; (2) pruning or sparsity [59,60,61,62], which aims to eliminate unnecessary neurons or weights within the models; (3) and distillation [63,64,65,66] where predictions from larger models are utilized as supervised information to train smaller models. \n\nTransformer in NLP. Transformers [67] as a popular option have been frequently adopted by plenty of natural language processing (NLP) applications with prevailing successes [68,69,70,71,72,46,73,13,74,75]. Roughly, modern transformer-based networks can be categorized into two groups: \n\n(1) Encoder-Decoder or Encoder-only (i.e., BERT-style models [76]). This type of transformers commonly leverages the Masked Language Modeling task which encourages models to capture the intrinsic relationship between words and their context. Notable examples include BERT [76], RoBBERTa [69] and T5 [77]. (2) Decoder-only (i.e., GPT-style models [78]). Usually, this group of transformers adopts the Casual Language Modeling task, which is optimized to generate the next word/token in a sequence based on the preceding words/tokens. Such an autoregressive manner is highly preferred by downstream tasks like text generation and question answering. GPT-3 [79], OPT [39], PaLM [13], and BLOOM [80] are representative architectures within this huge family.",

The numerous FC layers in NLP models are promising for weight pruning and quantization. GOBO [344] proposes to compress BERT model down to 3 bits, thus significantly reducing DRAM access. Q-BERT [258]  Table 7. Summarized results of Transformer [291], Evolved Transformer [264] and HAT [300]. In this table, the latency is measured on the Raspberry Pi ARM CPU, the training cost is estimated with a single NVIDIA V100 GPU, and the CO 2 emission and the cloud computing cost are computed following Strubell et al. [268]. \n\nwith a Hessian-based mix-precision strategy. I-BERT [147] proposes integer-only BERT. Ternary-BERT [349] and BinaryBERT [11] further quantize the model down to Ternary ({-1, 0, +1}) and binary schemes. Tambe et al. [276] propose an adaptive floating-point data format in consideration of the large dynamic range of NLP models' weights. Weight pruning is also widely used in NLP model size reduction [96,174,334]. The major differences between them are the number of bits and the granularity of quantization. According to Bai et al. [11], on different tasks, the BERT accuracy goes down from 3% to 7% when quantized to 4 bits, and another 4% to 13% when quantized to 2 bits. Besides, NLP models have large opportunities for activation pruning and quantization because of the redundancy of human languages. Multiple on-the-fly pruning methods are proposed to reduce the redundancy by token/head pruning [97,146,209,292,294,298]. Specifically, SpAtten [298] proposes cascade token/head pruning to reduce both DRAM access and computation. It prunes the tokens according to cumulative token importance scores obtained by accumulating attention probabilities (indicators for token influence) across layers.",

            "text": "Model compression is a group of methods (such as pruning, parameter sharing, quantization, knowledge distillation and low-rank factorization) for shrinking the size of deep learning models without significantly affecting their accuracy or performance by eliminating extraneous components, such as duplicated parameters or layers. Due to deep learning models' high computational and storage needs, model compression has become more and more crucial. These methods are created to make it possible to deploy complicated models on devices with limited resources or in large-scale distributed systems with constrained processing, memory, and storage. To enhance the efficacy and efficiency of deep learning models in various applications, it is possible to employ these techniques either in isolation or in conjunction. For instance, a classic example of combining multiple techniques is Deep Compression, which combines techniques such as pruning, quantization, and Huffman coding to achieve significant compression of deep neural networks (DNN) [119]. \n\n1) Model Pruning: DNN models typically consist of numerous parameters and hierarchies, making them computationally and storage-intensive. Due to their frequent application in scenarios with limited resources, such as mobile devices, it is imperative that these models are smaller in size and require less computational power to perform optimally. Pruning is a prevalent model compression technique that reduces the model's size by eliminating extraneous layers or parameters, thereby enhancing its efficiency and reasoning speed. Addi-tionally, pruning helps to prevent overfitting and bolsters the model's ability to generalize. \n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing pruning techniques for AI models to reduce their size and improve their efficiency, particularly for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Various research efforts have been undertaken to address this challenge. For instance, Xu et al.

Although these models have remarkable capabilities, they are computation-and memory-intensive, making their deployment on resourceconstrained devices challenging. To address this challenge, model compression has become a widely adopted technique to reduce model size and complexity. \n\nCommon compression techniques, such as model distillation (Gu et al., 2024;Magister et al., 2023;Jiang et al., 2023b;Huang et al., 2022;Qiu et al., 2024), pruning (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;2022;Ma et al., 2023;Sun et al., 2024;Jiang et al., 2024;Petri et al., 2023), and quantization (Lin et al., 2024;Zhao et al., 2024;Ashkboos et al., 2024;Xiao et al., 2023;Sun et al., 2023), early-exit (Pan et al., 2024;Wang et al., 2024a) etc. have been extensively studied. While such techniques are effective in many scenarios, these methods often require hardware modification and expensive retraining. Compression techniques based on low-rank approximation with, e.g., Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (Yuan et al., 2023;Hsu et al., 2022;Wang et al., 2024b), provide a promising alternative since they are not restricted by such constraints. In SVD-based weight compression, a weight matrix in a layer is processed individually by decomposing it into three matrices. By removing small singular values in the decomposed diagonal matrix, the original weight matrix can be approximated with fewer number of weight values.",

Pruning has emerged as a pivotal compression strategy, introducing sparsity to enhance both memory and computational efficiency. Yet, traditional global pruning is impractical for LLMs due to scalability issues, while local pruning, despite its efficiency, leads to suboptimal solutions. Addressing these challenges, we propose SparseLLM, a novel framework that redefines the global pruning process into manageable, coordinated subproblems, allowing for resource-efficient optimization with global optimality. SparseLLM's approach, which conceptualizes LLMs as a chain of modular functions and leverages auxiliary variables for problem decomposition, not only facilitates a pragmatic application on LLMs but also demonstrates significant performance improvements, particularly in high-sparsity regimes where it surpasses current state-of-the-art methods.",

            "text": "Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, achieving exceptional performance in tasks such as text understanding, generation, and reasoning (Zhao et al., 2023;Dubey et al., 2024;Brown et al., 2020). However, the computational and storage resources required for model deployment incur high costs and environmental impacts, limiting their accessibility in resource-constrained scenarios. Model compression techniques, such as quantization (Lin et al., 2024;Frantar et al., 2022), pruning (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Ma et al., 2023), and low-rank decomposition (Wang et al., 2024), are essential for reducing LLM size and computational demands. This paper focuses on structural pruning, which notably enhances inference efficiency in a hardware-agnostic manner. \n\nExisting structural pruning methods for LLMs are typically classified into local and global techniques. Local pruning methods (Kurtic et al., 2023;Meng et al., 2024), which prune layers individually, enable efficient compression of hundred-billion-scale LLMs on a single GPU via offload approaches. However, they overlook global dependencies in model topology and restrict the sparsity to be uniform across layers. Global pruning methods (Ma et al., 2023;Kwon et al., 2022) alleviate local constraints, facilitating sparsity allocation and the potential for optimal pruning. However, they face resource constraints and rely on memoryintensive gradient backpropagation for saliency calculation. Moreover, by ranking structural saliency uniformly, they neglect inter-structure dependencies, hindering end-to-end optimization. Global pruning also poses a risk of overfitting with limited calibration data. Therefore, a question arises: \n\nHow to achieve efficient global structural pruning with endto-end optimization? \n\nTo address this challenge, we propose T\u00fdr-the-Pruner, an efficient search-based global pruning framework with endto-end optimization. Our framework constructs a supernet by applying local pruning to each layer, producing pruned copies with varying sparsity ratios.",

            "text": "Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across tasks from a range of domains (Grattafiori et al., 2024;Groeneveld et al., 2024;Yang et al., 2024). Behind this success lies a recipe with two key ingredients: highly parameterized models and extensive training. However, the vast scale of these models presents substantial challenges in their deployment and application (Treviso et al., 2023;Zhu et al., 2024). Luccioni et al. (2024) suggest that the trend towards generalpurpose models has introduced substantial yet potentially unnecessary inference costs. \n\nModel compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, are foundational approaches aimed at reducing the computational footprint of LMs during inference (Zhu et al., 2024). Quantization represents weights (and/or activations) with lower precision, while pruning removes less important weights. Notably, recent work has shown the successful application of quantization (Frantar et al., 2023;Lin et al., 2024) and pruning (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2024) to generalpurpose LMs without any additional training. \n\nLM compression studies typically focus on preserving general-purpose performance, i.e. language modeling and commonsense reasoning capabilities (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023;Ma et al., 2023;Sun et al., 2024). However, in practice, LMs may be deployed within only one particular domain, e.g. biomedical or legal (Labrak et al., 2024;Colombo et al., 2024;Ling et al., 2024;Chen et al., 2024). This scenario unlocks new paths towards improving inference efficiency by extracting domain-specific LMs from general-purpose models (Figure 1). \n\nRecently, Zhang et al. (2024) proposed D-Pruner, a pruning method aiming to preserve weights that are influential to both domain-specific and general capabilities. To identify such weights, D-Pruner leverages the gradient information from a composite loss function which incorporates general weight importance scores.",

            "text": "Pre-trained Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017;Devlin et al., 2019) have become a standard building block for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing robust language representations which can be specialized on \"downstream\" classification and generation tasks. Despite their success, these models have large parameter counts, which limits their usability. Techniques for reducing these parameter counts and the corresponding computational overheads have become vital, especially given the recent breakneck pace of model growth (Radford et al., 2019;MTN).\n\nSeveral compression approaches are known for large language models (LLMs). One example is Knowledge Distillation (KD) (Hinton et al., 2015), which led to smaller models like DistillBERT (Sanh et al., 2019), MobileBERT (Sun et al., 2020), and TinyBERT (Jiao et al., 2020) which approximate the original model with minor accuracy changes. Other work has leveraged lower-precision representations to produce quantized models such as Q8BERT (Zafrir et al., 2019), Ternary-BERT (Zhang et al., 2020), and Q-BERT (Shen et al., 2020). An orthogonal approach, which is our primary focus, has been to apply fine-grained methods such as unstructured pruning to produce model families such as SparseBERT (Xu et al., 2021) and PruneBERT , which compress by removing individual weights. Figure 1 provides a comparative overview of state-of-the-art results for unstructured pruning on a standard model (BERT-base).\n\nWe investigate improved methods for unstructured and semi-structured (block) pruning approaches at BERT scale, by leveraging the second-order (curvature) approach pioneered by the Optimal Brain Surgeon framework (LeCun et al., 1989). We put our results in the context of a compound compression framework, which combines unstructured pruning with structured pruning and quantization, showing that these methods can be complementary. To realize these compression gains in practice, we tailor the resulting compressed models to execute efficiently on a sparsity-aware CPUbased runtime engine (NeuralMagic, 2021), leading to order",

            "text": "What is the next to train more efficient edge models remains an open challenge. \n\nIn parallel, LLM compression (Ashkboos et al., 2024a;Gu et al., 2024;Ashkboos et al., 2024b) focuses on retaining the performance of larger and stronger models while reducing computational cost. Despite its protential efficiency, existing methods (Sreenivas et al., 2024;Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Xiao et al., 2023) compress LLM only using a small calibration dataset in post-training, which often results in significant performance degradation, making them unsuitable for top-quality edge language models. Recently, ShearedLlama (Xia et al., 2023) initializes from an optimized LLM, improving training efficiency. However, the constrained optimization (Platt & Barr, 1987) hinders scaling up pruning stage and the performance gap to direct pretraining still remains. This work extends the performance boundary of traditional LLM compression by scaling up training data, which is underexplored but essential in this field. \n\nThis work proposes the pruning-aware pretraining to extend the efficiency boundary of edge language models. A family of top-efficiency edge language models in 100M \u223c 1B sizes are pretrained, named EfficientLLM. As shown in Fig. 1, we fomulate pruning-aware pretraining as a bi-level optimization problem, and decouple the LLM pruning at every pretraining step. Driven by saliency, the overall architecture can be auto-designed (Zoph et al., 2018;Yu et al., 2020) according to predefined pruning space step by step. Compared with direct pretraining, pruning-aware pretraining leverages the performance of much larger optimized models, which direct pretraining smaller models never achieves. Compared with post-training pruning, it scales up the pruning stage with pretraining data. As shown in Fig. 2, pruning-aware pretraining scales up vanilla LLM-Pruner, achieving more than a 10% increase in accuracy.",

Their consistent and remarkable performance spans a wide array of tasks (Brown et al., 2020b;Chung et al., 2022;Touvron et al., 2023a;b;Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023;OpenAI, 2023;Anil et al., 2023). For a long time, pruning has been identified as a powerful technique for reducing the size or complexity of a model by removing unnecessary or redundant components (LeCun et al., 1989;Hassibi et al., 1993a). Pruning can be divided into structured and unstructured pruning. Structured pruning targets at removing a set of weights from a network at once such as channels or layers to reduce the model size and complexity while maintaining the network structure intact. In the realm of pruning LLMs, several studies (Frantar & Alistarh, 2022;2023;Sun et al., 2023) have been undertaken in this area. Our work provides a unique angle from gradient along this direction.",

Aggressive post-training model compression is necessary to reduce the models' size, but it often results in significant accuracy loss. To address this challenge, we propose a novel network pruning technology that utilizes over 0.7 sparsity and less than 8 bits of quantization. Our approach enables the compression of prevailing LLMs within a couple of hours while maintaining a relatively small accuracy loss. In experimental evaluations, our method demonstrates effectiveness and potential for practical deployment. By making LLMs available on domestic devices, our work can facilitate a new era of natural language processing applications with wide-ranging impacts.",

The success of LLMs can in part be attributed to their massive scale-state-ofthe-art models like GPT-3 [Brown et al., 2020] and OPT-175B [Zhang et al., 2022a] have hundreds of billions of parameters. However, this enormous size comes at a steep cost in terms of storage and computational resources. For instance, the OPT-175B model requires at least 320 GB of memory to store its parameters in half-precision (FP16) format, necessitating the use of multiple high-end GPUs for inference [Frantar and Alistarh, 2023]. To make LLMs more accessible and efficient, considerable efforts have been made to compress these models, with a particular emphasis on model quantization techniques [Lin et al., 2023, Behdin et al., 2023, Dettmers et al., 2023]. \n\nNetwork pruning [LeCun et al., 1989, Hassibi and Stork, 1992, Han et al., 2015], a complementary approach to quantization, has received comparatively less attention in the realm of LLMs. Pruning aims to reduce the model size by identifying and removing redundant or less important weights, resulting in a sparser and more efficient network. Traditional pruning methods rely on iterative retraining to recover accuracy after each pruning stage [Han et al., 2015, Luo et al., 2017, Molchanov et al., 2016, Liu et al., 2018], which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.",

            "text": "To reduce the inference cost of pre-trained transformer models, a variety of compression techniques have been proposed, including weight pruning [8,19,30], quantization [4,17,31] and distillation [15,29]. Token-level pruning has been shown to complement knowledge distillation and quantization [18]. Here, we focus on pruning and distillation and briefly discuss the related work. \n\nWeight pruning is categorized into 1) unstructured and 2) structured pruning. Unstructured methods [8,30] achieve high sparsity without accuracy drop but offer minimal latency benefits due to irregular sparse patterns. In contrast, structured pruning removes coherent weight groups, reducing latency without special hardware support. CoFi [40] achieves 10\u00d7 speedup with a small accuracy drop by jointly pruning layers, attention heads, FFN, and hidden units. SwiftPruner [44] is a latency-aware pruning method that finds optimal layer-wise pruning policies under a given latency requirement through AutoML. However, structure pruning may result in a loss of accuracy when the deployment requirements are highly constrained and the downstream task has a long input sequence. This is because the model complexity increases quadratically with token length. When the token length is long, the original model must be compressed to a high ratio, which can cause accuracy loss. \n\nKnowledge distillation [12,32,33] aims to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a small student model. It is well known that model pruning with a distillation objective can significantly improve accuracy [19,30]. Common distillation objectives include cross-entropy loss for output probability distributions [12,29] and MSE loss for layer-wise representations [15,32,40]. However, the combination of distillation with token pruning has not been widely explored. Our aim is to transfer the knowledge of token importance rankings from the teacher's final layer to the early layers of the student model during token pruning, which poses a new challenge and requires new distillation objective functions.",

            "title": "Task-specific Compression for Multi-task Language Models using Attribution-based Pruning",
            "text": "Various pre-trained language models with largescale data and parameters have emerged (Devlin et al., 2018;Lewis et al., 2019;Raffel et al., 2019;Brown et al., 2020). Specifically, pre-trained language models like T5 (Raffel et al., 2019) and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) have shown outstanding performance on many natural language understanding tasks. These language models can perform various tasks with a single model by treating every text processing problem as a text generation problem. However, these language models may utilize unnecessary large-scale model parameters even when performing only a specific task. Previous works have introduced various compression methods for language models such as pruning (Chen et al., 2020;Goyal et al., 2020;He et al., 2021), knowledge distillation (Sanh et al., 2019;Hou et al., 2020;Mao et al., 2020;Sun et al., 2020), quantization (Shen et al., 2020), and low-rank factorization (Liu et al., 2021). However, these studies have (1) not compressed the language models taskspecifically or (2) demanded an additional training process like the case of knowledge distillation. This additional training process requires excessive computing resources and a massive training dataset. Furthermore, this training process can destroy inherent pre-trained knowledge in language models since it updates the model's pre-trained parameters (Toneva et al., 2018). Due to the catastrophic forgetting (McCloskey and Cohen, 1989) caused by pre-trained knowledge destruction, models which are compressed and trained for a specific task, tend to show degraded performance on solving other pre-trained tasks (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017;Ritter et al., 2018). Also, additional memory space is required to store the trained parameters separately. \n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel training-free attribution-based task-specific pruning method that enables more efficient compression and inference by extracting only task-specific parameters from multi-task language models.",

            "text": "Channel pruning in natural language processing (NLP) refers to a method for reducing the computational complexity and memory requirements of neural models by eliminating excess or redundant channels.In many tasks of NLP, like text classification or sentiment analysis, neural networks often employ convolutional layers to extract meaningful features from textual data.These convolutional layers consist of multiple channels, each responsible for detecting specific patterns or linguistic features.However, not all channels contribute equally to the network's performance, and some may even be redundant.Channel pruning aims to identify and remove these redundant channels, thereby reducing the model's overall complexity without significantly sacrificing accuracy.Channel pruning extends the idea of filter pruning to the entire channels of convolutional layers.A channel in a convolutional layer refers to the output of a single filter applied to the entire input.Instead of pruning individual filters, channel pruning prunes entire sets of filters (channels) from the network, leading to a more significant reduction in computational cost.In NLP models, channel pruning involves removing entire sets of learned features.The process of channel pruning is shown in Fig. 4.\n\nThe process typically involves evaluating the importance or contribution of each channel through methods like magnitude-based pruning or sensitivity analysis.Pruned models can generate significant computational reductions, making them more effective for use in large-scale NLP applications or on devices with limited resources.\n\nYu and Wu [37] introduces Unified Pruning Framework for Vision Transformers (UP-ViTs), a unified pruning framework for vision transformers, to address issues like large model sizes, memory consumption, and computational costs.Existing vision transformer pruning methods involve token sampling, which hampers generalization and is challenging to apply to NLP tasks.UP-ViTs prunes channels in a unified manner, covering all transformer components.It evaluates the importance scores of each filter in a pre-trained ViT and removes redundant channels based on compression goals.The approach maintains token representation consistency, ensuring generalization to downstream tasks.UP-ViTs outperform previous ViTs with higher throughput and can be extended to transformers in NLP tasks, showing improvements on language modeling benchmarks.",

Additionally, SliceGPT [1] has pioneered post-training sparsification, emphasizing the importance of layer removal order for optimal performance. Quantization techniques offer another significant avenue for compression. GPTQ [11] applies layer-wise quantization and reduces quantization errors through secondorder error compensation. AWQ [22] introduces activationaware weight quantization, employing a scale transformation between weights and activations. Moreover, BiLLM [19] and ARB-LLM [21] achieve further compression to 1-bit while maintaining remarkable performance.",

            "text": "Pruning methods stand out as notably simple and efficient mechanisms for model compression, serving to eliminate weights contingent on their significance. Reduced models can be conveniently dispatched to edge devices, and also exhibit substantially Preprint lower energy consumption, a sizable portion of energy is expended in transferring model parameters from a device's long-term storage to its memory (Dao et al., 2022). \n\nHowever, given the constraints of training-free conditions, existing solutions for pruning LLMs primarily employ either weight magnitude (Han et al., 2015a;2016) or a combination of magnitude and activation (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Sun et al., 2023). While these methods are substantiated with empirical ablations and experiments, they are, to a degree, either too complex to use like SparseGPT by computing matrix inverses and updating weights, or heuristic and lack profound theoretical justification like Wanda, especially concerning the application to the recently developed, highly advanced large language models. \n\nIn this study, we tackle the aforementioned complexity and interpretability challenges in LLM pruning methods by presenting a simple yet effective approach named GBLM-Pruner (Gradient-Based Language Model Pruner) that can be well explained in theory using the adapted optimal brain surgeon (OBS) (Hassibi et al., 1993b). This method proficiently prunes LLMs to significant levels of sparsity, eliminating the necessity to alter the residual weights. Specifically, we employ normalization of gradients across various samples to formulate an indicator matrix. This matrix can serve as activations and can either replace or supplement them. This method maintains simplicity over SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023) while showcasing enhanced robustness and improved interpretation than Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) on large language models. Furthermore, it is notable that although we employ gradients in our approach, there is no necessity for retraining or any updates to parameters. \n\nDifference to Previous Gradient-based Methods.",

(2020)), tensor decomposition and sub-quadratic complexity transformers. \n\nFairness Google Brain (Hooker et al., 2020) tries to characterize compression's impact on fairness for vision models. They tests quantization and pruning techniques and argue that though compressed models achieve similar overall error rate, but fairness is compromised because performance of samples with under-represented features is sacrificed after compression. Researchers from University of Utah (Joseph et al., 2020) proposes adding fairness into the compression objective function for vision tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work has been done studying Knowledge Distillation method, nor are there any compression fairness studies on NLP models. \n\nCompression as regularization (Fan et al., 2020) introduces a compression method for transformers named structured dropout, which is shown to achieve higher performance than distillation and weight pruning. The method assumes that transformer models are over-parametrized and sub-structures of the original model could achieve equivalent performances, plus that smaller networks will enjoy the benefit of regularization. Many studies (Jord\u00e3o and Pedrini (2021), Bartoldson et al. (2020)) also argue that pruning of Convolutional Neural Networks serves as a way of regularization. \n\nCompression for robust learning The seminal work of (Papernot et al., 2016) introduces Knowledge Distillation as a defense against adversarial perturbations. Following works continue to use Knowledge Distillation to improve generalization (Arani et al., 2019) and robustness (Goldblum et al. (2020)). Knowledge Distillation is also used to improve models on privacy protection (Shejwalkar and Houmansadr (2019), Zhao and Caragea (2021)).",

            "text": "Model pruning [19,12] has been at the frontier of deep-learning research since the early developments in this field. It has found practical applications not only in reducing the model size but also in enhancing the interpretability of the models under study. The same holds true for pruning large language models (LLMs). \n\nA significant number of studies focuses on unstructured pruning, where individual weights within matrices throughout the model are zeroed out, resulting in sparse connections. SparseGPT [9] tackles the challenge of layer-wise reconstruction in pruning by leveraging approximations of the inverse Hessian matrix. Wanda [37] improves the SparseGPT idea of reducing computations via simplification of the Hessian approximation. The LLM Surgeon [40] uses Kronecker-factored curvature approximations to perform pruning of LLMs. Despite maintaining high model quality post-pruning, computational savings from unstructured pruning requires specialized hardware support for sparse computations, limiting its wide applicability. \n\nIn contrast, structured pruning involves the complete elimination of certain structures inside the network. In this context, removing entire attention heads or MLP channels is referred to as width pruning. LLM-Pruner [25] suggested to calculate an importance metric based on the difference in the loss when this is computed with and without a pruned group of weights, respectively. FLAP [1] proposed a training free approach that is based on a fluctuation pruning metric and an adaptive compression ratio. \n\nAnother typical strategy within structured pruning, which is also the focus of this work, is depth pruning. Methods that fall in this category, aim to remove entire transformer layers of the network. In Shortened llama [15], the authors suggested to identify the significance of each decoder layer using perplexity analysis and a Taylor metric. This Taylor metric is based on a similar idea with the LLM-Pruner importance metirc, that is it measures the difference of the model loss when it is computed with and without a pruned layer. After pruning, the authors [15] further propose to do healing through LoRA fine-tuning, continual pre-training, or their combination.",

Interestingly, pruning can sometimes even enhance accuracy by removing noise that accumulates during training, particularly through matrix decompositions. However, recent work has primarily focused on single matrix decompositions or lower precision techniques, which may fail to fully capture structural patterns. To address these limitations, we introduce TRAWL (Tensor Reduced and Approximated Weights for Large Language Models), a technique that applies tensor decomposition across multiple weight matrices to effectively denoise LLMs by capturing global structural patterns. Our experiments show that TRAWL improves model performance by up to 16% over baseline models on benchmark datasets, without requiring additional data, training, or fine-tuning.",

Despite their significant capabilities, these models are computationally and memory-intensive, posing deployment challenges on resourcelimited devices. To mitigate these challenges, model compression (Gupta & Agrawal, 2022;Zhu et al., 2023) has emerged as a popular post-training solution, reducing model size and complexity. \n\nPredominant compression techniques encompass model distillation (Sun et al., 2019;2020;Pan et al., 2020), pruning (LeCun et al., 1989;Hassibi et al., 1993;Suzuki et al., 2018;Wang et al., 2019b;Zafrir et al., 2021;Xia et al., 2022;Kurtic et al., 2022;Ma et al., 2023;van der Ouderaa et al., 2023), matrix decomposition (Hsu et al., 2022;Noach & Goldberg, 2020;Golub & Reinsch, 1971), and quantization (Gholami et al., 2022;Bai et al., 2020;Frantar et al., 2022;Wang et al., 2023). This study focuses on matrix decomposition techniques that require minimal computing resources and do not involve backward propagation as seen in recovery fine-tuning (RFT) or Fisher matrix calculations from Taylor expansion (Ma et al., 2023;van der Ouderaa et al., 2023). Conven-tional matrix decomposition such as SVD typically splits each matrix W \u2208 R d\u00d7d into two low-rank matrices W = AB, requiring the rank less than d/2 to achieve true compression, as shown in Figure 1(b). This stringent requirement often results in a significant drop in accuracy, necessitating the use of RFT (Hsu et al., 2022).",

            "title": "On the Impact of Calibration Data in Post-training Quantization and Pruning",
            "text": "Model compression is the process of reducing the memory requirements of a model, usually enabling improved inference efficiency (Treviso et al., 2023). In the case of neural networks, model compression has a rich history, with origins in seminal work from LeCun et al. (1989).2 Quantization and pruning are two widely adopted approaches for model compression (Gholami et al., 2021;Hoefler et al., 2021). Pruning seeks to remove redundant weights, while quantization aims to represent the weights (and possibly activations) in lower precision. Applying these techniques to LLMs presents significant challenges, such as large-magnitude outlier features and high computational requirements (Dettmers et al., 2022;Frantar and Alistarh, 2023). \n\nPost-training compression considers the scenario where a model must be compressed without retraining, instead relying upon a small amount of calibration data (Nagel et al., 2020;Hubara et al., 2021). While quantization and pruning are distinct methods, they are connected in a post-training setting via the layer-wise compression problem (Frantar and Alistarh, 2022). This involves selecting compressed weights for each layer that function closely to the original weights, with respect to the calibration data. More formally, given layer \u2113 with weights W \u2113 and inputs X \u2113 , the aim is to minimize \n\n2 with respect to the compressed weights W. This is subject to a given compression constraint C( W \u2113 ) > C, which differs between quantization and pruning. \n\nRecently, a range of approaches have been proposed for the layer-wise compression problem. SparseGPT (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023) enables LLM pruning up to 60% sparsity, with little im-pact upon perplexity. This sequentially prunes the weights in each column of the weight matrix using a series of Hessian inverses, followed by updating the remaining weights. Wanda (Sun et al., 2024) significantly improves upon the efficiency of SparseGPT, avoiding the expensive computation of the inverse Hessian.",

However, the deployment of LLMs is constrained by their intensive computational demands. To make LLMs more accessible and efficient for practical use, various optimization strategies have been actively studied over recent years (see Zhu et al. (2023); Wan et al. (2023) for survey). * Equal contribution. \u2020 Corresponding author. (An et al., 2024) and LLM-Pruner (Ma et al., 2023), our depth pruning (D\u2702) achieves faster inference. Right: Continued pretraining is crucial for restoring the quality of heavily pruned models with fewer than 3.7B parameters, enabling our method to surpass the baselines, including SLEB (Song et al., 2024). See Table 3 for details. \n\nThis work focuses on structured pruning (Fang et al., 2023;Li et al., 2017a), which removes groups of unnecessary weights and can facilitate hardwareagnostic acceleration. \n\nIn the context of compressing recent LLMs, LLM-Pruner (Ma et al., 2023) and FLAP (An et al., 2024) narrow the network width by pruning coupled structures (e.g., attention heads and their associated weight connections) while maintaining the number of layers. Sheared-LLaMA (Xia et al., 2024) reduces not only the network width but also its depth by entirely removing some layers. Despite the existence of pruning methods (Xia et al., 2022;Kurtic et al., 2023;Xia et al., 2024) that incorporate both width and depth aspects, there remains a gap in detailed analysis comparing these two factors (width vs. depth), specifically in relation to their impact on LLM inference efficiency.",

Smyrnis and Maragos (2020) proposed a tropical division algorithm for structured network compression, further enhancing the capabilities of structured pruning techniques. Misiakos et al. (2022) developed Neural Path K-means, which uses clustering techniques based on tropical geometry and functional approximation for structured compression. \n\nBeyond pruning, other state-of-the-art strategies for network compression include parameter quantization and low-rank approximation. Parameter quantization, as explored by Zhou et al. (2017), Zhou et al. (2018) and Han et al. (2015), reduces the number of bits per parameter, significantly lowering memory and computational requirements. Behdin et al. (2023) presented an optimization-based framework for efficient post-training quantization of large language models. Polino et al. (2018) presented quantized distillation, a method that combines quantization with teacher-student distillation. Low-rank approximation (LRA) techniques decompose weight matrices into smaller matrices, reducing parameters and computations. Studies by Denton et al. (2014), Jaderberg et al. (2014), Sindhwani et al. (2015), Ioannou et al. (2016), Tai et al. (2016), andChen et al. (2018) have shown that LRA can achieve significant speedups and compression with minimal accuracy loss, although it typically requires iterative optimization. These methods can be combined with structured pruning approaches like ThiNet to achieve further model compression and efficiency. \n\nOur framework is a structured pruning method that extends the approach of Misiakos et al. (2022). It prunes networks layer-by-layer, aiming to minimize the error introduced to the input of the next layer. In that sense, it is similar to the ThiNet framework. However, our algorithm is simpler to implement and does not require a training dataset. Our framework leverages clustering and can be naturally extended to non-uniform pruning, drawing parallels to the CUP framework. In fact, it improves upon steps 1 and 3 of CUP.",

            "text": "In recent times, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown incredible performance over almost any language task [44,33,4]. However, their performance tends to grow with their sizes (i.e., the number of trainable parameters), which in turn is proportional to the computational burden required to train and then use such models. One way to reduce the computational cost of LLMs is through network pruning, i.e., algorithms that remove parameters while minimizing performance degradation. This approach has been extensively studied on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [13,25,43,11], but nowadays the focus has shifted towards pre-trained models [41,42,22]. This shift has required a change of paradigm in pruning techniques: in fact, while in CNNs the main paradigm is iterative pruning (with re-training) [13], with pre-trained models (such as LLMs) in most cases it is not possible to fully re-train such models, because (1) training data are often not accessible, and (2) full re-training would be anyway too expensive. This calls for \"exploiting\" as much as possible the information contained in a pre-trained model to obtain a performant sparse version of it, using weight's information [21], activations [40,39], or reconstruction error [15], without the need for re-training. More recently, a new category of pruning algorithms, which we may call top-up algorithms (i.e., methods that can be applied on top of a given pruning algorithm for LLMs), has emerged, aiming at further improving pruning performance. Such approaches can be divided into two categories: those that minimize the reconstruction error [18,45,49], and those that impose non-uniform sparsity distribution modifying the block-wise sparsity [46]. The latter category is extremely effective for improving performance in CNNs [14,38], while its application to LLMs is still limited [46].",

            "text": "Pre-trained Large Language models (LLMs) (Touvron et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2022;Scao et al., 2023;OpenAI et al., 2024) have demonstrated exceptional abilities in natural language understanding and generation, creating numerous avenues of applications across a wide range of domains such as healthcare, education and finance. These deep neural models are predominantly based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2023) and often contain several billions of parameters. Models like GPT-4, and larger variants of (> 65B parameters) LLaMA-2, and OPT can occupy as much as 350GB of memory in FP16 format, making them impractical for deploying to resourceconstrained environments such as mobile or edge devices. The need for dedicated GPUs, even for inference, restricts their applicability in real-time, low-resource scenarios, creating a barrier for broader adoption in industries where speed and efficiency are crucial. \n\nModel compression is a class of techniques that are widely used to reduce the computational overhead of LLMs. Two major subclasses of model compression are quantization and model pruning. \n\nWhile quantization is primarily used to reduce the precision points of the saved model weights, thereby reducing the memory footprint of the model, model pruning aims at pruning or dropping different neural components to make models smaller and faster during inference. Notable methods like post-training model pruning methods (Ashkboos et al., 2024;Yang et al., 2024)  Table 1: A summary of the experimental results. We highlight the effective sparsity ratio, along with total FLOPs (Floating Point Operations) and average zero-shot accuracy for different sparsity ratios with the LLaMA-2-7B model (see Table 2 for more details). Effective sparsity can be calculated as the ratio of the total number of parameters in the compressed model and that of the uncompressed model. SliceGPT achieves less effective sparsity with high FLOPs at a lower sparsity ratio (< 25%) as it learns the pruned parameters with a learnable network and retains them within the LLM.",

            "text": "Natural Language Processing technology, as a key bridge of human-computer interaction, is undergoing unprecedented changes.Especially, the advent of extensive, language models like BERT [1] and the successive iterations within the GPT [2] series has sparked a substantial leap forward.With their powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, these architectures have shown remarkable efficacy across various domains, including question-response systems [3][4][5], medical analysis [6][7][8], Semantic Mining [9], and so on.However, along with this increase in performance comes an exponential increase in model size, which not only places extremely high demands on computing resources, but also raises deep concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact.In the face of this situation, exploring and implementing efficient model optimization strategies has become the common pursuit of academia and industry.How to effectively reduce computing cost and improve resource utilization efficiency without sacrificing model performance has become a problem to be solved.This study aims to provide a systematic review and in-depth analysis for the efficiency optimization of large-scale language models.This paper begins by detailing the fundamental structure of modern, expansive language models and their pivotal function in tasks related to natural language processing.We then discuss the efficiency bottlenecks in model training and reasoning in detail.By analyzing advanced techniques such as adaptive optimization algorithms, massively parallel computing, and mixed-precision training, this study reveals how these methods can accelerate the training process and reduce resource consumption while maintaining the model's learning ability.Additionally, we explore comprehensively the application of model compression methods [10], including pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation [11], to realize model miniaturization and enhance inference speed while maintaining predictive precision.On this basis, this paper not only stops at the technical level of the summary, but further critically evaluates the limitations and potential negative effects of existing optimization strategies, indicating the direction for future research.We emphasize the importance of ensuring the generalization ability of algorithms, maintaining the performance stability of models after compression, and exploring environmentally friendly technologies while pursuing efficiency.",

            "text": "Pruning is a long-established technique for model compression that reduces the size of a model by removing unnecessary or less important parameters [61,90]. In language models, many weights can be zeroed out or eliminated with little to no effect on overall performance [18]. By pruning these redundant parameters, we can significantly shrink model size and accelerate inference, with only a minor drop in accuracy if done carefully. Pruning thus makes models more storage-friendly, memoryefficient, and computation-efficient. Based on the granularity of removal, pruning is categorized as unstructured pruning and structured pruning. \n\nStructured pruning streamlines LLM by eliminating entire architectural components-such as neurons, filter channels, attention heads, or even layers-instead of removing individual parameters [126,198]. By selectively pruning structurally coherent groups of parameters, this approach yields a smaller yet regularly structured model-maintaining dense connectivity while reducing inference costs, for instance, LLM-Pruner [126]. Unstructured pruning removes individual weights from LLM without considering any specific structure within the model [41]. Unstructured pruning removes less important weights based on a threshold, resulting in a sparse model where the architecture remains unchanged, as long as enough weights stay to maintain performance. Unstructured pruning can deliver higher accuracy for a given compression ratio by allowing more targeted weight removal. However, its irregular sparsity pattern leads to inefficient memory access and limited speed-ups on standard hardware. To fully leverage the compression benefits, specialized libraries or hardware are needed, and even then, acceleration gains are modest unless the model is highly sparse. Post unstructured pruning, significant retraining or fine-tuning is often required to recover lost accuracy that can be resource-intensive. \n\nDiscussion on pruning: Contextual pruning is a promising method for building domain-specific language models [177]. Recent research has focused on one-shot pruning methods and improved criteria to minimize the need for costly retraining [211], validating its performance for healthcare tasks.",

            "text": "Compression of Language Model. Language models [9,29,25] have gained much attention and increase the need to reduce the size of parameters and reduce the latency [23,46]. To compress the language model, previous works can be divided into several categories: network pruning [21,61,30,15], knowledge distillation [44,45,38], quantization [63,1,66] and other techniques, like early exit [60] or dynamic token reduction [64]. We focus on the pruning of the language models, especially structural pruning [26]. Structural pruning removes the entire filter from the neural network, which is more hardware friendly. There are several ways to remove the structure, such as l1-dependent pruning [16,67], first-order importance estimation [18], hessian-based estimation [21,52] or the optimal brain surgeon [24,21]. As for the pruning unit in structural pruning, some works adopt the entire layer [10] as the minimal unit, and others take the multi-head attention [50] or the feed-forward layers [18,34] as the basic structure to prune. CoFi [59] studies the pruning unit in different granularity. \n\nEfficient and Low Resource Compression. With the growing size of models, there is an increasing demand for efficient LLM compression and compression is independent of the original training data. \n\nAs for the efficient compression, [22] accelerate the post-training by defining the reconstruction error as a linear least squares problem. [13,12] propose the layer-wise optimal brain surgeon. As for the constraint of availability of the training corpus, data-free pruning [43,65] come up with several strategies to prune the model by measuring neurons' similarity. Besides, [32,31,40] proposes methods that distill the model without reliance on the training corpus of the model. However, those methods are too time-consuming, involving synthesizing samples by backpropagating the pre-trained language models.",

            "text": "In contrast to moderate-size neural network pruning, structural weight pruning on the Large-Language Models (LLMs) imposes a novel challenge on the efficiency of the pruning algorithms, due to the heavy computation/memory demands of the LLMs. Recent efficient LLM pruning methods typically operate at the post-training phase without the expensive weight finetuning, however, their pruning criteria often rely on heuristically hand-crafted metrics, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. We instead propose a novel optimization-based structural pruning that learns the pruning masks in a probabilistic space directly by optimizing the loss of the pruned model. To preserve the efficiency, our method eliminates the back-propagation through the LLM per se during the optimization, requiring only the forward pass of the LLM. We achieve this by learning an underlying Bernoulli distribution to sample binary pruning masks, where we decouple the Bernoulli parameters from the LLM loss, thus facilitating an efficient optimization via a policy gradient estimator without back-propagation. As a result, our method is able to 1) operate at structural granularities of channels, heads, and layers, 2) support global and heterogeneous pruning (i.e., our method automatically determines different redundancy for different layers), and 3) optionally initialize with a metric-based method (for our Bernoulli distributions). Extensive experiments on LLaMA, LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Vicuna, and Mistral using the C4 and WikiText2 datasets demonstrate that our method operates for 2.7 hours with around 35GB memory for the 13B models on a single A100 GPU, and our pruned models outperform the state-of-the-arts w.r.t. both perplexity and the majority of various zero-shot tasks.

            "text": "We introduce AMP, a novel structured pruning method designed to efficiently identify and eliminate less critical components (attention heads and MLP neurons) from Large Language Models (LLMs), producing highly optimized models. Moreover, our coherence check confirms that AMP correctly ranks the importance of each component. Particularly, when our method removes components ranked as more critical (those it should preserve), the model performance drastically decreases. In addition, our method is computationally efficient, requiring only a few minutes on a consumer-grade GPU (NVIDIA RTX 3090) to identify the components for removal. \n\nThrough extensive experiments, we show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art structured pruning approaches. Specifically, AMP surpasses existing techniques by a large margin, achieving mean accuracy improvements of up to 4.81 pp for LLaMA 7B and 9.52 pp for LLaMA-2 7B. Furthermore, perplexity evaluation on WikiText2 corroborates the results by demonstrating the consistency of AMP across many compression rates. Notably, AMP achieves up to 1.25\u00d7 inference speedup without requiring specialized hardware, further enhancing efficiency and sustainability. Finally, apart from these benefits, our method aligns with Green AI principles, emphasizing the role of AMP in reducing the computational costs of LLMs. \n\nLast but not least, we present evidence of the significance of the post-training stage in restoring model performance after pruning, corroborating previous work [24]. In this context, we hypothesize that extending post-training on larger datasets would yield even greater performance, a direction we plan to explore in future work.",

            "text": "Sparsity-driven techniques, often associated with model pruning, form an energetic subset of research primarily in the pursuit of model compression. At their core, these methods focus on the elimination of less influential neurons while retaining the more critical ones, thereby sustaining optimal model performance (LeCun, Denker, and Solla 1990a;Han, Mao, and Dally 2016;Han et al. 2015;LeCun, Denker, and Solla 1990b;Liu et al. 2017;He, Zhang, and Sun 2017;Zhou, Alvarez, and Porikli 2016). Contemporary research has shed light on the heightened robustness of pruned models against adversarial conditions, such as overfitting and distribution shifts. Typical pruning methods for language models encompass structured pruning (Michel, Levy, and Neubig 2019), fine-grained structured pruning (Lagunas et al. 2021), and unstructured pruning (Gale, Elsen, and Hooker 2019). In brief, unstructured pruning removes individual weights in a network, leading to a sparse matrix, structured pruning eliminates entire structures like neurons or layers for a dense model, while fine-grained structured pruning prunes smaller structures like channels or weight vectors, offering a balance between the previous two. We direct the readers to the benchmark (Liu et al. 2023) for a comprehensive overview. In our case, we focus on unstructured pruning for its effectiveness and better interpretability. \n\nRecently, studies have underscored the interpretability afforded by sparse networks (Subramanian et al. 2018). For instance, Meister et al. (2021) delve into the interpretability of sparse attention mechanisms in language models, Liu et al. (2022) incorporate sparse contrastive learning in an ancillary sparse coding layer to facilitate word-level interpretability, and Oikarinen et al. (2023) demonstrate that a sparsity constraint on the final linear predictor enhances concept-level interpretation of CBMs. Despite their effectiveness, these frameworks restrict sparsity to a handful of layers, leading to unidimensional interpretability that falls short of the desired comprehensiveness.",

[50] investigate the use of unstructured pruning in the context of recurrent neural networks (RNNs).The authors want to know how weight pruning affects RNNs and suggest a structured regularisation strategy to encourage sparsity in these networks.By exploring the potential of unstructured pruning, they aim to reduce the number of parameters in RNNs while minimizing the impact on performance.The study begins by highlighting the significance of sparsity in deep learning models, especially in scenarios where computational and memory resources are limited.RNNs, being widely used in various NLP tasks such as language modeling and sequence generation, can benefit from pruning techniques to alleviate the computational burden and improve efficiency.However, the unique recurrent structure of RNNs poses challenges in applying traditional pruning methods effectively.To address these challenges, Narang et al. propose a structured regularization technique that encourages sparsity in RNNs.This regularization technique introduces a penalty term based on the L1 norm of the weights, encouraging a large number of them to be set to zero.",

            "title": "SLEB: Streamlining LLMs through Redundancy Verification and Elimination of Transformer Blocks",
            "text": "Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3, OPT, and LLaMA demonstrate exceptional proficiency in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks and have become key components in applications like chatbots and questionanswering systems (Brown et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2022;Chowdhery et al., 2022;Touvron et al., 2023a;b). However, their substantial number of parameters creates significant challenges in deploying these models for real-world services, especially due to the increased memory consumption and computational demands. This limitation restricts their widespread use. Consequently, it is critical to develop techniques that improve the compactness and processing efficiency of LLMs while preserving their linguistic prowess. \n\nNetwork pruning is a technique aimed at reducing the size and complexity of neural networks by eliminating redundant weight parameters (LeCun et al., 1989;Hassibi et al., 1993;Han et al., 2015). Its application in LLMs has been somewhat limited, primarily due to challenges that arise in managing sparse matrices (Frantar & Alistarh, 2022;Sun et al., 2023;Frantar & Alistarh, 2023;Zhang et al., 2024). This complexity becomes particularly evident when using modern GPU hardware, as these systems are typically optimized for operations involving dense matrices (Wang, 2020;Shi et al., 2020). \n\nIn the realm of LLMs, a significant similarity in output is observed among successive transformer blocks (Din et al., 2023;Liu et al., 2023). This similarity arises because each transformer block incrementally contributes to the residual path spanning the entire LLM. Figure 1 depicts the typical architecture of conventional LLMs, characterized by a continuous stack of transformer blocks. A key aspect of LLM computation is the residual path that traverses the entire network, a feature introduced to stabilize the backpropagation process during training. Consequently, each transformer block contributes its computational outputs, derived from both the attention mechanisms and feed-forward In this paper, we propose SLEB, a novel approach designed to streamline LLMs by identifying and eliminating redundant transformer blocks. Figure 2 compares the proposed approach with previous pruning methods.",

Extensive experiments on benchmarks (GLUE and SQuAD) show that SP3 can reduce d by 70%, compress 94% of the BERTbase model, maintain over 96% accuracy, and outperform other methods that compress d by 6% in accuracy at the same compression ratio.

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT (Floridi & Chiriatti, 2020), and Llama (Touvron et al., 2023) excel in various language-modeling tasks. Finetuning these for specific downstream tasks enhances personalized experiences (Sanh et al., 2021;Labrak et al., 2024) and has become a standard practice in natural language processing (Dodge et al., 2020;Zhao et al., 2023). Indeed, most entries on the OpenLLM Leaderboard involve full-parameter finetunes or their combinations (Liu et al., 2024), underscoring the widespread adoption and availability of fine-tuned models online. Decomposing fine-tuned model weights into the original parameters of the pre-trained model yields delta parameters (DP) (Yu et al., 2023a;Liu et al., 2024;Yao & Klimovic, 2023). Reducing the size of DPs, which are as large as the base model and can number in the hundreds of millions of parameters for LLMs, could significantly enhance communication efficiency in federated learning, minimize task conflicts in model merging, accelerate multi-task serving, and decrease storage needs for new fine-tuned models (see Related Work). Delta-parameter pruning (DPP) drops a fraction p of the DPs towards realizing these benefits. Naturally, DPP can be seen as an instance of generic model-parameter pruning, which compresses neural networks by eliminating weights that contribute minimally, resulting in sparse architectures (LeCun et al., 1989;Han et al., 2015b). Traditional pruning methods typically remove weights post-training based on importance criteria like weight magnitude or activation levels. While these techniques could naturally extend to DPP, their integration into this context remains largely unexplored. Random-based pruning strategies, which provide more flexibility and efficiency in implementation, also offer a competitive alternative. For instance, Random Drop and Rescale (DARE) (Yu et al., 2023a), a recently introduced randomized DPP method, reduces DP size through random pruning followed by rescaling.",

            "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to complex reasoning. However, their increasing size-from GPT-3's 175 billion parameters to GPT-4's estimated trillions-presents significant deployment challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments. \n\nRecent years have seen the development of various compression approaches, which are usually either training-aware or post-training. These approaches include low-rank matrix factorization, which reduces parameter count by decomposing weight matrices [1]; knowledge distillation, which transfers knowledge from larger to smaller models [2]; pruning, which removes less important connections [3]; and quantization, which reduces the precision of model weights [4]. The field has evolved from modest to aggressive techniques, with quantization being pushed to its limits through 1-bit representations [5], though such extremes often struggle to preserve model performance, particularly on complex reasoning tasks. \n\nComplementary to parameter-focused compression are graph optimization techniques (e.g., ONNX, TensorRT), which improve inference efficiency through computational graph transformations without directly modifying model parameters. \n\nThe challenge of evaluating compressed models adds another layer of complexity. Traditional metrics like perplexity have been shown to correlate poorly with actual model capabilities, especially under compression. As demonstrated by [6], perplexity often fails to capture subtle degradation in knowledge-intensive tasks even when compressed models maintain similar perplexity scores to their dense counterparts. Moreover, recent studies have shown an inverse relationship between model size and information density, with larger models often having lower parameter efficiency [7]. This phenomenon manifests in compression experiments, where larger models demonstrate disproportionately high compression rates that may not generalize to more efficient architectures. This can lead to overstated claims, as seen with techniques like SparseGPT reporting extreme pruning rates primarily based on perplexity metrics [8], potentially misrepresenting their general applicability. Notably, empirical evidence suggests model capability density doubles every three months through algorithmic improvements [7], indicating a clear trend toward more efficient architectures and training methodologies. \n\nRather than pursuing ever more extreme forms of standalone compression, a promising direction may lie in combining multiple approaches.",

When the target model size is reached, the pruning-aware pretraining requires 2.5B, 4.5B, 8.4B, and 72.1B tokens of pretraining, respectively. Fig. 5 indicates that scaling up pruning-aware pretraining continuously improves pruning performance. Therefore, by scaling up LLM pruning during pretraining, the upper boundary of LLM compression can be extended. \n\nGeneralization. There is a large number of methods that perform post-training pruning based on second-order Taylor expansion, such as OBC and SparseGPT. As shown in Fig. 6, we generalize EfficientLLM to the second order updating case as EfficientLLM-B. Compared with post-training settings, EfficientLLM retains source model performance consistently in large pruning ratio. We observe similar performance of EfficientLLM-A/B in large scale pruning-aware pretrainning, but when the pruning data is small (< 1B), EfficientLLM-B significantly improves accuracy in Table 4. In this section, we conduct light-weight pruning-aware pretraining to compare with existing LLM pruning methods and ShearedLlama. Experiments reveal that only scaling up the pruning stage to 5B tokens can achieve much higher performance than what was possible previously (Table 3). \n\nTraditional LLM Pruning. We mainly focus on large pruning ratio because it is more practical to achieve highly efficiency based on heavy source LLMs. In Table 3, we scale up pruning-aware pretraining to only 5B tokens. We report both results with or without finetuning after pruning. \n\nBecause previous works finetune in different settings, we finetune additional 1B tokens if with it. Notice that, even without finetuning, EfficientLLM exceeds all the according baselines. It is shown that existing LLM pruning is impractical in large pruning ratio.",

            "text": "Deep neural networks (DNN) are in high demand because of their widespread applications in natural language processing, image processing, and a lot of other domains. However, due to their computational expense, over-parameterization, and large memory requirements, DNN applications often require the use of substantial model resources. This strict requirement of latency and limited memory availability are hurdles in the device deployment of these technologies. Therefore, a common idea could be to mitigate the DNN-based models\u2019 size without any performance degradation using different compression techniques. During the last few years, a great deal of progress has been made in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using deep learning approaches. The objective of this research is to offer a thorough overview of the various pruning methods applied in the context of NLP. In this paper, we review several recent pruning-based schemes used for converting standard networks into their compact and accelerated versions. Traditionally, pruning is a technique for improving latency, reducing model size, and computational complexity which is a viable approach to deal with the above-mentioned challenges. In general, these techniques are divided into two main categories: structural and unstructured pruning methods. Structural pruning methods are further classified into filter, channel, layer, block, and movement pruning. Whereas, neuron, magnitude-based, and iterative pruning lie in the category of unstructured pruning. For each method, we discuss the related metrics and benchmarks. Then recent work on each method is discussed in detail, which provides insightful analysis of the performance, related applications, and pros and cons. Then, a comparative analysis is provided to analyze the differences among approaches. Finally, the paper concludes with possible future directions and some technical challenges.",

            "text": "Consistent with the findings from Minitron, we observe that excessive single-step compression leads to significant degradation. Although maintaining attention heads is generally beneficial, our experiments reveal that pruning them for smaller models is effective when done earlier at larger scales as presented in Table 16. Additionally, we find that input and output embeddings can be tied by averaging without causing noticeable degradation, which we apply when pruning from 4.5B to 2.1B as shown in Table 17. \n\nLastly, we observe that the composition of distillation data directly influences the performance, while pruning data is less important. For models larger than 2B, we use high-quality 300 billion tokens of stage 2 described in Section 2.3.1. However, for smaller models, increasing the proportion of general-domain English data increases both English performance and other benchmark scores, as shown in Table 18. \n\nIn conclusion, our comprehensive pre-training process, which includes staged pre-training, depth up-scaling, and iterative pruning and distillation, offers a compute-efficient strategy for developing high-performing language models. This combined approach not only enhances performance across diverse benchmarks, but also ensures computational efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy in producing a robust family of models spanning the range from 2.1B to 32.5B.

            "text": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing fields, achieving impressive results in tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, question answering, and text generation (Lyu et al., 2023;Yao et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2023a,b;Wang et al., 2023;Arefeen et al., 2024;Li et al., 2024). Advanced LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), Meta's LLaMA-3 (AI, 2023), and Google's Gemini (Team et al., 2023) excel in generating coherent text with extensive parameters. However, the growth in model sizes outpaces hardware improvements, posing significant deployment and inference challenges (Steiner et al., 2023). For example, operating OPT-175B (Zhang et al., 2022) requires over 320GB of memory and at least five 80GB A100 GPUs for loading its parameters in FP16 precision. This challenge becomes more pronounced in environments with limited resources, such as mobile devices, edge computing systems, and real-time applications. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in compressing LLMs to enhance their efficiency and practicality for deployment across various applications. \n\nPruning is a key method for compressing LLMs, aiming to eliminate redundant weights to reduce model size and computational demands while striving to maintain performance. Methods such as those in (Huang et al., 2020;Ma et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2023c) require a retraining phase post-pruning, which is inefficient for billion-scale LLMs. Recent developments, including SparseGPT (Frantar and Alistarh, 2023) and Wanda (Sun et al., 2023), employ one-shot post-training pruning techniques for LLMs. These methods, however, rely on the heuristic-based optimal brain surgeon (OBS) framework (Hassibi and Stork, 1992) or utilize heuristic-based pruning metric to determine which weights to prune, potentially compromising performance.",

            "text": "This work discusses how existing LLM compression methods do not follow the pretrain-thenfinetune paradigm. We show that with additional continued pretraining of compressed models after pruning, coupled with embarrassingly simple pruning techniques, can beat complex structured pruning approaches and compete with semi-structured compression methods with improved efficiency. Our LayerCHOP methods set new performance standards for LLM compression while improving inference speeds by 1.84\u00d7 over the baseline model, compared to the limited 1.24\u00d7 end-to-end speed improvement from 2:4 semi-structured compression via specialized NVIDIA accelerator kernels. \n\nThe work closest to ours is Sheared Llama (Xia et al., 2023), where they apply Co-Fi (Xia et al., 2022) like fine-grained pruning and continued pre-training on RedPajama data. Their work selects components of a 7B model (e.g., attention heads) to assemble smaller models, at the 1.3B and 2.7B scales, using a pruning heuristic that trains further on domain-specific data. Our work differs by recovering state-of-the-art compression results by continuing to pretrain despite pruning models at a much coarser granularity. Our methods also require no domain-specific data selection, as we continue pretraining on same pretraining data distribution. \n\nFinally, we demonstrate that under this new pretrain-then-finetune paradigm for LLM compression, augmenting pruning with distillation losses does not improve performance as is the case for BERT-style models. We also identify how studentteacher distillation on large pretraining corpus results in inefficient compression algorithms. CHOP offers compression compatible with contemporary modelling optimizations (e.g., Flash Attention) to surpass distillation with embarassingly simple techniques. We hope our work contributes to a new conversation on how to train a compressed large language model, and how to learn from large corpora for better, smaller models.",

            "title": "GMP*: Well-Tuned Gradual Magnitude Pruning Can Outperform Most BERT-Pruning Methods",
            "text": "The massive recent growth of the computational cost of accurate deep learning models, in particular large language models (LLMs), has motivated the development of several advanced model compression techniques (Hoefler et al., 2021;Gholami et al., 2021), encompassing unstructured and structured pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. In this paper, we focus on the unstructured pruning, for which we follow the standard pipeline. Such models are first pre-trained on a large upstream corpus of unlabelled text. Then, they are fine-tuned in a supervised manner on a smaller downstream task, such as question-answering or text classification. In the context of compression, this pipeline led to two paradigms: 1) upstream pruning, followed by fine-tuning of the remaining weights on a downstream task, and 2) downstream pruning, pruning and fine-tuning directly on the downstream task. \n\nA tempting baseline approach in most settings is gradual magnitude pruning (GMP) (Hagiwara, 1994;Zhu and Gupta, 2017), that is, periodically removing the smallest fraction of weights during training, possibly interspersed with fine-tuning steps designed to recover accuracy. GMP has been shown to be an extremely strong baseline in the context of computer vision (Gale et al., 2019;Hoefler et al., 2021). However, the literature on pruning LLMs, and in particular BERT models (Sanh et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2020;Zafrir et al., 2021), clearly suggests that GMP does not perform well. \n\nContribution. In this paper, we re-examine this conclusion and investigate whether GMP can be a competitive baseline, once carefully tuned. Specifically, we show that a well tuned variant which we call GMP , can produce highly accurate and sparse language models in both upstream and downstream pruning regimes, matching or even outperforming more complex methods. We explore effects of the crucial parameters for gradual pruning, and provide simple and intuitive guidelines on how to integrate them in a principled manner. \n\nOur results are summarized in Figure 1, which presents performance of state-of-the-art unstructured pruning techniques on two benchmarks.",

            "title": "The LLM Surgeon",
            "text": "Recent advancements in language modeling (Vaswani et al., 2017) allow fitting large language models (LLMs) with millions or even billions of parameters (such as OPT (Zhang et al., 2022) and Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023)) on big text corpora achieving high performance. Unfortunately, the size of these LLMs often makes it hard to deploy them within practical constraints. Cloudbased deployment can get very expensive for larger models, and efficient devices such as phones are frequently limited in the memory size to host a model. \n\nA body of literature extending back to the late 1980s, e.g., Optimal Brain Damage (OBD, LeCun et al. (1989)) and Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS, Hassibi & Stork (1992)), phrases pruning as a constraint optimization problem to reduce a model's footprint and runtime requirements. The Hessian required for this approach grows with the square of the number of parameters, and can only be computed in practice for unrealistically small networks. To overcome this issue, Eigendamage (Wang et al., 2019) introduces a Kronecker factorization of a blockwise-diagonal approximation of the Hessian. Recent works, like Optimal Brain Compression (Frantar & Alistarh, 2022), SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023), demonstrate practical post-training pruning of LLMs, but only consider a loss curvature of a pruned layer's squared output reconstruction error, ignoring gradients that relate local removal costs to the target loss. As a result, their approximation to the target loss landscape is inaccurate, leading to a significant performance degradation for pruned LLMs. Further, these methods do not readily extend to structured pruning. This work introduces LLM Surgeon, a general framework for unstructured, semi-structured and structured pruning of LLMs. At paper submission, we deemed this the first method to successfully perform structured pruning of LLMs. Concurrent work by Ashkboos et al. (2024) also considers structured pruning of LLMs but ignores gradient information, resulting in lower final performance.",

            "text": "This section discusses the progression of transformer-based models, with a specific focus on their optimization for enhanced efficiency and application in resource-constrained environments. \n\nIntroduced by (Devlin et al., 2019) BERT revolutionized NLP tasks by employing a bidirectional training of Transformer, a novel architecture that was originally used in the paper (Vaswani et al., 2023) thereby encapsulating a deeper contextual understanding. The paper (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) introduces Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the original BERT model that uses Siamese and triplet network structures to efficiently generate sentence embeddings for enhanced performance in semantic similarity tasks. (Zhu and Gupta, 2017) evaluates the impact of different pruning techniques on neural network compression and performance across various models and tasks. As discussed in their (Fan et al., 2019), it has been shown that carefully targeted removal of layers can significantly decrease the size of a model while having only a minimal effect on its performance. Furthermore, the study by (Michel et al., 2019), titled \"Are Sixteen Heads Really Better than One?\" shows that many attention heads in transformers can be pruned without significant degradation in capabilities, highlighting the redundancy in these models. \n\nWe explore research aimed at enhancing the efficiency of transformer models, particularly through model compression techniques. Key studies in this area include (Hubara et al., 2016) and (Jiao et al., 2020), which provide valuable insights into designing more efficient models without significant loss in performance. The main goal of TinyBERT is to distill the knowledge from a large pre-trained language model, such as BERT, into a smaller model, while maintaining performance. \n\nAdditionally, we delve into the literature on layer pruning techniques, which specifically address methods for optimizing neural network architectures by identifying and removing redundant or less important layers. In this domain, valuable strategies have been employed for reducing the computational burden of neural network models through systematic layer pruning approaches (Liu et al., 2017). An iterative algorithm (Pietron and Wielgosz, 2020) is introduced for layer pruning, reducing storage demands in pre-trained neural networks.",

            "text": "Recent years have witnessed the great success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various challenging tasks, such as mathematical reasoning, code generation. However, the practical use of these models for inference has faced a major obstacle due to the substantial computational resources they consume. To tackle this, many of the key developments up to now have revolved around weight quantization. It is possible to quantize LLMs down to 4 bits per weight with little impact on accuracy, which aids in memory reduction and speeds up inference (Lin et al., 2024). Nonetheless, maintaining accuracy becomes problematic when quantizing to around 3 bits per weight with existing methods (Dettmers et al., 2024;Egiazarian et al., 2024). \n\nA complementary method is neural network pruning (Han et al., 2015b), which can be combined with quantization to further improve the inference efficiency of LLMs (Kurtic et al., 2023;Frantar & Alistarh, 2023). Pruning can be categorized into two main approaches: unstructured pruning (Sun et al., 2024;Frantar & Alistarh, 2023), which involves the removal of specific weights, and structured pruning (Ma et al., 2023), which entails the removal of complete rows or columns of weights. In contrast to structured pruning, which struggles with performance in LLMs even at low sparsity levels, unstructured pruning methods like SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023) and Wanda (Sun et al., 2024) exhibit promising results without additional retraining, and achieves practical speedup in both CPU and GPU through the recent engineering advancements (Agarwalla et al., 2024). They also have the benefit in reducing hallucinations of LLMs (Chrysostomou et al., 2024).",

[51] addresses the challenges posed by unstructured sparsity after pruning in the implementation of deep learning models.The authors suggest a technique of compression that combines unstructured pruning with a unique weight permutation mechanism.The sparse weight matrix is further compressed into a tiny and dense shape by permuting it, maximising hardware resource utilisation.When compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the suggested method yields a 10.28x improvement in matrix compression rate.As a result, throughput and energy efficiency are increased by 2.12 and 1.57 times, respectively.The approach is named ''Tight Compression'' and offers a promising solution for efficiently compressing CNN models.",

            "text": "natural language processing (NLP) tasks without expertise in compression of language models. As part of this study, we release a set of efficient language models optimized to deliver the greatest improvement in inference while minimizing losses in accuracy. We then show how these models can be used for sparse transfer learning (Iofinova et al., 2021;Zafrir et al., 2021) such that most compression happens during the pre-training stage. The pre-trained sparse models can be transferred to various NLP tasks, preserving sparsity without extensive optimization. Using these sparse transfer models and the DeepSparse inference engine, we show these sparse models can be fine-tuned to produce task-specific sparse models with minimal accuracy loss and result in greatly improved inference speeds with minimal accuracy loss. As shown in figure 1, oBERTa provides stateof-the-art performance for sparse language models on the SQUAD v1.1 Question Answering dataset. oBERTa variants exceed the performance of BERT base despite being eight times faster, exceed the performance of Prune OFA large and oBERT large while being two to five times faster. In this paper, we focus on the following research questions:\n\n\u2022 RQ1: Is RoBERTa more sensitive to unstructured pruning than BERT?\n\n\u2022 RQ2: What impact of using a larger teacher 4 Based on monthly downloads on the huggingface model hub in march 2023 for KD during pruning of language models?\n\n\u2022 RQ3: Can frozen embeddings improve the accuracy of pruned language models?\n\nAs part of our experimentation, we release the associated models and the training regimes to aid reproducibility and encourage efficient inference models.\n\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\n\n\u2022 We provide a thorough case study on how to compress a less studied language model, RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), and evaluate performance on a set of seven NLP tasks finding that it is possible to effectively compress a language model without using its original pretraining dataset.\n\n\u2022 We demonstrate the impact of varying the size of teachers in KD, freezing embeddings, and variations in learning rates when applied to sparse language models.\n\n\u2022 We demonstrate that our compressed models can be leveraged to deliver accuracy of over 91% on the popular SQUAD v1.1 (Rajpurkar et al",

Each blue dot in all sub-figures represents a candidate, while the values on the x-axis and y-axis stand for the accuracy/metrics values after pruning (pruning without fine-tuning) and the value after finetuning (pruning with fine-tuning), respectively. The red line in each subplot is the auto-fitting trend line. The positive slope of trend lines in four sub-figures indicate a linear mapping relation between the manner of pruning without fine-tuning and the manner of pruning with fine-tuning, which justifies our observation. The experimental results of are shown in Table I on GLUE benchmark tasks. We can achieve the aimed prune ratio with limited accuracy loss by applying our proposed AE-BERT framework. To be more specific, for the paraphrase similarity matching task on MRPC both the top 1 and top 10 F1 scores (89.5 and 89.6) of the sparse model at a pruning ratio of 0.5 even exceed our own fine-tuned baseline (89.4). Furthermore, for STS-B, the Spearman correlation loss for the top 1 result is 3.0, while the top 10 is 2.4 at a pruning ratio of 0.7. On the natural language inference tasks (QNLI and RTE), our proposed framework can limit the accuracy loss up to 1.7 for the top 10 results. \n\nComparison results with BERT compression works [40] and [14] are shown in Table I, which indicating that our method has advantage on these tasks. (Since there is no result of irregular pruning on MRPC in [40], we do not compare the result of it.) Our AE-BERT framework exhibits the highest accuracy performance among various NLP tasks without the need for domain experts' efforts. Under a more overall pruning ratio, our proposed framework achieves higher accuracy than the hand-crafted model compression methods for BERT. On QNLI and RTE, 75% and 42.8% more overall pruning ratio is obtained while higher accuracy is maintained.",

However, the iterative generation process introduces critical computational bottlenecks that disproportionately af- Figure 1: Compared to methods that train a specific model based on the LLM input and its compressed version, our approach achieves ultra-low-loss and highperformance compression through importance sampling at two levels, which only need a compact 9-layer RL policy network. \n\nfect system performance -particularly in reasoning and planning tasks. As token sequences grow through successive iterations, memory consumption exhibits quadratic scaling relative to sequence length, while inference latency increases linearly. This fundamental conflict between the demand for deeper reasoning capabilities and practical computational constraints underscores the urgent need for efficient prompt compression methodologies. Such techniques require an optimal balance between semantic preservation and token reduction, maintaining critical informational fidelity while significantly decreasing computational overhead. \n\nCurrent approaches primarily adapt conventional text summarization paradigms, which can be categorized into two groups: 1) generative compression methods (e.g., LLMLingua (Jiang et al., 2023a)), which employ auxiliary language models for prompt rewriting, and 2) heuristic pruning techniques (e.g., Selective Context (Li et al., 2023)), which eliminate tokens based on surface-level metrics. Although these strategies offer some solutions, they fundamentally overlook two critical aspects of LLM operation: (a) the excessive computational cost introduced by the reliance on external generative models, which significantly increases training and inference overhead, and (b) the failure of heuristic pruning to account for the internal mechanisms of the LLM, resulting in token sequences that may not align with the model's optimal representation of relevant information. These issues result in current methods being either not efficient or not effective. \n\nThis work addresses two fundamental research questions through a unified theoretical and methodological framework: \n\n\u2022 How to achieve higher compression quality without relying on generative models? \u2022 How to formalize prompt compression in alignment with LLMs' computational mechanisms?",

We choose Knowledge Distillation because it's popular in NLP: Distill-Bert (Sanh et al., 2019), Distill-GPT, Distilled Blenderbot, and distil-T5 are all distilled generative models publicly available to download and deploy on Hugginface.co (Wolf et al., 2020); those distilled models could achieve testing performance on par with original models, while cutting inference time and model size by more than half; we also test on pruning because it's the most commonly used compression techniques, and there are also works that prunes NLP models(Insert more about pruning here);",

However, pruning in LLMs is challenging due to the complexity of their architecture and the varying significance of components such as attention heads. Conventional pruning methods, effective in CNNs, face limitations when applied to LLMs [104]. As shown in Fig. 6 (b), specialized pruning techniques for LLMs are generally categorized into structured and unstructured pruning, each with distinct trade-offs.",

Structurally pruned models remain dense and high-precision, highly compatible with further tuning and compression.

In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic structured pruning approach coupled with a compact Transformer architecture design. The proposed approach, named TransAct, reduces transitional activations inside multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modules, while preserving the inter-module activations that are sensitive to perturbations. Hence, the LLM is pruned into an intra-module low-rank architecture, significantly reducing weights, KV Cache and attention computation. TransAct is implemented on the LLaMA model and evaluated on downstream benchmarks. Results verify the optimality of our approach at high compression with respect to both efficiency and performance. Further, ablation studies reveal the strength of activation-guided iterative pruning and provide experimental analysis on the redundancy of MHA and MLP modules.",

However, they are often inefficient for real-world deployment due to their expensive inference costs. Knowledge distillation is a promising technique to improve their efficiency while retaining most of their effectiveness. In this paper, we reproduce, compare and analyze several representative methods for task-agnostic (general-purpose) distillation of Transformer language models. Our target of study includes Output Distribution (OD) transfer, Hidden State (HS) transfer with various layer mapping strategies, and Multi-Head Attention (MHA) transfer based on MiniLMv2. Through our extensive experiments, we study the effectiveness of each method for various student architectures in both monolingual (English) and multilingual settings. Overall, we show that MHA transfer based on MiniLMv2 is generally the best option for distillation and explain the potential reasons behind its success. Moreover, we show that HS transfer remains as a competitive baseline, especially under a sophisticated layer mapping strategy, while OD transfer consistently lags behind other approaches.

Considering the redundancy in natural language, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical units according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language model such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a suboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and may fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression; (ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective. To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive knowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information, and meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset. We formulate prompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the faithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a Transformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential information for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context. Our approach leads to lower latency by explicitly learning the compression objective with smaller models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT. We evaluate our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, including MeetingBank, LongBench, ZeroScrolls, GSM8K, and BBH. Despite its small size, our model shows significant performance gains over strong baselines and demonstrates robust generalization ability across different LLMs. Additionally, our model is 3x-6x faster than existing prompt compression methods, while accelerating the end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x with compression ratios of 2x-5x.

To tackle these issues, we propose Cluster-driven Expert Pruning (C-Prune), a novel two-stage framework for adaptive task-specific compression of MoE LLMs. C-Prune operates through layer-wise expert clustering, which groups functionally similar experts within each MoE layer using parameter similarity metrics, followed by global cluster pruning, which eliminates redundant clusters across all layers through a unified importance scoring mechanism that accounts for cross-layer homogeneity. We validate C-Prune through extensive experiments on multiple MoE models and benchmarks.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for reducing the complexity of deep learning models for NLP by combining compressive sensing and Bayesian learning. In our approach, we use compressive sensing with Bayesian learning to identify the most important weights in a deep learning model and represent them in a compressed form. We then prune the non-critical weights and ensure that the model's accuracy is preserved. We evaluate our approach on several NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis and text classification, and compare its performance to that of other compression methods, such as weight pruning and knowledge distillation. Our results show that our approach can significantly reduce the complexity of deep learning models (90% compression) while maintaining high accuracy (<1% drop). In conclusion, our novel approach offers a promising solution for reducing the complexity of deep learning models for NLP and making them more feasible for deployment in resource-constrained environments. By combining compressive sensing and Bayesian learning, we achieve a trade-off between model size and accuracy that is superior to other methods.",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for reducing the complexity of deep learning models for NLP by combining compressive sensing and Bayesian learning. In our approach, we use compressive sensing with Bayesian learning to identify the most important weights in a deep learning model and represent them in a compressed form. We then prune the non-critical weights and ensure that the model's accuracy is preserved. We evaluate our approach on several NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis and text classification, and compare its performance to that of other compression methods, such as weight pruning and knowledge distillation. Our results show that our approach can significantly reduce the complexity of deep learning models (90% compression) while maintaining high accuracy (<1% drop). In conclusion, our novel approach offers a promising solution for reducing the complexity of deep learning models for NLP and making them more feasible for deployment in resource-constrained environments. By combining compressive sensing and Bayesian learning, we achieve a trade-off between model size and accuracy that is superior to other methods.",

However, the high demand for computing resources in training such models hinders their application in practice. In order to alleviate this resource hunger in large-scale model training, we propose a Patient Knowledge Distillation approach to compress an original large model (teacher) into an equally-effective lightweight shallow network (student). Different from previous knowledge distillation methods, which only use the output from the last layer of the teacher network for distillation, our student model patiently learns from multiple intermediate layers of the teacher model for incremental knowledge extraction, following two strategies: (i) PKD-Last: learning from the last k layers; and (ii) PKD-Skip: learning from every k layers. These two patient distillation schemes enable the exploitation of rich information in the teacher\u2019s hidden layers, and encourage the student model to patiently learn from and imitate the teacher through a multi-layer distillation process. Empirically, this translates into improved results on multiple NLP tasks with a significant gain in training efficiency, without sacrificing model accuracy.",

However, pre-trained language models are usually computationally expensive, so it is difficult to efficiently execute them on resource-restricted devices. To accelerate inference and reduce model size while maintaining accuracy, we first propose a novel Transformer distillation method that is specially designed for knowledge distillation (KD) of the Transformer-based models. By leveraging this new KD method, the plenty of knowledge encoded in a large \u201cteacher\u201d BERT can be effectively transferred to a small \u201cstudent\u201d TinyBERT.

This framework ensures that TinyBERT can capture the general-domain as well as the task-specific knowledge in BERT. TinyBERT4 with 4 layers is empirically effective and achieves more than 96.8% the performance of its teacher BERT-Base on GLUE benchmark, while being 7.5x smaller and 9.4x faster on inference.

Basically, MobileBERT is a thin version of BERT_LARGE, while equipped with bottleneck structures and a carefully designed balance between self-attentions and feed-forward networks. To train MobileBERT, we first train a specially designed teacher model, an inverted-bottleneck incorporated BERT_LARGE model. Then, we conduct knowledge transfer from this teacher to MobileBERT.

In particular, LTP prunes tokens with an attention score below a threshold, whose value is learned for each layer during training. Our threshold-based method allows the length of the pruned sequence to vary adaptively based on the input sequence, and avoids algorithmically expensive operations such as top-k token selection.

We find that this approach learns to prune out full components of the underlying model, such as attention heads. Experiments consider classification and generation tasks, yielding among other results a pruned model that is a 2.4x faster, 74% smaller BERT on SQuAD v1, with a 1% drop on F1, competitive both with distilled models in speed and pruned models in size.",
                    "[247922354 | Xia et al. | 2022 | Citations: 187]": "The growing size of neural language models has led to increased attention in model compression. The two predominant approaches are pruning, which gradually removes weights from a pre-trained model, and distillation, which trains a smaller compact model to match a larger one. Pruning methods can significantly reduce the model size but hardly achieve large speedups as distillation. However, distillation methods require large amounts of unlabeled data and are expensive to train. In this work, we propose a task-specific structured pruning method CoFi (Coarse- and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers highly parallelizable subnetworks and matches the distillation methods in both accuracy and latency, without resorting to any unlabeled data. Our key insight is to jointly prune coarse-grained (e.g., layers) and fine-grained (e.g., heads and hidden units) modules, which controls the pruning decision of each parameter with masks of different granularity. We also devise a layerwise distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models during optimization. Our experiments on GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that CoFi yields models with over 10X speedups with a small accuracy drop, showing its effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous pruning and distillation approaches.",

To leverage powerful transformers like BERT in this low-latency setting, many existing approaches perform ad-side computations offline. While efficient, these approaches are unable to serve cold start ads, resulting in poor relevance predictions for such ads. This work aims to design a new, low-latency BERT via structured pruning to empower real-time online inference for cold start ads relevance on a CPU platform. Our challenge is that previous methods typically prune all layers of the transformer to a high, uniform sparsity, thereby producing models which cannot achieve satisfactory inference speed with an acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we propose SwiftPruner - an efficient framework that leverages evolution-based search to automatically find the best-performing layer-wise sparse BERT model under the desired latency constraint. Different from existing evolution algorithms that conduct random mutations, we propose a reinforced mutator with a latency-aware multi-objective reward to conduct better mutations for efficiently searching the large space of layer-wise sparse models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher ROC AUC and lower latency than the uniform sparse baseline and state-of-the-art search methods. Remarkably, under our latency requirement of 1900us on CPU, SwiftPruner achieves a 0.86% higher AUC than the state-of-the-art uniform sparse baseline for BERT-Mini on a large scale real-world dataset. Online A/B testing shows that our model also achieves a significant 11.7% cut in the ratio of defective cold start ads with satisfactory real-time serving latency."

In this paper, we analyze this norm-based criterion and point out that its effectiveness depends on two requirements that are not always met: (1) the norm deviation of the filters should be large; (2) the minimum norm of the filters should be small. To solve this problem, we propose a novel filter pruning method, namely Filter Pruning via Geometric Median (FPGM), to compress the model regardless of those two requirements. Unlike previous methods, FPGM compresses CNN models by pruning filters with redundancy, rather than those with\u201crelatively less\u201d importance. When applied to two image classification benchmarks, our method validates its usefulness and strengths. Notably, on CIFAR-10, FPGM reduces more than 52% FLOPs on ResNet-110 with even 2.69% relative accuracy improvement. Moreover, on ILSVRC-2012, FPGM reduces more than 42% FLOPs on ResNet-101 without top-5 accuracy drop, which has advanced the state-of-the-art.

Similarly to their biological counterparts, sparse networks generalize just as well, if not better than, the original dense networks. Sparsity can reduce the memory footprint of regular networks to fit mobile devices, as well as shorten training time for ever growing networks. In this paper, we survey prior work on sparsity in deep learning and provide an extensive tutorial of sparsification for both inference and training. We describe approaches to remove and add elements of neural networks, different training strategies to achieve model sparsity, and mechanisms to exploit sparsity in practice. Our work distills ideas from more than 300 research papers and provides guidance to practitioners who wish to utilize sparsity today, as well as to researchers whose goal is to push the frontier forward. We include the necessary background on mathematical methods in sparsification, describe phenomena such as early structure adaptation, the intricate relations between sparsity and the training process, and show techniques for achieving acceleration on real hardware. We also define a metric of pruned parameter efficiency that could serve as a baseline for comparison of different sparse networks.

This problem is critical for applications that run on low-end embedded GPU or CPU systems with limited resources. As a result, model compression for deep neural networks becomes an important research topic. Popular compression methods such as weight pruning remove redundant neurons from the CNN without affecting the network\u2019s output accuracy. While these pruning methods work well on simple networks such as VGG or AlexNet, they are not suitable for compressing current state-of-the-art networks such as ResNets because of these networks\u2019 complex architectures with dimensionality dependencies. This dependency results in filter pruning breaking the structure of ResNets leading to an untrainable network. In this paper, we first use the weight pruning method only on a selective number of layers in the ResNet architecture to avoid breaking the network structure. Second, we introduce a knowledge distillation architecture and a loss function to compress the untouched layers during the pruning. We test our method on both image-based regression and classification networks for head-pose estimation and image classification. Our compression method reduces the models\u2019 size significantly while maintaining the accuracy very close to the baseline model.",
                    "[258035138 | Wang et al. | 2023 | Citations: 6]": "Although the classification method based on the deep neural network has achieved excellent results in classification tasks, it is difficult to apply to real-time scenarios because of high memory footprints and prohibitive inference times. Compared to unstructured pruning, structured pruning techniques can reduce the computation cost of the model runtime more effectively, but inevitably reduces the precision of the model. Traditional methods use fine tuning to restore model damage performance. However, there is still a large gap between the pruned model and the original one. In this paper, we use progressive multi-level distillation learning to compensate for the loss caused by pruning. Pre-pruning and post-pruning networks serve as the teacher and student networks. The proposed approach utilizes the complementary properties of structured pruning and knowledge distillation, which allows the pruned network to learn the intermediate and output representations of the teacher network, thus reducing the influence of the model subject to pruning. Experiments demonstrate that our approach performs better on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets with different pruning rates. For instance, GoogLeNet can achieve near lossless pruning on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 60% pruning. Moreover, this paper also proves that using the proposed distillation learning method during the pruning process achieves more significant performance gains than after completing the pruning."

Pruning methods can be broadly categorized into unstructured pruning, which removes individual weights, and structured pruning, which removes higher-granularity structures such as neurons, attention heads, or entire layers. Layer-wise pruning, a specific form of structured pruning, has been explored in several studies. Fan et al. (2019) [5] introduced LayerDrop, a structured dropout method that randomly drops layers during training to improve robustness to layer reduction at inference time. Additionally, several studies have investigated the disparities in representations across different layers, highlighting the significance of updating the last few layers for language models [12], [14], [18]. Building on this foundation, Peer et al. (2022) [22] and Sajjad et al. (2023) [24] aimed to identify and remove an optimal subset of layers directly from the pretrained models for use in downstream tasks. These works focus on pruning layers to reduce model size while preserving taskspecific performance within the standard fine-tuning paradigm. However, they do not explore the interaction between layer pruning and prompt-based fine-tuning, which is the focus of our work.\n\nRecent studies have explored the application of pruning techniques to large language models, such as Sheared LLMs [34] and SparseGPT [6], which aims to sparsify or prune LLMs for efficient inference. These methods often involve complex optimization strategies or require additional training steps [1], [4], [11]. In contrast, our approach is a simple top-layer pruning strategy that directly removes layers from LLMs and evaluates their performance in prompt-based fine-tuning scenarios.",

The two predominant approaches are pruning, which gradually removes weights from a pre-trained model, and distillation, which trains a smaller compact model to match a larger one. Pruning methods can significantly reduce the model size but hardly achieve large speedups as distillation. However, distillation methods require large amounts of unlabeled data and are expensive to train. In this work, we propose a task-specific structured pruning method CoFi (Coarse- and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers highly parallelizable subnetworks and matches the distillation methods in both accuracy and latency, without resorting to any unlabeled data. Our key insight is to jointly prune coarse-grained (e.g., layers) and fine-grained (e.g., heads and hidden units) modules, which controls the pruning decision of each parameter with masks of different granularity. We also devise a layerwise distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models during optimization. Our experiments on GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that CoFi yields models with over 10X speedups with a small accuracy drop, showing its effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous pruning and distillation approaches.",

We can execute SparseGPT on the largest available open-source models, OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B, in under 4.5 hours, and can reach 60% unstructured sparsity with negligible increase in perplexity: remarkably, more than 100 billion weights from these models can be ignored at inference time.

For vanilla KD and hidden states transfer, initialisation with lower layers of the teacher gives a considerable improvement over higher layers, especially on the task of QNLI (up to an absolute percentage change of 17.8 in accuracy).

In this work, we study structured pruning as an effective means to develop smaller LLMs from pre-trained, larger models. Our approach employs two key techniques: (1) targeted structured pruning, which prunes a larger model to a specified target shape by removing layers, heads, and intermediate and hidden dimensions in an end-to-end manner, and (2) dynamic batch loading, which dynamically updates the composition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying losses across different domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting the Sheared-LLaMA series, pruning the LLaMA2-7B model down to 1.3B and 2.7B parameters. Sheared-LLaMA models outperform state-of-the-art open-source models of equivalent sizes, such as Pythia, INCITE, OpenLLaMA and the concurrent TinyLlama models, on a wide range of downstream and instruction tuning evaluations, while requiring only 3% of compute compared to training such models from scratch. This work provides compelling evidence that leveraging existing LLMs with structured pruning is a far more cost-effective approach for building competitive small-scale LLMs",
                    "[84841767 | Liu et al. | 2019 | Citations: 735]": "Contextual word representations derived from large-scale neural language models are successful across a diverse set of NLP tasks, suggesting that they encode useful and transferable features of language. To shed light on the linguistic knowledge they capture, we study the representations produced by several recent pretrained contextualizers (variants of ELMo, the OpenAI transformer language model, and BERT) with a suite of sixteen diverse probing tasks. We find that linear models trained on top of frozen contextual representations are competitive with state-of-the-art task-specific models in many cases, but fail on tasks requiring fine-grained linguistic knowledge (e.g., conjunct identification). To investigate the transferability of contextual word representations, we quantify differences in the transferability of individual layers within contextualizers, especially between recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. For instance, higher layers of RNNs are more task-specific, while transformer layers do not exhibit the same monotonic trend. In addition, to better understand what makes contextual word representations transferable, we compare language model pretraining with eleven supervised pretraining tasks. For any given task, pretraining on a closely related task yields better performance than language model pretraining (which is better on average) when the pretraining dataset is fixed. However, language model pretraining on more data gives the best results."

Pruning methods can be broadly categorized into unstructured pruning, which removes individual weights, and structured pruning, which removes higher-granularity structures such as neurons, attention heads, or entire layers. Layer-wise pruning, a specific form of structured pruning, has been explored in several studies. Fan et al. (2019) [5] introduced LayerDrop, a structured dropout method that randomly drops layers during training to improve robustness to layer reduction at inference time. Additionally, several studies have investigated the disparities in representations across different layers, highlighting the significance of updating the last few layers for language models [12], [14], [18]. Building on this foundation, Peer et al. (2022) [22] and Sajjad et al. (2023) [24] aimed to identify and remove an optimal subset of layers directly from the pretrained models for use in downstream tasks. These works focus on pruning layers to reduce model size while preserving taskspecific performance within the standard fine-tuning paradigm. However, they do not explore the interaction between layer pruning and prompt-based fine-tuning, which is the focus of our work.\n\nRecent studies have explored the application of pruning techniques to large language models, such as Sheared LLMs [34] and SparseGPT [6], which aims to sparsify or prune LLMs for efficient inference. These methods often involve complex optimization strategies or require additional training steps [1], [4], [11]. In contrast, our approach is a simple top-layer pruning strategy that directly removes layers from LLMs and evaluates their performance in prompt-based fine-tuning scenarios."

ZeroQuant is an end-to-end quantization and inference pipeline with three main components: (1) a fine-grained hardware-friendly quantization scheme for both weight and activations; (2) a novel affordable layer-by-layer knowledge distillation algorithm (LKD) even without the access to the original training data; (3) a highly-optimized quantization system backend support to remove the quantization/dequantization overhead. As such, we are able to show that: (1) ZeroQuant can reduce the precision for weights and activations to INT8 in a cost-free way for both BERT and GPT3-style models with minimal accuracy impact, which leads to up to 5.19x/4.16x speedup on those models compared to FP16 inference; (2) ZeroQuant plus LKD affordably quantize the weights in the fully-connected module to INT4 along with INT8 weights in the attention module and INT8 activations, resulting in 3x memory footprint reduction compared to the FP16 model; (3) ZeroQuant can be directly applied to two of the largest open-sourced language models, including GPT-J6B and GPT-NeoX20, for which our INT8 model achieves similar accuracy as the FP16 model but achieves up to 5.2x better efficiency.",

Sparsification provides a solution to alleviate these resource constraints, and recent works have shown that trained models can be sparsified post-hoc. Existing sparsification techniques face challenges as they need additional data structures and offer constrained speedup with current hardware. In this paper we present SliceGPT, a new post-training sparsification scheme which replaces each weight matrix with a smaller (dense) matrix, reducing the embedding dimension of the network. Through extensive experimentation, we show that SliceGPT can remove up to 25% of the model parameters (including embeddings) for LLAMA2-70B, OPT 66B and Phi-2 models while maintaining 99%, 99% and 90% zero-shot task performance of the dense model respectively. Our sliced models run on fewer GPUs and run faster without any additional code optimization: on 24GB consumer GPUs we reduce the total compute for inference on LLAMA2-70B to 64% of that of the dense model; on 40GB A100 GPUs we reduce it to 66%. We offer a new insight, computational invariance in transformer networks, which enables SliceGPT and we hope it will inspire and enable future avenues to reduce memory and computation demands for pre-trained models.

These pruning methods can be broadly classified into structured and unstructured approaches. Structured pruning is more hardware-friendly, as it directly prunes entire segments of weights, thereby removing consecutive computations [17,(Liu et al., 2023). Unstructured pruning (sparsification) is also receiving interest, particularly as hardware advancements increasingly support the acceleration of sparse patterns such as 2:4 or 4:8 sparse [20]. Techniques such as SparseGPT (Frantar et al., 2023) extend the OBS (Hassibi et al., 1993) methodology to column-wise prune weights, allowing the modification of values in the unpruned columns to compensate for the pruning errors. Aaquib et al. (Syed et al., 2023) enhance SparseGPT by incorporating minimal iterative task fine-tuning during the pruning process, demonstrating performance improvements at high sparsity levels. Wanda [27] introduces a simple yet effective no-retraining-needed pruning strategy that prunes weights based on their magnitudes and corresponding activations. OWL (Yin et al., 2023) considers the inhomogeneous distribution of interlayer outliers and further extends Wanda to a non-uniform sparsity distribution, achieving better performance.

To address this limitation, we introduce \"deep compression\", a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9x to 13x; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35x, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49x from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory.

We can execute SparseGPT on the largest available open-source models, OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B, in under 4.5 hours, and can reach 60% unstructured sparsity with negligible increase in perplexity: remarkably, more than 100 billion weights from these models can be ignored at inference time.

However, they are computationally expensive at inference time. Sparsity is a natural approach to reduce this cost, but existing methods either require costly retraining, have to forgo LLM's in-context learning ability, or do not yield wall-clock time speedup on modern hardware. We hypothesize that contextual sparsity, which are small, input-dependent sets of attention heads and MLP parameters that yield approximately the same output as the dense model for a given input, can address these issues. We show that contextual sparsity exists, that it can be accurately predicted, and that we can exploit it to speed up LLM inference in wall-clock time without compromising LLM's quality or in-context learning ability. Based on these insights, we propose DejaVu, a system that uses a low-cost algorithm to predict contextual sparsity on the fly given inputs to each layer, along with an asynchronous and hardware-aware implementation that speeds up LLM inference. We validate that DejaVu can reduce the inference latency of OPT-175B by over 2X compared to the state-of-the-art FasterTransformer, and over 6X compared to the widely used Hugging Face implementation, without compromising model quality.

In response to this challenge, efforts have been directed toward the application of traditional network pruning techniques to LLMs, uncovering a massive number of parameters that can be pruned in one-shot without hurting performance. Prevailing LLM pruning strategies have consistently adhered to the practice of uniformly pruning all layers at equivalent sparsity, resulting in robust performance. However, this observation stands in contrast to the prevailing trends observed in the field of vision models, where non-uniform layerwise sparsity typically yields stronger results. To understand the underlying reasons for this disparity, we conduct a comprehensive study and discover a strong correlation with the emergence of activation outliers in LLMs. Inspired by this finding, we introduce a novel LLM pruning methodology that incorporates a tailored set of non-uniform layerwise sparsity ratios, termed as Outlier Weighed Layerwise sparsity (OWL). The sparsity ratio of OWL is proportional to the outlier ratio observed within each layer, facilitating a more effective alignment between layerwise weight sparsity and outlier ratios. Our empirical evaluation, conducted across the LLaMA-V1 family and OPT, spanning various benchmarks, demonstrates the distinct advantages offered by OWL over previous methods. For instance, OWL exhibits a remarkable performance gain, surpassing the state-of-the-art Wanda and SparseGPT by 61.22 and 6.80 perplexity at a high sparsity level of 70%, respectively, while delivering 2.6x end-to-end inference speed-up in the DeepSparse inference engine.

As one of the most well-established pre-LLMs approaches in reducing model complexity, network pruning appears to lag behind in the era of LLMs, due mostly to its costly fine-tuning (or re-training) necessity under the massive volumes of model parameter and training data. To close this industry-academia gap, we introduce Dynamic Sparse No Training (DSnoT), a training-free fine-tuning approach that slightly updates sparse LLMs without the expensive backpropagation and any weight updates. Inspired by the Dynamic Sparse Training, DSnoT minimizes the reconstruction error between the dense and sparse LLMs, in the fashion of performing iterative weight pruning-and-growing on top of sparse LLMs. To accomplish this purpose, DSnoT particularly takes into account the anticipated reduction in reconstruction error for pruning and growing, as well as the variance w.r.t. different input data for growing each weight. This practice can be executed efficiently in linear time since its obviates the need of backpropagation for fine-tuning LLMs. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-V1/V2, Vicuna, and OPT across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DSnoT in enhancing the performance of sparse LLMs, especially at high sparsity levels. For instance, DSnoT is able to outperform the state-of-the-art Wanda by 26.79 perplexity at 70% sparsity with LLaMA-7B. Our paper offers fresh insights into how to fine-tune sparse LLMs in an efficient training-free manner and open new venues to scale the great potential of sparsity to LLMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/zyxxmu/DSnoT.",

Current post-training pruning methods, while reducing the sizes of LLMs, often fail to maintain their original performance. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SPP, a Sparsity-Preserved Parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. Different from existing post-training pruning approaches that struggle with performance retention, SPP proposes to employ lightweight learnable column and row matrices to optimize sparse LLM weights, keeping the structure and sparsity of pruned pre-trained models intact. By element-wise multiplication and residual addition, SPP ensures the consistency of model sparsity pattern and ratio during both training and weight-merging processes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPP by applying it to the LLaMA and LLaMA-2 model families with recent post-training pruning methods. Our results show that SPP significantly enhances the performance of models with different sparsity patterns (i.e. unstructured and N:M sparsity), especially for those with high sparsity ratios (e.g. 75%), making it a promising solution for the efficient fine-tuning of sparse LLMs. Code will be made available at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/SPP."

On-device LLM is becoming increasingly important: running LLMs locally on edge devices can reduce cloud computing costs and protect users' privacy.

To solve these issues, we propose Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) and TinyChat, an algorithm-system full-stack solution for efficient on-device LLM deployment. AWQ is a novel quantization method that identifies and protects salient weights based on activation distribution, significantly reducing model size while preserving performance. TinyChat, an optimized inference framework, translates AWQ's theoretical memory savings into practical speedups through techniques such as on-the-fly dequantization, SIMD-aware weight packing, and kernel fusion. Together, they enable 4x model size reduction and 3-4x acceleration across various edge platforms, from high-end desktop GPUs to resource-constrained IoT devices.

Existing methods, however, require either retraining, which is rarely affordable for billion-scale LLMs, or solving a weight reconstruction problem reliant on second-order information, which may also be computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel, straightforward yet effective pruning method, termed Wanda (Pruning by Weights and activations), designed to induce sparsity in pretrained LLMs. Motivated by the recent observation of emergent large magnitude features in LLMs, our approach prunes weights with the smallest magnitudes multiplied by the corresponding input activations, on a per-output basis. Notably, Wanda requires no retraining or weight update, and the pruned LLM can be used as is. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our method Wanda on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 across various language benchmarks. Wanda significantly outperforms the established baseline of magnitude pruning and performs competitively against recent method involving intensive weight update.

Compression techniques for language models include network pruning (Xu et al., 2021), knowledge distillation (Sun et al., 2019(Sun et al., , 2020)), quantization (Yao et al., 2022), decomposition (Hsu et al., 2022;Yuan et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024), and methods like early exit (Xin et al., 2020). Building on these techniques, pruning, and sparsity is crucial for MoE models, which often have up to 95% of parameters dedicated to experts. Pruning MoE models involves removing less important experts or neurons to reduce the number of active parameters during inference. For example, (Kim et al., 2021) retains the most activated experts to enhance machine translation MoE models, while (Koishekenov et al., 2022) introduces gate statistics-based pruning during decoding. Although effective, these methods are mostly confined to linguistic models in machine translation. (Chen et al., 2022) dropping-while-training approach progressively removes non-essential experts for specific tasks, tested on Switch Transformers (Fedus et al., 2021). The merge-compression (Li et al., 2023) method and EPP (Lu et al., 2024) approach, which is similar to ours, consider pruning and skipping in MoE models but face challenges in reducing computational costs.",

The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the\"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\"and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.",

In this work, we present an efficient and affordable post-training quantization approach to compress large Transformer-based models, termed as ZeroQuant. ZeroQuant is an end-to-end quantization and inference pipeline with three main components: (1) a fine-grained hardware-friendly quantization scheme for both weight and activations; (2) a novel affordable layer-by-layer knowledge distillation algorithm (LKD) even without the access to the original training data; (3) a highly-optimized quantization system backend support to remove the quantization/dequantization overhead. As such, we are able to show that: (1) ZeroQuant can reduce the precision for weights and activations to INT8 in a cost-free way for both BERT and GPT3-style models with minimal accuracy impact, which leads to up to 5.19x/4.16x speedup on those models compared to FP16 inference; (2) ZeroQuant plus LKD affordably quantize the weights in the fully-connected module to INT4 along with INT8 weights in the attention module and INT8 activations, resulting in 3x memory footprint reduction compared to the FP16 model; (3) ZeroQuant can be directly applied to two of the largest open-sourced language models, including GPT-J6B and GPT-NeoX20, for which our INT8 model achieves similar accuracy as the FP16 model but achieves up to 5.2x better efficiency.",

However, such impressive capability typically comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in both the deployment, inference, and training stages. With LLM being a general-purpose task solver, we explore its compression in a task-agnostic manner, which aims to preserve the multi-task solving and language generation ability of the original LLM. One challenge to achieving this is the enormous size of the training corpus of LLM, which makes both data transfer and model post-training over-burdensome. Thus, we tackle the compression of LLMs within the bound of two constraints: being task-agnostic and minimizing the reliance on the original training dataset. Our method, named LLM-Pruner, adopts structural pruning that selectively removes non-critical coupled structures based on gradient information, maximally preserving the majority of the LLM's functionality. To this end, the performance of pruned models can be efficiently recovered through tuning techniques, LoRA, in merely 3 hours, requiring only 50K data. We validate the LLM-Pruner on three LLMs, including LLaMA, Vicuna, and ChatGLM, and demonstrate that the compressed models still exhibit satisfactory capabilities in zero-shot classification and generation.

Therefore, vanilla SMoE models are memory inefficient and non-scalable, especially for resource-constrained downstream scenarios. In this paper, we ask: Can we craft a compact SMoE model by consolidating expert information? What is the best recipe to merge multiple experts into fewer but more knowledgeable experts? Our pilot investigation reveals that conventional model merging methods fail to be effective in such expert merging for SMoE. The potential reasons are: (1) redundant information overshadows critical experts; (2) appropriate neuron permutation for each expert is missing to bring all of them in alignment. To address this, we propose M-SMoE, which leverages routing statistics to guide expert merging. Specifically, it starts with neuron permutation alignment for experts; then, dominant experts and their\"group members\"are formed; lastly, every expert group is merged into a single expert by utilizing each expert's activation frequency as their weight for merging, thus diminishing the impact of insignificant experts. Moreover, we observed that our proposed merging promotes a low dimensionality in the merged expert's weight space, naturally paving the way for additional compression. Hence, our final method, MC-SMoE (i.e., Merge, then Compress SMoE), further decomposes the merged experts into low-rank and structural sparse alternatives. Extensive experiments across 8 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of MC-SMoE. For instance, our MC-SMoE achieves up to 80% memory and a 20% FLOPs reduction, with virtually no loss in performance."

(Chen et al., 2022) dropping-while-training approach progressively removes non-essential experts for specific tasks, tested on Switch Transformers (Fedus et al., 2021). The merge-compression (Li et al., 2023) method and EPP (Lu et al., 2024) approach, which is similar to ours, consider pruning and skipping in MoE models but face challenges in reducing computational costs."

Specifically, due to their massive size, even inference for large, highly-accurate GPT models may require multiple performant GPUs, which limits the usability of such models. While there is emerging work on relieving this pressure via model compression, the applicability and performance of existing compression techniques is limited by the scale and complexity of GPT models. In this paper, we address this challenge, and propose GPTQ, a new one-shot weight quantization method based on approximate second-order information, that is both highly-accurate and highly-efficient. Specifically, GPTQ can quantize GPT models with 175 billion parameters in approximately four GPU hours, reducing the bitwidth down to 3 or 4 bits per weight, with negligible accuracy degradation relative to the uncompressed baseline. Our method more than doubles the compression gains relative to previously-proposed one-shot quantization methods, preserving accuracy, allowing us for the first time to execute an 175 billion-parameter model inside a single GPU for generative inference. Moreover, we also show that our method can still provide reasonable accuracy in the extreme quantization regime, in which weights are quantized to 2-bit or even ternary quantization levels. We show experimentally that these improvements can be leveraged for end-to-end inference speedups over FP16, of around 3.25x when using high-end GPUs (NVIDIA A100) and 4.5x when using more cost-effective ones (NVIDIA A6000).

Pruning methods drop a subset of weights to accelerate, but many of them require retraining, which is prohibitively expensive and computationally demanding. Recently, post-training pruning approaches introduced novel metrics, enabling the pruning of LLMs without retraining. However, these metrics require the involvement of human experts and tedious trial and error. To efficiently identify superior pruning metrics, we develop an automatic framework for searching symbolic pruning metrics using genetic programming. In particular, we devise an elaborate search space encompassing the existing pruning metrics to discover the potential symbolic pruning metric. We propose an opposing operation simplification strategy to increase the diversity of the population. In this way, Pruner-Zero allows auto-generation of symbolic pruning metrics. Based on the searched results, we explore the correlation between pruning metrics and performance after pruning and summarize some principles. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 on language modeling and zero-shot tasks demonstrate that our Pruner-Zero obtains superior performance than SOTA post-training pruning methods.

However, the escalation in model size also engenders substantial deployment costs. While few efforts have explored model pruning techniques to reduce the size of LLMs, they mainly center on general or task-specific weights. This leads to suboptimal performance due to lacking specificity on the target domain or generality on different tasks when applied to domain-specific challenges. This work introduces an innovative unstructured dual-pruning methodology, D-Pruner, for domain-specific compression on LLM. It extracts a compressed, domain-specific, and task-agnostic LLM by identifying LLM weights that are pivotal for general capabilities, like linguistic capability and multi-task solving, and domain-specific knowledge. More specifically, we first assess general weight importance by quantifying the error incurred upon their removal with the help of an open-domain calibration dataset. Then, we utilize this general weight importance to refine the training loss, so that it preserves generality when fitting into a specific domain. Moreover, by efficiently approximating weight importance with the refined training loss on a domain-specific calibration dataset, we obtain a pruned model emphasizing generality and specificity. Our comprehensive experiments across various tasks in healthcare and legal domains show the effectiveness of D-Pruner in domain-specific compression.

While methods that address both width and depth aspects exist 17,18 , there is still a need for in-depth analysis comparing the impact of these factors on LLM inference efficiency.

Meanwhile, the size of these models and their latency have significantly increased, which makes their usage costly, and raises an interesting question: do language models need to be large? We study this question through the lens of model compression. We present a novel, structured pruning approach based on low rank factorization and augmented Lagrangian L0 norm regularization. Our structured approach achieves significant inference speedups while matching or outperforming our unstructured pruning baseline at various sparsity levels. We apply our method to state of the art models on the enwiki8 dataset and obtain a 1.19 perplexity score with just 5M parameters, vastly outperforming a model of the same size trained from scratch. We also demonstrate that our method can be applied to language model fine-tuning by pruning the BERT model on several downstream classification benchmarks.",

However, the existing pruning methods are usually heuristic, task-specified, and require an extra fine-tuning procedure. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework that compresses DNNs into slimmer architectures with competitive performances and significant FLOPs reductions by Only-Train-Once (OTO). OTO contains two keys: (i) we partition the parameters of DNNs into zero-invariant groups, enabling us to prune zero groups without affecting the output; and (ii) to promote zero groups, we then formulate a structured-sparsity optimization problem and propose a novel optimization algorithm, Half-Space Stochastic Projected Gradient (HSPG), to solve it, which outperforms the standard proximal methods on group sparsity exploration and maintains comparable convergence. To demonstrate the effectiveness of OTO, we train and compress full models simultaneously from scratch without fine-tuning for inference speedup and parameter reduction, and achieve state-of-the-art results on VGG16 for CIFAR10, ResNet50 for CIFAR10 and Bert for SQuAD and competitive result on ResNet50 for ImageNet.

In this paper, we progress towards resolving this problem by proposing a novel structured compression approach for LLMs, called ZipLM. ZipLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-vs-speedup, while matching a set of desired target runtime speedups in any given inference environment. Specifically, given a model, a dataset, an inference environment, as well as a set of speedup targets, ZipLM iteratively identifies and removes components with the worst loss-runtime trade-off. Unlike prior methods that specialize in either the post-training/one-shot or the gradual compression setting, and only for specific families of models such as BERT (encoder) or GPT (decoder), ZipLM produces state-of-the-art compressed models across all these settings. Furthermore, ZipLM achieves superior results for a fraction of the computational cost relative to prior distillation and pruning techniques, making it a cost-effective approach for generating an entire family of smaller, faster, and highly accurate models, guaranteed to meet the desired inference specifications. In particular, ZipLM outperforms all prior BERT-base distillation and pruning techniques, such as CoFi, MiniLM, and TinyBERT. Moreover, it matches the performance of the heavily optimized MobileBERT model, obtained via extensive architecture search, by simply pruning the baseline BERT-large model. When compressing GPT2, ZipLM outperforms DistilGPT2 while being 60% smaller and 30% faster. Our code is available at: https://github.com/IST-DASLab/ZipLM.",

Retraining-free is important for LLMs' pruning methods. However, almost all of the existing retraining-free pruning approaches for LLMs focus on unstructured pruning, which requires specific hardware support for acceleration. In this paper, we propose a novel retraining-free structured pruning framework for LLMs, named FLAP (FLuctuation-based Adaptive\nStructured Pruning). It is hardware-friendly by effectively reducing storage and enhancing inference speed. For effective structured pruning of LLMs, we highlight three critical elements that demand the utmost attention: formulating structured importance metrics, adaptively searching the global compressed model, and implementing compensation mechanisms to mitigate performance loss. First, FLAP determines whether the output feature map is easily recoverable when a column of weight is removed, based on the fluctuation pruning metric. Then it standardizes the importance scores to adaptively determine the global compressed model structure. At last, FLAP adds additional bias terms to recover the output feature maps using the baseline values. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on a variety of language benchmarks. Without any retraining, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including LLM-Pruner and the extension of Wanda in structured pruning.

In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller general-purpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be fine-tuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts. While most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-specific models, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster. To leverage the inductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device study.",

As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.",

Specifically, due to their massive size, even inference for large, highly-accurate GPT models may require multiple performant GPUs, which limits the usability of such models. While there is emerging work on relieving this pressure via model compression, the applicability and performance of existing compression techniques is limited by the scale and complexity of GPT models. In this paper, we address this challenge, and propose GPTQ, a new one-shot weight quantization method based on approximate second-order information, that is both highly-accurate and highly-efficient. Specifically, GPTQ can quantize GPT models with 175 billion parameters in approximately four GPU hours, reducing the bitwidth down to 3 or 4 bits per weight, with negligible accuracy degradation relative to the uncompressed baseline. Our method more than doubles the compression gains relative to previously-proposed one-shot quantization methods, preserving accuracy, allowing us for the first time to execute an 175 billion-parameter model inside a single GPU for generative inference. Moreover, we also show that our method can still provide reasonable accuracy in the extreme quantization regime, in which weights are quantized to 2-bit or even ternary quantization levels. We show experimentally that these improvements can be leveraged for end-to-end inference speedups over FP16, of around 3.25x when using high-end GPUs (NVIDIA A100) and 4.5x when using more cost-effective ones (NVIDIA A6000).

Existing methods, however, require either retraining, which is rarely affordable for billion-scale LLMs, or solving a weight reconstruction problem reliant on second-order information, which may also be computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel, straightforward yet effective pruning method, termed Wanda (Pruning by Weights and activations), designed to induce sparsity in pretrained LLMs. Motivated by the recent observation of emergent large magnitude features in LLMs, our approach prunes weights with the smallest magnitudes multiplied by the corresponding input activations, on a per-output basis. Notably, Wanda requires no retraining or weight update, and the pruned LLM can be used as is. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our method Wanda on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 across various language benchmarks. Wanda significantly outperforms the established baseline of magnitude pruning and performs competitively against recent method involving intensive weight update.

Also, conventional networks fix the architecture before training starts; as a result, training cannot improve the architecture. To address these limitations, we describe a method to reduce the storage and computation required by neural networks by an order of magnitude without affecting their accuracy by learning only the important connections. Our method prunes redundant connections using a three-step method. First, we train the network to learn which connections are important. Next, we prune the unimportant connections. Finally, we retrain the network to fine tune the weights of the remaining connections. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the number of parameters of AlexNet by a factor of 9x, from 61 million to 6.7 million, without incurring accuracy loss. Similar experiments with VGG-16 found that the number of parameters can be reduced by 13x, from 138 million to 10.3 million, again with no loss of accuracy."

Due to deep learning models' high computational and storage needs, model compression has become more and more crucial. These methods are created to make it possible to deploy complicated models on devices with limited resources or in large-scale distributed systems with constrained processing, memory, and storage. To enhance the efficacy and efficiency of deep learning models in various applications, it is possible to employ these techniques either in isolation or in conjunction."

Especially, there have been three main types of research, e.g.,encoder-only LMs (Devlin et al., 2019;He et al., 2023), decoder-only LMs (Touvron et al., 2023;OpenAI, 2023), and encoder-decoder LMs (Lewis et al., 2020;Raffel et al., 2020;Chung et al., 2022b;Tay et al., 2023), which aim for their specific expertise. On the other perspective of LM researches rather than performances, efficiency of LMs (e.g.,computational and memory cost) have been intensively studied because of their huge computational requirements. This research direction is called model compression. Among the various model compression techniques (Jiao et al., 2020;Yao et al., 2022), pruning (Frankle and Carbin, 2018;Sanh et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020c;Xia et al., 2022) is a promising method that aims to remove redundant weights from networks, resulting in improved efficiency by saving storage capacity and enhancing inference speed."

Structured pruning method delivers a static compact model by removing structured blocks of weights, e.g. heads (Voita et al., 2019), Michel et al., 2019) and encoder layers (Fan et al., 2019). However, removing a large proportion of parameters may result in noticeable accuracy loss. To address this, the distillation paradigm is commonly adopted for recovery training, where the pruned model learns the knowledge delivered from the unpruned model. (Sanh et al., 2020) While these pruning methods achieve compelling results, they are static and have a fixed computation route for all inputs, regardless of the differing information redundancy of various sequences."

We find that the most important and confident heads play consistent and often linguistically-interpretable roles. When pruning heads using a method based on stochastic gates and a differentiable relaxation of the L0 penalty, we observe that specialized heads are last to be pruned. Our novel pruning method removes the vast majority of heads without seriously affecting performance. For example, on the English-Russian WMT dataset, pruning 38 out of 48 encoder heads results in a drop of only 0.15 BLEU."

These models contain hundreds of millions of parameters, necessitating a large amount of computation and making them prone to overfitting. In this work, we explore LayerDrop, a form of structured dropout, which has a regularization effect during training and allows for efficient pruning at inference time. In particular, we show that it is possible to select sub-networks of any depth from one large network without having to finetune them and with limited impact on performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by improving the state of the art on machine translation, language modeling, summarization, question answering, and language understanding benchmarks. Moreover, we show that our approach leads to small BERT-like models of higher quality compared to training from scratch or using distillation."

                            "Unstructured Pruning is a compression approach that removes individual weights or groups of weights in a model by applying a mask or setting the weight values to 0. This compression approach has been broadly studied in computer vision (Han et al., 2015), and many methods can remove 70% or more of model weights with little to no loss in accuracy. Models pruned can be 20x smaller in terms of pure model size and, when paired with a sparsity-aware inference engine such as DeepSparse (Magic, 2023), provide 3-5x speedups in inference throughput. Focused on language models, recent work has shown that it is possible to prune models during pre-training with little to no loss in accuracy (Sanh et al., 2020) (Kurti\u0107 et al., 2022"

Quantization is a widely employed approach in the compression of post-training large language models [9,40,42]. By reducing the bit precision, quantization methods necessitate lower memory utilization, thus facilitating faster computations and, consequently, higher efficiency. Distillation methods distill the knowledge from larger models and embed it into smaller models to approach model compression [5,15,17]. Another noteworthy method for model compression is pruning [21]26]. Pruning achieves reduced complexity by eliminating relatively less impactful model components, effectively reducing the model's size."

                            "The growing energy and performance costs of deep learning have driven the community to reduce the size of neural networks by selectively pruning components. Similarly to their biological counterparts, sparse networks generalize just as well, if not better than, the original dense networks. Sparsity can reduce the memory footprint of regular networks to fit mobile devices, as well as shorten training time for ever growing networks. In this paper, we survey prior work on sparsity in deep learning and provide an extensive tutorial of sparsification for both inference and training. We describe approaches to remove and add elements of neural networks, different training strategies to achieve model sparsity, and mechanisms to exploit sparsity in practice. Our work distills ideas from more than 300 research papers and provides guidance to practitioners who wish to utilize sparsity today, as well as to researchers whose goal is to push the frontier forward. We include the necessary background on mathematical methods in sparsification, describe phenomena such as early structure adaptation, the intricate relations between sparsity and the training process, and show techniques for achieving acceleration on real hardware. We also define a metric of pruned parameter efficiency that could serve as a baseline for comparison of different sparse networks. We close by speculating on how sparsity can improve future workloads and outline major open problems in the field."

Unstructured pruning targets individual weights by zeroing them out or applying masks based on certain criteria, such as magnitude or other heuristics <Paper corpusId=\"247741658\" paperTitle=\"(Movva et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"259287257\" paperTitle=\"(Shen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. While this approach can achieve high sparsity without significant accuracy degradation, it often requires specialized hardware support to realize actual speed benefits due to the irregular sparse patterns it creates <Paper corpusId=\"259251699\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"271909421\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn contrast, structured pruning removes entire coherent blocks of weights or model components, such as attention heads, encoder layers, or neurons <Paper corpusId=\"247741658\" paperTitle=\"(Movva et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"258833347\" paperTitle=\"(Tan, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach is more hardware-friendly as it directly reduces model dimensions and computational requirements without requiring specialized sparse computation support <Paper corpusId=\"259251699\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Structured pruning can target various levels of model architecture:\n\n1. **Head-level pruning**: Removes entire attention heads that are deemed less important <Paper corpusId=\"162183964\" paperTitle=\"(Voita et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"258833347\" paperTitle=\"(Tan, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Layer-level pruning**: Eliminates complete encoder or decoder layers, significantly reducing model depth <Paper corpusId=\"202750230\" paperTitle=\"(Fan et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"258833347\" paperTitle=\"(Tan, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Block-level pruning**: Removes blocks of weight matrices rather than individual weights <Paper corpusId=\"259287257\" paperTitle=\"(Shen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n4. **Neuron-level pruning**: Prunes entire neurons or hidden units <Paper corpusId=\"264146174\" paperTitle=\"(Shao et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n5. **Width-reduction pruning**: Reduces model width by pruning coupled structures across dimensions <Paper corpusId=\"277275922\" paperTitle=\"(Belhaouari et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent approaches have also introduced semi-structured pruning patterns, such as 2:4 or 4:8 sparsity, which strike a balance between the flexibility of unstructured pruning and the hardware efficiency of structured pruning <Paper corpusId=\"259287257\" paperTitle=\"(Shen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"276482745\" paperTitle=\"(Qin et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. These patterns can be accelerated by emerging hardware technologies that support specific sparse formats <Paper corpusId=\"271909421\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nTo recover performance after pruning, various techniques are employed. The distillation paradigm is commonly used, where the pruned model learns knowledge from the unpruned model <Paper corpusId=\"258833347\" paperTitle=\"(Tan, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"218665313\" paperTitle=\"(Sanh et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Some methods also incorporate layerwise distillation strategies to transfer knowledge between the original and pruned models <Paper corpusId=\"247922354\" paperTitle=\"(Xia et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFinally, recent research has explored more comprehensive approaches that combine different levels of pruning. For example, CoFi jointly prunes coarse-grained (layers) and fine-grained (heads and hidden units) modules to achieve greater speedups while maintaining performance <Paper corpusId=\"247922354\" paperTitle=\"(Xia et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, Sheared-LLaMA reduces both network width and depth by removing entire layers for more efficient models <Paper corpusId=\"263830786\" paperTitle=\"(Xia et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"277275922\" paperTitle=\"(Belhaouari et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "Pruning for Language Model Compression. The surging complexity of Transformer-based language models, which now feature hundreds of billions of parameters, has accentuated the urgent need for effective and efficient model pruning methods (Han et al., 2015)(Han et al., 2015)(Hassibi et al., 1993). These pruning methods can be broadly classified into structured and unstructured approaches. Structured pruning is more hardware-friendly, as it directly prunes entire segments of weights, thereby removing consecutive computations [17,(Liu et al., 2023). Unstructured pruning (sparsification) is also receiving interest, particularly as hardware advancements increasingly support the acceleration of sparse patterns such as 2:4 or 4:8 sparse [20]. Techniques such as SparseGPT (Frantar et al., 2023) extend the OBS (Hassibi et al., 1993) methodology to column-wise prune weights, allowing the modification of values in the unpruned columns to compensate for the pruning errors. Aaquib et al. (Syed et al., 2023) enhance SparseGPT by incorporating minimal iterative task fine-tuning during the pruning process, demonstrating performance improvements at high sparsity levels. Wanda [27] introduces a simple yet effective no-retraining-needed pruning strategy that prunes weights based on their magnitudes and corresponding activations. OWL (Yin et al., 2023) considers the inhomogeneous distribution of interlayer outliers and further extends Wanda to a non-uniform sparsity distribution, achieving better performance. DS\u2205T (Zhang et al., 2023) and SPP (Lu et al., 2024), as fine-tuning methods designed for sparse models, can improve the performance of pruned PLMs within limited complexity."

                            "Pruning has emerged as a promising approach to compress and accelerate DNN models, significantly reducing storage and computational costs. Structured pruning method delivers a static compact model by removing structured blocks of weights, e.g. heads (Voita et al., 2019), Michel et al., 2019) and encoder layers (Fan et al., 2019). However, removing a large proportion of parameters may result in noticeable accuracy loss. To address this, the distillation paradigm is commonly adopted for recovery training, where the pruned model learns the knowledge delivered from the unpruned model. (Sanh et al., 2020) While these pruning methods achieve compelling results, they are static and have a fixed computation route for all inputs, regardless of the differing information redundancy of various sequences."

In this work we evaluate the contribution made by individual attention heads to the overall performance of the model and analyze the roles played by them in the encoder. We find that the most important and confident heads play consistent and often linguistically-interpretable roles. When pruning heads using a method based on stochastic gates and a differentiable relaxation of the L0 penalty, we observe that specialized heads are last to be pruned. Our novel pruning method removes the vast majority of heads without seriously affecting performance. For example, on the English-Russian WMT dataset, pruning 38 out of 48 encoder heads results in a drop of only 0.15 BLEU."

In particular, we show that it is possible to select sub-networks of any depth from one large network without having to finetune them and with limited impact on performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by improving the state of the art on machine translation, language modeling, summarization, question answering, and language understanding benchmarks. Moreover, we show that our approach leads to small BERT-like models of higher quality compared to training from scratch or using distillation."

                            "The compression of language models has gained significant attention, leading to the development of various methods, including network pruning 12 , knowledge distillation, and quantization 13 . LLM-Pruner 14 and FLAP 15 aim to reduce network width by pruning coupled structures. Sheared-LLaMA 16 takes a more comprehensive approach, reducing network width and depth by removing entire layers. While methods that address both width and depth aspects exist 17,18 , there is still a need for in-depth analysis comparing the impact of these factors on LLM inference efficiency. Applying traditional pruning techniques to LLMs presents unique challenges due to their vast number of parameters and substantial computational requirements 19 . Pruning methods for LLMs can be broadly categorized into unstructured and structured approaches.\n\nStructured pruning methods 20 focus on removing entire groups of parameters, maintaining dense weight matrices, and improving hardware efficiency. Techniques such as LLM-Pruner 14 and LoRAPrune 11 emphasize efficient deployment and inference acceleration. Sheared-LLaMA 16 aims to prune models to a target architecture and train them dynamically. The work of Tao introduces a novel compression technique called QuantGPT. This method focused on quantization and module adaptation, allowing for systematic compression while maintaining the integrity of the model's architecture and performance 25 . LightPAFF focuses on transferring knowledge from a more prominent (teacher) model to a smaller (student) model. This process inherently involves structuring the model to retain important features learned by the teacher rather than simply removing individual weights, as seen in unstructured pruning 21 . Unstructured pruning methods 22 target individual weights, maintaining performance. Notable examples include SparseGPT 23 , which employs sophisticated weight updates and pruning without retraining."

We propose the use of movement pruning, a simple, deterministic first-order weight pruning method that is more adaptive to pretrained model fine-tuning. We give mathematical foundations to the method and compare it to existing zeroth- and first-order pruning methods. Experiments show that when pruning large pretrained language models, movement pruning shows significant improvements in high-sparsity regimes. When combined with distillation, the approach achieves minimal accuracy loss with down to only 3% of the model parameters."

                            "The growing size of neural language models has led to increased attention in model compression. The two predominant approaches are pruning, which gradually removes weights from a pre-trained model, and distillation, which trains a smaller compact model to match a larger one. Pruning methods can significantly reduce the model size but hardly achieve large speedups as distillation. However, distillation methods require large amounts of unlabeled data and are expensive to train. In this work, we propose a task-specific structured pruning method CoFi (Coarse- and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers highly parallelizable subnetworks and matches the distillation methods in both accuracy and latency, without resorting to any unlabeled data. Our key insight is to jointly prune coarse-grained (e.g., layers) and fine-grained (e.g., heads and hidden units) modules, which controls the pruning decision of each parameter with masks of different granularity. We also devise a layerwise distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models during optimization. Our experiments on GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that CoFi yields models with over 10X speedups with a small accuracy drop, showing its effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous pruning and distillation approaches."

In this work, we study structured pruning as an effective means to develop smaller LLMs from pre-trained, larger models. Our approach employs two key techniques: (1) targeted structured pruning, which prunes a larger model to a specified target shape by removing layers, heads, and intermediate and hidden dimensions in an end-to-end manner, and (2) dynamic batch loading, which dynamically updates the composition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying losses across different domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting the Sheared-LLaMA series, pruning the LLaMA2-7B model down to 1.3B and 2.7B parameters. Sheared-LLaMA models outperform state-of-the-art open-source models of equivalent sizes, such as Pythia, INCITE, OpenLLaMA and the concurrent TinyLlama models, on a wide range of downstream and instruction tuning evaluations, while requiring only 3% of compute compared to training such models from scratch. This work provides compelling evidence that leveraging existing LLMs with structured pruning is a far more cost-effective approach for building competitive small-scale LLMs"

We can execute SparseGPT on the largest available open-source models, OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B, in under 4.5 hours, and can reach 60% unstructured sparsity with negligible increase in perplexity: remarkably, more than 100 billion weights from these models can be ignored at inference time. SparseGPT generalizes to semi-structured (2:4 and 4:8) patterns, and is compatible with weight quantization approaches. The code is available at: https://github.com/IST-DASLab/sparsegpt."

                            "As their size increases, Large Languages Models (LLMs) are natural candidates for network pruning methods: approaches that drop a subset of network weights while striving to preserve performance. Existing methods, however, require either retraining, which is rarely affordable for billion-scale LLMs, or solving a weight reconstruction problem reliant on second-order information, which may also be computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel, straightforward yet effective pruning method, termed Wanda (Pruning by Weights and activations), designed to induce sparsity in pretrained LLMs. Motivated by the recent observation of emergent large magnitude features in LLMs, our approach prunes weights with the smallest magnitudes multiplied by the corresponding input activations, on a per-output basis. Notably, Wanda requires no retraining or weight update, and the pruned LLM can be used as is. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our method Wanda on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 across various language benchmarks. Wanda significantly outperforms the established baseline of magnitude pruning and performs competitively against recent method involving intensive weight update.

                            "Large Language Models (LLMs), renowned for their remarkable performance across diverse domains, present a challenge when it comes to practical deployment due to their colossal model size. In response to this challenge, efforts have been directed toward the application of traditional network pruning techniques to LLMs, uncovering a massive number of parameters that can be pruned in one-shot without hurting performance. Prevailing LLM pruning strategies have consistently adhered to the practice of uniformly pruning all layers at equivalent sparsity, resulting in robust performance. However, this observation stands in contrast to the prevailing trends observed in the field of vision models, where non-uniform layerwise sparsity typically yields stronger results. To understand the underlying reasons for this disparity, we conduct a comprehensive study and discover a strong correlation with the emergence of activation outliers in LLMs. Inspired by this finding, we introduce a novel LLM pruning methodology that incorporates a tailored set of non-uniform layerwise sparsity ratios, termed as Outlier Weighed Layerwise sparsity (OWL). The sparsity ratio of OWL is proportional to the outlier ratio observed within each layer, facilitating a more effective alignment between layerwise weight sparsity and outlier ratios. Our empirical evaluation, conducted across the LLaMA-V1 family and OPT, spanning various benchmarks, demonstrates the distinct advantages offered by OWL over previous methods. For instance, OWL exhibits a remarkable performance gain, surpassing the state-of-the-art Wanda and SparseGPT by 61.22 and 6.80 perplexity at a high sparsity level of 70%, respectively, while delivering 2.6x end-to-end inference speed-up in the DeepSparse inference engine.

                            "Network Pruning is a promising way to address the huge computing resource demands of the deployment and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). Retraining-free is important for LLMs' pruning methods. However, almost all of the existing retraining-free pruning approaches for LLMs focus on unstructured pruning, which requires specific hardware support for acceleration. In this paper, we propose a novel retraining-free structured pruning framework for LLMs, named FLAP (FLuctuation-based Adaptive\nStructured Pruning). It is hardware-friendly by effectively reducing storage and enhancing inference speed. For effective structured pruning of LLMs, we highlight three critical elements that demand the utmost attention: formulating structured importance metrics, adaptively searching the global compressed model, and implementing compensation mechanisms to mitigate performance loss. First, FLAP determines whether the output feature map is easily recoverable when a column of weight is removed, based on the fluctuation pruning metric. Then it standardizes the importance scores to adaptively determine the global compressed model structure. At last, FLAP adds additional bias terms to recover the output feature maps using the baseline values. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on a variety of language benchmarks. Without any retraining, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including LLM-Pruner and the extension of Wanda in structured pruning.

                            "Large language models have become the cornerstone of natural language processing, but their use comes with substantial costs in terms of compute and memory resources. Sparsification provides a solution to alleviate these resource constraints, and recent works have shown that trained models can be sparsified post-hoc. Existing sparsification techniques face challenges as they need additional data structures and offer constrained speedup with current hardware. In this paper we present SliceGPT, a new post-training sparsification scheme which replaces each weight matrix with a smaller (dense) matrix, reducing the embedding dimension of the network. Through extensive experimentation, we show that SliceGPT can remove up to 25% of the model parameters (including embeddings) for LLAMA2-70B, OPT 66B and Phi-2 models while maintaining 99%, 99% and 90% zero-shot task performance of the dense model respectively. Our sliced models run on fewer GPUs and run faster without any additional code optimization: on 24GB consumer GPUs we reduce the total compute for inference on LLAMA2-70B to 64% of that of the dense model; on 40GB A100 GPUs we reduce it to 66%. We offer a new insight, computational invariance in transformer networks, which enables SliceGPT and we hope it will inspire and enable future avenues to reduce memory and computation demands for pre-trained models.

                            "The ever-increasing large language models (LLMs), though opening a potential path for the upcoming artificial general intelligence, sadly drops a daunting obstacle on the way towards their on-device deployment. As one of the most well-established pre-LLMs approaches in reducing model complexity, network pruning appears to lag behind in the era of LLMs, due mostly to its costly fine-tuning (or re-training) necessity under the massive volumes of model parameter and training data. To close this industry-academia gap, we introduce Dynamic Sparse No Training (DSnoT), a training-free fine-tuning approach that slightly updates sparse LLMs without the expensive backpropagation and any weight updates. Inspired by the Dynamic Sparse Training, DSnoT minimizes the reconstruction error between the dense and sparse LLMs, in the fashion of performing iterative weight pruning-and-growing on top of sparse LLMs. To accomplish this purpose, DSnoT particularly takes into account the anticipated reduction in reconstruction error for pruning and growing, as well as the variance w.r.t. different input data for growing each weight. This practice can be executed efficiently in linear time since its obviates the need of backpropagation for fine-tuning LLMs. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-V1/V2, Vicuna, and OPT across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DSnoT in enhancing the performance of sparse LLMs, especially at high sparsity levels. For instance, DSnoT is able to outperform the state-of-the-art Wanda by 26.79 perplexity at 70% sparsity with LLaMA-7B. Our paper offers fresh insights into how to fine-tune sparse LLMs in an efficient training-free manner and open new venues to scale the great potential of sparsity to LLMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/zyxxmu/DSnoT."

Traditional layer-wise pruning methods often adopt a uniform sparsity approach across all layers, which leads to suboptimal performance due to the varying significance of individual transformer layers within the model not being accounted for. To this end, we propose the Shapley Value-based Non-Uniform Pruning (SV-NUP) method for LLMs. This approach quantifies the contribution of each transformer layer to the overall model performance, enabling the assignment of tailored pruning budgets to different layers to retain critical parameters. To further improve efficiency, we design the Sliding Window-based Shapley Value approximation method."

                            "Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency across a wide array of NLP tasks. However, the escalation in model size also engenders substantial deployment costs. While few efforts have explored model pruning techniques to reduce the size of LLMs, they mainly center on general or task-specific weights. This leads to suboptimal performance due to lacking specificity on the target domain or generality on different tasks when applied to domain-specific challenges. This work introduces an innovative unstructured dual-pruning methodology, D-Pruner, for domain-specific compression on LLM. It extracts a compressed, domain-specific, and task-agnostic LLM by identifying LLM weights that are pivotal for general capabilities, like linguistic capability and multi-task solving, and domain-specific knowledge. More specifically, we first assess general weight importance by quantifying the error incurred upon their removal with the help of an open-domain calibration dataset. Then, we utilize this general weight importance to refine the training loss, so that it preserves generality when fitting into a specific domain. Moreover, by efficiently approximating weight importance with the refined training loss on a domain-specific calibration dataset, we obtain a pruned model emphasizing generality and specificity. Our comprehensive experiments across various tasks in healthcare and legal domains show the effectiveness of D-Pruner in domain-specific compression. Our code is available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/D-Pruner."

Recent work demonstrates that post-training quantization can be effectively combined with pruning methods to substantially reduce model size and inference latency <Paper corpusId=\"273507514\" paperTitle=\"(Williams et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"258999941\" paperTitle=\"(Lin et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"259203115\" paperTitle=\"(Sun et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. For instance, QPruner employs structured pruning followed by layer-wise mixed-precision quantization, using Bayesian optimization to determine optimal precision allocation for different layers based on their importance <Paper corpusId=\"274776787\" paperTitle=\"(Zhou et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This combined approach addresses both computational and memory constraints simultaneously.\n\n## Pruning with Knowledge Distillation\n\nKnowledge distillation, where knowledge is transferred from larger to smaller models, provides an effective mechanism to recover performance after pruning. Layerwise distillation strategies can efficiently transfer knowledge between original and pruned models <Paper corpusId=\"263677297\" paperTitle=\"(Malihi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"258035138\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Some approaches use pre-pruning and post-pruning networks as teacher-student pairs, enabling the pruned model to learn intermediate and output representations from the original model <Paper corpusId=\"258035138\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. CoFi, for example, combines coarse-grained and fine-grained pruning with layerwise distillation to achieve significant speedups with minimal accuracy loss <Paper corpusId=\"247922354\" paperTitle=\"(Xia et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Sequence and Proportion of Compression Techniques\n\nThe order and proportion in which pruning and other techniques are applied significantly impacts the final model's performance. Some research indicates that applying pruning before quantization and then distillation yields optimal results <Paper corpusId=\"235719025\" paperTitle=\"(Aghli et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. For example, PQK combines pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation in a structured progression specifically designed for edge device deployment <Paper corpusId=\"263677297\" paperTitle=\"(Malihi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Hardware Considerations\n\nThe choice of pruning method should align with hardware capabilities. While unstructured pruning achieves higher sparsity rates, it requires specialized hardware support to realize actual speedups due to irregular sparse patterns <Paper corpusId=\"259251699\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Structured pruning methods are generally more hardware-friendly as they directly reduce model dimensions without requiring specialized sparse computation support <Paper corpusId=\"259251699\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. \n\n## Adaptive Compression Frameworks\n\nEmerging frameworks adopt dynamic approaches that adapt compression techniques based on specific usage scenarios. These frameworks integrate multiple techniques\u2014pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation\u2014adjusting model size according to deployment requirements <Paper corpusId=\"275869391\" paperTitle=\"(Chander, 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. For instance, layer pruning techniques for Sentence-BERT models have demonstrated the ability to maintain 98% of original performance even after removing 40% of model layers <Paper corpusId=\"272828010\" paperTitle=\"(Shelke et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n## Resource-Constrained Applications\n\nFor applications with specific latency requirements, methods like SwiftPruner leverage evolution-based search to automatically find the best-performing layer-wise sparse model under desired latency constraints <Paper corpusId=\"251979775\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, for mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, specialized approaches like MC-SMoE merge experts based on routing statistics before applying additional compression techniques, achieving up to 80% memory reduction and 20% FLOPs reduction with negligible performance loss <Paper corpusId=\"263605809\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al._1, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe integration of pruning with other compression techniques represents a promising direction for making large language models more accessible across a wider range of applications and deployment scenarios, particularly those with limited computational resources <Paper corpusId=\"273811289\" paperTitle=\"(Yang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "To reduce the inference cost of pre-trained transformer models, a variety of compression techniques have been proposed, including weight pruning [8,(Lagunas et al., 2021)[30], quantization [4,17,(Shen et al., 2019) and distillation [15,29]. Token-level pruning has been shown to complement knowledge distillation and quantization (Kim et al., 2021)",
                            "Weight pruning is categorized into 1) unstructured and 2) structured pruning. Unstructured methods [8]30] achieve high sparsity without accuracy drop but offer minimal latency benefits due to irregular sparse patterns. In contrast, structured pruning removes coherent weight groups, reducing latency without special hardware support. CoFi (Xia et al., 2022) achieves 10\u00d7 speedup with a small accuracy drop by jointly pruning layers, attention heads, FFN, and hidden units. SwiftPruner (Zhang et al., 2022) is a latency-aware pruning method that finds optimal layer-wise pruning policies under a given latency requirement through AutoML."

On-device LLM is becoming increasingly important: running LLMs locally on edge devices can reduce cloud computing costs and protect users' privacy. However, the astronomical model size and the limited hardware resources pose significant deployment challenges. To solve these issues, we propose Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) and TinyChat, an algorithm-system full-stack solution for efficient on-device LLM deployment. AWQ is a novel quantization method that identifies and protects salient weights based on activation distribution, significantly reducing model size while preserving performance. TinyChat, an optimized inference framework, translates AWQ's theoretical memory savings into practical speedups through techniques such as on-the-fly dequantization, SIMD-aware weight packing, and kernel fusion. Together, they enable 4x model size reduction and 3-4x acceleration across various edge platforms, from high-end desktop GPUs to resource-constrained IoT devices. This solution democratizes on-device LLM deployment, offering privacy-preserving, low-latency AI capabilities across a wide range of applications."

                            "As their size increases, Large Languages Models (LLMs) are natural candidates for network pruning methods: approaches that drop a subset of network weights while striving to preserve performance. Existing methods, however, require either retraining, which is rarely affordable for billion-scale LLMs, or solving a weight reconstruction problem reliant on second-order information, which may also be computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel, straightforward yet effective pruning method, termed Wanda (Pruning by Weights and activations), designed to induce sparsity in pretrained LLMs. Motivated by the recent observation of emergent large magnitude features in LLMs, our approach prunes weights with the smallest magnitudes multiplied by the corresponding input activations, on a per-output basis. Notably, Wanda requires no retraining or weight update, and the pruned LLM can be used as is. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our method Wanda on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 across various language benchmarks. Wanda significantly outperforms the established baseline of magnitude pruning and performs competitively against recent method involving intensive weight update.

However, the combined errors from pruning and quantization increase the difficulty of fine-tuning, requiring a more refined quantization scheme. To this end, we propose QPruner, a novel framework that employs structured pruning to reduce model size, followed by a layer-wise mixed-precision quantization scheme. Quantization precisions are assigned to each layer based on their importance to the target task, and Bayesian optimization is employed to refine precision allocation strategies, ensuring a balance between model accuracy and memory efficiency."

                            "Although the classification method based on the deep neural network has achieved excellent results in classification tasks, it is difficult to apply to real-time scenarios because of high memory footprints and prohibitive inference times. Compared to unstructured pruning, structured pruning techniques can reduce the computation cost of the model runtime more effectively, but inevitably reduces the precision of the model. Traditional methods use fine tuning to restore model damage performance. However, there is still a large gap between the pruned model and the original one. In this paper, we use progressive multi-level distillation learning to compensate for the loss caused by pruning. Pre-pruning and post-pruning networks serve as the teacher and student networks. The proposed approach utilizes the complementary properties of structured pruning and knowledge distillation, which allows the pruned network to learn the intermediate and output representations of the teacher network, thus reducing the influence of the model subject to pruning. Experiments demonstrate that our approach performs better on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets with different pruning rates. For instance, GoogLeNet can achieve near lossless pruning on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 60% pruning. Moreover, this paper also proves that using the proposed distillation learning method during the pruning process achieves more significant performance gains than after completing the pruning."

                            "The growing size of neural language models has led to increased attention in model compression. The two predominant approaches are pruning, which gradually removes weights from a pre-trained model, and distillation, which trains a smaller compact model to match a larger one. Pruning methods can significantly reduce the model size but hardly achieve large speedups as distillation. However, distillation methods require large amounts of unlabeled data and are expensive to train. In this work, we propose a task-specific structured pruning method CoFi (Coarse- and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers highly parallelizable subnetworks and matches the distillation methods in both accuracy and latency, without resorting to any unlabeled data. Our key insight is to jointly prune coarse-grained (e.g., layers) and fine-grained (e.g., heads and hidden units) modules, which controls the pruning decision of each parameter with masks of different granularity. We also devise a layerwise distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models during optimization. Our experiments on GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that CoFi yields models with over 10X speedups with a small accuracy drop, showing its effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous pruning and distillation approaches."

While these pruning methods work well on simple networks such as VGG or AlexNet, they are not suitable for compressing current state-of-the-art networks such as ResNets because of these networks\u2019 complex architectures with dimensionality dependencies. This dependency results in filter pruning breaking the structure of ResNets leading to an untrainable network. In this paper, we first use the weight pruning method only on a selective number of layers in the ResNet architecture to avoid breaking the network structure. Second, we introduce a knowledge distillation architecture and a loss function to compress the untouched layers during the pruning. We test our method on both image-based regression and classification networks for head-pose estimation and image classification. Our compression method reduces the models\u2019 size significantly while maintaining the accuracy very close to the baseline model."

The L3Cube-MahaSBERT and HindSBERT (Joshi et al., 2022) models were established as benchmarks for generating high-quality sentence embeddings in Marathi and Hindi, respectively. These specialized models are highlighted for their effectiveness in processing these low-resource languages. These models have been rigorously trained and evaluated across various NLP tasks, including text classification and semantic similarity.\n\nOur research aims to extend these foundational models by applying layer-pruning techniques to enhance their efficiency without compromising the quality of the embeddings. By integrating layer pruning, we seek to reduce the computational demand and improve the operational feasibility of deploying SBERT models in real-world applications, making advanced NLP tools more accessible for languages that traditionally have fewer technological resources.\n\n\u2022 A research (Sajjad et al., 2022) has showcased a range of layer pruning strategies, under-scoring their effectiveness.

                            "Ad relevance modeling plays a critical role in online advertising systems including Microsoft Bing. To leverage powerful transformers like BERT in this low-latency setting, many existing approaches perform ad-side computations offline. While efficient, these approaches are unable to serve cold start ads, resulting in poor relevance predictions for such ads. This work aims to design a new, low-latency BERT via structured pruning to empower real-time online inference for cold start ads relevance on a CPU platform. Our challenge is that previous methods typically prune all layers of the transformer to a high, uniform sparsity, thereby producing models which cannot achieve satisfactory inference speed with an acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we propose SwiftPruner - an efficient framework that leverages evolution-based search to automatically find the best-performing layer-wise sparse BERT model under the desired latency constraint. Different from existing evolution algorithms that conduct random mutations, we propose a reinforced mutator with a latency-aware multi-objective reward to conduct better mutations for efficiently searching the large space of layer-wise sparse models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher ROC AUC and lower latency than the uniform sparse baseline and state-of-the-art search methods. Remarkably, under our latency requirement of 1900us on CPU, SwiftPruner achieves a 0.86% higher AUC than the state-of-the-art uniform sparse baseline for BERT-Mini on a large scale real-world dataset. Online A/B testing shows that our model also achieves a significant 11.7% cut in the ratio of defective cold start ads with satisfactory real-time serving latency."

                            "Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has shown promise to scale up the learning capacity of neural networks, however, they have issues like (a) High Memory Usage, due to duplication of the network layers into multiple copies as experts; and (b) Redundancy in Experts, as common learning-based routing policies suffer from representational collapse. Therefore, vanilla SMoE models are memory inefficient and non-scalable, especially for resource-constrained downstream scenarios. In this paper, we ask: Can we craft a compact SMoE model by consolidating expert information? What is the best recipe to merge multiple experts into fewer but more knowledgeable experts? Our pilot investigation reveals that conventional model merging methods fail to be effective in such expert merging for SMoE. The potential reasons are: (1) redundant information overshadows critical experts; (2) appropriate neuron permutation for each expert is missing to bring all of them in alignment. To address this, we propose M-SMoE, which leverages routing statistics to guide expert merging. Specifically, it starts with neuron permutation alignment for experts; then, dominant experts and their\"group members\"are formed; lastly, every expert group is merged into a single expert by utilizing each expert's activation frequency as their weight for merging, thus diminishing the impact of insignificant experts. Moreover, we observed that our proposed merging promotes a low dimensionality in the merged expert's weight space, naturally paving the way for additional compression. Hence, our final method, MC-SMoE (i.e., Merge, then Compress SMoE), further decomposes the merged experts into low-rank and structural sparse alternatives. Extensive experiments across 8 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of MC-SMoE. For instance, our MC-SMoE achieves up to 80% memory and a 20% FLOPs reduction, with virtually no loss in performance."

                            "Recent advancements in large language models have underscored the need to reduce parameter sizes and latency (Ma et al., 2023). Compression techniques for language models include network pruning (Xu et al., 2021), knowledge distillation (Sun et al., 2019(Sun et al., , 2020)), quantization (Yao et al., 2022), decomposition (Hsu et al., 2022;Yuan et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024), and methods like early exit (Xin et al., 2020). Building on these techniques, pruning, and sparsity is crucial for MoE models, which often have up to 95% of parameters dedicated to experts. Pruning MoE models involves removing less important experts or neurons to reduce the number of active parameters during inference. For example, (Kim et al., 2021) retains the most activated experts to enhance machine translation MoE models, while (Koishekenov et al., 2022) introduces gate statistics-based pruning during decoding. Although effective, these methods are mostly confined to linguistic models in machine translation. (Chen et al., 2022) dropping-while-training approach progressively removes non-essential experts for specific tasks, tested on Switch Transformers (Fedus et al., 2021). The merge-compression (Li et al., 2023) method and EPP (Lu et al., 2024) approach, which is similar to ours, consider pruning and skipping in MoE models but face challenges in reducing computational costs."

                "text": "\nPruning large language models yields substantial performance benefits across multiple dimensions, making these powerful models more accessible for resource-constrained environments. Recent pruning methods have demonstrated remarkable compression capabilities while preserving model functionality. Unstructured pruning approaches can remove 70% or more of model weights with minimal performance degradation, resulting in models that are up to 20x smaller in terms of pure model size <Paper corpusId=\"257901132\" paperTitle=\"(Campos et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. When implemented with specialized sparsity-aware inference engines such as DeepSparse, these pruned models can achieve 3-5x improvements in inference throughput <Paper corpusId=\"257901132\" paperTitle=\"(Campos et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe efficiency gains extend beyond storage requirements to computational performance. Structured pruning approaches like CoFi (which jointly prunes layers, attention heads, and hidden units) have demonstrated up to 10x speedups with only small accuracy drops <Paper corpusId=\"259251699\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"247922354\" paperTitle=\"(Xia et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. These performance benefits are particularly important for deployment scenarios with strict latency requirements. For instance, SwiftPruner, which uses evolution-based search to find optimal layer-wise pruning policies, can automatically identify the best-performing sparse model configuration under specific latency constraints <Paper corpusId=\"259251699\" paperTitle=\"(Li et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"251979775\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe efficiency gains from pruning are especially valuable as models continue to grow in size. By removing redundant parameters, pruning enhances not only storage efficiency but also memory utilization and computational speed <Paper corpusId=\"267897588\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. SparseLLM, for example, redefines global pruning into manageable, coordinated subproblems for resource-efficient optimization, addressing both scalability issues and optimization quality <Paper corpusId=\"268041812\" paperTitle=\"(Bai et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nWhile traditional pruning methods like magnitude-based pruning have been effective for smaller models, they often struggle with large-scale LLMs due to their inability to capture complex parameter interactions <Paper corpusId=\"271909582\" paperTitle=\"(Su et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. More sophisticated approaches like SparseGPT and Wanda have emerged to address these limitations, offering better sparsity-performance tradeoffs for billion-parameter models <Paper corpusId=\"271909582\" paperTitle=\"(Su et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe recovery process after pruning is critical for maintaining performance. Many approaches adopt a distillation paradigm, where the pruned model learns from the unpruned model <Paper corpusId=\"258833347\" paperTitle=\"(Tan, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This knowledge transfer helps preserve accuracy even with significant parameter reduction <Paper corpusId=\"258833347\" paperTitle=\"(Tan, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, layerwise distillation strategies have proven effective for transferring knowledge between original and pruned models <Paper corpusId=\"273345395\" paperTitle=\"(Thangarasa et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor practical deployment, both quantization and pruning can be effectively applied in post-training settings while retaining comparable performance across downstream tasks <Paper corpusId=\"273507514\" paperTitle=\"(Williams et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"258999941\" paperTitle=\"(Lin et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"259203115\" paperTitle=\"(Sun et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This is particularly valuable since it avoids the costly retraining typically associated with compression techniques <Paper corpusId=\"278033481\" paperTitle=\"(Garg et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe combined efficiency benefits of pruning\u2014reduced storage requirements, lower memory usage, faster inference, and minimal accuracy loss\u2014make it an essential technique for deploying LLMs in environments with limited computational resources. By carefully applying pruning methods, developers can significantly improve model efficiency while maintaining the powerful capabilities that make LLMs so valuable for a wide range of applications.",

                            "The growing size of neural language models has led to increased attention in model compression. The two predominant approaches are pruning, which gradually removes weights from a pre-trained model, and distillation, which trains a smaller compact model to match a larger one. Pruning methods can significantly reduce the model size but hardly achieve large speedups as distillation. However, distillation methods require large amounts of unlabeled data and are expensive to train. In this work, we propose a task-specific structured pruning method CoFi (Coarse- and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers highly parallelizable subnetworks and matches the distillation methods in both accuracy and latency, without resorting to any unlabeled data. Our key insight is to jointly prune coarse-grained (e.g., layers) and fine-grained (e.g., heads and hidden units) modules, which controls the pruning decision of each parameter with masks of different granularity. We also devise a layerwise distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models during optimization. Our experiments on GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that CoFi yields models with over 10X speedups with a small accuracy drop, showing its effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous pruning and distillation approaches."

                            "Ad relevance modeling plays a critical role in online advertising systems including Microsoft Bing. To leverage powerful transformers like BERT in this low-latency setting, many existing approaches perform ad-side computations offline. While efficient, these approaches are unable to serve cold start ads, resulting in poor relevance predictions for such ads. This work aims to design a new, low-latency BERT via structured pruning to empower real-time online inference for cold start ads relevance on a CPU platform. Our challenge is that previous methods typically prune all layers of the transformer to a high, uniform sparsity, thereby producing models which cannot achieve satisfactory inference speed with an acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we propose SwiftPruner - an efficient framework that leverages evolution-based search to automatically find the best-performing layer-wise sparse BERT model under the desired latency constraint. Different from existing evolution algorithms that conduct random mutations, we propose a reinforced mutator with a latency-aware multi-objective reward to conduct better mutations for efficiently searching the large space of layer-wise sparse models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher ROC AUC and lower latency than the uniform sparse baseline and state-of-the-art search methods. Remarkably, under our latency requirement of 1900us on CPU, SwiftPruner achieves a 0.86% higher AUC than the state-of-the-art uniform sparse baseline for BERT-Mini on a large scale real-world dataset. Online A/B testing shows that our model also achieves a significant 11.7% cut in the ratio of defective cold start ads with satisfactory real-time serving latency."

                            "Within the realm of model compression, three prominent techniques have garnered significant attention: quantization, distillation, and pruning. Quantization is a widely employed approach in the compression of post-training large language models [9,40,42]. By reducing the bit precision, quantization methods necessitate lower memory utilization, thus facilitating faster computations and, consequently, higher efficiency. Distillation methods distill the knowledge from larger models and embed it into smaller models to approach model compression [5,15,17]. Another noteworthy method for model compression is pruning [21]26]. Pruning achieves reduced complexity by eliminating relatively less impactful model components, effectively reducing the model's size."

Yet, traditional global pruning is impractical for LLMs due to scalability issues, while local pruning, despite its efficiency, leads to suboptimal solutions. Addressing these challenges, we propose SparseLLM, a novel framework that redefines the global pruning process into manageable, coordinated subproblems, allowing for resource-efficient optimization with global optimality."

Structured pruning method delivers a static compact model by removing structured blocks of weights, e.g. heads (Voita et al., 2019), Michel et al., 2019) and encoder layers (Fan et al., 2019). However, removing a large proportion of parameters may result in noticeable accuracy loss. To address this, the distillation paradigm is commonly adopted for recovery training, where the pruned model learns the knowledge delivered from the unpruned model.

                            "Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous AI applications. On-device LLM is becoming increasingly important: running LLMs locally on edge devices can reduce cloud computing costs and protect users' privacy. However, the astronomical model size and the limited hardware resources pose significant deployment challenges. To solve these issues, we propose Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) and TinyChat, an algorithm-system full-stack solution for efficient on-device LLM deployment. AWQ is a novel quantization method that identifies and protects salient weights based on activation distribution, significantly reducing model size while preserving performance. TinyChat, an optimized inference framework, translates AWQ's theoretical memory savings into practical speedups through techniques such as on-the-fly dequantization, SIMD-aware weight packing, and kernel fusion. Together, they enable 4x model size reduction and 3-4x acceleration across various edge platforms, from high-end desktop GPUs to resource-constrained IoT devices. This solution democratizes on-device LLM deployment, offering privacy-preserving, low-latency AI capabilities across a wide range of applications."

                            "As their size increases, Large Languages Models (LLMs) are natural candidates for network pruning methods: approaches that drop a subset of network weights while striving to preserve performance. Existing methods, however, require either retraining, which is rarely affordable for billion-scale LLMs, or solving a weight reconstruction problem reliant on second-order information, which may also be computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel, straightforward yet effective pruning method, termed Wanda (Pruning by Weights and activations), designed to induce sparsity in pretrained LLMs. Motivated by the recent observation of emergent large magnitude features in LLMs, our approach prunes weights with the smallest magnitudes multiplied by the corresponding input activations, on a per-output basis. Notably, Wanda requires no retraining or weight update, and the pruned LLM can be used as is. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our method Wanda on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 across various language benchmarks. Wanda significantly outperforms the established baseline of magnitude pruning and performs competitively against recent method involving intensive weight update.

In language models, many weights can be zeroed out or eliminated with little to no effect on overall performance (Bergsma et al., 2025). By pruning these redundant parameters, we can significantly shrink model size and accelerate inference, with only a minor drop in accuracy if done carefully. Pruning thus makes models more storage-friendly, memoryefficient, and computation-efficient. Based on the granularity of removal, pruning is categorized as unstructured pruning and structured pruning",
