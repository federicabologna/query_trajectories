ONs are small (15\u201330 bp) nucleotide-based therapeutics which are capable of targeting DNA and RNA as well as other biomolecules. ONs can be subdivided into several classes based on their chemical modifications and on the mechanisms of their target interactions. Historically, the largest hindrance to the widespread usage of ON therapeutics has been their inability to effectively internalize into cells and escape from endosomes to reach their molecular targets in the cytosol or nucleus. While cell uptake has been improved, \u201cendosomal escape\u201d remains a significant problem. There are a range of approaches to overcome this, and in this review, we focus on three: altering the chemical structure of the ONs, formulating synthetic, lipid-based nanoparticles to encapsulate the ONs, or biologically loading the ONs into extracellular vesicles. This review provides a background to the design and mode of action of existing FDA-approved ONs. It presents the most common ON classifications and chemical modifications from a fundamental scientific perspective and provides a roadmap of the cellular uptake pathways by which ONs are trafficked. Finally, this review delves into each of the above-mentioned approaches to ON delivery, highlighting the scientific principles behind each and covering recent advances.",

The PEGlipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption. This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEGcoating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. 181,187,188 To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. 181,189 Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. 187,190 The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. 191 Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment. 192\u2212194 Protein corona studies provide molecular level insight into mechanisms of cellular recognition, uptake, and intracellular destiny of particles. 195 Among the different classes of adsorbed biomolecules (e.g., proteins, 196 lipids, 197 carbohydrates, 198,199 and metabolites 200 ), the apolipoprotein ApoE, involved in the metabolism of fats in the body, has",

NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. 181,189 Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. 187,190 The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. 191 Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment. 192\u2212194 Protein corona studies provide molecular level insight into mechanisms of cellular recognition, uptake, and intracellular destiny of particles. 195 Among the different classes of adsorbed biomolecules (e.g., proteins, 196 lipids, 197 carbohydrates, 198,199 and metabolites 200 ), the apolipoprotein ApoE, involved in the metabolism of fats in the body, has",

                    "text": "Recently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium. It was observed that the addition of FBS could decrease the transfection efficacy of C18 LNPs while increasing the efficacy of C14 LNPs. The authors discussed these results, suggesting that the protein corona could either hinder the uptake process or facilitate it due to other receptor-mediated phenomenon [4]. Even if the protein corona has been described to inhibit transfection, it now appears that some of the proteins included in this corona could specifically interact with cellular processes and particles trafficking [2]. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [6]. Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection. Moreover, as explained by Chen et al., PEG cannot completely eliminate the binding of proteins around LNPs, and that proteins could impact the transfection in serum. \n\nSeveral parameters must then be considered when designing LNPs. The use of long lipids-PEG can offer an efficient protection against protein corona formation, prolong the circulation of LNPs, and increase the accumulation in tumor. Nevertheless, the transfection efficacy of these LNPs could finally be lower than expected because of the barrier effect of PEG. However, this effect could be balanced by an intermediate proportion of C18 lipid-PEG in LNPs formulations if an equilibrium between efficient stealth properties and efficient transfection can be found. On the other hand, recent examples highlighted the interest in using short lipids-PEG in order to avoid long effect or to target hepatic diseases. In that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs.",

                    "text": "The recent emergence of COVID-19 vaccines composed of Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) and mRNA has highlighted the wide range of diseases that could be treated with lipid nanovectors. LNPs traditionally include nucleic acids (mRNA, siRNA) and four types of lipids: an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a phospholipid, and a lipid bound to poly(ethylene glycol) (lipid-PEG) [1]. The lipid-PEG is known to play a major role in the outcome of vectors, and it should be selected according to the application. Indeed, both the lipid and the PEG portions have an important impact on the in vivo behavior of the LNPs. While the use of PEG is important in order to confer steric stability and increase the elimination half-time of particles, the type of lipid associated with the PEG can therefore have a significant impact on its in vivo behavior. It is indeed largely described that one of the most important limitation between in vivo and in vitro translation is the important changes to LNPs' identities when they reach biological fluids [2]. Regarding the PEG chain, an intermediate length-such as molecular weight of 2000 g/mol, i.e., ~45 repetition units (PEG 2000 )-is commonly used, as this provides a good compromise between increased elimination half-time and efficient gene delivery. Short PEGs (PEG 1000 or shorter) do not prevent protein corona formation and fail to increase the particles' blood circulation time, whereas long PEGs (PEG 5000 or longer) can strongly interfere with the cellular uptake or the endosomal escape process [3][4][5]. Moreover, the lipid anchoring the PEG also demonstrated a significant impact on nanovector's outcome. Previous studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG 2000 (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG 2000 (C18, distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine) [6].",

                    "text": "The evolution of LNP size distribution profiles after incubation in fetal bovine serum (FBS) was measured by NTA in order to assess the formation of a protein corona around particles. Two main parameters were considered: the average size (Mean) and the concentration of total particles (LNPs at the initial time, LNPs and serum particles during the incubation). As shown in Figure 3, after incubation in FBS, the particle size distribution profiles (concentration/size curves) were completely different depending on the lipid-PEG included in the LNPs. A flattening and displacement of the curves was observed for the DMG-and DTA-PEG (C14)-based formulations (Figure 3G-J), indicating an increase in the mean size and a decrease in the total particle concentration over time in the presence of FBS. The increase in the mean size was related to the adsorption of proteins around LNPs. On the contrary, the DSPE-and DSG-PEG (C18)-based formulations (Figure 3A-D) did not show any flattening of their curves over time. These formulations were characterized by maintaining a constant average size with no decrease in concentration during incubation. The formulations containing Cer-PEG demonstrated intermediate results in terms of size increase and concentration decrease. Figure 4 summarizes the observations of the total particles mean size (Figure 4A) and concentration (Figure 4B) evolution as a function of time. Formulations containing C14 lipids-PEG (DMG-or DTA-PEG) showed a significant increase in the mean size (from 50 to more than 100 nm) and a decrease in concentration (normalized concentration between 8 and 50% of the initial concentration) after 4 h. Statistical analyses (Figure 4C,D) confirmed that the formulations containing C14 lipids-PEG have a significantly higher mean size after 4 h of incubation in FBS when compared with the CSL3/DSPE-PEG formulation, and a significant decrease in the normalized concentration. These results were related to the emergence of fewer but larger particles following the adsorption of proteins around the LNPs, thereby leading to the alteration of LNPs.",

                    "text": "Previous studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG 2000 (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG 2000 (C18, distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine) [6]. A few hours following parenteral injection, DMG-PEG 2000 is dissociated and replaced by a biomolecular corona including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) with specificity for hepatocytes [7,8]. DMG-PEG 2000 is therefore optimal for liver targeting, and the development of Onpattro TM is a concrete therapeutic application approved by the FDA. In this context, two short lipids-PEG (C14) were recently used in the Comirnaty \u00ae and Spikevax \u00ae COVID-19 vaccines: ALC-0159 (DTA-PEG 2000 , ditetradecylacetamide) and DMG-PEG 2000 , respectively. After an intramuscular injection, LNPs are responsible for a transient local inflammation and the recruitment of neutrophils and antigen-presenting cells [1]. In contrast, longer PEG-derivatives, such as C18 lipids-PEG, display a better anchoring ability in lipid membranes. For example, DSPE-PEG 2000 is used to effectively protect LNPs by decreasing interactions with blood proteins, allowing for a prolonged blood circulation time and increased tumor accumulation [3,9]. \n\nIn this context, the objective of this study was to develop an in vitro method to rapidly assess the behavior of LNPs in serum in order to predict their in vivo fate. For this purpose, two LNPs formulations [CSL3 or SM-102 (pH-sensitive lipids)/DSPC/Chol/lipid-PEG in 50/10/37.5/2.5 molar ratio] carrying siRNA were produced. The ionizable lipids were selected based on the promise they show for efficiently delivering nucleic acids.",

                    "text": "Previous studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG2000 (C14, dimyristoylglycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG2000 (C18, distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine) [6]. A few hours following parenteral injection, DMG-PEG2000 is dissociated and replaced by a biomolecular corona including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) with specificity for hepatocytes [7,8]. DMG-PEG2000 is therefore optimal for liver targeting, and the development of Onpattro TM is a concrete therapeutic application approved by the FDA. In this context, two short lipids-PEG (C14) were recently used in the Comirnaty \u00ae and Spikevax \u00ae COVID-19 vaccines: ALC-0159 (DTA-PEG2000, ditetradecylacetamide) and DMG-PEG2000, respectively. After an intramuscular injection, LNPs are responsible for a transient local inflammation and the recruitment of neutrophils and antigen-presenting cells [1]. In contrast, longer PEG-derivatives, such as C18 lipids-PEG, display a better anchoring ability in lipid membranes. For example, DSPE-PEG2000 is used to effectively protect LNPs by decreasing interactions with blood proteins, allowing for a prolonged blood circulation time and increased tumor accumulation [3,9]. \n\nIn this context, the objective of this study was to develop an in vitro method to rapidly assess the behavior of LNPs in serum in order to predict their in vivo fate. For this purpose, two LNPs formulations [CSL3 or SM-102 (pH-sensitive lipids)/DSPC/Chol/lipid-PEG in 50/10/37.5/2.5 molar ratio] carrying siRNA were produced. The ionizable lipids were selected based on the promise they show for efficiently delivering nucleic acids.",

Two main parameters were considered: the average size (Mean) and the concentration of total particles (LNPs at the initial time, LNPs and serum particles during the incubation). As shown in Figure 3, after incubation in FBS, the particle size distribution profiles (concentration/size curves) were completely different depending on the lipid-PEG included in the LNPs. A flattening and displacement of the curves was observed for the DMG-and DTA-PEG (C14)-based formulations (Figure 3G-J), indicating an increase in the mean size and a decrease in the total particle concentration over time in the presence of FBS. The increase in the mean size was related to the adsorption of proteins around LNPs. On the contrary, the DSPE-and DSG-PEG (C18)-based formulations (Figure 3A-D) did not show any flattening of their curves over time. These formulations were characterized by maintaining a constant average size with no decrease in concentration during incubation.",

The SM-102 lipid (Figure 1B) was recently used in the Spikevax \u00ae COVID-19 vaccine. It has a tertiary amine function allowing for electrostatic complexation with nucleic acids at acidic pH and then LNPs' stability at physiological pH [1,10]. The switchable cationic lipid CSL3 (Figure 1B) has previously demonstrated its ability to promote endosomal escape and deliver siRNA through a pH-triggered conformational switch [11][12][13]. For both formulations, five different lipids-PEG were used (Figure 1A): two C18 lipids (DSPE-and DSG-PEG), two C14 lipids (DMG-and DTA-PEG [ALC-0159]) and one asymmetric ceramide lipid (C16 and C8 [Cer-PEG]) with intermediary lipid length. LNPs were produced by a rapidmixing method. The commercial SM-102 lipid was compared with the recently developed CSL3 lipid. \n\nincreased elimination half-time and efficient gene delivery. Short PEGs (PEG1000 or shorter) do not prevent protein corona formation and fail to increase the particles' blood circulation time, whereas long PEGs (PEG5000 or longer) can strongly interfere with the cellular uptake or the endosomal escape process [3][4][5]. Moreover, the lipid anchoring the PEG also demonstrated a significant impact on nanovector's outcome. Previous studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG2000 (C14, dimyristoylglycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG2000 (C18, distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine) [6].",

Berger, Manon Degey, Jeanne Leblond Chain, E. Maquoi, B. Evrard, A. Lechanteur, G. Piel\n## Abstract\nPolyethylene glycol (PEG) is used in Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) formulations to confer stealth properties and is traditionally anchored in membranes by a lipid moiety whose length significantly impacts the LNPs fate in vivo. C18 acyl chains are efficiently anchored in the membrane, while shorter C14 lipids are quickly desorbed and replaced by a protein corona responsible for the completely different fate of LNPs. In this context, a method to predict the biological behavior of LNPs depending on the lipid-PEG dissociation was developed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) method in serum. Two formulations of siRNA-containing LNPs were prepared including CSL3 or SM-102 lipids and were grafted with different lipids-PEG (C18, C14 lipids-PEG, and Ceramide-PEG). The impact of the lipid-PEG on the interactions between LNPs and serum components was demonstrated by monitoring the mean particle size and the concentration over time. In vitro, these formulations demonstrated low toxicity and efficient gene knockdown on tumor MDA-MB-231 cells, but serum was found to significantly impact the efficiency of C18-PEG-based LNPs, while it did not impact the efficiency of C14-PEG-based LNPs. The NTA method demonstrated the ability to discriminate between the behaviors of LNPs according to serum proteins\u2019 interactions. CSL3 lipid and Cer-PEG were confirmed to have promise for LNP formulation.\n## Introduction\nThe recent emergence of COVID-19 vaccines composed of Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) and mRNA has highlighted the wide range of diseases that could be treated with lipid nanovectors. LNPs traditionally include nucleic acids (mRNA, siRNA) and four types of lipids: an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a phospholipid, and a lipid bound to poly(ethylene glycol) (lipid-PEG) [1]. The lipid-PEG is known to play a major role in the outcome of vectors, and it should be selected according to the application. Indeed, both the lipid and the PEG portions have an important impact on the in vivo behavior of the LNPs. While the use of PEG is important in order to confer steric stability and increase the elimination half-time of particles, the type of lipid associated with the PEG can therefore have a significant impact on its in vivo behavior. It is indeed largely described that one of the most important limitation between in vivo and in vitro translation is the important changes to LNPs' identities when they reach biological fluids [2]. Regarding the PEG chain, an intermediate length-such as molecular weight of 2000 g/mol, i.e., ~45 repetition units (PEG 2000 )-is commonly used, as this provides a good compromise between increased elimination half-time and efficient gene delivery. Short PEGs (PEG 1000 or shorter) do not prevent protein corona formation and fail to increase the particles' blood circulation time, whereas long PEGs (PEG 5000 or longer) can strongly interfere with the cellular uptake or the endosomal escape process [3][4][5]. Moreover, the lipid anchoring the PEG also demonstrated a significant impact on nanovector's outcome. Previous studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG 2000 (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG 2000 (C18, distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine) [6].\n...\nPrevious studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG 2000 (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG 2000 (C18, distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine) [6]. A few hours following parenteral injection, DMG-PEG 2000 is dissociated and replaced by a biomolecular corona including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) with specificity for hepatocytes [7,8]. DMG-PEG 2000 is therefore optimal for liver targeting, and the development of Onpattro TM is a concrete therapeutic application approved by the FDA. In this context, two short lipids-PEG (C14) were recently used in the Comirnaty \u00ae and Spikevax \u00ae COVID-19 vaccines: ALC-0159 (DTA-PEG 2000 , ditetradecylacetamide) and DMG-PEG 2000 , respectively. After an intramuscular injection, LNPs are responsible for a transient local inflammation and the recruitment of neutrophils and antigen-presenting cells [1]. In contrast, longer PEG-derivatives, such as C18 lipids-PEG, display a better anchoring ability in lipid membranes. For example, DSPE-PEG 2000 is used to effectively protect LNPs by decreasing interactions with blood proteins, allowing for a prolonged blood circulation time and increased tumor accumulation [3,9]. \n\nIn this context, the objective of this study was to develop an in vitro method to rapidly assess the behavior of LNPs in serum in order to predict their in vivo fate. For this purpose, two LNPs formulations [CSL3 or SM-102 (pH-sensitive lipids)/DSPC/Chol/lipid-PEG in 50/10/37.5/2.5 molar ratio] carrying siRNA were produced. The ionizable lipids were selected based on the promise they show for efficiently delivering nucleic acids.\n...\nThe ionizable lipids were selected based on the promise they show for efficiently delivering nucleic acids. The SM-102 lipid (Figure 1B) was recently used in the Spikevax \u00ae COVID-19 vaccine. It has a tertiary amine function allowing for electrostatic complexation with nucleic acids at acidic pH and then LNPs' stability at physiological pH [1,10]. The switchable cationic lipid CSL3 (Figure 1B) has previously demonstrated its ability to promote endosomal escape and deliver siRNA through a pH-triggered conformational switch [11][12][13]. For both formulations, five different lipids-PEG were used (Figure 1A): two C18 lipids (DSPE-and DSG-PEG), two C14 lipids (DMG-and DTA-PEG [ALC-0159]) and one asymmetric ceramide lipid (C16 and C8 [Cer-PEG]) with intermediary lipid length. LNPs were produced by a rapidmixing method. The commercial SM-102 lipid was compared with the recently developed CSL3 lipid. \n\nincreased elimination half-time and efficient gene delivery. Short PEGs (PEG1000 or shorter) do not prevent protein corona formation and fail to increase the particles' blood circulation time, whereas long PEGs (PEG5000 or longer) can strongly interfere with the cellular uptake or the endosomal escape process [3][4][5]. Moreover, the lipid anchoring the PEG also demonstrated a significant impact on nanovector's outcome. Previous studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG2000 (C14, dimyristoylglycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG2000 (C18, distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine) [6].\n...\nPrevious studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG2000 (C14, dimyristoylglycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG2000 (C18, distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine) [6].

Two main parameters were considered: the average size (Mean) and the concentration of total particles (LNPs at the initial time, LNPs and serum particles during the incubation). As shown in Figure 3, after incubation in FBS, the particle size distribution profiles (concentration/size curves) were completely different depending on the lipid-PEG included in the LNPs. A flattening and displacement of the curves was observed for the DMG-and DTA-PEG (C14)-based formulations (Figure 3G-J), indicating an increase in the mean size and a decrease in the total particle concentration over time in the presence of FBS. The increase in the mean size was related to the adsorption of proteins around LNPs. On the contrary, the DSPE-and DSG-PEG (C18)-based formulations (Figure 3A-D) did not show any flattening of their curves over time. These formulations were characterized by maintaining a constant average size with no decrease in concentration during incubation.\n...\nThe evolution of LNP size distribution profiles after incubation in fetal bovine serum (FBS) was measured by NTA in order to assess the formation of a protein corona around particles.

These formulations were characterized by maintaining a constant average size with no decrease in concentration during incubation. The formulations containing Cer-PEG demonstrated intermediate results in terms of size increase and concentration decrease. Figure 4 summarizes the observations of the total particles mean size (Figure 4A) and concentration (Figure 4B) evolution as a function of time. Formulations containing C14 lipids-PEG (DMG-or DTA-PEG) showed a significant increase in the mean size (from 50 to more than 100 nm) and a decrease in concentration (normalized concentration between 8 and 50% of the initial concentration) after 4 h. Statistical analyses (Figure 4C,D) confirmed that the formulations containing C14 lipids-PEG have a significantly higher mean size after 4 h of incubation in FBS when compared with the CSL3/DSPE-PEG formulation, and a significant decrease in the normalized concentration. These results were related to the emergence of fewer but larger particles following the adsorption of proteins around the LNPs, thereby leading to the alteration of LNPs.\n\n## Discussion\nRecently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium. It was observed that the addition of FBS could decrease the transfection efficacy of C18 LNPs while increasing the efficacy of C14 LNPs. The authors discussed these results, suggesting that the protein corona could either hinder the uptake process or facilitate it due to other receptor-mediated phenomenon [4]. Even if the protein corona has been described to inhibit transfection, it now appears that some of the proteins included in this corona could specifically interact with cellular processes and particles trafficking [2]. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [6]. Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection. Moreover, as explained by Chen et al., PEG cannot completely eliminate the binding of proteins around LNPs, and that proteins could impact the transfection in serum. \n\nSeveral parameters must then be considered when designing LNPs. The use of long lipids-PEG can offer an efficient protection against protein corona formation, prolong the circulation of LNPs, and increase the accumulation in tumor. Nevertheless, the transfection efficacy of these LNPs could finally be lower than expected because of the barrier effect of PEG. However, this effect could be balanced by an intermediate proportion of C18 lipid-PEG in LNPs formulations if an equilibrium between efficient stealth properties and efficient transfection can be found. On the other hand, recent examples highlighted the interest in using short lipids-PEG in order to avoid long effect or to target hepatic diseases. In that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs.\n\n## Conclusions\nConsidering the known obstacles that limit the development of therapeutic LNPs as the new identity acquired by these LNPs when they come into contact with biological fluids, a method to predict the biological behavior of LNPs depending on the lipid-PEG dissociation was developed using the powerful nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) method in serum. An increase in the mean size and a decrease in the particle concentration over time was correlated with important protein adsorption on LNPs from which C14 lipids-PEG were desorbed. On the contrary, for the C18 lipids-PEG LNPs, the size remained constant and the concentration did not decrease, demonstrating a stronger anchor of C18 lipid-PEG and a longer stealth effect. That method demonstrated the ability to discriminate between the different behaviors of LNPs according to serum proteins' interactions and could be used to screen new formulations in order to predict their possible fate prior to in vivo testing. \n\nRegarding the tested formulations including promising ionizable lipids (CSL3 and SM-102), the results confirmed, using live imaging, their high transfection efficacy in tumor MDA-MB-231 expressing cytoplasmic mEmerald cells, even in serum medium.

Their physiochemical attributes, encompassing size, charge and surface modifications, significantly affect their behaviors both in vivo and in vitro. Nevertheless, the effects of these properties on the transfection and distribution of LNPs after intramuscular injection remain elusive. In this study, LNPs with varying sizes, lipid-based charges and PEGylated lipids were formulated to study their transfection and in vivo distribution. Luciferase mRNA (mLuc) was entraped in LNPs as a model nucleic acid molecule. Results indicated that smaller-sized LNPs and those with neutral potential presented superior transfection efficiency after intramuscular injection. Surprisingly, the sizes and charges did not exert a notable influence on the in vivo distribution of the LNPs. Furthermore, PEGylated lipids with shorter acyl chains contributed to enhanced transfection efficiency due to their superior cellular uptake and lysosomal escape capabilities. Notably, the mechanisms underlying cellular uptake differed among LNPs containing various types of PEGylated lipids, which was primarily attributed to the length of their acyl chain. Together, these insights underscore the pivotal role of nanoparticle characteristics and PEGylated lipids in the intramuscular route. This study not only fills crucial knowledge gaps but also provides significant directions for the effective delivery of mRNA via LNPs.

Confocal microscopy revealed that the cellular uptake of LNPs by HEK293 cells increased with increasing incubation time (Fig. 5A). Specifically, LNPs containing DMG-PEG2k exhibited significantly greater cellular uptake than the other LNPs (Fig. 5A). This increased uptake may be influenced by the acyl chain length of the PEGylated lipids, suggesting that LNPs with longer acyl chains may exhibit reduced cellular uptake efficiency. The importance of acyl chain lengths of PEGylated lipids for the nucleic acid delivery of LNPs has been corroborated by a substantial body of research [2,24]. The acyl chain of DMG-PEG2k is of a shorter length than that of the other two lipids, which contributes to a faster rate of shedding efficiency. Accordingly, the cellular uptake of LNPs formulated with DMG-PEG2k is more efficient, which is in accordance with the results presented in Fig. 5A. Functional groups of PEGylated lipids also affect cellular uptake in HEK293 and DC2.4 cells. Notably, LNPs formulated with DSG-PEG2k demonstrated markedly superior cellular uptake efficiency compared to those formulated with DSPE-PEG2k (Fig. 5B). According to the results above, FBS affect cell transfection efficiency. Subsequent studies, shown in Fig. 5C, investigated the protein corona adsorbed by LNPs containing DMG-PEG2k, DSG-PEG2k, and DSPE-PEG2k in the presence of FBS. The results revealed no significant differences in the type of protein corona formed among these LNPs. The observed variations in cellular uptake between different PEGylated lipids are primarily attributed to the length of the acyl chain and the specific functional groups, factors that appear to be independent of the protein corona composition. These findings highlight the complex interactions between the structural attributes of PEGylated lipids and their functional performance in cellular environments.",

Their physiochemical attributes, encompassing size, charge and surface modifications, significantly affect their behaviors both in vivo and in vitro. Nevertheless, the effects of these properties on the transfection and distribution of LNPs after intramuscular injection remain elusive. In this study, LNPs with varying sizes, lipid-based charges and PEGylated lipids were formulated to study their transfection and in vivo distribution. Luciferase mRNA (mLuc) was entraped in LNPs as a model nucleic acid molecule. Results indicated that smaller-sized LNPs and those with neutral potential presented superior transfection efficiency after intramuscular injection. Surprisingly, the sizes and charges did not exert a notable influence on the in vivo distribution of the LNPs. Furthermore, PEGylated lipids with shorter acyl chains contributed to enhanced transfection efficiency due to their superior cellular uptake and lysosomal escape capabilities. Notably, the mechanisms underlying cellular uptake differed among LNPs containing various types of PEGylated lipids, which was primarily attributed to the length of their acyl chain. Together, these insights underscore the pivotal role of nanoparticle characteristics and PEGylated lipids in the intramuscular route. This study not only fills crucial knowledge gaps but also provides significant directions for the effective delivery of mRNA via LNPs.

Confocal microscopy revealed that the cellular uptake of LNPs by HEK293 cells increased with increasing incubation time (Fig. 5A). Specifically, LNPs containing DMG-PEG2k exhibited significantly greater cellular uptake than the other LNPs (Fig. 5A). This increased uptake may be influenced by the acyl chain length of the PEGylated lipids, suggesting that LNPs with longer acyl chains may exhibit reduced cellular uptake efficiency. The importance of acyl chain lengths of PEGylated lipids for the nucleic acid delivery of LNPs has been corroborated by a substantial body of research [2,24]. The acyl chain of DMG-PEG2k is of a shorter length than that of the other two lipids, which contributes to a faster rate of shedding efficiency. Accordingly, the cellular uptake of LNPs formulated with DMG-PEG2k is more efficient, which is in accordance with the results presented in Fig. 5A. Functional groups of PEGylated lipids also affect cellular uptake in HEK293 and DC2.4 cells. Notably, LNPs formulated with DSG-PEG2k demonstrated markedly superior cellular uptake efficiency compared to those formulated with DSPE-PEG2k (Fig. 5B). According to the results above, FBS affect cell transfection efficiency. Subsequent studies, shown in Fig. 5C, investigated the protein corona adsorbed by LNPs containing DMG-PEG2k, DSG-PEG2k, and DSPE-PEG2k in the presence of FBS. The results revealed no significant differences in the type of protein corona formed among these LNPs. The observed variations in cellular uptake between different PEGylated lipids are primarily attributed to the length of the acyl chain and the specific functional groups, factors that appear to be independent of the protein corona composition. These findings highlight the complex interactions between the structural attributes of PEGylated lipids and their functional performance in cellular environments.\n...\nPrevious studies have reported that acyl chain length affects the adsorption rate of the protein corona [43]. However, it does not significantly affect the type of protein corona formed, which has not been previously explored. The results in HEK293 cells suggest that LNPs with DMG-PEG2k are primarily internalized via clathrinmediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. In contrast, macropinocytosis, along with phagocytosis and caveolinmediated pathways, are implicated in the uptake of LNPs containing DSG-PEG2k and DSPE-PEG2k. These findings underscore the role of acyl chain length in modulating the cellular uptake mechanisms of LNPs.

It is shown that the longer hydrophobic chains of PEGylated lipids in LNPs, the more likely LNPs are to enter cells via the caveolin system. This could serve as a hypothesis for future studies.

            "abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown promise as a delivery system for nucleic acid-based therapeutics, including DNA, siRNA, and mRNA vaccines. The immune system plays a critical role in the response to these nanocarriers, with innate immune cells initiating an early response and adaptive immune cells mediating a more specific reaction, sometimes leading to potential adverse effects. Recent studies have shown that the innate immune response to LNPs is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize the lipid components of the nanoparticles. This recognition can trigger the activation of inflammatory pathways and the production of cytokines and chemokines, leading to potential adverse effects such as fever, inflammation, and pain at the injection site. On the other hand, the adaptive immune response to LNPs appears to be primarily directed against the protein encoded by the mRNA cargo, with little evidence of an ongoing adaptive immune response to the components of the LNP itself. Understanding the relationship between LNPs and the immune system is critical for the development of safe and effective nucleic acid-based delivery systems. In fact, targeting the immune system is essential to develop effective vaccines, as well as therapies against cancer or infections. There is a lack of research in the literature that has systematically studied the factors that influence the interaction between LNPs and the immune system and further research is needed to better elucidate the mechanisms underlying the immune response to LNPs. In this review, we discuss LNPs\u2019 composition, physico-chemical properties, such as size, shape, and surface charge, and the protein corona formation which can affect the reactivity of the immune system, thus providing a guide for the research on new formulations that could gain a favorable efficacy/safety profile.",

On the contrary, LNPs with longer lipid chains, such as C18 acyl chain (distearoyl-glycerol), show completely different in vivo behavior with a better anchoring ability on lipid membranes, protecting LNPs and decreasing their interaction with blood proteins [114]. siRNA-loaded LNP formulations containing PEG2000-DMG (1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000) have shorter circulation times and higher in vivo delivery efficacy than formulations containing PEG2000-DSG (1,2distearoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000), due to the faster dissociation from the LNPs, which may favor cellular uptake and endosomal escape [115]. \n\nDuring the formation of LNPs, PEG-lipid components arrange themselves with the hydrophilic polymer extended towards the aqueous medium, forming a hydrophilic coating on the surface of the LNPs which can increase their stability reducing aggregation phenomena during storage [24]. The LNP's ability to deliver their cargo to target cells is directly affected by the PEGylation; in fact, the addition of PEGylated lipid to NP formulations is widely used to increase the in vivo circulation time and prevent rapid clearance from the bloodstream.",

                    "text": "Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a hydrophilic polymer with many applications in pharmaceutical formulations, and PEGylation has become a gold standard in pharmaceutical nanocarrier modification for developing successful drug delivery systems. PEG-lipid conjugates (PEG-lipids) are lipids in which a hydrophobic alkyl chain is conjugated to a hydrophilic PEG polymer chain; PEG-lipids have been widely used in LNP formulations to deliver anti-cancer drugs, siRNA, and mRNA vaccines. PEG-lipids are present with the smallest mole percentage in the formulation of LNPs, usually not exceeding 1.5 mol%. Their presence, particularly regarding the molar ratio, can influence different NP properties such as particle size, PDI, zeta potential, and stability. LNP size is an important parameter that must be controlled during preparation because it can play a decisive role in their pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, delivery efficiency, and transfection potency [45,113]. \n\nIncreasing the molar ratio of the PEG-lipid resulted in significantly smaller LNPs, independently of other lipid components. The PEG-lipid is located at the LNP surface, and hence, raising the mol% of the PEG-lipid leads to a higher surface area-volume ratio, and thus, decrease in their particle size. \n\nThe type of PEG-lipid concerning structure, chain length, molar mass ratio, and length of the alkyl chain constituting the lipid tail can be crucial in modifying some LNP properties. Which PEG-lipid to choose depends on the therapeutic purpose, target organ and/or cell type, and administration route. \n\nRegarding the PEG chain, a molecular weight of 2000 g/mol, corresponding to about 45 repetition units (PEG 2000), is a good choice for pharmaceutical nanocarriers with a satisfactory elimination half-time and delivery efficiency. PEG with shorter chains is not so performant in terms of preventing protein corona formation and increasing blood circulation time, while PEG with longer chains can have a strong effect on cellular uptake and the endosomal escape process [114].",

Reprinted with permission [38]. \n\nMoreover, studies have shown that upon IV administration PEG-lipid with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, inducing a change in surface structure that allows ApoE adsorption to LNPs, with the formation of a protein corona that affects their endosomal escape and mRNA release. ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it.

Catenacci, Rachele Rossi, Francesca Sechi, Daniela Buonocore, Milena Sorrenti, S. Perteghella, Marco Peviani, M. Bonferoni\n## Abstract\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown promise as a delivery system for nucleic acid-based therapeutics, including DNA, siRNA, and mRNA vaccines. The immune system plays a critical role in the response to these nanocarriers, with innate immune cells initiating an early response and adaptive immune cells mediating a more specific reaction, sometimes leading to potential adverse effects. Recent studies have shown that the innate immune response to LNPs is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize the lipid components of the nanoparticles. This recognition can trigger the activation of inflammatory pathways and the production of cytokines and chemokines, leading to potential adverse effects such as fever, inflammation, and pain at the injection site. On the other hand, the adaptive immune response to LNPs appears to be primarily directed against the protein encoded by the mRNA cargo, with little evidence of an ongoing adaptive immune response to the components of the LNP itself. Understanding the relationship between LNPs and the immune system is critical for the development of safe and effective nucleic acid-based delivery systems. In fact, targeting the immune system is essential to develop effective vaccines, as well as therapies against cancer or infections. There is a lack of research in the literature that has systematically studied the factors that influence the interaction between LNPs and the immune system and further research is needed to better elucidate the mechanisms underlying the immune response to LNPs. In this review, we discuss LNPs\u2019 composition, physico-chemical properties, such as size, shape, and surface charge, and the protein corona formation which can affect the reactivity of the immune system, thus providing a guide for the research on new formulations that could gain a favorable efficacy/safety profile.\n## PEG-Lipids\nPolyethylene glycol (PEG) is a hydrophilic polymer with many applications in pharmaceutical formulations, and PEGylation has become a gold standard in pharmaceutical nanocarrier modification for developing successful drug delivery systems. PEG-lipid conjugates (PEG-lipids) are lipids in which a hydrophobic alkyl chain is conjugated to a hydrophilic PEG polymer chain; PEG-lipids have been widely used in LNP formulations to deliver anti-cancer drugs, siRNA, and mRNA vaccines. PEG-lipids are present with the smallest mole percentage in the formulation of LNPs, usually not exceeding 1.5 mol%. Their presence, particularly regarding the molar ratio, can influence different NP properties such as particle size, PDI, zeta potential, and stability. LNP size is an important parameter that must be controlled during preparation because it can play a decisive role in their pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, delivery efficiency, and transfection potency [45,113]. \n\nIncreasing the molar ratio of the PEG-lipid resulted in significantly smaller LNPs, independently of other lipid components. The PEG-lipid is located at the LNP surface, and hence, raising the mol% of the PEG-lipid leads to a higher surface area-volume ratio, and thus, decrease in their particle size. \n\nThe type of PEG-lipid concerning structure, chain length, molar mass ratio, and length of the alkyl chain constituting the lipid tail can be crucial in modifying some LNP properties. Which PEG-lipid to choose depends on the therapeutic purpose, target organ and/or cell type, and administration route. \n\nRegarding the PEG chain, a molecular weight of 2000 g/mol, corresponding to about 45 repetition units (PEG 2000), is a good choice for pharmaceutical nanocarriers with a satisfactory elimination half-time and delivery efficiency. PEG with shorter chains is not so performant in terms of preventing protein corona formation and increasing blood circulation time, while PEG with longer chains can have a strong effect on cellular uptake and the endosomal escape process [114].\n...\nPEG with shorter chains is not so performant in terms of preventing protein corona formation and increasing blood circulation time, while PEG with longer chains can have a strong effect on cellular uptake and the endosomal escape process [114]. mRNA-LNP formulations were developed using two short PEG-lipids (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) which quickly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum. On the contrary, LNPs with longer lipid chains, such as C18 acyl chain (distearoyl-glycerol), show completely different in vivo behavior with a better anchoring ability on lipid membranes, protecting LNPs and decreasing their interaction with blood proteins [114]. siRNA-loaded LNP formulations containing PEG2000-DMG (1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000) have shorter circulation times and higher in vivo delivery efficacy than formulations containing PEG2000-DSG (1,2distearoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000), due to the faster dissociation from the LNPs, which may favor cellular uptake and endosomal escape [115]. \n\nDuring the formation of LNPs, PEG-lipid components arrange themselves with the hydrophilic polymer extended towards the aqueous medium, forming a hydrophilic coating on the surface of the LNPs which can increase their stability reducing aggregation phenomena during storage [24]. The LNP's ability to deliver their cargo to target cells is directly affected by the PEGylation; in fact, the addition of PEGylated lipid to NP formulations is widely used to increase the in vivo circulation time and prevent rapid clearance from the bloodstream.\n...\nThe illustration underscores the primary challenges and drawbacks associated with LNP vaccines. One significant opportunity lies in the ability to modify the protein corona composition, which can help mitigate off-target accumulation and enhance the interaction of LNPs with antigenpresenting cells and dendritic cells. This, in turn, has the potential to significantly improve vaccine efficacy. Reprinted with permission [38]. \n\nMoreover, studies have shown that upon IV administration PEG-lipid with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, inducing a change in surface structure that allows ApoE adsorption to LNPs, with the formation of a protein corona that affects their endosomal escape and mRNA release. ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it. Furthermore, Figure 6. The illustration underscores the primary challenges and drawbacks associated with LNP vaccines. One significant opportunity lies in the ability to modify the protein corona composition, which can help mitigate off-target accumulation and enhance the interaction of LNPs with antigenpresenting cells and dendritic cells. This, in turn, has the potential to significantly improve vaccine efficacy. Reprinted with permission [38].",

            "abstract": "RNAi (RNA interference)-based technology is emerging as a versatile tool which has been widely utilized in the treatment of various diseases. siRNA can alter gene expression by binding to the target mRNA and thereby inhibiting its translation. This remarkable potential of siRNA makes it a useful candidate, and it has been successively used in the treatment of diseases, including cancer. However, certain properties of siRNA such as its large size and susceptibility to degradation by RNases are major drawbacks of using this technology at the broader scale. To overcome these challenges, there is a requirement for versatile tools for safe and efficient delivery of siRNA to its target site. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been extensively explored to this end, and this paper reviews different types of LNPs, namely liposomes, solid lipid NPs, nanostructured lipid carriers, and nanoemulsions, to highlight this delivery mode. The materials and methods of preparation of the LNPs have been described here, and pertinent physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface charge, surface modifications, and PEGylation in enhancing the delivery performance (stability and specificity) have been summarized. We have discussed in detail various challenges facing LNPs and various strategies to overcome biological barriers to undertake the safe delivery of siRNA to a target site. We additionally highlighted representative therapeutic applications of LNP formulations with siRNA that may offer unique therapeutic benefits in such wide areas as acute myeloid leukaemia, breast cancer, liver disease, hepatitis B and COVID-19 as recent examples.",

The length of the acyl chain of PEG also regulates the intracellular delivery of a drug into the target cell. Usually, to the membrane of LNPs, the PEG-lipid is anchored using the hydrophobic acyl chain [62]. PEG-lipids having short acyl chains dissociate quickly from the LNPs following injection (since less energy is required in order to break the anchoring bonds present between the PEG-lipid and LNP), allowing the LNPs to better interact with target cells. For instance, PEG-lipids with C14 acyl chains take a half-time of around 1 h to dissociate from LNPs, while PEG-lipids with C20 acyl chains take 24 h or longer half-times for dissociation. PEG shields the LNP from the serum protein such as apolipoproteins (ApoE) and albumins. Judge et al. revealed that LNPs containing high amounts of C18 PEG-lipids, showed longer circulation time and thereby enhanced the efficacy LNPs as compared to LNPs with lower amounts of C14 PEG-lipids. The reduced association of ApoE was observed due to the highly shielded LNPs provided by mPEG200. [71]. This resulted in longer circulation which led to a greater opportunity of LNPs to enter subcutaneous tumour cells [72]. However, an excessive amount of PEGylation in LNP could inhibit cellular internalization and intracellular release of the drug, resulting in reduced intracellular delivery [73]. \n\nSuzuki et al. also studied the PEG shedding profiles of DMG-LNP and DSG-LNP, respectively for encapsulation of siRNA specific for GFP or FVII. DMG-PEG with shorter acyl chains displayed faster shedding from the LNPs than the DSG-PEG having the longer acyl chain.",

Incorporation of PEG provides the LNPs with an external polymeric layer onto their outer shell, and this helps to hinder the adsorption of serum proteins and the components of a phagocytic system, thereby extending their in vivo circulation time. It prevents aggregation during storage and increases the stability of the NPs. The length and density of the polymer chains determine the circulatory half-life of LNPs. The PEG chain length and its molecular weight (750 to 5000 kDa) has shown varying effect in vivo clearance study, which resulted from its interaction with different-sized opsonins which is present in the bloodstream [69]. \n\nThe surface coating of LNP with PEG also influences the overall surface charge on LNPs. For instance, Kumar et al. studied the effect of polyethylene glycol-1,2-dimyristoylsn-glycerol-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG-DMG) for shielding the LNP surface charge using 1.5% (LNP1.5), 5% (LNP5), and 10% (LNP10) PEG-DMG concentration (Figure 3). The LNPs were formulated using 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), cholesterol, DLin-MC3-DMA. The increasing PEG-DMG concentration resulted in a decrease in zeta potential (performed at pH 5.5) which was observed to drop from +32 mV (for LNP1.5) to +24 (for LNP5) and +18 mV (for LNP10) suggesting that higher PEG-DMG reduces the surface charge density of LNP.

Pandey, H. Uluda\u01e7\n## Abstract\nRNAi (RNA interference)-based technology is emerging as a versatile tool which has been widely utilized in the treatment of various diseases. siRNA can alter gene expression by binding to the target mRNA and thereby inhibiting its translation. This remarkable potential of siRNA makes it a useful candidate, and it has been successively used in the treatment of diseases, including cancer. However, certain properties of siRNA such as its large size and susceptibility to degradation by RNases are major drawbacks of using this technology at the broader scale. To overcome these challenges, there is a requirement for versatile tools for safe and efficient delivery of siRNA to its target site. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been extensively explored to this end, and this paper reviews different types of LNPs, namely liposomes, solid lipid NPs, nanostructured lipid carriers, and nanoemulsions, to highlight this delivery mode. The materials and methods of preparation of the LNPs have been described here, and pertinent physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface charge, surface modifications, and PEGylation in enhancing the delivery performance (stability and specificity) have been summarized. We have discussed in detail various challenges facing LNPs and various strategies to overcome biological barriers to undertake the safe delivery of siRNA to a target site. We additionally highlighted representative therapeutic applications of LNP formulations with siRNA that may offer unique therapeutic benefits in such wide areas as acute myeloid leukaemia, breast cancer, liver disease, hepatitis B and COVID-19 as recent examples.\n## PEGylation\nPEG, a non-ionic biocompatible synthetic polymer, is soluble both in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents [68]. Incorporation of PEG provides the LNPs with an external polymeric layer onto their outer shell, and this helps to hinder the adsorption of serum proteins and the components of a phagocytic system, thereby extending their in vivo circulation time. It prevents aggregation during storage and increases the stability of the NPs. The length and density of the polymer chains determine the circulatory half-life of LNPs.

The length of the acyl chain of PEG also regulates the intracellular delivery of a drug into the target cell. Usually, to the membrane of LNPs, the PEG-lipid is anchored using the hydrophobic acyl chain [62]. PEG-lipids having short acyl chains dissociate quickly from the LNPs following injection (since less energy is required in order to break the anchoring bonds present between the PEG-lipid and LNP), allowing the LNPs to better interact with target cells. For instance, PEG-lipids with C14 acyl chains take a half-time of around 1 h to dissociate from LNPs, while PEG-lipids with C20 acyl chains take 24 h or longer half-times for dissociation. PEG shields the LNP from the serum protein such as apolipoproteins (ApoE) and albumins. Judge et al. revealed that LNPs containing high amounts of C18 PEG-lipids, showed longer circulation time and thereby enhanced the efficacy LNPs as compared to LNPs with lower amounts of C14 PEG-lipids. The reduced association of ApoE was observed due to the highly shielded LNPs provided by mPEG200. [71]. This resulted in longer circulation which led to a greater opportunity of LNPs to enter subcutaneous tumour cells [72]. However, an excessive amount of PEGylation in LNP could inhibit cellular internalization and intracellular release of the drug, resulting in reduced intracellular delivery [73]. \n\nSuzuki et al. also studied the PEG shedding profiles of DMG-LNP and DSG-LNP, respectively for encapsulation of siRNA specific for GFP or FVII. DMG-PEG with shorter acyl chains displayed faster shedding from the LNPs than the DSG-PEG having the longer acyl chain.",

                    "text": "Studies have demonstrated that anionic liposomes modified with PEGs could achieve enhanced clearance at the site of subcutaneous administration and increased retention in the lymph nodes when compared to liposomes that were not modified. Liposomes modified with shorter PEG chains exhibited higher retention but lower clearance in the lymph nodes compared to liposomes modified with longer PEG chains. Therefore, the targeting behavior and transfection capability of LNPs can be significantly influenced by the selection of a linear or branched PEG chain [110]. In addition to passive cellular uptake and prolonged circulation, nanoparticle uptake into target cells can be improved by attaching a receptor ligand to the particle surface. Enhancing the uptake of nanoparticles into target cells can be achieved through methods other than relying on prolonged circulation and passive cellular uptake, such as utilizing a receptor ligand that is conjugated to the particle surface. The incorporation of targeting ligands into lipid-based nanoparticles is a strategy for efficiently targeting delivery systems to specific tissues or cells, including the lymph nodes and other desired locations. The ASSET platform (Anchored Secondary scFv Enabling Targeting) was developed through the conjugation of anti-Ly6C antibodies onto lipid-based nanoparticles that were loaded with siRNA, which selectively targets inflammatory leukocytes in vivo [111,112]. Cell-penetrating peptides have demonstrated their effectiveness in facilitating the intracellular delivery of a diverse range of pharmacologically interesting molecules across various types of cells and show promise in enhancing the intracellular delivery of a wide array of biologically active agents [113]. LNPs have been modified with cell-penetrating peptides, such as R8 and GALA, to improve the uptake of these particles in dendritic cells and to enhance the immune response [114]. The exposure of LNPs to biological fluids causes the biomolecules to be rapidly adsorbed onto their surface, generating the protein corona. Initially, the protein corona comprises significant quantities of low-affinity proteins prevalent in the biological environment. As time progresses, the corona's makeup becomes enhanced with high-affinity proteins [115].",

Biological products have achieved a solid presence in clinical settings, and the anticipation of creating novel variants is increasing. These products predominantly encompass therapeutic proteins, nucleic acids and messenger RNA. The advancement of efficient LNP-based delivery systems for biologics that can overcome their limitations remains a highly favorable formulation strategy. Moreover, given their small size, biocompatibility, and biodegradation, LNPs can proficiently transport therapeutic moiety into the cells without significant toxicity and adverse reactions. This is especially crucial for the existing and upcoming biopharmaceuticals since large molecules as a group present several challenges that can be overcome by LNPs. This review describes the LNP technology for the delivery of biologics and summarizes the developments in the chemistry, manufacturing, and characterization of lipids used in the development of LNPs for biologics. Finally, we present a perspective on the potential opportunities and the current challenges pertaining to LNP technology.\n## Typical Product Attributes of LNPs\nStudies have demonstrated that anionic liposomes modified with PEGs could achieve enhanced clearance at the site of subcutaneous administration and increased retention in the lymph nodes when compared to liposomes that were not modified. Liposomes modified with shorter PEG chains exhibited higher retention but lower clearance in the lymph nodes compared to liposomes modified with longer PEG chains. Therefore, the targeting behavior and transfection capability of LNPs can be significantly influenced by the selection of a linear or branched PEG chain [110]. In addition to passive cellular uptake and prolonged circulation, nanoparticle uptake into target cells can be improved by attaching a receptor ligand to the particle surface. Enhancing the uptake of nanoparticles into target cells can be achieved through methods other than relying on prolonged circulation and passive cellular uptake, such as utilizing a receptor ligand that is conjugated to the particle surface. The incorporation of targeting ligands into lipid-based nanoparticles is a strategy for efficiently targeting delivery systems to specific tissues or cells, including the lymph nodes and other desired locations. The ASSET platform (Anchored Secondary scFv Enabling Targeting) was developed through the conjugation of anti-Ly6C antibodies onto lipid-based nanoparticles that were loaded with siRNA, which selectively targets inflammatory leukocytes in vivo [111,112]. Cell-penetrating peptides have demonstrated their effectiveness in facilitating the intracellular delivery of a diverse range of pharmacologically interesting molecules across various types of cells and show promise in enhancing the intracellular delivery of a wide array of biologically active agents [113]. LNPs have been modified with cell-penetrating peptides, such as R8 and GALA, to improve the uptake of these particles in dendritic cells and to enhance the immune response [114]. The exposure of LNPs to biological fluids causes the biomolecules to be rapidly adsorbed onto their surface, generating the protein corona. Initially, the protein corona comprises significant quantities of low-affinity proteins prevalent in the biological environment. As time progresses, the corona's makeup becomes enhanced with high-affinity proteins [115].\n\n## Role of PEG-Lipids\nPEG-lipids have a significant impact on the key characteristics of LNPs, which include particle size and polydispersity [156], the stability of LNPs during preparation and in storage, the prevention of aggregation [157], the encapsulation efficiency of nucleic acids, circulation half-life, immune response, in vivo distribution and efficiency in transfection [158,159]. The PEG-lipids used in Comirnaty \u00ae , Spikevax \u00ae and in Onpattro \u00ae are ALC-0159, PEG-DMG and PEG-c-DMG, respectively. The biological activity of LNPs is impacted by the structure of the lipid tail in PEG-lipids. Incorporation of PEG-lipids into the LNP membrane occurs through the hydrophobic tail (composed of alkyl/acyl chains). PEG-lipids possessing longer tails exhibit reduced propensity for dissociation from the LNP. Mui et al. demonstrated that PEG-lipid desorption from LNPs in circulation, analyzed one hour after administering them in vivo, was 45% for PEG-lipids containing C14 dialkyl chains, and conversely PEG-lipids with C16 and C18 dialkyl chains displayed only 1.3% and 0.2% desorption, respectively [160]. The short-chained diacyl PEG-lipid PEG-carbamate-1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol (PEG-c-DMG), which was introduced in the Onpattro \u00ae formulation, tends to desorb from the LNPs upon intravenous administration. PEG-lipids with short lipid tails enable them to desorb from LNPs, allowing the particles to adsorb apoE, facilitating LNPs to endogenously target hepatocytes in the liver [32]. PEG-lipids serve to stabilize LNPs during their preparation and storage by creating a steric barrier that facilitates self-assembly and inhibits aggregation. Moreover, the specific type of PEG-lipid used has an influence on the circulation time of LNPs and their interactions with cells.",

                    "text": "PEGylation of nanomaterials is a common strategy to provide them with steric stability, prevent opsonization and enhance their overall systemic circulation time [ 162 ]. The impact conferred by PEG-lipids on LNP circulation time is determined by the dissociation rate of the PEG-lipid from the surface of the LNP, which relates to the acyl chain length of the PEG-lipid: dissociation rate has been shown to decrease with chain length, with formulations comprised of longer chain PEG-lipids thus having a longer circulation time [ 163 ]. PEG-lipids are additionally one of the key factors controlling particle size: increasing the ratio of a PEG-lipid in LNP formulations has been hypothesized to increase compression in the lipid bilayer and enhance repulsive forces between particles, [164] consequently generating smaller particles as PEG-lipid ratio increases [ 165 , 166 ]. PEG-lipids further aid in the aqueous solubility of LNP systems and provide a 'stealth' effect to particles in vivo , through shielding the LNP surface to limit the adsorption of serum proteins, ensuring protection against mononuclear phagocyte systemic uptake and thus contributing to increased circulation time [ 162 ]. Generally, higher PEG density on the surface of lipid delivery systems generates better steric barriers through the formation of brush-like conformations; around 2% PEGylation of liposomes was found to be optimal to limit serum protein binding to the liposome surface on incubation with serum for 10 min [ 167 ]. Interestingly, though PEGylated lipids are generally incorporated at low molar ratios compared to other formulation components in mRNA-LNPs, Sago and colleagues reported mRNA-LNPs with 20% C14-PEG20 0 0 content mediated effective delivery of their cargo [ 168 ].\n\nHaving a hydrophilic layer around LNPs can, however, interfere with cellular uptake and limit endosome destabilization, consequently decreasing transfection potency [ 135 , 169 ]. In this sense, a more rapid dissociation of PEG-lipid from the LNP surface, though decreasing the circulation time of the particle, can increase its fusogenicity, allowing the LNP to more effectively deliver",

Truong\n## Abstract\nNone\n## PEG-lipids\nPEGylation of nanomaterials is a common strategy to provide them with steric stability, prevent opsonization and enhance their overall systemic circulation time [ 162 ]. The impact conferred by PEG-lipids on LNP circulation time is determined by the dissociation rate of the PEG-lipid from the surface of the LNP, which relates to the acyl chain length of the PEG-lipid: dissociation rate has been shown to decrease with chain length, with formulations comprised of longer chain PEG-lipids thus having a longer circulation time [ 163 ]. PEG-lipids are additionally one of the key factors controlling particle size: increasing the ratio of a PEG-lipid in LNP formulations has been hypothesized to increase compression in the lipid bilayer and enhance repulsive forces between particles, [164] consequently generating smaller particles as PEG-lipid ratio increases [ 165 , 166 ]. PEG-lipids further aid in the aqueous solubility of LNP systems and provide a 'stealth' effect to particles in vivo , through shielding the LNP surface to limit the adsorption of serum proteins, ensuring protection against mononuclear phagocyte systemic uptake and thus contributing to increased circulation time [ 162 ]. Generally, higher PEG density on the surface of lipid delivery systems generates better steric barriers through the formation of brush-like conformations; around 2% PEGylation of liposomes was found to be optimal to limit serum protein binding to the liposome surface on incubation with serum for 10 min [ 167 ].

                    "text": "In addition to PEG length, the detachment kinetics provide a means to regulate the composition of the adsorbed corona.In numerous cases, the carbon anchor length dictates the PEG detachment, as exemplified in LNPs.When comparing a series of alkyl chain lengths (18, 16, 14) in PEGylated lipids, an inversely proportional desorption rate (0.2, 1.3, 45% h \u22121 ) to the chain length was observed. [21]This trend is potentially translatable to other systems, although specific rates are applicable only to the evaluated carrier and for specific PEG lengths.Furthermore, the significance of conformational alterations in NPs upon protein adsorption should not be underestimated, [22][23][24] as these changes could generate a modified NP during circulation, thereby influencing anticipated effects by altering intracellular trafficking.\n\nUltimate limitations inherent to active targeting pertain to the impact of an anchored targeting motif on PEGylated NPs, including its potential to alter the protein corona or the possibility for the ligand to be buried beneath the layer of adsorbed proteins.This discouraging outcome has been observed with transferrintargeted PEG-silica NPs by Dawson and colleagues. [25]Chan and colleagues have proposed an alternative approach to ensure the active ligand exposure by introducing shorter PEG additionally to the longer, ligand-carrying PEG chains. [26]Although there is an increasing interest in how active targeting approaches are hindered by protein corona formation, most studies focus on in vitro formation and target recognition.Considering the critical importance of the biological identity of NPs in vivo, improved understanding thereof is necessary. [27]here is a substantial lack of attempts to correlate the in vivo protein corona profile to the actual biodistribution of administered NPs, a matter of utmost importance that needs to be addressed to improve translational advances of delivery systems.Improved methodology regarding the recollection of coronacoated NPs might solve one of the intricacies contributing to this knowledge gap.\n\nIn addition to the problems highlighted above, from the experimental point of view, the results reported about protein corona should be cautiously interpreted, considering that the PEG-protein corona formation is highly dependent on study conditions.

L\u00f3pez-Est\u00e9vez, Philipp Lapuhs, Laura Pineiro-Alonso, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Alonso\n## Abstract\nThe success of personalized medicine in oncology relies on using highly effective and precise therapeutic modalities such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Unfortunately, the clinical exploitation of these biological drugs has encountered obstacles in overcoming intricate biological barriers. Drug delivery technologies represent a plausible strategy to overcome such barriers, ultimately facilitating the access to intracellular domains. Here, an overview of the current landscape on how nanotechnology has dealt with protein corona phenomena as a first and determinant biological barrier is presented. This continues with the analysis of strategies facilitating access to the tumor, along with conceivable methods for enhanced tumor penetration. As a final step, the cellular barriers that nanocarriers must confront in order for their biological cargo to reach their target are deeply analyzed. This review concludes with a critical analysis and future perspectives of the translational advances in personalized oncological nanomedicine.\n## PEGylation as a Strategy to Reduce Protein Attachment\nIn recent years, there has been significant advancement in comprehending the corona-mediated in vivo fate and its correlation with NP composition.However, the strategies to manipulate the protein corona remain limited, with PEGylation being the main strategy to extend blood circulation time as evidenced the number of marketed PEGylated NPs. [17,18]This scenario is also in agreement with the good regulatory profile of PEG.\n\nNumerous studies have attempted to delineate the optimal composition and configuration of PEGylated surfaces for minimizing protein corona formation.Among the factors influencing protein adsorption, PEG length and its density, as well as conformation on the surface of NPs have been recognized for decades.More recently, the PEG desorption kinetics and the presence of an active targeting motif have been analyzed as key determinants of protein corona formation.These factors cannot be viewed independently from the described carrier system, making definitive conclusions challenging.However, general trends can be discerned.In spite of the incapacity to agree on the ideal PEG density as particle size and outer shell composition, among others, also play into the equation, high PEG densities have been linked to reduced protein adsorption. [18,19]Nevertheless, this observation requires careful consideration since the units employed to describe these technologies hinder direct comparisons.For instance, a PEG 2k density of 10 lipid mol% was found to reduce the ApoE adsorption in lipid-nanoparticles (LNPs). [19]Similar conclusions have been drawn for PEG-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) self-assemblies, with densities of 0.45 PEG 5k chains nm \u22122 leading to reduced adsorption of ApoE. [18]Similar trends regarding increased PEG density resulting in decreased protein adsorption were observed for inorganic NPs. [20]Although PEG density holds greater importance than its length, a threshold of between 2 and 5 kDa has been established for optimal stealth properties.However, this conclusion has been based on specific types of PEGylated materials and nanocarriers and, therefore, cannot be extrapolated in a generic form.\n\nIn addition to PEG length, the detachment kinetics provide a means to regulate the composition of the adsorbed corona.\n...\nIn addition to PEG length, the detachment kinetics provide a means to regulate the composition of the adsorbed corona.In numerous cases, the carbon anchor length dictates the PEG detachment, as exemplified in LNPs.When comparing a series of alkyl chain lengths (18, 16, 14) in PEGylated lipids, an inversely proportional desorption rate (0.2, 1.3, 45% h \u22121 ) to the chain length was observed. [21]This trend is potentially translatable to other systems, although specific rates are applicable only to the evaluated carrier and for specific PEG lengths.Furthermore, the significance of conformational alterations in NPs upon protein adsorption should not be underestimated, [22][23][24] as these changes could generate a modified NP during circulation, thereby influencing anticipated effects by altering intracellular trafficking.\n\nUltimate limitations inherent to active targeting pertain to the impact of an anchored targeting motif on PEGylated NPs, including its potential to alter the protein corona or the possibility for the ligand to be buried beneath the layer of adsorbed proteins.This discouraging outcome has been observed with transferrintargeted PEG-silica NPs by Dawson and colleagues. [25]Chan and colleagues have proposed an alternative approach to ensure the active ligand exposure by introducing shorter PEG additionally to the longer, ligand-carrying PEG chains. [26]Although there is an increasing interest in how active targeting approaches are hindered by protein corona formation, most studies focus on in vitro formation and target recognition.Considering the critical importance of the biological identity of NPs in vivo, improved understanding thereof is necessary. [27]here is a substantial lack of attempts to correlate the in vivo protein corona profile to the actual biodistribution of administered NPs, a matter of utmost importance that needs to be addressed to improve translational advances of delivery systems.Improved methodology regarding the recollection of coronacoated NPs might solve one of the intricacies contributing to this knowledge gap.\n\nIn addition to the problems highlighted above, from the experimental point of view, the results reported about protein corona should be cautiously interpreted, considering that the PEG-protein corona formation is highly dependent on study conditions.

                    "text": "Pegylation of LNP surface via polyethylene glycol (PEG) plays a pivotal role in improving LNP stability and facilitating readily tissue penetration and targeting.Pegylation strategy has been widely used in many drug modalities and delivery systems.Since PEG is an amphiphilic lipid that can interact with both the hydrophobic core of the LNPs and the hydrophilic environment of physiological conditions or storage buffers, it plays a crucial role in regulating the clearance and half-life of LNPs, as well as on-shelf stability.Typically, the half-life of LNPs depends on the length of PEG lipid.The longer the PEG length, the less easily nonspecific interaction with serum components in the bloodstream.Nonetheless, it also inhibits fusion between LNP and endosome membrane, widely known as the \"PEG dilemma\" in LNP drug delivery [64].The lipid structure of pegylation also has a significant effect on LNP function.[35], while PEG lipids with longer C18 alkyl chain were more capable of longer circulation [65].In a nonviral gene therapy to treat traumatic brain injury, DMG-PEG 2000 and DSPE-PEG 2000 were compared.They formulated siRNA and mRNA LNPs with various ratios of DMG-PEG 2000 and DSPE-PEG 2000 and discovered that the increase in the proportion of DSPE-PEG 2000 led to longer blood circulation with enhanced gene expression in the injured brain hemisphere [66].\n\nBesides optimizing the choice of the hydrophobic domain of PEG lipids, regulating the affinity (or shedding rate) of PEG lipids is another trending strategy.The presence of PEG on the surface of nanoparticles may hinder cell uptake of nanoparticles.PEG lipids on LNPs are expected to shed from LNP in a controlled way after administrations, thus inducing cellular internalizations at the target site and also maintaining high serum stability.Suzuki et al. [67] revealed the influence of PEG shedding rate on the blood clearance of PEGylated LNPs.",

[69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

The tremendous success of mRNA vaccines in effectively combatting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) evidences the unlimited medical and therapeutic potential of mRNA technology. Overcoming challenges related to mRNA stability, immunogenicity, and precision targeting has been made possible by recent advancements in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). This review summarizes state-of-the-art LNP-mRNA-based therapeutics, including their structure, material compositions, design guidelines, and screening principles. Additionally, we highlight current preclinical and clinical trends in LNP-mRNA therapeutics in a broad range of treatments in ophthalmological conditions, cancer immunotherapy, gene editing, and rare-disease medicine. Particular attention is given to the translation and evolution of LNP-mRNA vaccines into a broader spectrum of therapeutics. We explore concerns in the aspects of inadequate extrahepatic targeting efficacy, elevated doses, safety concerns, and challenges of large-scale production procedures. This discussion may offer insights and perspectives on near- and long-term clinical development prospects for LNP-mRNA therapeutics.\n## PEGylated lipid-Modulating serum protein adsorption for tissue targeting\nPegylation of LNP surface via polyethylene glycol (PEG) plays a pivotal role in improving LNP stability and facilitating readily tissue penetration and targeting.Pegylation strategy has been widely used in many drug modalities and delivery systems.Since PEG is an amphiphilic lipid that can interact with both the hydrophobic core of the LNPs and the hydrophilic environment of physiological conditions or storage buffers, it plays a crucial role in regulating the clearance and half-life of LNPs, as well as on-shelf stability.Typically, the half-life of LNPs depends on the length of PEG lipid.The longer the PEG length, the less easily nonspecific interaction with serum components in the bloodstream.Nonetheless, it also inhibits fusion between LNP and endosome membrane, widely known as the \"PEG dilemma\" in LNP drug delivery [64].The lipid structure of pegylation also has a significant effect on LNP function.[35], while PEG lipids with longer C18 alkyl chain were more capable of longer circulation [65].In a nonviral gene therapy to treat traumatic brain injury, DMG-PEG 2000 and DSPE-PEG 2000 were compared.They formulated siRNA and mRNA LNPs with various ratios of DMG-PEG 2000 and DSPE-PEG 2000 and discovered that the increase in the proportion of DSPE-PEG 2000 led to longer blood circulation with enhanced gene expression in the injured brain hemisphere [66].\n\nBesides optimizing the choice of the hydrophobic domain of PEG lipids, regulating the affinity (or shedding rate) of PEG lipids is another trending strategy.The presence of PEG on the surface of nanoparticles may hinder cell uptake of nanoparticles.PEG lipids on LNPs are expected to shed from LNP in a controlled way after administrations, thus inducing cellular internalizations at the target site and also maintaining high serum stability.Suzuki et al. [67] revealed the influence of PEG shedding rate on the blood clearance of PEGylated LNPs.\n...\nThe study highlighted that pH-responsive PEG lipids facilitated improved active targeting and gene silencing efficacy in hepatocytes.Furthermore, the PEG content significantly affects targeting of extrahepatic tissues.For instance, Zhang et al. [69] engineered aerosolized LNPs for pulmonary delivery of mRNA.They optimized PEGylation parameters to achieve efficient mRNA delivery to the lungs.They found that increasing the PEG ratio in the LNP formulation not only reduced the size of LNPs but also decreased intracellular protein expression of mRNA.Therefore, precise consideration of the extent of PEG-anchored lipids is crucial when designing LNP-mRNA for lung therapeutics.This approach represents a significant advancement in developing noninvasive respiratory therapies with potential applications in treating various pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe protein corona phenomenon, mainly influenced by the surface properties of LNPs, has become popular among researchers in the field of nanosized drug delivery systems.After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona.This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition.Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs.Parallelly, the compositions of the corona proteins can govern the distributions of the nanoparticles due to the organ-specific accumulations of the serum proteins, such as ApoE for the liver and complementary system-related proteins for the spleen.\n\nIn a recent study, Chen et al. [70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.\n...\nFor instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.In the aspect of transfection performance, nanoparticles with apolipoproteinrich corona showed better delivery to hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) as compared to those with vitronectin-rich corona.LNPs formulated with PEG-conjugated C18 lipids (either 3% or 6% molar ratio) were proved to be optimal for in vivo delivery to HepG2 tumor.The study revealed that the composition of the protein corona influenced the biodistribution and targeting efficiency of LNPs, highlighting the complex interplay between nanoparticle surface properties, including surface-coating PEG, protein interactions, and in vivo performance.\n\nIn conclusion, PEGylated lipids play multiple roles in enhancing the performance of LNPs as drug delivery systems for therapeutic mRNA.Through studies that examined PEG shedding rates, protein corona formation, and pH-labile PEGylation, researchers have gained valuable insights into optimizing the effectiveness of LNPs by manipulating surface PEG.These advancements in PEGylation strategies hold promise for the design of precise and efficient delivery systems for therapeutic nucleic acid, especially mRNA.\n\n## Emerging technologies boosting the tissue targeting efficacy\nIn the case of LNPs, PEG length and alkyl chain affect both surface chemistry and PEG shedding rate [67], thereby influencing the surface coronation and targeting tissues.Pegylation plays a crucial role in determining the in vivo destination of LNPs and their payloads, suggesting its significance for LNP-mRNA therapeutic applications.Despite all the strides made, the underlying mechanisms and relationships between tissue targeting properties of LNP and protein corona formation remain elusive.Certain occurrences, such as the alteration of corona formation, have resulted in changes in tissue accumulation, yet a proper explanation is lacking [70].\n\nPrevious attempts illustrated that specific protein may serve as the nutrition or major supplement for the organs or the cells.There is also an explanation related to the receptor-mediated recognition, for which the most commonly acknowledged one is LDLR-corona protein-ApoE assisted liver targeting of LNP.However, various LDL receptors were identified other than ApoE, such as ApoA1.Basic knowledge related to physiology and pharmacodynamics remains to be explored.Therefore, while we appreciate the creativity of the concept of corona, it currently serves no more than a hypothesis in a long journey to promote LNP-mRNA into clinical stage.The lack of a liable detection technique also hinders the understanding of the protein corona phenomenon and stalls its development.Enabling in situ analysis of protein corona formation is crucial since current post-analysis via centrifugation separation and mass spectrometry is insufficient to unveil the authentic situation of protein adsorption around LNPs in the blood circulation.In a recent work, Zhan and colleagues [97] optimized the extraction of the corona in incubating serum by applying chromatography containing PEG-scFv (single-chain variable fragment).This facilitated the separation of pegylated nanoparticles and proteins while minimizing the depletion of protein corona components.Last but not least, predicting the in vivo performance of the corona protein formation around LNP, especially the stereochemistry and conformation of the absorbed proteins, which are essential to the cell-specific internalizations and successful translation of actively targeted LNP-mRNA, remains challenging.",

Since the PEG-lipid is incorporated into the LNP membrane through the hydrophobic tail (the alkyl/acyl chains), PEGlipids with longer tails are less likely to dissociate from the LNP. Studies have reported this correlation between desorption rate and lipid tail length both in vitro [49,65] and in vivo [51]. Mui et al. [51] showed that PEG-lipid desorption from LNPs in circulation, measured one hour after in vivo administration, was 45% for PEG-lipids with C14 dialkyl chains (the length of the alkyl/acyl groups is reported as CX, where X is the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl/acyl chain) and only 1.3% and 0.2% for PEG-lipids with C16 and C18 dialkyl chains, respectively. Studies have generally found that longer alkyl chains improve LNP stability in biological fluids. That said, even short C12 and C14 dialkyl/diacyl chains provide sufficient stability during LNP self-assembly [49,51]. However, in the presence of a lipid sink (e.g. plasma), which contains endogenous lipid-based particles including lipoproteins and extracellular vesicles plus high levels of albumin with its many hydrophobic pockets [66], the short-alkyl-chained PEG-lipids are prone to dissociating into the endogenous lipid-associating entities. In addition to biological lipid-based nanoparticles in blood, cell membranes can also function as a lipid sink.\n\n3.2.1.1. PEG-lipids mediate indirect targeting capabilities of LNPs. In addition to impacting structural properties such as size and stability, different PEG-lipid molar ratios and compositions greatly influence in vivo distribution and degree of cellular interaction, thereby controlling the ability of LNPs and LNP-like particles",

These data lead one to question whether PEG-lipid desorption (when using 1.5 mol% PEGlipid) is essential for apoE adsorption to LNPs.\n\nIn addition to the indirect active targeting properties obtained via the association between apoE and LNPs in blood, more passive targeting could be attained by preserving the steric barrier of the LNP in vivo. A PEG-lipid like the PEG-DSPE (C18) (Fig. 3B) used in Doxil \u00d2 inhibits rapid desorption and thus limits protein binding and clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic system, thereby prolonging circulation time of the PEGylated nanocarrier. Approaches [72-74] using a persistent PEG-lipid to improve LNP accumulation elsewhere employ a formulation with compromised activity and therefore require higher doses to achieve silencing at the target tissue. A slow PEG desorption rate will also minimize specific uptake in the liver and further increase circulation time, enhancing LNP accumulation in tumor tissues [51].\n\nTaken together, the research detailed above shows that the choice of PEG-lipid greatly influences key LNP properties such as size, stability, in vivo distribution, and transfection efficiency. PEG-lipids stabilize LNPs during preparation and storage by providing a steric barrier that both drives self-assembly and prevents aggregation. Further, the type of PEG-lipid partly controls LNP circulation time and cellular interactions. Which PEG-lipid to choose highly depends on therapeutic purpose, target organ and/or cell type, and administration route, and should include considerations regarding both molar ratios and length of the akyl/acyl chain(s) constituting the lipid tail, as these parameters have all shown to influence key properties of LNPs.\n\n3.2.1.2.

While PEG-DSPE ensures long circulation [49], PEG-c-DMG tends to desorb from the LNPs upon i.v. administration, to exploit an already established route for specific cellular uptake in the liver. Blood contains significant apoE, especially on LDLs and remanent chylomicrons which are taken up in the liver via the LDLR. PEG-lipids with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs [6,51,63], allowing the particles to adsorb apoE [34]. This allows LNPs to endogenously target hepatocytes in the liver, as exploited in Onpattro \u00d2 [34] (Fig. 3C). That said, other plasma components, in addition to apoE, could potentially also facilitate uptake of LNPs in hepatocytes or any other cell type.\n\nAs discussed above, PEG desorption rate can be controlled by formulating LNPs using PEG-lipids with different acyl chain lengths [24,49,51]. Relatedly, Mui et al. [51] showed that increasing the molar ratio of the PEG-lipid from 1.5 to 2.5 mol% compromised transfection efficiency in hepatocytes when the PEG chain was attached to a C18 lipid tail but not a C14 lipid tail. This indicates that only a C14 lipid tail facilitates PEG-lipid desorption followed by association with apoE, thereby promoting receptor-mediated uptake in the liver, and that the molar ratio of the PEG-lipid therefore has no impact on transfection efficiency as most PEG-lipids desorb rapidly following administration. Mui et al. [51] also showed that for 1.5 mol% PEG-lipids, the in vivo transfection level was almost independent of the carbon length of the PEG-lipids. Hence, the expected longer circulation time of LNPs coated with C18 compared to C14 PEG-lipids do not change final transfection efficacy and/or apoE adsorption levels.

Kulkarni, D. Witzigmann, Marianne Lind, K. Petersson, J. Simonsen\n## Abstract\nNone\n## PEG-lipids control LNP size and stability\neffect of concurrently modifying cholesterol ratios by up to 2 mol%, as in studies focused on changing the molar ratio of PEG, is presumably negligible.\n\nThe lipid tail structure in PEG-lipids also influences LNPs biological activity. Since the PEG-lipid is incorporated into the LNP membrane through the hydrophobic tail (the alkyl/acyl chains), PEGlipids with longer tails are less likely to dissociate from the LNP. Studies have reported this correlation between desorption rate and lipid tail length both in vitro [49,65] and in vivo [51]. Mui et al. [51] showed that PEG-lipid desorption from LNPs in circulation, measured one hour after in vivo administration, was 45% for PEG-lipids with C14 dialkyl chains (the length of the alkyl/acyl groups is reported as CX, where X is the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl/acyl chain) and only 1.3% and 0.2% for PEG-lipids with C16 and C18 dialkyl chains, respectively. Studies have generally found that longer alkyl chains improve LNP stability in biological fluids. That said, even short C12 and C14 dialkyl/diacyl chains provide sufficient stability during LNP self-assembly [49,51]. However, in the presence of a lipid sink (e.g. plasma), which contains endogenous lipid-based particles including lipoproteins and extracellular vesicles plus high levels of albumin with its many hydrophobic pockets [66], the short-alkyl-chained PEG-lipids are prone to dissociating into the endogenous lipid-associating entities. In addition to biological lipid-based nanoparticles in blood, cell membranes can also function as a lipid sink.\n\n3.2.1.1. PEG-lipids mediate indirect targeting capabilities of LNPs. In addition to impacting structural properties such as size and stability, different PEG-lipid molar ratios and compositions greatly influence in vivo distribution and degree of cellular interaction, thereby controlling the ability of LNPs and LNP-like particles\n...\n-DSPE is facilitating. While PEG-DSPE ensures long circulation [49], PEG-c-DMG tends to desorb from the LNPs upon i.v. administration, to exploit an already established route for specific cellular uptake in the liver. Blood contains significant apoE, especially on LDLs and remanent chylomicrons which are taken up in the liver via the LDLR. PEG-lipids with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs [6,51,63], allowing the particles to adsorb apoE [34]. This allows LNPs to endogenously target hepatocytes in the liver, as exploited in Onpattro \u00d2 [34] (Fig. 3C). That said, other plasma components, in addition to apoE, could potentially also facilitate uptake of LNPs in hepatocytes or any other cell type.\n\nAs discussed above, PEG desorption rate can be controlled by formulating LNPs using PEG-lipids with different acyl chain lengths [24,49,51]. Relatedly, Mui et al. [51] showed that increasing the molar ratio of the PEG-lipid from 1.5 to 2.5 mol% compromised transfection efficiency in hepatocytes when the PEG chain was attached to a C18 lipid tail but not a C14 lipid tail. This indicates that only a C14 lipid tail facilitates PEG-lipid desorption followed by association with apoE, thereby promoting receptor-mediated uptake in the liver, and that the molar ratio of the PEG-lipid therefore has no impact on transfection efficiency as most PEG-lipids desorb rapidly following administration. Mui et al. [51] also showed that for 1.5 mol% PEG-lipids, the in vivo transfection level was almost independent of the carbon length of the PEG-lipids. Hence, the expected longer circulation time of LNPs coated with C18 compared to C14 PEG-lipids do not change final transfection efficacy and/or apoE adsorption levels. These data lead one to question whether PEG-lipid desorption (when using 1.5 mol% PEG\n...\n, the expected longer circulation time of LNPs coated with C18 compared to C14 PEG-lipids do not change final transfection efficacy and/or apoE adsorption levels. These data lead one to question whether PEG-lipid desorption (when using 1.5 mol% PEGlipid) is essential for apoE adsorption to LNPs.\n\nIn addition to the indirect active targeting properties obtained via the association between apoE and LNPs in blood, more passive targeting could be attained by preserving the steric barrier of the LNP in vivo. A PEG-lipid like the PEG-DSPE (C18) (Fig. 3B) used in Doxil \u00d2 inhibits rapid desorption and thus limits protein binding and clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic system, thereby prolonging circulation time of the PEGylated nanocarrier. Approaches [72-74] using a persistent PEG-lipid to improve LNP accumulation elsewhere employ a formulation with compromised activity and therefore require higher doses to achieve silencing at the target tissue. A slow PEG desorption rate will also minimize specific uptake in the liver and further increase circulation time, enhancing LNP accumulation in tumor tissues [51].\n\nTaken together, the research detailed above shows that the choice of PEG-lipid greatly influences key LNP properties such as size, stability, in vivo distribution, and transfection efficiency. PEG-lipids stabilize LNPs during preparation and storage by providing a steric barrier that both drives self-assembly and prevents aggregation. Further, the type of PEG-lipid partly controls LNP circulation time and cellular interactions. Which PEG-lipid to choose highly depends on therapeutic purpose, target organ and/or cell type, and administration route, and should include considerations regarding both molar ratios and length of the akyl/acyl chain(s) constituting the lipid tail, as these parameters have all shown to influence key properties of LNPs.\n\n3.2.1.2. Do PEG-lipids stimulate an immune response?. Grafting PEG to long chained lipids onto liposomes grants them stealth-like properties that prolong their half-life in circulation.

This success has motivated research to identify ways to further advance this delivery platform. Here, we characterize the polyethylene glycol lipid (PEG-lipid) components, which are required to control the self-assembly process during formation of lipid particles, but can negatively affect delivery to hepatocytes and hepatic gene silencing in vivo. The rate of transfer from LNPs to plasma lipoproteins in vivo is measured for three PEG-lipids with dialkyl chains 14, 16, and 18 carbons long. We show that 1.5\u2009mol % PEG-lipid represents a threshold concentration at which the chain length exerts a minimal effect on hepatic gene silencing but can still modify LNPs pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Increasing the concentration to 2.5 and 3.5\u2009mol % substantially compromises hepatocyte gene knockdown for PEG-lipids with distearyl (C18) chains but has little impact for shorter dimyristyl (C14) chains. These data are discussed with respect to RNA delivery and the different rates at which the steric barrier disassociates from LNPs in vivo.",

                    "text": "The most common PEG-lipids employed in the current generation of siRNA LNPs contain two saturated, dimyristyl chains (PEG-C14). 7 We have shown in vitro that PEG-C14 transfers from LNPs to lipoproteins at a rate of ~50%/hour in mouse plasma at an LNP-to-plasma ratio equivalent to administering LNPs in vivo at a total lipid dose of 20 mg/kg, which is sevenfold higher than the dose employed here (manuscript in preparation). In vivo, a gradual increase in the 3 H/ 14 C ratio measured in whole blood and plasma occurs over the first hour indicating that 14 C-MC3-labeled LNPs are leaving the circulation faster (80% cleared in the first hour, Figure 3a), than 3 H-PEG-C14. These data are consistent with 3 H-PEG-C14 transferring to lipoproteins, which remain in circulation longer than LNPs, resulting in an increase in 3 H/ 14 C ratio. Specific loss of 3 H-PEG-lipid from LNPs becomes more apparent when plasma, isolated from blood drawn at each time point, is separated from lipoproteins by size exclusion chromatography enabling the 3 H/ 14 C ratio of the recovered LNPs to be measured directly (Figure 3a). The ratio decreases rapidly, with ~80% of the initial 3 H-PEG-C14 leaving LNPs within 2 hours. \n\nThe hydrophobic interactions responsible for associating PEG-lipids with LNP membranes are proportional to their alkyl chain length. 14,15 Therefore, PEG-C16 and PEG-C18 lipids should remain associated with LNPs in vivo longer than PEG-C14, as more energy is required for the longer chains to leave the membrane. Analysis of LNPs containing these lipids confirms this, with desorption estimated at 45, 1.3, and 0.2%/hour for C14, C16, and C18 PEG-lipids, respectively (Figure 3b).",

Hope\n## Abstract\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating short interfering RNAs that target hepatic genes are advancing through clinical trials, and early results indicate the excellent gene silencing observed in rodents and nonhuman primates also translates to humans. This success has motivated research to identify ways to further advance this delivery platform. Here, we characterize the polyethylene glycol lipid (PEG-lipid) components, which are required to control the self-assembly process during formation of lipid particles, but can negatively affect delivery to hepatocytes and hepatic gene silencing in vivo. The rate of transfer from LNPs to plasma lipoproteins in vivo is measured for three PEG-lipids with dialkyl chains 14, 16, and 18 carbons long. We show that 1.5\u2009mol % PEG-lipid represents a threshold concentration at which the chain length exerts a minimal effect on hepatic gene silencing but can still modify LNPs pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Increasing the concentration to 2.5 and 3.5\u2009mol % substantially compromises hepatocyte gene knockdown for PEG-lipids with distearyl (C18) chains but has little impact for shorter dimyristyl (C14) chains. These data are discussed with respect to RNA delivery and the different rates at which the steric barrier disassociates from LNPs in vivo.\n## Desorption of PEG-lipids with different chain lengths from LNPs in vivo\nThe most common PEG-lipids employed in the current generation of siRNA LNPs contain two saturated, dimyristyl chains (PEG-C14). 7 We have shown in vitro that PEG-C14 transfers from LNPs to lipoproteins at a rate of ~50%/hour in mouse plasma at an LNP-to-plasma ratio equivalent to administering LNPs in vivo at a total lipid dose of 20 mg/kg, which is sevenfold higher than the dose employed here (manuscript in preparation). In vivo, a gradual increase in the 3 H/ 14 C ratio measured in whole blood and plasma occurs over the first hour indicating that 14 C-MC3-labeled LNPs are leaving the circulation faster (80% cleared in the first hour, Figure 3a), than 3 H-PEG-C14. These data are consistent with 3 H-PEG-C14 transferring to lipoproteins, which remain in circulation longer than LNPs, resulting in an increase in 3 H/ 14 C ratio. Specific loss of 3 H-PEG-lipid from LNPs becomes more apparent when plasma, isolated from blood drawn at each time point, is separated from lipoproteins by size exclusion chromatography enabling the 3 H/ 14 C ratio of the recovered LNPs to be measured directly (Figure 3a). The ratio decreases rapidly, with ~80% of the initial 3 H-PEG-C14 leaving LNPs within 2 hours. \n\nThe hydrophobic interactions responsible for associating PEG-lipids with LNP membranes are proportional to their alkyl chain length. 14,15 Therefore, PEG-C16 and PEG-C18 lipids should remain associated with LNPs in vivo longer than PEG-C14, as more energy is required for the longer chains to leave the membrane. Analysis of LNPs containing these lipids confirms this, with desorption estimated at 45, 1.3, and 0.2%/hour for C14, C16, and C18 PEG-lipids, respectively (Figure 3b).\n\n## Discussion\nLipids that achieve this transition state can rapidly diffuse through the aqueous space down a concentration gradient to acceptor sites such as other membranes and lipoproteins. The large energy barrier associated with entering the activated state is why the majority of membrane phospholipids, which have two acyl chain lengths >16 carbons, form stable bilayers and exhibit extremely low rates of transfer, with typical half-times of hundreds of hours in the absence protein facilitators. 20 The rate of lipid desorption, however, increases exponentially with decreasing chain length and is further enhanced by large hydrophilic headgroups, such as PEG, that contribute to lower the energy required to adopt transition-state complexes. 13,19 y isolating plasma at various time intervals after injection and separating LNPs from lipoproteins, we determined the rate of loss for each PEG-lipid from LNPs in vivo to be >45%/hour, 1.3%/hour, and 0.2%/hour for C14, C16, and C18, respectively.

However, efficient delivery of these vaccines requires that the mRNA be protected against extracellular degradation.

Then, utilization of specific PEG lipids that possess short acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may be advantageous to achieving high transfection efficiency because of their ability to gradually diffuse out of the LNPs, leading to the formation of destabilized LNPs that consequently release their nucleic acid contents [91,95]. \n\nThe formation of a bimolecular corona complex may change the surface properties of LNPs, and these changes can be adopted to enhance and/or target delivery of the loaded content [90,96]. It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity [90]. LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination [97]. PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system [94]. However, accelerated removal of PEGylated nanoparticles and stronger activation of complement interactions can be encountered upon infusion of these PEGylated nanoparticles in patients having anti-PEG antibodies [94,98].",

Almurshedi\n## Abstract\nThere has been increased interest in the development of RNA-based vaccines for protection against various infectious diseases and also for cancer immunotherapies. Rapid and cost-effective manufacturing methods in addition to potent immune responses observed in preclinical and clinical studies have made mRNA-based vaccines promising alternatives to conventional vaccine technologies. However, efficient delivery of these vaccines requires that the mRNA be protected against extracellular degradation. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been extensively studied as non-viral vectors for the delivery of mRNA to target cells because of their relatively easy and scalable manufacturing processes. This review highlights key advances in the development of LNPs and reviews the application of mRNA-based vaccines formulated in LNPs for use against infectious diseases and cancer.\n## PEG-Lipids\nPEGylated lipids, or PEG-lipids, represent important components that are usually located on the surface of the LNPs. PEG-lipids consist of a hydrophilic molecule of PEG conjugated to a hydrophobic alkyl (or lipid) chain, where the PEG domain is attached to the LNP surface while the alkyl chain is attached to the LNP bilayer. The incorporation of PEGylated lipids in LNPs is known to extend the circulation time of LNPs due to their steric barrier effect. This property reduces binding of LNPs to plasma proteins (opsonins), reduces rapid elimination by the reticuloendothelial system, and consequently, assists in the accumulation of the nanoparticles at disease sites [25,49]. In addition, the steric barrier properties of PEGylated lipids may prevent fusion or aggregation of nanoparticles during manufacturing, and this would result in a homogenous formulation with a small particle size (50-100 nm) and narrow polydispersity index [25]. \n\nThe amount of PEGylated lipids incorporated in LNPs should be controlled carefully and kept to a minimum. Having higher PEG contents usually increases the residence time of LNPs in the blood circulation but may prevent their fusion with the endosomal bilayer and hinder the intracellular delivery of nucleic acids [68,69]. Therefore, a reduction in PEG content from 10% to about 1.5% (along with increasing the ionizable lipids to 57%) produced a marked improvement in the potency of mRNA-based LNPs as reported by Semple et al. [64]. Moreover, monitoring the size of PEG-lipids attached to the LNPs can be used to control the rate at which the PEG-lipids diffuse away from the nanoparticles and affect the residence time in blood circulation. Larger lipid anchors are usually used in formulating liposomes that circulate for longer duration in the blood to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs [70]. On the other hand, smaller lipid anchors are used in developing LNPs that favor shorter residence times to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes [71].\n\n## Colloidal Stability of Formulations\nConventional PEG lipids, such as distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG2000, are known to remain firmly linked to LNPs and prohibit the release of the nucleic acid. Then, utilization of specific PEG lipids that possess short acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may be advantageous to achieving high transfection efficiency because of their ability to gradually diffuse out of the LNPs, leading to the formation of destabilized LNPs that consequently release their nucleic acid contents [91,95]. \n\nThe formation of a bimolecular corona complex may change the surface properties of LNPs, and these changes can be adopted to enhance and/or target delivery of the loaded content [90,96]. It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity [90]. LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination [97]. PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system [94]. However, accelerated removal of PEGylated nanoparticles and stronger activation of complement interactions can be encountered upon infusion of these PEGylated nanoparticles in patients having anti-PEG antibodies [94,98].",

The recent success of mRNA vaccines for combating the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the medical value of RNA drugs. However, one of the major challenges in realizing the full potential of RNA drugs is to deliver RNA into specific organs and tissues in a targeted manner, which is crucial for achieving therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects, and enhancing overall treatment efficacy. Numerous attempts have been made to pursue targeting, nonetheless, the lack of clear guideline and commonality elucidation has hindered the clinical translation of RNA drugs. In this review, we outline the mechanisms of action for targeted RNA delivery systems and summarize four key factors that influence the targeting delivery of RNA drugs. These factors include the category of vector materials, chemical structures of vectors, administration routes, and physicochemical properties of RNA vectors, and they all notably contribute to specific organ/tissue tropism. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the main RNA-based drugs that are currently in clinical trials, highlighting their design strategies and tissue tropism applications. This review will aid to understand the principles and mechanisms of targeted delivery systems, accelerating the development of future RNA drugs for different diseases.",

                    "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

The recent success of mRNA vaccines for combating the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the medical value of RNA drugs. However, one of the major challenges in realizing the full potential of RNA drugs is to deliver RNA into specific organs and tissues in a targeted manner, which is crucial for achieving therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects, and enhancing overall treatment efficacy. Numerous attempts have been made to pursue targeting, nonetheless, the lack of clear guideline and commonality elucidation has hindered the clinical translation of RNA drugs. In this review, we outline the mechanisms of action for targeted RNA delivery systems and summarize four key factors that influence the targeting delivery of RNA drugs. These factors include the category of vector materials, chemical structures of vectors, administration routes, and physicochemical properties of RNA vectors, and they all notably contribute to specific organ/tissue tropism. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the main RNA-based drugs that are currently in clinical trials, highlighting their design strategies and tissue tropism applications. This review will aid to understand the principles and mechanisms of targeted delivery systems, accelerating the development of future RNA drugs for different diseases.\n## Protein corona\nThe formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

This review addresses vector-free options for targeted delivery of LNPs, namely the influence of lipid composition of these nanoparticles on their biodistribution. In the review, experimental studies are examined that are focused on the biodistribution of mRNA or of the encoded protein after mRNA administration via LNPs in mammals.

The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

Ivanov, V. Reshetnikov\n## Abstract\nToday, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are some of the main delivery systems for mRNA-based therapeutics. The scope of LNP applications in terms of RNA is not limited to antiviral vaccines but encompasses anticancer drugs and therapeutics for genetic (including rare) diseases. Such widespread use implies high customizability of targeted delivery of LNPs to specific organs and tissues. This review addresses vector-free options for targeted delivery of LNPs, namely the influence of lipid composition of these nanoparticles on their biodistribution. In the review, experimental studies are examined that are focused on the biodistribution of mRNA or of the encoded protein after mRNA administration via LNPs in mammals. We also performed a comprehensive analysis of individual lipids\u2019 functional groups that ensure biodistribution to desired organs. These data will allow us to outline prospects for further optimization of lipid compositions of nanoparticles for targeted delivery of mRNA therapeutics.\n## Helper lipids\nFor classic fourcomponent LNPs, apparent pK a was 6.3-6.6 in the above study, depending on the ionizable cationic lipid used. The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

Specifically, they localize on the surface of lipid particles and maintain the spatial stability of the delivery system. Furthermore, the presence of PEG chains prevents LNP aggregation, serum protein adsorption, and uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system in vivo, thereby prolonging the circulating half-life of LNPs in the bloodstream [54,55]. Alternatively, extended circulation times lead to a higher number of nanoparticles interacting with the blood-brain barrier. Importantly, the size of LNPs must be carefully controlled during preparation, as it plays a pivotal role in determining their pharmacokinetics, delivery efficiency, and transfection efficacy. Studies have shown that increasing the molar ratio of PEG-lipids results in significantly smaller LNPs, independent of other lipid components [56,57]. These findings underscore the importance of optimizing the PEG-lipid ratio to achieve the desired size and functionality of LNPs. Moreover, beyond their influence on structural properties such as size and stability, variations in the molar ratio and composition of PEG-lipids also markedly affect the biodistribution and cellular interaction of LNPs, which are critical in determining the efficiency of cargo delivery to target cells [58]. PEGylated polymeric nanocarriers were developed by Nance and colleagues for the targeted delivery of the anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) to brain tissues. They demonstrated that PEGylation significantly enhanced the brain-targeting ability of the nanocarriers, improving PTX delivery to brain regions compared to uncoated polymeric nanocarriers [59]. Therefore, the careful optimization of these parameters is essential to create a balanced LNP structure that maximizes the therapeutic potential of PEGylated lipids. In conclusion, PEGylated lipids serve a crucial role in enhancing the stability, tissue penetration, and targeting efficiency of LNPs as drug delivery systems. These advancements in PEGylation strategies offer significant potential for developing precise and efficient delivery platforms.",

            "abstract": "RNA-based therapies have great potential to treat many undruggable human diseases. However, their efficacy, in particular for mRNA, remains hampered by poor cellular delivery and limited endosomal escape. Development and optimisation of delivery vectors, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), are impeded by limited screening methods to probe the intracellular processing of LNPs in sufficient detail. We have developed a high-throughput imaging-based endosomal escape assay utilising a Galectin-9 reporter and fluorescently labelled mRNA to probe correlations between nanoparticle-mediated uptake, endosomal escape frequency, and mRNA translation. Furthermore, this assay has been integrated within a screening platform for optimisation of lipid nanoparticle formulations. We show that Galectin-9 recruitment is a robust, quantitative reporter of endosomal escape events induced by different mRNA delivery nanoparticles and small molecules. We identify nanoparticles with superior escape properties and demonstrate cell line variances in endosomal escape response, highlighting the need for fine-tuning of delivery formulations for specific applications. Munson et al. develop a high-throughput Galectin-9 reporter based endosomal escape imaging assay to probe correlations between nanoparticle-mediated uptake, endosomal escape frequency, and mRNA translation. By screening various delivery systems, modulators and combinations of nanoparticle components, the authors demonstrate how nanomedicines can be optimized for superior escape properties and efficacy in specific applications.",

                    "text": "Finally, we examined differences in particles containing either DMG-PEG 2k or DMPE-PEG 2k . Whilst both contain a C14-acyl chain and PEG 2k , DMPE contains a phosphate group giving the overall molecule a negative charge compared to DMG that is neutral. Substitution to DMG-PEG 2k resulted in reduced uptake and slower kinetics, lower endosomal escape induction and ultimately impaired EGFP production across all particles surveyed (Fig. 6b, e). It has been shown that the half-life of DMPE-PEG on nanoparticle surfaces is shorter than DMG-PEG 13 and this may account for some of the changes observed. In addition, particle charge variance may also lead to differential interactions with serum proteins that are important for cellular uptake and/or endosomal escape 13 . Representative microscopy images demonstrating changes to key particle components on the uptake, GAL9 recruitment and EGFP translation are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9. \n\nAltogether, the screen presented in Fig. 6 illustrates that LNPs with similar physical properties such as size, PDI and encapsulation but formed from different lipids can demonstrate great variation in terms of how they are taken up by cells and are able to deliver mRNA. Integration of the mCherry-GAL9 reporter into a screening platform with multiple cellular read-outs have allowed us to probe in greater detail to which delivery step a certain lipid alteration can modulate LNP potency and highlights the benefits of utilising such a reporter system for deriving greater insights into nanoparticle function.",

Munson, Gwen O\u2019Driscoll, A. Silva, Elisa L\u00e1zaro-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, A. Gallud, John T. Wilson, A. Coll\u00e9n, E. K. Esbj\u00f6rner, A. Sabirsh\n## Abstract\nRNA-based therapies have great potential to treat many undruggable human diseases. However, their efficacy, in particular for mRNA, remains hampered by poor cellular delivery and limited endosomal escape. Development and optimisation of delivery vectors, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), are impeded by limited screening methods to probe the intracellular processing of LNPs in sufficient detail. We have developed a high-throughput imaging-based endosomal escape assay utilising a Galectin-9 reporter and fluorescently labelled mRNA to probe correlations between nanoparticle-mediated uptake, endosomal escape frequency, and mRNA translation. Furthermore, this assay has been integrated within a screening platform for optimisation of lipid nanoparticle formulations. We show that Galectin-9 recruitment is a robust, quantitative reporter of endosomal escape events induced by different mRNA delivery nanoparticles and small molecules. We identify nanoparticles with superior escape properties and demonstrate cell line variances in endosomal escape response, highlighting the need for fine-tuning of delivery formulations for specific applications. Munson et al. develop a high-throughput Galectin-9 reporter based endosomal escape imaging assay to probe correlations between nanoparticle-mediated uptake, endosomal escape frequency, and mRNA translation. By screening various delivery systems, modulators and combinations of nanoparticle components, the authors demonstrate how nanomedicines can be optimized for superior escape properties and efficacy in specific applications.\n## Results\nFinally, we examined differences in particles containing either DMG-PEG 2k or DMPE-PEG 2k . Whilst both contain a C14-acyl chain and PEG 2k , DMPE contains a phosphate group giving the overall molecule a negative charge compared to DMG that is neutral. Substitution to DMG-PEG 2k resulted in reduced uptake and slower kinetics, lower endosomal escape induction and ultimately impaired EGFP production across all particles surveyed (Fig. 6b, e). It has been shown that the half-life of DMPE-PEG on nanoparticle surfaces is shorter than DMG-PEG 13 and this may account for some of the changes observed. In addition, particle charge variance may also lead to differential interactions with serum proteins that are important for cellular uptake and/or endosomal escape 13 . Representative microscopy images demonstrating changes to key particle components on the uptake, GAL9 recruitment and EGFP translation are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9. \n\nAltogether, the screen presented in Fig. 6 illustrates that LNPs with similar physical properties such as size, PDI and encapsulation but formed from different lipids can demonstrate great variation in terms of how they are taken up by cells and are able to deliver mRNA. Integration of the mCherry-GAL9 reporter into a screening platform with multiple cellular read-outs have allowed us to probe in greater detail to which delivery step a certain lipid alteration can modulate LNP potency and highlights the benefits of utilising such a reporter system for deriving greater insights into nanoparticle function.",

            "text": "PEGylation of nanomaterials is a common strategy to provide them with steric stability, prevent opsonization and enhance their overall systemic circulation time [ 162 ]. The impact conferred by PEG-lipids on LNP circulation time is determined by the dissociation rate of the PEG-lipid from the surface of the LNP, which relates to the acyl chain length of the PEG-lipid: dissociation rate has been shown to decrease with chain length, with formulations comprised of longer chain PEG-lipids thus having a longer circulation time [ 163 ]. PEG-lipids are additionally one of the key factors controlling particle size: increasing the ratio of a PEG-lipid in LNP formulations has been hypothesized to increase compression in the lipid bilayer and enhance repulsive forces between particles, [164] consequently generating smaller particles as PEG-lipid ratio increases [ 165 , 166 ]. PEG-lipids further aid in the aqueous solubility of LNP systems and provide a 'stealth' effect to particles in vivo , through shielding the LNP surface to limit the adsorption of serum proteins, ensuring protection against mononuclear phagocyte systemic uptake and thus contributing to increased circulation time [ 162 ]. Generally, higher PEG density on the surface of lipid delivery systems generates better steric barriers through the formation of brush-like conformations; around 2% PEGylation of liposomes was found to be optimal to limit serum protein binding to the liposome surface on incubation with serum for 10 min [ 167 ]. Interestingly, though PEGylated lipids are generally incorporated at low molar ratios compared to other formulation components in mRNA-LNPs, Sago and colleagues reported mRNA-LNPs with 20% C14-PEG20 0 0 content mediated effective delivery of their cargo [ 168 ].\n\nHaving a hydrophilic layer around LNPs can, however, interfere with cellular uptake and limit endosome destabilization, consequently decreasing transfection potency [ 135 , 169 ]. In this sense, a more rapid dissociation of PEG-lipid from the LNP surface, though decreasing the circulation time of the particle, can increase its fusogenicity, allowing the LNP to more effectively deliver",

            "text": "In recent years, there has been significant advancement in comprehending the corona-mediated in vivo fate and its correlation with NP composition.However, the strategies to manipulate the protein corona remain limited, with PEGylation being the main strategy to extend blood circulation time as evidenced the number of marketed PEGylated NPs. [17,18]This scenario is also in agreement with the good regulatory profile of PEG.\n\nNumerous studies have attempted to delineate the optimal composition and configuration of PEGylated surfaces for minimizing protein corona formation.Among the factors influencing protein adsorption, PEG length and its density, as well as conformation on the surface of NPs have been recognized for decades.More recently, the PEG desorption kinetics and the presence of an active targeting motif have been analyzed as key determinants of protein corona formation.These factors cannot be viewed independently from the described carrier system, making definitive conclusions challenging.However, general trends can be discerned.In spite of the incapacity to agree on the ideal PEG density as particle size and outer shell composition, among others, also play into the equation, high PEG densities have been linked to reduced protein adsorption. [18,19]Nevertheless, this observation requires careful consideration since the units employed to describe these technologies hinder direct comparisons.For instance, a PEG 2k density of 10 lipid mol% was found to reduce the ApoE adsorption in lipid-nanoparticles (LNPs). [19]Similar conclusions have been drawn for PEG-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) self-assemblies, with densities of 0.45 PEG 5k chains nm \u22122 leading to reduced adsorption of ApoE. [18]Similar trends regarding increased PEG density resulting in decreased protein adsorption were observed for inorganic NPs. [20]Although PEG density holds greater importance than its length, a threshold of between 2 and 5 kDa has been established for optimal stealth properties.However, this conclusion has been based on specific types of PEGylated materials and nanocarriers and, therefore, cannot be extrapolated in a generic form.\n\nIn addition to PEG length, the detachment kinetics provide a means to regulate the composition of the adsorbed corona.",

[21]This trend is potentially translatable to other systems, although specific rates are applicable only to the evaluated carrier and for specific PEG lengths.Furthermore, the significance of conformational alterations in NPs upon protein adsorption should not be underestimated, [22][23][24] as these changes could generate a modified NP during circulation, thereby influencing anticipated effects by altering intracellular trafficking.\n\nUltimate limitations inherent to active targeting pertain to the impact of an anchored targeting motif on PEGylated NPs, including its potential to alter the protein corona or the possibility for the ligand to be buried beneath the layer of adsorbed proteins.This discouraging outcome has been observed with transferrintargeted PEG-silica NPs by Dawson and colleagues. [25]Chan and colleagues have proposed an alternative approach to ensure the active ligand exposure by introducing shorter PEG additionally to the longer, ligand-carrying PEG chains. [26]Although there is an increasing interest in how active targeting approaches are hindered by protein corona formation, most studies focus on in vitro formation and target recognition.Considering the critical importance of the biological identity of NPs in vivo, improved understanding thereof is necessary. [27]here is a substantial lack of attempts to correlate the in vivo protein corona profile to the actual biodistribution of administered NPs, a matter of utmost importance that needs to be addressed to improve translational advances of delivery systems.Improved methodology regarding the recollection of coronacoated NPs might solve one of the intricacies contributing to this knowledge gap.\n\nIn addition to the problems highlighted above, from the experimental point of view, the results reported about protein corona should be cautiously interpreted, considering that the PEG-protein corona formation is highly dependent on study conditions.

On the contrary, LNPs with longer lipid chains, such as C18 acyl chain (distearoyl-glycerol), show completely different in vivo behavior with a better anchoring ability on lipid membranes, protecting LNPs and decreasing their interaction with blood proteins [114]. siRNA-loaded LNP formulations containing PEG2000-DMG (1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000) have shorter circulation times and higher in vivo delivery efficacy than formulations containing PEG2000-DSG (1,2distearoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000), due to the faster dissociation from the LNPs, which may favor cellular uptake and endosomal escape [115]. \n\nDuring the formation of LNPs, PEG-lipid components arrange themselves with the hydrophilic polymer extended towards the aqueous medium, forming a hydrophilic coating on the surface of the LNPs which can increase their stability reducing aggregation phenomena during storage [24]. The LNP's ability to deliver their cargo to target cells is directly affected by the PEGylation; in fact, the addition of PEGylated lipid to NP formulations is widely used to increase the in vivo circulation time and prevent rapid clearance from the bloodstream.",

The PEGlipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption. This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEGcoating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. 181,187,188 To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. 181,189 Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. 187,190 The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. 191 Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment. 192\u2212194 Protein corona studies provide molecular level insight into mechanisms of cellular recognition, uptake, and intracellular destiny of particles. 195 Among the different classes of adsorbed biomolecules (e.g., proteins, 196 lipids, 197 carbohydrates, 198,199 and metabolites 200 ), the apolipoprotein ApoE, involved in the metabolism of fats in the body, has",

            "text": "The evolution of LNP size distribution profiles after incubation in fetal bovine serum (FBS) was measured by NTA in order to assess the formation of a protein corona around particles. Two main parameters were considered: the average size (Mean) and the concentration of total particles (LNPs at the initial time, LNPs and serum particles during the incubation). As shown in Figure 3, after incubation in FBS, the particle size distribution profiles (concentration/size curves) were completely different depending on the lipid-PEG included in the LNPs. A flattening and displacement of the curves was observed for the DMG-and DTA-PEG (C14)-based formulations (Figure 3G-J), indicating an increase in the mean size and a decrease in the total particle concentration over time in the presence of FBS. The increase in the mean size was related to the adsorption of proteins around LNPs. On the contrary, the DSPE-and DSG-PEG (C18)-based formulations (Figure 3A-D) did not show any flattening of their curves over time. These formulations were characterized by maintaining a constant average size with no decrease in concentration during incubation. The formulations containing Cer-PEG demonstrated intermediate results in terms of size increase and concentration decrease. Figure 4 summarizes the observations of the total particles mean size (Figure 4A) and concentration (Figure 4B) evolution as a function of time. Formulations containing C14 lipids-PEG (DMG-or DTA-PEG) showed a significant increase in the mean size (from 50 to more than 100 nm) and a decrease in concentration (normalized concentration between 8 and 50% of the initial concentration) after 4 h. Statistical analyses (Figure 4C,D) confirmed that the formulations containing C14 lipids-PEG have a significantly higher mean size after 4 h of incubation in FBS when compared with the CSL3/DSPE-PEG formulation, and a significant decrease in the normalized concentration. These results were related to the emergence of fewer but larger particles following the adsorption of proteins around the LNPs, thereby leading to the alteration of LNPs.",

            "text": "Furthermore, the combined analysis of particle surface charge with pH titration together with haemolytic activity suggested that the high PEG density provided a more significant physical steric barrier in the inhibition of membrane fusion and disruption, as compared to the charge shielding effect property. The length of the acyl chain of PEG also regulates the intracellular delivery of a drug into the target cell. Usually, to the membrane of LNPs, the PEG-lipid is anchored using the hydrophobic acyl chain [62]. PEG-lipids having short acyl chains dissociate quickly from the LNPs following injection (since less energy is required in order to break the anchoring bonds present between the PEG-lipid and LNP), allowing the LNPs to better interact with target cells. For instance, PEG-lipids with C14 acyl chains take a half-time of around 1 h to dissociate from LNPs, while PEG-lipids with C20 acyl chains take 24 h or longer half-times for dissociation. PEG shields the LNP from the serum protein such as apolipoproteins (ApoE) and albumins. Judge et al. revealed that LNPs containing high amounts of C18 PEG-lipids, showed longer circulation time and thereby enhanced the efficacy LNPs as compared to LNPs with lower amounts of C14 PEG-lipids. The reduced association of ApoE was observed due to the highly shielded LNPs provided by mPEG200. [71]. This resulted in longer circulation which led to a greater opportunity of LNPs to enter subcutaneous tumour cells [72]. However, an excessive amount of PEGylation in LNP could inhibit cellular internalization and intracellular release of the drug, resulting in reduced intracellular delivery [73]. \n\nSuzuki et al. also studied the PEG shedding profiles of DMG-LNP and DSG-LNP, respectively for encapsulation of siRNA specific for GFP or FVII. DMG-PEG with shorter acyl chains displayed faster shedding from the LNPs than the DSG-PEG having the longer acyl chain.",

C18 acyl chains are efficiently anchored in the membrane, while shorter C14 lipids are quickly desorbed and replaced by a protein corona responsible for the completely different fate of LNPs. In this context, a method to predict the biological behavior of LNPs depending on the lipid-PEG dissociation was developed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) method in serum. Two formulations of siRNA-containing LNPs were prepared including CSL3 or SM-102 lipids and were grafted with different lipids-PEG (C18, C14 lipids-PEG, and Ceramide-PEG). The impact of the lipid-PEG on the interactions between LNPs and serum components was demonstrated by monitoring the mean particle size and the concentration over time. In vitro, these formulations demonstrated low toxicity and efficient gene knockdown on tumor MDA-MB-231 cells, but serum was found to significantly impact the efficiency of C18-PEG-based LNPs, while it did not impact the efficiency of C14-PEG-based LNPs. The NTA method demonstrated the ability to discriminate between the behaviors of LNPs according to serum proteins\u2019 interactions.

            "text": "Recently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium. It was observed that the addition of FBS could decrease the transfection efficacy of C18 LNPs while increasing the efficacy of C14 LNPs. The authors discussed these results, suggesting that the protein corona could either hinder the uptake process or facilitate it due to other receptor-mediated phenomenon [4]. Even if the protein corona has been described to inhibit transfection, it now appears that some of the proteins included in this corona could specifically interact with cellular processes and particles trafficking [2]. Regarding the results obtained in this study, it could then be hypothesized that C14 lipids-PEG dissociate in serum, which can facilitate transfection, as PEG is known to prevent the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [6]. Following this desorption, PEG could be replaced by a protein corona, which could also play a positive role on transfection, depending on its composition. In contrast, C18 lipids-PEG have strong anchoring ability which allows for the prevention of protein corona formation, but could also be an obstacle to transfection. Moreover, as explained by Chen et al., PEG cannot completely eliminate the binding of proteins around LNPs, and that proteins could impact the transfection in serum. \n\nSeveral parameters must then be considered when designing LNPs. The use of long lipids-PEG can offer an efficient protection against protein corona formation, prolong the circulation of LNPs, and increase the accumulation in tumor. Nevertheless, the transfection efficacy of these LNPs could finally be lower than expected because of the barrier effect of PEG. However, this effect could be balanced by an intermediate proportion of C18 lipid-PEG in LNPs formulations if an equilibrium between efficient stealth properties and efficient transfection can be found. On the other hand, recent examples highlighted the interest in using short lipids-PEG in order to avoid long effect or to target hepatic diseases. In that case, the formation of the protein corona is intended, and recent studies demonstrated the high transfection efficacy of these LNPs.",

            "text": "The formation of protein coronas is believed to be closely associated with the biodistribution of nanoparticles in the body. Upon intravenous injection, the nanoparticles come into contact with the serum, leading proteins to adsorb on their surface and form a distinctive protein corona layer [121]. The presence of the protein corona may alter the properties of the nanoparticles, with profound influences for their tissue specificity. For instance, most LNPs exhibit hepatic specificity via intravenous administration, owing to the adsorption of ApoE by binding to the LDLR that are over-expressed on the hepatocytes [121]. Additionally, it has been validated that the knockdown of ApoE lowered the liver targeting of nanomaterials by delivering mRNA into a mouse model lacking ApoE expression [121]. Although the mechanism of endogenous targeting is still not fully explored, researchers have striven to investigate the rules. It is discovered that when the PEG-lipids desorb from LNPs, specific protein binding to LNPs is promoted. The desorption rate of PEG-lipids with longer hydrophobic chains is slower, which might not conducive to formulating appropriate protein coronas and achieving organ targeted delivery [121]. In parallel, nano-vectors with different structures and properties may adsorb different proteins, resulting in protein coronas with distinct components and properties. The formation of protein corona at the interface will alter the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles, exhibiting a crucial impact on their biodistribution and endocytosis [162]. It has been demonstrated that LNPs with different pKa values can influence their organ targeting. More specifically, the preferred pK a range for liver, spleen, and lung targeting is 6.2~6.5, 2~6, and 7~9, respectively [121,174,175]. These theories have implications for guiding the design of other delivery systems as well.",

An increase in the mean size and a decrease in the particle concentration over time was correlated with important protein adsorption on LNPs from which C14 lipids-PEG were desorbed. On the contrary, for the C18 lipids-PEG LNPs, the size remained constant and the concentration did not decrease, demonstrating a stronger anchor of C18 lipid-PEG and a longer stealth effect. That method demonstrated the ability to discriminate between the different behaviors of LNPs according to serum proteins' interactions and could be used to screen new formulations in order to predict their possible fate prior to in vivo testing. \n\nRegarding the tested formulations including promising ionizable lipids (CSL3 and SM-102), the results confirmed, using live imaging, their high transfection efficacy in tumor MDA-MB-231 expressing cytoplasmic mEmerald cells, even in serum medium.

Since the PEG-lipid is incorporated into the LNP membrane through the hydrophobic tail (the alkyl/acyl chains), PEGlipids with longer tails are less likely to dissociate from the LNP. Studies have reported this correlation between desorption rate and lipid tail length both in vitro [49,65] and in vivo [51]. Mui et al. [51] showed that PEG-lipid desorption from LNPs in circulation, measured one hour after in vivo administration, was 45% for PEG-lipids with C14 dialkyl chains (the length of the alkyl/acyl groups is reported as CX, where X is the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl/acyl chain) and only 1.3% and 0.2% for PEG-lipids with C16 and C18 dialkyl chains, respectively. Studies have generally found that longer alkyl chains improve LNP stability in biological fluids. That said, even short C12 and C14 dialkyl/diacyl chains provide sufficient stability during LNP self-assembly [49,51]. However, in the presence of a lipid sink (e.g. plasma), which contains endogenous lipid-based particles including lipoproteins and extracellular vesicles plus high levels of albumin with its many hydrophobic pockets [66], the short-alkyl-chained PEG-lipids are prone to dissociating into the endogenous lipid-associating entities. In addition to biological lipid-based nanoparticles in blood, cell membranes can also function as a lipid sink.\n\n3.2.1.1. PEG-lipids mediate indirect targeting capabilities of LNPs.

[70] investigated the role of apolipoprotein-and vitronectin-enriched corona on LNPs for targeted delivery and transfection of oligonucleotides in murine tumor models.A slight change in the physicochemical properties of LNPs altered the corona pattern.For instance, the introduction of positive charge via cationic lipid 3\u03b2-{N-[2-(dimethylamino) ethyl]carbamoyl}cholesterol (DC-cholesterol) as a substitution for original cholesterol shifted the protein corona pattern from apolipoprotein-rich to vitronectin-rich.",

Two main parameters were considered: the average size (Mean) and the concentration of total particles (LNPs at the initial time, LNPs and serum particles during the incubation). As shown in Figure 3, after incubation in FBS, the particle size distribution profiles (concentration/size curves) were completely different depending on the lipid-PEG included in the LNPs. A flattening and displacement of the curves was observed for the DMG-and DTA-PEG (C14)-based formulations (Figure 3G-J), indicating an increase in the mean size and a decrease in the total particle concentration over time in the presence of FBS. The increase in the mean size was related to the adsorption of proteins around LNPs. On the contrary, the DSPE-and DSG-PEG (C18)-based formulations (Figure 3A-D) did not show any flattening of their curves over time. These formulations were characterized by maintaining a constant average size with no decrease in concentration during incubation.",

            "text": "Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a hydrophilic polymer with many applications in pharmaceutical formulations, and PEGylation has become a gold standard in pharmaceutical nanocarrier modification for developing successful drug delivery systems. PEG-lipid conjugates (PEG-lipids) are lipids in which a hydrophobic alkyl chain is conjugated to a hydrophilic PEG polymer chain; PEG-lipids have been widely used in LNP formulations to deliver anti-cancer drugs, siRNA, and mRNA vaccines. PEG-lipids are present with the smallest mole percentage in the formulation of LNPs, usually not exceeding 1.5 mol%. Their presence, particularly regarding the molar ratio, can influence different NP properties such as particle size, PDI, zeta potential, and stability. LNP size is an important parameter that must be controlled during preparation because it can play a decisive role in their pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, delivery efficiency, and transfection potency [45,113]. \n\nIncreasing the molar ratio of the PEG-lipid resulted in significantly smaller LNPs, independently of other lipid components. The PEG-lipid is located at the LNP surface, and hence, raising the mol% of the PEG-lipid leads to a higher surface area-volume ratio, and thus, decrease in their particle size. \n\nThe type of PEG-lipid concerning structure, chain length, molar mass ratio, and length of the alkyl chain constituting the lipid tail can be crucial in modifying some LNP properties. Which PEG-lipid to choose depends on the therapeutic purpose, target organ and/or cell type, and administration route. \n\nRegarding the PEG chain, a molecular weight of 2000 g/mol, corresponding to about 45 repetition units (PEG 2000), is a good choice for pharmaceutical nanocarriers with a satisfactory elimination half-time and delivery efficiency. PEG with shorter chains is not so performant in terms of preventing protein corona formation and increasing blood circulation time, while PEG with longer chains can have a strong effect on cellular uptake and the endosomal escape process [114].",

            "text": "PEG-lipids have a significant impact on the key characteristics of LNPs, which include particle size and polydispersity [156], the stability of LNPs during preparation and in storage, the prevention of aggregation [157], the encapsulation efficiency of nucleic acids, circulation half-life, immune response, in vivo distribution and efficiency in transfection [158,159]. The PEG-lipids used in Comirnaty \u00ae , Spikevax \u00ae and in Onpattro \u00ae are ALC-0159, PEG-DMG and PEG-c-DMG, respectively. The biological activity of LNPs is impacted by the structure of the lipid tail in PEG-lipids. Incorporation of PEG-lipids into the LNP membrane occurs through the hydrophobic tail (composed of alkyl/acyl chains). PEG-lipids possessing longer tails exhibit reduced propensity for dissociation from the LNP. Mui et al. demonstrated that PEG-lipid desorption from LNPs in circulation, analyzed one hour after administering them in vivo, was 45% for PEG-lipids containing C14 dialkyl chains, and conversely PEG-lipids with C16 and C18 dialkyl chains displayed only 1.3% and 0.2% desorption, respectively [160]. The short-chained diacyl PEG-lipid PEG-carbamate-1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol (PEG-c-DMG), which was introduced in the Onpattro \u00ae formulation, tends to desorb from the LNPs upon intravenous administration. PEG-lipids with short lipid tails enable them to desorb from LNPs, allowing the particles to adsorb apoE, facilitating LNPs to endogenously target hepatocytes in the liver [32]. PEG-lipids serve to stabilize LNPs during their preparation and storage by creating a steric barrier that facilitates self-assembly and inhibits aggregation. Moreover, the specific type of PEG-lipid used has an influence on the circulation time of LNPs and their interactions with cells.",

Moreover, the roles of different formulations in differential biological distribution, as well as the general relationship between lipid structure, formulation, and activity, are areas that require further exploration. 122 iScience Review Figure 6. Representative chemical structures of key lipids designed for organ-selective nucleic acids delivery Proteins from plasma are adsorbed onto the LNPs surface to form a protein corona in the blood circulation. The protein corona formed on LNPs after intravenous injection contains hundreds of biomolecules (mainly proteins and lipids). LNPs are cleared and extravasated from the circulation, and ultimately function intracellularly via cellular uptake and undergo organ, cellular, and molecular biological processes. 138 The composition of the protein corona is influenced by the chemical and molecular components of the surface of the LNPs, as well as its charge. This formation of protein coronas allows the fate of LNPs in vivo to be predicted, and even the targeting ligands can be shielded so that LNPs can be delivered less efficiently. Thus, understanding protein corona can help in the design of novel targeted LNPs. 20 sually, the formation of protein corona reduces the delivery efficiency of LNPs, and encapsulation of LNPs on the surface with PEG or other materials usually inhibits the formation of protein corona and prolongs the blood circulation of LNPs. 139 Recent studies have shown that apolipoproteins can be incorporated into protein corona, exerting endogenous targeting properties and playing an important role in organ-and cell-specific targeting of LNPs. 140",

The addition of an anionic lipid reduced pK a , whereas the addition of a cationic lipid increased pK a , which affected the interaction with plasma proteins and the formation of the protein corona (Dilliard et al., 2021). Results of their proteomic analysis of the protein corona suggested that targeting to the liver takes place with predominance of the ApoE protein in the protein corona; to lungs, with predominance of the \u03b22-GPI protein; and to the spleen, with predominance of the VTN protein. Incubation of these proteins with the LNPs in vitro also enabled specific LNP targeting (Dilliard et al., 2021). \n\nThose authors proposed a three-stage mechanism underlying the targeting of a five-component LNP (Dilliard et al., 2021). The first stage is the dissociation of the PEGylated lipid from the surface of LNPs; the second is the binding of SORT-lipid to blood proteins; and the third stage is the binding of proteins (adhering to the  Frontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org 09 particle) to tissue-specific receptors. In the case of PEG with a longer aliphatic anchor, which shows worse desorption, the expression of the reporter protein in all organs was noticeably lower, thus confirming the above mechanism. In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3).",

Structures of lipids are presented in Figure S1. This resulted in testing three formulations: MC3/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG (referred as DSPC/Chol), MC3/DOPE/Cholesterol/PEG (referred as DOPE/Chol), and MC3/DOPE/\u03b2-sitosterol/PEG (referred as DOPE/\u03b2S). \u03b2S possesses an additional ethyl group at the C24 position. All formulations resulted in LNPs of 76-95 nm with a neutral zeta potential (Table 1). Complexation of mRNA was verified by gel electrophoresis, with no free mRNA detectable (Figure 1A). Interestingly, DSPC containing LNPs exhibited a lower polydispersity index (0.066 for MC3/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG vs. 0.16 for MC3/DOPE/Cholesterol/PEG and 0.13 for MC3/DOPE/\u03b2-sitosterol/PEG). These results indicate similarly low polydispersity for the three types of LNPs. We also monitored the size of LNPs after incubation with serum and at 37 \u2022 C by dynamic light scattering (Figure 1B). Proteins in serum could interact with the surface of LNPs and induce their aggregation. The three types of LNPs remained stable during incubation confirming the PEG-mediated stabilization of the nanoparticles in serum as previously reported [38,45,46]. The size of DOPE/\u03b2S LNPs moderately increased from 90 nm to 120 nm over 8 h.",

Incorporation of PEG provides the LNPs with an external polymeric layer onto their outer shell, and this helps to hinder the adsorption of serum proteins and the components of a phagocytic system, thereby extending their in vivo circulation time. It prevents aggregation during storage and increases the stability of the NPs. The length and density of the polymer chains determine the circulatory half-life of LNPs. The PEG chain length and its molecular weight (750 to 5000 kDa) has shown varying effect in vivo clearance study, which resulted from its interaction with different-sized opsonins which is present in the bloodstream [69]. \n\nThe surface coating of LNP with PEG also influences the overall surface charge on LNPs. For instance, Kumar et al. studied the effect of polyethylene glycol-1,2-dimyristoylsn-glycerol-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG-DMG) for shielding the LNP surface charge using 1.5% (LNP1.5), 5% (LNP5), and 10% (LNP10) PEG-DMG concentration (Figure 3). The LNPs were formulated using 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), cholesterol, DLin-MC3-DMA. The increasing PEG-DMG concentration resulted in a decrease in zeta potential (performed at pH 5.5) which was observed to drop from +32 mV (for LNP1.5) to +24 (for LNP5) and +18 mV (for LNP10) suggesting that higher PEG-DMG reduces the surface charge density of LNP. Furthermore, the combined analysis of particle surface charge with pH titration together with haemolytic activity suggested that the high PEG density provided a more significant physical steric barrier in the inhibition of membrane fusion and disruption, as compared to the charge shielding effect property.",

            "text": ", the expected longer circulation time of LNPs coated with C18 compared to C14 PEG-lipids do not change final transfection efficacy and/or apoE adsorption levels. These data lead one to question whether PEG-lipid desorption (when using 1.5 mol% PEGlipid) is essential for apoE adsorption to LNPs.\n\nIn addition to the indirect active targeting properties obtained via the association between apoE and LNPs in blood, more passive targeting could be attained by preserving the steric barrier of the LNP in vivo. A PEG-lipid like the PEG-DSPE (C18) (Fig. 3B) used in Doxil \u00d2 inhibits rapid desorption and thus limits protein binding and clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic system, thereby prolonging circulation time of the PEGylated nanocarrier. Approaches [72-74] using a persistent PEG-lipid to improve LNP accumulation elsewhere employ a formulation with compromised activity and therefore require higher doses to achieve silencing at the target tissue. A slow PEG desorption rate will also minimize specific uptake in the liver and further increase circulation time, enhancing LNP accumulation in tumor tissues [51].\n\nTaken together, the research detailed above shows that the choice of PEG-lipid greatly influences key LNP properties such as size, stability, in vivo distribution, and transfection efficiency. PEG-lipids stabilize LNPs during preparation and storage by providing a steric barrier that both drives self-assembly and prevents aggregation. Further, the type of PEG-lipid partly controls LNP circulation time and cellular interactions. Which PEG-lipid to choose highly depends on therapeutic purpose, target organ and/or cell type, and administration route, and should include considerations regarding both molar ratios and length of the akyl/acyl chain(s) constituting the lipid tail, as these parameters have all shown to influence key properties of LNPs.\n\n3.2.1.2. Do PEG-lipids stimulate an immune response?. Grafting PEG to long chained lipids onto liposomes grants them stealth-like properties that prolong their half-life in circulation.

ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nFor instance, the addition of PEG or poloxamine coatings to NPs has been found to reduce complement activation, while dextran coatings increase it.

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG 2000 (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG 2000 (C18, distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine) [6]. A few hours following parenteral injection, DMG-PEG 2000 is dissociated and replaced by a biomolecular corona including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) with specificity for hepatocytes [7,8]. DMG-PEG 2000 is therefore optimal for liver targeting, and the development of Onpattro TM is a concrete therapeutic application approved by the FDA. In this context, two short lipids-PEG (C14) were recently used in the Comirnaty \u00ae and Spikevax \u00ae COVID-19 vaccines: ALC-0159 (DTA-PEG 2000 , ditetradecylacetamide) and DMG-PEG 2000 , respectively. After an intramuscular injection, LNPs are responsible for a transient local inflammation and the recruitment of neutrophils and antigen-presenting cells [1]. In contrast, longer PEG-derivatives, such as C18 lipids-PEG, display a better anchoring ability in lipid membranes. For example, DSPE-PEG 2000 is used to effectively protect LNPs by decreasing interactions with blood proteins, allowing for a prolonged blood circulation time and increased tumor accumulation [3,9]. \n\nIn this context, the objective of this study was to develop an in vitro method to rapidly assess the behavior of LNPs in serum in order to predict their in vivo fate. For this purpose, two LNPs formulations [CSL3 or SM-102 (pH-sensitive lipids)/DSPC/Chol/lipid-PEG in 50/10/37.5/2.5 molar ratio] carrying siRNA were produced. The ionizable lipids were selected based on the promise they show for efficiently delivering nucleic acids.",

            "text": "The PEG shedding strategy used in recently developed LNP systems is based on PEG lipid desorption from the LNP surface upon entering systemic circulation. The PEG coating on one hand prevents the aggregation of liposomes upon storage and to some extent in vivo also, but on the other hand hinders interactions of lipid nanoparticles with target cell membranes and their subsequent internalization [50,51]. Ideally, the PEG layer should be removed at the site of action. \n\nThe way the PEG coating is exploited for targeting/stability has varied over the years by either making it a more stable component of LNP systems to evade undesired immune responses while in systemic circulation, as in the case of intravenously administered LNPs, or by applying the PEG coating as a transient component which provides stability upon storage but sheds in vivo upon interaction with serum proteins, as is the case for intramuscularly administered LNPs. The shedding of PEG relies on (i) shorter carbon chain lengths of the lipid that is conjugated to the PEG, (ii) the concentration of serum proteins in vivo, and (iii) the time of exposure to serum proteins [52]. In an in vitro study, Gallud et al. [52] demonstrated an increase in the uptake of PEGylated LNPs in Huh 7 cells when LNPs were pre-incubated in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, the increase in LNP uptake was proportional to the amount of FBS present and the time of incubation. They also showed that LNPs anchored to streptavidin via Biotin-mediated binding were released as the medium was exposed to FBS, providing a clear insight into the FBS-mediated release of PEG lipids. However, the precise mechanism of stimulation by serum proteins to augment the PEG lipid release from the LNPs is still unknown. \n\nAdditionally, there are other mechanisms that play a vital role in PEG lipid removal from nanoparticles. One such force is the cohesive interaction of PEG lipids within nanoparticles with other lipid components.",

            "text": "PEG, a non-ionic biocompatible synthetic polymer, is soluble both in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents [68]. Incorporation of PEG provides the LNPs with an external polymeric layer onto their outer shell, and this helps to hinder the adsorption of serum proteins and the components of a phagocytic system, thereby extending their in vivo circulation time. It prevents aggregation during storage and increases the stability of the NPs. The length and density of the polymer chains determine the circulatory half-life of LNPs. The PEG chain length and its molecular weight (750 to 5000 kDa) has shown varying effect in vivo clearance study, which resulted from its interaction with different-sized opsonins which is present in the bloodstream [69]. \n\nThe surface coating of LNP with PEG also influences the overall surface charge on LNPs. For instance, Kumar et al. studied the effect of polyethylene glycol-1,2-dimyristoylsn-glycerol-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG-DMG) for shielding the LNP surface charge using 1.5% (LNP1.5), 5% (LNP5), and 10% (LNP10) PEG-DMG concentration (Figure 3). The LNPs were formulated using 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), cholesterol, DLin-MC3-DMA. The increasing PEG-DMG concentration resulted in a decrease in zeta potential (performed at pH 5.5) which was observed to drop from +32 mV (for LNP1.5) to +24 (for LNP5) and +18 mV (for LNP10) suggesting that higher PEG-DMG reduces the surface charge density of LNP. Furthermore, the combined analysis of particle surface charge with pH titration together with haemolytic activity suggested that the high PEG density provided a more significant physical steric barrier in the inhibition of membrane fusion and disruption, as compared to the charge shielding effect property.",

            "text": "systems. This phenomenon could be explained by the differences in the chemical structure and spatial arrangement of the two polymers within the lipid nano-carriers. Namely, in the samples covered with PEG2000-DSPE, PEG groups are anchored to a phospholipid tail (DSPE), which is aligned parallel within the membrane phospholipid molecules of the formulations, allowing for the hydrophilic PEG chains to extend outward. This configuration was shown to decrease the surface hydrophobicity, and therefore reduce the plasma protein adsorption [21]. On the other hand, the large hydrophobic polypropylene oxide block of Poloxamer was probably positioned deeper and closer to the lipid layer of the NLs and NLCs, thereby limiting the degree to which the PEG chains were projected and extended on the surface of the nano-formulations [29].\n\nAccording to the literature data, upon the intravenous administration of nanoparticles in vivo, the adherence of serum biomolecules on the nanoparticles' surfaces could result in particle integrity loss and severely alter the particle properties, which has a major influence on their key performances, including their aggregation behavior, circulation time in vivo, toxicity, and targeting capability [27]. In this sense, the change in the particle diameter during the incubation in human plasma may have been due to the destabilization of the system in terms of particle agglomeration, or, more likely, the formation of a protein corona [28]. This phenomenon could be observed at the first time points of the incubation of the formulations, which points to the dynamic process of protein corona formation, i.e., the constant adsorption and desorption of proteins from the particles' surfaces, which is especially emphasized during the formation of the initial, \"soft\" corona [30]. except for NLCPOL, where there was noted a significant change in the z-average diameter after 24 h of incubation time (p = 0.0101; p < 0.05; ANOVA) ( Figure 2a). Similar values for the nano-systems' average diameters were obtained when they were incubated in human plasma, except with NLCPOL, where, after 24 h, there was an increase in particle size of ~",

The choice of lipid-PEGs also had no significant influence on the particle size (~ 60-70 nm) and the encapsulation efficiency of siRNA, which was ~ 50-60% for all the NPs (Figure 2c) as measured using fluorophore labeled siRNA (DY547-siRNA). \n\nConsidering that albumin is the main plasma protein in blood and has a strong binding with diacyl lipids [40], we utilized 4 w/v% serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to investigate the role of albumin on the de-PEGylation of the hybrid siRNA NPs. While all lipid-PEGs dissociated from NPs over time as shown in Figure 2d-e, the rate of dissociation was drastically different. For lipid-PEGs with saturated tails in both neutral and anionic categories, shorter alkyl chains resulted in faster dissociation. For example, after 24 h incubation with albumin, over 50% of DSG-PEG and DSPE-PEG (with C18 alkyl chains) still remained on NP surfaces. As a comparison, the amount of DMG-PEG and DMPE-PEG (with C14 alkyl chains) dwindled below the detection limit after 6-12 h. This phenomenon might be explained by the higher phase transition temperature and lower fluidity of the lipid tails with longer saturated alkyl chains, which could result in stronger hydrophobic interactions with the PLGA core. Interestingly, much faster dissociation was observed for the unsaturated lipid-PEGs than the saturated ones with the same length of alkyl chain (ceramide vs. DPG, or DOPE vs. DSPE).",

            "text": "(iii) Polyethilenglycol (PEG) is a widely known polymer that has been described and previously used in liposomes and other types of nanoformulations. It seems to play a main role in prolonging circulation time by reducing macrophage phagocytic system (MPS) interactions, improving colloidal stability and preventing the formation of the protein corona [53,75,76]. PEGylated lipids typically included in these formulations consist of two domains, a hydrophilic PEG polymer conjugated to a hydrophobic lipid branch. In LNPs, the hydrophilic domain is located towards the exterior surface of the particle and the lipid branch towards the interior. Additionally, LNP properties can be tuned by modulating the PEG-lipid/total lipid content ratio. For instance, it is known that smaller LNPs are generated at higher PEG-lipid ratios-a matter that is further described in Section 2.1.3. PEG-lipids can additionally balance the half-life and cellular uptake of LNPs [54]. For this reason, the PEG amount is today kept to a minimum of 1.5 mol% of the total lipid content, after Semple et al. reported a 5-fold potency improvement when decreasing PEG content from 10% to 1.5% [54]. Considering that PEG can also affect cell-nanoparticle interactions by preventing a close approach between the two and impeding endosomal escape by preventing fusion [77]; some studies suggest that causing PEG lipids to diffuse from the LNPs upon administration would allow for intracellular delivery promotion [78]. \n\nDespite the well-characterized and studied molar compositions, little is known about how changing the overall composition might affect the LNPs' biodistribution. Apart from the above-described study where DOPE and DSPC LNP formulations were compared [71], another important study was recently published in Nature about selective organ targeting of LNPs [79]. In this study, the authors concluded that it is possible to include additional lipids to tune LNPs' base composition, and thus modify their surface charge to target specific organs such as the spleen and lungs.",

            "text": "Although alternative strategies are proposed, like cleavage of a PEG moiety (72), this problem is majorly addressed by a strategy based on \"reversible PEGylation\", where a lipid-containing PEG slowly detaches from the NP surface once administered. This allows to take advantage of the disposing of the high PEG concentration needed for small and monodisperse synthesis and distribution, and the lower PEG concentration needed to have a good cellular uptake at the moment when the NP reaches the target organ. Note that an increase in the concentration of PEG also influences its conformation and protective effects, increasing the circulation time of the iLNPs (71). Indeed, a completely PEG-covered iLNP surface will dramatically inhibit the interaction with cells and serum proteins, modifying circulation time and biodistribution (68,71). Such PEG-lipids remain integrated into the LNP structure during formation and under storage conditions, but in the presence of a lipid sink like in plasma, these PEG-lipids are stripped off the particle and into de medium, leaving the surface of the iLNP gradually unshielded (45). These PEG-lipids have short alkyl chains -which act as \"hydrophobic anchors\"-allowing a reasonable desorption rate once they enter blood circulation (71). The proper balance between a fully protected surface for iLNP synthesis and distribution, and a relatively unshielded surface for interactions with cell membranes, is achieved by finding a compromise between alkyl chain length and PEG-lipid surface concentration. \n\nSpecial mention deserves the interaction of NPs with proteins, adjusted by the size and concentration of PEG at the NP surface. When NPs are administrated into the body, they first interact with biological fluids. Depending on the administration site, the biomolecules that will interact with the NPs can vary: from lung surfactants when inhaled to the interstitial fluid when locally injected into blood plasma following intravenous administration (73).",

PEG also mediates stealth effects in vivo reducing serum protein adsorption and consequently resulting in a prolonged blood circulation time. These effects are dependent on the density and the molecular weight of the linear PEG [13] . \n\nSerum protein adsorption with formation of a protein corona occurs whenever NPs get into contact with biological fluids like blood, result-ing in a new NP biological identity [ 5 , 14 , 15 ]. Hence, blood circulation time, biodistribution and targeting of nanocarriers can be influenced. The NP characteristics like size, shape and surface composition, as well as environmental parameters like temperature and type of fluid can affect the composition of the protein corona [ 16 , 17 ]. Corona proteins can either act as opsonins and mark NPs for rapid recognition by the reticuloendothelial system or they act as dysopsonins mediating longer blood circulation times [18] . As PEG can reduce protein adsorption, but not completely prevent it, the formation of a protein corona around the NPs has to be considered for successful active targeting. \n\nThe aim of this study was on the one hand to analyze the effect of different PEG spacers with varying length for ligand coupling on active targeting. On the other hand, we aimed to characterize the protein corona formed around these NPs and its influence on the active targeting capability. We demonstrated that both serum protein adsorption and selection of the PEG spacer for the targeting moiety have an effect on active targeting and also influence each other.",

            "text": "Pegylation of LNP surface via polyethylene glycol (PEG) plays a pivotal role in improving LNP stability and facilitating readily tissue penetration and targeting.Pegylation strategy has been widely used in many drug modalities and delivery systems.Since PEG is an amphiphilic lipid that can interact with both the hydrophobic core of the LNPs and the hydrophilic environment of physiological conditions or storage buffers, it plays a crucial role in regulating the clearance and half-life of LNPs, as well as on-shelf stability.Typically, the half-life of LNPs depends on the length of PEG lipid.The longer the PEG length, the less easily nonspecific interaction with serum components in the bloodstream.Nonetheless, it also inhibits fusion between LNP and endosome membrane, widely known as the \"PEG dilemma\" in LNP drug delivery [64].The lipid structure of pegylation also has a significant effect on LNP function.[35], while PEG lipids with longer C18 alkyl chain were more capable of longer circulation [65].In a nonviral gene therapy to treat traumatic brain injury, DMG-PEG 2000 and DSPE-PEG 2000 were compared.They formulated siRNA and mRNA LNPs with various ratios of DMG-PEG 2000 and DSPE-PEG 2000 and discovered that the increase in the proportion of DSPE-PEG 2000 led to longer blood circulation with enhanced gene expression in the injured brain hemisphere [66].\n\nBesides optimizing the choice of the hydrophobic domain of PEG lipids, regulating the affinity (or shedding rate) of PEG lipids is another trending strategy.The presence of PEG on the surface of nanoparticles may hinder cell uptake of nanoparticles.PEG lipids on LNPs are expected to shed from LNP in a controlled way after administrations, thus inducing cellular internalizations at the target site and also maintaining high serum stability.Suzuki et al. [67] revealed the influence of PEG shedding rate on the blood clearance of PEGylated LNPs.",

            "text": "Interestingly, pegylation slightly decreases the SC surface mass density but does not influence the HC, and no significant difference is observed between the two pegylated formulations for SC or HC. However, the percentage protein-to-lipid ratios show that the pegylated formulation F3 accumulated almost twice the molar amount of proteins per amount of lipid comparing to F2, again most likely a reflection of the amphiphilic nature of ICG and its clustering within PEG. Several authors have noted that the corona continues to evolve under in vivo relevant conditions, where the amount of biomolecular species is not limited by scarcity and where biological processes affect the corona during its passage through different biological compartments (i.e. immune activation and enzymatic modifications). 50,51 In our measurements, neither of the pegylated formulations saturated during the ca. 20 min incubation period (Fig. 4 and S9 \u2020). Considering that all our formulations tested positive for traces of endotoxins, it is probable that these surfaces induced complement system activation, which can increase the amount of bound biomolecules by as much as 25% due to surface deposition of opsonins. 52,53 The slight differences between F2 and F3 in thickness and surface mass density, and the clear difference in protein-to-lipid ratios between the pegylated formulations demonstrate that ICG influences corona formation. Overall, the mass accumulated per area is very similar for all SC and HC, respectively, whereas clear differences between the liposome formulations are seen when the amount of bound protein is compared to the amount of lipid. The replicate data calculations are provided as ESI Table M1. \u2020 Corona studies generally employ static incubation conditions where protein adsorption reaches equilibrium quickly. 50 For instance, Walczyk et al. reported HC thicknesses of 11-12 nm before and 10.5 nm after extensive washing for differential centrifugal sedimentation isolated 100 nm surface-carboxylated polystyrene NPs, measured using TEM and DLS. 54",

[57] nebulized LNPs for pulmonary delivery and observed that LNPs with high molar ratios of PEG-lipids resulted in higher pulmonary transfection efficiency than LNPs with lower molar ratios of PEG-lipids. LNPs damaged during nebulization are expected to aggregate, suggesting that higher PEG-density on LNPs limits aggregation and subsequently promotes cellular uptake. LNP size must be controlled during preparation as it plays a decisive role in nanoparticle pharmacokinetics and biodistribution [62] and LNP biodistribution, delivery efficiency, and transfection potency [63]. Multiple studies have shown that increasing the molar ratio of the PEG-lipid coheres with significantly smaller LNPs, independent of other lipid components [24,52,64]. Kulkarni et al. [52] used cryo-transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) to visualize how varying the PEG molar ratio affects the lipid structure (Fig. 3D). It is hypothesized that the PEG-lipid is located only at the LNP surface [54], hence raising the mol% of the PEGlipid (surface molecule) leads to a higher surface area:volume ratio and thus decrease in particle size. In these studies, varying the molar ratio of PEG-lipids requires concurrently varying the molar ratio of another lipid. Most studies choose to alter cholesterol content [51,52]. Kulkarni et al. [52] investigated the impact of DSPC and cholesterol mol% on LNP size and observed no significant differences when varying DSPC-cholesterol (1:1 mol) within a 40-60 mol% range [15]. This indicates that the effect of concurrently modifying cholesterol ratios by up to 2 mol%, as in studies focused on changing the molar ratio of PEG, is presumably negligible.\n\nThe lipid tail structure in PEG-lipids also influences LNPs biological activity.

Besides, the insights provided in Section 2.3 are applicable here, given that passive targeting involves preventing protein corona formation.Despite this theoretical basis, the reality is that few studies have established a clear correlation between protein corona formation and biodistribution to the tumor.\n\n107][108][109][110][111][112][113][114][115][116] However, other materials like DMG-PEG 2k or PEG-polymers have gained popularity, especially in the context of siRNA delivery. [117,118]One of the primary factors driving the widespread adoption of DSPE-PEG is its hydrophobic segment, which plays a role in retarding detachment from various NPs, including LNPs. [21]This property contributes to the extended circulation time and enhanced accumulation of these NPs at tumor sites.In fact, in vivo studies intended to investigate the importance of PEG-lipids with alkyl chains of varying lengths (C14, C16, and C18) such as DMG-PEG, DPPE-PEG, and DSPE-PEG, concluded that the lipophilic segment of PEG-lipids not only governs their dissociation rate from siRNA polymer-lipid hybrid NP surface but also exerts tumor accumulation and silencing efficiency (Figure 4).Notably, surface modification with DSPE-PEG exhibited the most extended blood circulation time and the highest levels of tumor accumulation and gene silencing effectiveness. [119]Certainly, PEGylated LNPs, which are extensively used as carriers for RNA, have also been explored for the delivery of mAbs, [111][112][113][114][115][116] although this exploration has mainly centered around liposomes incorporating DSPE-PEG 2k .[116] Instead, a number of pharmacokinetics studies have shown the possibility to correlate the tumor accumulation of PEGylated nanostructures carrying different mAbs with a great antitumor outcome.",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG2000 (C14, dimyristoylglycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG2000 (C18, distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine) [6]. A few hours following parenteral injection, DMG-PEG2000 is dissociated and replaced by a biomolecular corona including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) with specificity for hepatocytes [7,8]. DMG-PEG2000 is therefore optimal for liver targeting, and the development of Onpattro TM is a concrete therapeutic application approved by the FDA. In this context, two short lipids-PEG (C14) were recently used in the Comirnaty \u00ae and Spikevax \u00ae COVID-19 vaccines: ALC-0159 (DTA-PEG2000, ditetradecylacetamide) and DMG-PEG2000, respectively. After an intramuscular injection, LNPs are responsible for a transient local inflammation and the recruitment of neutrophils and antigen-presenting cells [1]. In contrast, longer PEG-derivatives, such as C18 lipids-PEG, display a better anchoring ability in lipid membranes. For example, DSPE-PEG2000 is used to effectively protect LNPs by decreasing interactions with blood proteins, allowing for a prolonged blood circulation time and increased tumor accumulation [3,9]. \n\nIn this context, the objective of this study was to develop an in vitro method to rapidly assess the behavior of LNPs in serum in order to predict their in vivo fate. For this purpose, two LNPs formulations [CSL3 or SM-102 (pH-sensitive lipids)/DSPC/Chol/lipid-PEG in 50/10/37.5/2.5 molar ratio] carrying siRNA were produced. The ionizable lipids were selected based on the promise they show for efficiently delivering nucleic acids.",

            "text": "To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the differences in transfection efficiency observed among LNPs formulated with various types of PEGylated lipids, the nanoparticles were labeled with DiD to study cellular uptake. Confocal microscopy revealed that the cellular uptake of LNPs by HEK293 cells increased with increasing incubation time (Fig. 5A). Specifically, LNPs containing DMG-PEG2k exhibited significantly greater cellular uptake than the other LNPs (Fig. 5A). This increased uptake may be influenced by the acyl chain length of the PEGylated lipids, suggesting that LNPs with longer acyl chains may exhibit reduced cellular uptake efficiency. The importance of acyl chain lengths of PEGylated lipids for the nucleic acid delivery of LNPs has been corroborated by a substantial body of research [2,24]. The acyl chain of DMG-PEG2k is of a shorter length than that of the other two lipids, which contributes to a faster rate of shedding efficiency. Accordingly, the cellular uptake of LNPs formulated with DMG-PEG2k is more efficient, which is in accordance with the results presented in Fig. 5A. Functional groups of PEGylated lipids also affect cellular uptake in HEK293 and DC2.4 cells. Notably, LNPs formulated with DSG-PEG2k demonstrated markedly superior cellular uptake efficiency compared to those formulated with DSPE-PEG2k (Fig. 5B). According to the results above, FBS affect cell transfection efficiency. Subsequent studies, shown in Fig. 5C, investigated the protein corona adsorbed by LNPs containing DMG-PEG2k, DSG-PEG2k, and DSPE-PEG2k in the presence of FBS. The results revealed no significant differences in the type of protein corona formed among these LNPs. The observed variations in cellular uptake between different PEGylated lipids are primarily attributed to the length of the acyl chain and the specific functional groups, factors that appear to be independent of the protein corona composition. These findings highlight the complex interactions between the structural attributes of PEGylated lipids and their functional performance in cellular environments.",

            "text": "administration. The length of lipid chains anchored on the PEG lipid influences how long it stays on liposomes (Parr, Ansell, Choi, & Cullis, 1994), with longer acyl chains showing longer retention times than their shorter counterparts. Recently it has been shown that PEG lipids with short (C 14 ) acyl chains dissociate from LNP-siRNA in vivo with a half-time of approximately 1 h (Mui et al., 2013), whereas PEG lipids with longer (C 18 ) acyl chains exhibit dissociation rates of days or longer. This offers the possibility of employing LNP stabilized by PEG lipids with short acyl chains that rapidly dissociate following i.v. administration, allowing the LNP-siRNA systems to become potent transfection agents. \n\nIn addition to cationic lipids and PEG lipids, LNP formulations of siRNA typically contain other structural lipids. The most commonly used lipids are cholesterol and a saturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) such as distearoyl-PC (DSPC) or dipalmitoyl-PC (DPPC). The reasons as to why these lipids are required are unclear. Cholesterol is included because of historical data for bilayer liposomal systems indicating that liposomes consisting of PC alone accumulate cholesterol from serum components (Rodrigueza, Pritchard, & Hope, 1993); consequently, systems containing approximately equimolar cholesterol are in better equilibrium with their surroundings. The need for DSPC is counter-intuitive as the presence of DSPC would be expected to mitigate against fusion with the endosomal membrane following uptake into target cells due to its strong bilayer-stabilizing properties (Cullis, Hope, & Tilcock, 1986). However, recent data from our group suggested that elimination of DSPC compromises the gene silencing potency of LNP-siRNA systems for reasons yet to be determined (unpublished data). \n\nThere has been extensive work as well to incorporate targeting ligands into LNP systems.",

            "text": "The composition of the protein corona that forms around LNPs upon exposure to biological fluids is a key factor in their organ selectivity and biodistribution [28,35]. Given this well-established relationship, we sought to investigate whether the differences in our extrahepatic lipid library were reflected in distinct protein corona compositions, which could potentially explain their selective accumulation in non-hepatic tissues. With that purpose, we selected and purified the two top-performing ionizable lipids for lung targeting (A1T2C3, also named CP-LC-1067, and A3T2C7, also named CP-LC-1495) and the highestperforming lipid for spleen targeting (A2T2C9, also named CP-LC-1465). As controls, we included MC3-DOTAP and MC3-18:1 PA, well-established SORT formulations known for targeting the lung and spleen, respectively, with previously characterized protein coronas [12]. Additionally, we incorporated liver-targeting LNPs using SM-102 as the ionizable lipid and a control without LNPs. Subsequently, to mimic the in vivo environment, we incubated LNPs with human plasma, allowing the natural formation of a protein corona similar to that occurring in the bloodstream (Figure 4A). After purification and LNP proteincorona isolation, we performed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to identify and quantify the adsorbed proteins. \n\nPharmaceutics 2025, 17, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 potential was identified as a key factor in organ targeting by our ionizable lipid library, we further analyzed its influence on related protein properties such as isoelectric point (pI) and overall charge. We found that in lung-targeting LNPs, the isoelectric point distribution of adsorbed proteins was slightly shifted toward pI ~5.5 compared with liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs (Figure 4C). This may be attributed to their higher zeta potential, which likely influences protein binding. Notably, vitronectin [12], a key mediator of lung uptake, has a pI of ~5.5, suggesting a potential explanation for this enrichment.",

Then, utilization of specific PEG lipids that possess short acyl chains (like ceramide-PEG lipids) may be advantageous to achieving high transfection efficiency because of their ability to gradually diffuse out of the LNPs, leading to the formation of destabilized LNPs that consequently release their nucleic acid contents [91,95]. \n\nThe formation of a bimolecular corona complex may change the surface properties of LNPs, and these changes can be adopted to enhance and/or target delivery of the loaded content [90,96]. It is well-documented that the type and quantity of the individual proteins employed in the formation of bimolecular corona will be determined by the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles as well as their biological activity [90]. LNPs are known to interact with blood proteins (opsonins), such as immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), fibronectin, and a number of complement proteins. These interactions will facilitate recognition and uptake of nanoparticles by the phagocytic cells and, consequently, promote their elimination [97]. PEGylation of LNPs may diminish the recognition of nanoparticles and their rapid removal by phagocytic cells. It was reported that the inclusion of PEGylated lipids lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins and, hence, allow nanoparticles to escape the macrophage system [94]. However, accelerated removal of PEGylated nanoparticles and stronger activation of complement interactions can be encountered upon infusion of these PEGylated nanoparticles in patients having anti-PEG antibodies [94,98].",

In addition to impacting structural properties such as size and stability, different PEG-lipid molar ratios and compositions greatly influence in vivo distribution and degree of cellular interaction, thereby controlling the ability of LNPs and LNP-like particles to sufficiently deliver their nucleic acid cargo inside the cells of interest [49,54,65,67] PEGylation is a widely used method for preventing rapid nanoparticle clearance and increasing in vivo circulation time [49]. For example, in Doxil \u00d2 , which delivers the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (Dox), including PEG-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine (PEG-DSPE) extends circulation time [17]. By increasing circulation time, these well-anchored PEGlipids on the surface of Doxil \u00d2 -liposomes boost Dox accumulation at the tumor site [17] and decrease cardiotoxicity, as compared to free doxorubicin [68,69]. However, the generally high stability and stealth-like properties of PEGylated liposomes limit the cellular interactions that can lead to low cellular uptake and poor endosomal escape [70], an outcome that is counter-productive for nucleic acid delivery. Therefore, while particle stabilization with persistent PEG-lipids is helpful during formation and for extending circulation times, it creates a paradox known as the PEG dilemma [14,51,65,67,71] wherein improved accumulation outside the liver corresponds with reduced particle activity [49].\n\nThe short chained diacyl PEG-lipid PEG-carbamate-1,2dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol (PEG-c-DMG) is introduced in the Onpattro \u00d2 formulation (Fig. 3A) to do 'the exact opposite' to what the PEG-DSPE is facilitating. While PEG-DSPE ensures long circulation [49], PEG-c-DMG tends to desorb from the LNPs upon i.v. administration, to exploit an already established route for specific cellular uptake in the liver.

In vivo, it was then proved that nanoparticles with DMG-PEG anchor have no prolonged circulation time compared with the same particles grafted with C18-PEG, while the latter demonstrated higher stability in serum and tumor accumulation [33,35]. More recently, DMG-PEG 2000 was used in the COVID-19 Spikevax \u00ae vaccine [36], considering that an extended residence time could lead to undesirable inflammation at the injection site [37], and because, despite the lack of information, opsonization of the LNPs could also help to stimulate the immune system by promoting uptake by innate immune cells [38]. The formation of a protein corona around LNPs can therefore be seen either as a limitation or as an opportunity, depending on the application. In this context, the developed NTA method could be used to quickly screen new LNPs formulations and facilitate the rapid translation from in vitro to clinic. Its ease of implementation (low required volumes and materials) and its benefits over traditional methods to separate LNPs bound to proteins from free proteins make of this method an interesting tool. Indeed, separation methods no longer reflect the practical in vivo dynamic equilibrium between the adsorption and desorption of proteins, or the establishment of a soft corona around the high affinity proteins directly grafted around LNPs forming the hard corona [2]. \n\nThe impact of these lipids-PEG and of ionizable lipids on cellular metabolic activity was studied in tumor HeLa and HepG2 cells. In serum-free medium, LNPs induced low or no toxicity. In contrast, when used in the presence of serum, a significant impact of SM-102 LNPs with Cer-, DMG-and DTA-PEG on the metabolic activity of cells was noticed, predominantly in HepG2 cells. Considering the previously mentioned rapid desorption of C14 lipid-PEG in serum, it could be hypothesized that the transfection of cells with SM-102 LNPs lacking PEG could disturb cell metabolic activity.",

            "text": "PEG-lipids contribute to LNP self-assembly via the hydrophilic steric barrier that PEG chains form at the LNP surface [50]. During LNP formation, the PEG chain extends away from the surface of the emerging particle, and sufficient PEG-lipid accumulation per particle prevents heterogenous formulations. The steric PEG barriers also support particle stability by preventing aggregation [49,50,52]. Lokugamage et al. [57] demonstrated that formulations completely lacking PEG-lipids produced unstable, polydisperse LNPs exceeding 200 nm in diameter. Other studies have shown that including as little as 0.5 mol% of PEG-lipid resulted in stable, homogenous LNPs smaller than 80 nm [52]. The stability that PEG provides during formulation also endure long-term. LNPs containing mRNA can be stable for up to 3 weeks at 4\u00b0C in buffer, as quantified by consistent size, PDI, zeta-potential and encapsulation efficiencies during storage [49,58]. The current European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved shelf lives for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are 9 months between \u00c025\u00b0C and \u00c015\u00b0C or 30 days at 2-8\u00b0C for Moderna (Spikevax \u00d2 ) and 9 months between \u00c090\u00b0C and \u00c060\u00b0C or 1 month at 2-8\u00b0C for Pfizer-BioNTech (Comirnaty \u00d2 ) [59]. The different storage requirements may be due to disparate LNP formulations, including excipients and mRNA, or the companies' particular development approaches [60]. Comparatively, Onpattro \u00d2 has a clinical shelf life of 36 months, refrigerated, according to an EMA report [61]. Research has determined that LNPs formulated with different PEG-lipids have similar long-term stability, indicating that different PEG chain compositions can sufficiently provide the steric repulsive forces necessary during particle formation [49]. PEG-lipids also increase stability during subsequent LNP processing. Lokugamage et al. [57] nebulized LNPs for pulmonary delivery and observed that LNPs with high molar ratios of PEG-lipids resulted in higher pulmonary trans",

            "text": "In this study, we investigated the influence of LNP formulations with varying PEG lipids and ionizable lipids on the repeated administration of mRNA-loaded LNPs (mRNA/LNP).Our investigations demonstrated that ionizable lipids exhibited negligible effects on the outcomes of repeated dosages.In contrast, the lipid structure and molar ratio of PEG lipids exerted a substantial influence on the protein expression of mRNA/LNP.It became apparent that PEG molecules linked to LNPs, as opposed to free PEG, played a pivotal role in the generation of anti-PEG IgM antibodies.Within the biological milieu, PEGincorporated LNPs assumed the character of large PEG entities, potentially provoking antibody production.Upon subsequent injections, this phenomenon culminated in a diminution of protein expression by mRNA/LNP.Specifically, successive administrations of firefly luciferase (fLuc) mRNA caused a large decline in luminescent expression within the liver.The assessment of gene editing effects following repeated administrations yielded variations contingent upon the specific PEG lipid used.\n\nNotably, our investigation revealed that an increase in the lipid tail length of the PEG lipid corresponded to a reduction in PEG shedding rates and an escalation in anti-PEG IgM production, ultimately triggering the ABC phenomenon.This observation confirmed previous studies of PEG-NPs [33].Upon exposure to blood, PEG lipid shedding commenced within the LNP, with the process culminating in the spleen.Within the splenic marginal zone, B cells are responsible for the synthesis of antibodies.Consequently, it is suggested that LNPs exhibiting diminished PEG shedding would augment the synthesis of anti-PEG IgM.From this perspective, C14 DMG-PEG 2000, characterized by a shorter lipid tail length, exhibited a higher likelihood of shedding within LNPs compared to C16 PEG 2000 ceramide.\n\nThis study also provided a comparative investigation of the protein expression efficiency exhibited by C16 PEG ceramideincorporated LNPs as opposed to DMG-PEG LNPs during their initial administration.The results revealed that the first administration of C16 PEG ceramide-conjugated LNPs yielded relatively higher protein expression efficiency in comparison to DMG-PEG LNPs.",

Our data show that the lipid composition strongly influences their protein adsorption patterns, affecting their physicochemical properties and ultimately controlling tissue tropism. Lung-targeting LNPs exhibited distinct protein enrichment, including of vitronectin and prothrombin, supporting previously described mechanisms of protein corona-mediated lung selectivity [35]. In contrast, the protein-corona composition of spleen-targeting LNPs lacked a clear correlation with known targeting pathways, suggesting an alternative, but as-yet unidentified, mechanism of action. \n\nIn conclusion, these findings provide a strong foundation for the rational design of LNP systems with enhanced organ-targeting precision, guided by the structure-activity relationships of ionizable lipids and the LNP zeta potential. Understanding the molecular basis of extrahepatic targeting, including the key protein interactions that drive LNP accumulation in extrahepatic tissue, will be critical for optimizing these formulations for clinical use. Future studies should aim to elucidate these mechanisms and to evaluate the full safety profile, stability, and therapeutic potential of these LNPs in clinically relevant models. This approach holds significant promise for improving the specificity and efficacy of mRNA-based therapies, enabling more precise extrahepatic delivery and expanding the therapeutic landscape for a broad range of clinical applications, including in vaccines, cancer immunotherapy, and treatments for genetic and inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "Previous studies have reported that acyl chain length affects the adsorption rate of the protein corona [43]. However, it does not significantly affect the type of protein corona formed, which has not been previously explored. The results in HEK293 cells suggest that LNPs with DMG-PEG2k are primarily internalized via clathrinmediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. In contrast, macropinocytosis, along with phagocytosis and caveolinmediated pathways, are implicated in the uptake of LNPs containing DSG-PEG2k and DSPE-PEG2k. These findings underscore the role of acyl chain length in modulating the cellular uptake mechanisms of LNPs. Acyl chain lengths influence cellular uptake efficiency by affecting endocytic pathways, which has not been reported previously. It is shown that the longer hydrophobic chains of PEGylated lipids in LNPs, the more likely LNPs are to enter cells via the caveolin system. This could serve as a hypothesis for future studies. Moreover, the similar uptake mechanisms observed for LNPs with DSG-PEG2k and DSPE-PEG2k suggest that the specific functional groups of the PEGylated lipids do not significantly influence these processes. Nonetheless, the specific receptors and cellular pathways involved in these mechanisms warrant further investigation to fully understand the interactions at the cellular level. \n\nBased on the findings presented above, the types of PEGylated lipids affect the lysosomal escape of LNPs, primarily depending on the acyl chain length rather than the functional groups of the PEGylated lipids. Specifically, a decrease in lysosomal escape efficiency was observed with the increasing acyl chain length, a trend parallel to that of cellular uptake. Lysosomal escape is as crucial as cellular uptake for transfection among LNPs with various types of PEGylated lipids. Therefore, LNPs with DMG-PEG2k showed superior transfection efficiency over their counterparts. These findings have not been reported previously.",

It was shown that siRNA-LNP systems containing 10 mol % of DSPC exhibit maximum activity for a size of 80 nm, which suggests that to obtain smaller systems with optimized activity, higher levels of DSPC should be incorporated. 181 This was confirmed in both human adipocytes and hepatocytes, where protein expression levels for 130 nm mRNA-LNP systems differed as much as 50-fold depending on lipid compositions with a constant DLin-MC3-DMA/Chol molar ratio. The results suggest that some of these differences may be attributed to changes in surface composition of the particles and the impact this may have on the ability of LNPs to fuse with the endosomal membrane. 180,181 The proportions of different lipid species in optimized RNA-LNP systems may vary according to the particular ionizable cationic lipid employed (see Table 3). This expands considerably the possible lipid composition of an LNP system but mostly challenges researchers to find the optimal combination for a particular application. On-going efforts are put on using advanced approaches such as high-throughput screening methods and computer-assisted drug formulation, as well as implementing digitalization and artificial intelligence for developing personalized nanomedicine.\n\nBiological Interactions: PEG Shedding and the Protein Corona. In biological media, LNP dispersions will interact with the numerous biomolecules present. The exact nature of this interaction and the impact on functional delivery will undoubtedly be complex and systematic studies are needed. It is possible that serum proteins adsorb on to the surface of LNPs which could trigger uptake by surrounding macrophages (e.g., Kuppfer cells) or dendritic cells. The PEGlipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption. This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid",

            "text": "As previously commented, when NPs are exposed to bio-fluids containing proteins, like human serum, a dense layer of proteins eventually adsorb on the NPs surface forming the so-called protein corona [76]. This has a tremendous impact on the NPs stability and their behavior in the biofluids. In fact, the protein corona plays a major role in determining the fate of NPs circulating in blood as well as their macrophage uptake, or even the blockage of their functionalities [31]. Thus, major efforts have been devoted to preventing or diminishing the formation of the protein corona. For instance, Chan and coworkers [77] showed that by increasing the number of PEG molecules (molecular weight of 5 kDa) on the NPs surface the total protein adsorption is nonlinearly reduced. The protein adsorption is predominantly a function of PEG grafting density for PEG structures with molecular weights above ~1 kDa [78,79]. At the highest PEG density tested (1.25 PEG/nm 2 ), protein adsorption of serum was eliminated by 94-99% (relative to citrate-stabilized Au NPs). Importantly, the density of the PEG grafting, together with the NP size, also plays a key role in determining the specific composition of the protein corona, by reducing the adsorption of various proteins in serum to different extents. Moreover, it was reported that the PEG density also defines the mechanism and efficiency of the subsequent macrophage uptake. Below ~0.16 PEG/nm 2 , macrophage uptake depends on the presence of adsorbed serum proteins (serum-dependent uptake) meanwhile, above ~0.64 PEG/nm 2 , adsorbed proteins does not affect the macrophage uptake (serum independent uptake), see Figure 5    As the PEG density increases, fewer proteins are adsorbed. The lower panel shows that at low PEG densities, macrophage uptake is efficient and serum-dependent. At high PEG densities, macrophage uptake is driven predominantly by a less efficient serum-independent mechanism. Reproduced from [77] with permission.",

[16] Conventional LNPs are taken up following desorption of PEG-lipid and adsorption of serum proteins. [17] Specifically, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) adsorption facilitates uptake via the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor. [18] Both phospholipids and cholesterol influence the structure and fluidity of the lipid bilayer on the LNP surface, which impacts serum protein adsorption. [19] Here, we chose to vary the phospholipid used in F X NPs as it is known to impact cellular uptake of LNPs [16] and there are a diverse range of phospholipids commercially available. Specifically, we selected ten phospholipids with varied acyl chain lengths (12, 14, 16, 18, or 20 carbons), degree of lipid tail saturation (fully saturated or monounsaturated), and identity of the polar head group (choline, ethanolamine, or serine). A list of phospholipids with chemical structures is included in Table S2 (Supporting Information). F 7d NPs were used as a model because 7d has an intermediate pK a value among the fulvestrant analogs and demonstrated the greatest endocytosis-dependent endosomal disruption.

            "text": "LNPs are usually formulated by the solvent dilution method, in which lipid components are first dissolved in a water-miscible solvent (typically ethanol) and then diluted by an acidic buffer (pH 3-4) containing nucleic acids (Wang et al. 2023c). The tertiary amines of ionizable lipids are protonated in acidic conditions, which enables the encapsulation of negatively charged nucleic acids by electrostatic interactions (Ferhan et al. 2022). Spontaneously, lipid molecules aggregate to bury their hydrophobic lipid tails in the interior and expose their hydrophilic segments to the surface of the formed small particles (Eygeris et al. 2022). Next, the buffer exchange is performed to replace acidic buffers with physiological buffers (pH 7.4). The neutralization of ionizable lipids drives the fusion of small particles to form larger particles, and the further fusion process is inhibited by the phase separation of PEG-lipids (Kulkarni et al. 2018). It was reported that PEG-lipids and phospholipids together formed the surface layer of LNPs, and ionizable lipids would also be incorporated if LNPs did not contain sufficient phospholipids to cover the exterior monolayer (Kulkarni et al. 2018). In addition, PEG also induces the formation of the hydrated layer of LNPs in solution, which further prevents LNPs from aggregation and provides colloidal stability (Cui et al. 2022). Besides, the apparent aciddissociation constant (pKa) of the formed LNPs is below seven, which provides a nearly neutral surface charge under physiological pH conditions (Carrasco et al. 2021). \n\nA sheddable PEG-lipid, typically PEGylated dimyristoyl lipid, is frequently used in the aforementioned process. Upon systemic administration, the shedding of PEG-lipids breaks the equilibrium of surface lipid compositions, which promotes the adsorption of serum proteins to the surface of LNPs (Dilliard et al. 2021).",

            "text": "PEGylated lipids, or PEG-lipids, represent important components that are usually located on the surface of the LNPs. PEG-lipids consist of a hydrophilic molecule of PEG conjugated to a hydrophobic alkyl (or lipid) chain, where the PEG domain is attached to the LNP surface while the alkyl chain is attached to the LNP bilayer. The incorporation of PEGylated lipids in LNPs is known to extend the circulation time of LNPs due to their steric barrier effect. This property reduces binding of LNPs to plasma proteins (opsonins), reduces rapid elimination by the reticuloendothelial system, and consequently, assists in the accumulation of the nanoparticles at disease sites [25,49]. In addition, the steric barrier properties of PEGylated lipids may prevent fusion or aggregation of nanoparticles during manufacturing, and this would result in a homogenous formulation with a small particle size (50-100 nm) and narrow polydispersity index [25]. \n\nThe amount of PEGylated lipids incorporated in LNPs should be controlled carefully and kept to a minimum. Having higher PEG contents usually increases the residence time of LNPs in the blood circulation but may prevent their fusion with the endosomal bilayer and hinder the intracellular delivery of nucleic acids [68,69]. Therefore, a reduction in PEG content from 10% to about 1.5% (along with increasing the ionizable lipids to 57%) produced a marked improvement in the potency of mRNA-based LNPs as reported by Semple et al. [64]. Moreover, monitoring the size of PEG-lipids attached to the LNPs can be used to control the rate at which the PEG-lipids diffuse away from the nanoparticles and affect the residence time in blood circulation. Larger lipid anchors are usually used in formulating liposomes that circulate for longer duration in the blood to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs [70]. On the other hand, smaller lipid anchors are used in developing LNPs that favor shorter residence times to deliver siRNA to hepatocytes [71].",

            "text": "It is well-known that the interaction of drug nanocarriers with serum proteins can alter the pharmacokinetics of the nanovehicles either affecting the cellular uptake or the clearance of the particles by the immune system (Pearson et al., 2014). SPR has been applied to study the interplay between NPs and isolated serum proteins in order to optimize LNP's formulation design (Table 1). SPR has contributed to study fibrinogen, human serum albumin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor adsorption onto both neutral and negatively charged PEG-decorated liposomes (Efremova et al., 2000). Interestingly, the observed reduction in protein adsorption as PEG densities in the nanovehicles increases agreed with theoretical predictions. These results suggest that SPR studies could contribute to establish the physical basis of the different interactions of LNPs with proteins and cells. Moreover, particular proteins of the NPs' corona were identified by means of SPR experiments on LNPs preincubated with serum (Canovi et al., 2012) and the real-time protein corona formation was followed on surface-immobilized NPs (Kari et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Coating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach. Increased circulation times and brain accumulation are reported for PEG-coated NPs prepared from polycyanoacrylate [173][174][175], poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) [176,177], polystyrene [176], and other polymers [178], which is associated with the decreased formation of protein corona and evasion of the MPS. PEG density regulates corona formation and, consequently, particle clearance, of which the threshold for rapid clearance is indicated as 20 PEG chains per 100 nm 2 for PLGA-PG nanoparticles, largely independent of particle size (diameters of 55, 90, and 140 nm) [177]. No distinguishable difference regarding the composition of the protein corona was observed, although Apo E amounts decrease with increasing PEG density. Moreover, 100 nm diameter polystyrene NPs coated with nine PEG chains per 100 nm 2 showed good diffusion in rat brain tissue ex vivo, as determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis, as compared with particles with lower densities. Even below the PEG density threshold reported by Bertrand et al., brain diffusion appears to benefit from increased PEG density, which may be attributed to the higher quantity of Apo E in the protein corona and reduced adhesiveness [176,177]. Other surface modification methods to control protein corona formation are surface charge and hydrophobicity modulation [179][180][181]. \n\nParticles' mechanical properties also result in different protein corona profiles, which may affect uptake, toxicity, transport across the BBB, and brain accumulation [44,48,182,183]. Protein adsorption is lower for softer particles, which ultimately leads to a reduced impact of corona-related particle-cell interactions [183,184]. \n\nTargeting capabilities of ligand-decorated NPs are likewise also affected by the presence of a protein corona [75]. Corona formation and the effects on targeting have been evaluated for PEGylated polystyrene NPs functionalized with Tf [74].",

            "text": "Cer-PEG formulations showed intermediate results for both size and concentration changes over time. The asymmetric structure composed of C8 and C16 acyl chains was identified by the developed method as an intermediate anchor between C18 and C14 lipids-PEG. Indeed, it has already been described that Cer-PEG with short acyl chains (such as C8 chain) exhibits weak anchoring properties when compared with longer acyl chains (as C20 or C24 chain) [30]. In this study, extreme changes in physicochemical properties were observed, and the important increase in the mean size combined with the drastic decrease in concentration for C14 lipids-PEG LNPs can be explained due to the extreme operating conditions that were used to highlight the different LNPs behaviors (33.33% v/v FBS). \n\nThis method was developed using the NTA in order to highlight the dissociation of lipid-PEG in biological fluids. Indeed, DSPE-PEG 2000 is historically used to increase particles' lifetime and tumor accumulation [7,[31][32][33] due to two parameters. An intermediary PEG chain length (2000 g/mol) provides effective protection against proteins' adsorption while avoiding a strong decrease in particles cellular uptake or endosomal escape processes [3,4]. Next, the C18 DSPE chain provides an effective anchoring of the PEG into the LNPs, allowing the PEG segment to have a prolonged protection effect with an increased LNPs circulation time. Nevertheless, shorter lipids-PEG have other applications. DMG-PEG has recently been incorporated into the Onpattro \u00ae formulation due to its shorter lipid chain anchor, which is rapidly dissociated from the lipid membrane [6,31,33]. When dissociated from their PEG, LNPs can interact with blood proteins, including ApoE proteins, for delivery to the hepatocytes. The use of short lipids-PEG able to quickly dissociate is therefore one of the preferred options to target the liver [34].",

            "text": "When NPs enter the bloodstream, some biomolecules interact with the LNP surface, resulting in their encapsulation and leading to the formation of a corona. This corona is commonly known as protein corona (PC) due to the predominant presence of plasma proteins [38]. The PC formation is a spontaneous process that occurs rapidly thanks to noncovalent interactions between proteins and the LNP surface [119]. \n\nThe presence of PC influences many properties of LNPs such as surface charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, stability, targeting ability, aggregation phenomena, toxicity, and efficacy, and, when RNA or DNA are loaded in LNPs, the PC affected also their transfection efficiency [120,121]. Data published on PC-coated LNPs seem to conflict with each other; in fact, many researchers observed a reduction in the targeting ability of nanoparticles after the PC formation [122], an increase in LNP aggregation, a decrease in LNP stability, and the leakage of fluorophores used for LNP tracking in vivo [123] (Figure 6), while other researchers suggested that the PC formation could be favorable to obtain a specific LNP targeting [1]. \n\nThe PC composition is principally affected by the physico-chemical properties and the biological environment of LNPs; it is also important to underline that the administration of the same LNP formulation to different patients could result in a different interaction of LNP-PC, specific for everyone (depending, as example, on pathological conditions, gender, age, and administration site) [124,125]. The study of the PC seems to be important to obtain a better LNP formulation able to induce the desirable pharmacological effect on each patient [126]. \n\nMany studies demonstrated that a careful selection of the technique (or techniques) used to separate LNPs and PC components is one of the key factors in obtaining realistic results. In particular, LNPs resulted in low-dense soft materials that are hardly separable from the serum nanomaterials, including exosomes and HDL [123,127,128].",

            "text": "Despite constituting the smallest molar percentage of lipids in LNPs, typically around 1.5 mol%, PEG-lipids exert a substantial impact on the critical properties of LNPs. Specifically, they localize on the surface of lipid particles and maintain the spatial stability of the delivery system. Furthermore, the presence of PEG chains prevents LNP aggregation, serum protein adsorption, and uptake by the mononuclear phagocytic system in vivo, thereby prolonging the circulating half-life of LNPs in the bloodstream [54,55]. Alternatively, extended circulation times lead to a higher number of nanoparticles interacting with the blood-brain barrier. Importantly, the size of LNPs must be carefully controlled during preparation, as it plays a pivotal role in determining their pharmacokinetics, delivery efficiency, and transfection efficacy. Studies have shown that increasing the molar ratio of PEG-lipids results in significantly smaller LNPs, independent of other lipid components [56,57]. These findings underscore the importance of optimizing the PEG-lipid ratio to achieve the desired size and functionality of LNPs. Moreover, beyond their influence on structural properties such as size and stability, variations in the molar ratio and composition of PEG-lipids also markedly affect the biodistribution and cellular interaction of LNPs, which are critical in determining the efficiency of cargo delivery to target cells [58]. PEGylated polymeric nanocarriers were developed by Nance and colleagues for the targeted delivery of the anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) to brain tissues. They demonstrated that PEGylation significantly enhanced the brain-targeting ability of the nanocarriers, improving PTX delivery to brain regions compared to uncoated polymeric nanocarriers [59]. Therefore, the careful optimization of these parameters is essential to create a balanced LNP structure that maximizes the therapeutic potential of PEGylated lipids. In conclusion, PEGylated lipids serve a crucial role in enhancing the stability, tissue penetration, and targeting efficiency of LNPs as drug delivery systems. These advancements in PEGylation strategies offer significant potential for developing precise and efficient delivery platforms.",

            "text": "Each of these components has a specific role within the formulation. There is limited information about the role of phospholipids (commonly DSPC) and cholesterol in the activity of LNPs [30]. However, it has been reported that both DSPC and cholesterol, promote stability, contributing to the structural integrity of the formulation [31]. In addition to this, DSPC increases membrane rigidity and decreases membrane permeability due to its high transition temperature (55 \u2022 C). Some studies have reported that cholesterol-free or cholesterol-deficient LNPs might have possible destabilisation effects which might result in decreased LNP potency [32,33]. These lipids aid in the encapsulation of the nucleic acids. PEG-lipid plays several roles. It is located on the surface of the LNPs and it dictates the particle size of the LNPs during manufacture [16]. Production of LNPs in acidic pH without PEG-lipid would promote particle fusion [9]. In addition to this, they increase product shelf-life and in vivo circulation lifetime [34]. Finally, the role of the ionisable or cationic lipid is to both promote electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged nucleic acids and promote intracellular delivery. Moreover, ionisable lipids facilitate endosomal escape through fusion with the endosome membrane as a result of the cationic charge under endosomal pH [35]. \n\nWe further explored the effect of replacing the phospholipid or the PEG-lipid into the particle size of the LNPs. No impact on the physicochemical characteristics of the DOTAP-cLNPs was observed (Figure 5). It has been reported elsewhere that the type of phospholipid selected for formulation within the LNPs influences the LNP potency [18]. Regarding the choice of PEG-lipid, short hydrocarbon chains (C14 -DMG-PEG2000) that diffuse out of the LNPs enhance intracellular delivery [34,36,37]. However, C18 chains (DSPE-PEG2000), do not dissociate as easily, contributing to an extended circulation lifetime [38].",

            "text": "Despite their clinical successes, our understanding of how and which biological components in complex biofluids, including blood, LNPs interact with, and the impact of such interactions on the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of LNP-based therapeutic products are still sparse and almost entirely limited to interactions with apolipoprotein E (apoE). To fully exploit the potential of LNPs for the delivery of nucleic acid-based therapies across various indications, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which LNPs interact with the biochemical environment they are intended to function in is necessary. \n\nThe study of proteins adsorbed to NPs during circulation, also referred to as the protein corona, has been a hot topic for many years in the drug delivery field. However, protein corona studies are very challenging, particularly when studying lipid-based NPs such as liposomes and LNPs. This is partly due to: (i) the coexistence of compositional, mass density, and size-similar endogenous NPs in blood plasma, including high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), chylomicrons, and EVs complicating selective purification of exogenous lipid-based NPs from plasma 2 ; and (ii) inherent limitations in tools used for NP characterization. These limitations are put into context below by discussing some of the key findings presented by Liu et al. \n\nTo validate that their PEG affinity-based LNP isolation method avoids contamination by lipoproteins, EVs and other plasma components, Liu et al. analyzed pull-down fractions from rat blood plasma samples which were incubated with either pegylated LNPs or pure PEGlipids (non-LNP control) with dot blots based on PEG-antibody staining (Fig. 1a) 1 . LNPs isolated from plasma from either an obese (OP) or lean (LP) rat model with the pull-down method exhibit strong PEG-antibody signals, while pull-down fractions from the non-LNP control only show faint signals.",

            "text": "The most common PEG-lipids employed in the current generation of siRNA LNPs contain two saturated, dimyristyl chains (PEG-C14). 7 We have shown in vitro that PEG-C14 transfers from LNPs to lipoproteins at a rate of ~50%/hour in mouse plasma at an LNP-to-plasma ratio equivalent to administering LNPs in vivo at a total lipid dose of 20 mg/kg, which is sevenfold higher than the dose employed here (manuscript in preparation). In vivo, a gradual increase in the 3 H/ 14 C ratio measured in whole blood and plasma occurs over the first hour indicating that 14 C-MC3-labeled LNPs are leaving the circulation faster (80% cleared in the first hour, Figure 3a), than 3 H-PEG-C14. These data are consistent with 3 H-PEG-C14 transferring to lipoproteins, which remain in circulation longer than LNPs, resulting in an increase in 3 H/ 14 C ratio. Specific loss of 3 H-PEG-lipid from LNPs becomes more apparent when plasma, isolated from blood drawn at each time point, is separated from lipoproteins by size exclusion chromatography enabling the 3 H/ 14 C ratio of the recovered LNPs to be measured directly (Figure 3a). The ratio decreases rapidly, with ~80% of the initial 3 H-PEG-C14 leaving LNPs within 2 hours. \n\nThe hydrophobic interactions responsible for associating PEG-lipids with LNP membranes are proportional to their alkyl chain length. 14,15 Therefore, PEG-C16 and PEG-C18 lipids should remain associated with LNPs in vivo longer than PEG-C14, as more energy is required for the longer chains to leave the membrane. Analysis of LNPs containing these lipids confirms this, with desorption estimated at 45, 1.3, and 0.2%/hour for C14, C16, and C18 PEG-lipids, respectively (Figure 3b).",

[90]enerally, the mere presence of a certain lipid does not reliably predict enrichment of the theoretically associated serum protein, given that its surface display is a prerequisite.This adds complexity to the translation of findings across different NPs, since not only the components but also their ratios affect their struc-tural organization, [91] and consequently, the corona formation of these particles.Thus, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between NP structure and corona composition is essential.Expanding on this, the presence of certain proteins within the corona does not imply a functional role.Indeed, protein binding to NPs can cause structural alterations of said proteins, rendering them biologically inactive. [92]While it is exceedingly challenging to predict how the protein corona might alter the NPs fate, incremental progress in understanding presents opportunities for novel therapeutic and diagnostic avenues.\n\nThus far, endogenous targeting has proven effective in directing NPs to the liver, spleen, and lungs.To extend the application of this strategy toward additional tissues, further investigations connecting protein corona composition and biodistribution are required.",

            "text": "PEG lipid consists of a hydrophilic PEG polymer conjugated to a lipid. Interestingly, PEGylated lipids are usually included in mRNA-LNPs at lower molar ratios than other components of the formulation. PEG lipids are key factors in controlling particle size so that, by increasing the ratio of a PEG lipid in the LNP formulation, they increase the compression in the lipid bilayer and the repulsive forces between the particles that can produce smaller particles. PEGylated phospholipids are present on the surface, which increases the hydrophilicity of the compound. This component prevents rapid clearance by the immune system and increases stability by preventing the accumulation of particles [22,61,68]. They also prevent nonspecific binding to proteins (opsonins) and are eliminated by the reticuloendothelial system in the body. PEG lipids and some PEG modifications extend the circulation time of nanoparticles by reducing the clearance by the kidneys and the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). PEG lipids are used to conjugate specific ligands to the particle for targeted delivery [36,44,60]. \n\nIt should be noted that the optimization of the PEG lipid component density and chain length is very important for the effective development of mRNA-LNP systems. By adjusting the molecular weight of PEG and the length of the lipid anchor, the efficiency, circulation time, and absorption of immune cells can be changed, depending on the application. This is because the presence of a hydrophilic layer around LNPs can interfere with cell uptake, limiting endosome instability and thus reducing transfection power. There is a PEG dilemma in that, although faster separation of PEG lipid from the LNP surface reduces particle circulation time, it can increase its synthesis and allow the LNP to deliver its charge more efficiently to target cells, which can adversely affect transmission efficiency [59,63,69]. \n\nThe amount of coating on lipid nanoparticles should be appropriate because if this amount is more than necessary, it reduces the rate of cell uptake and interaction with the endosomal membrane, and more PEG lipids increase the circulation time of lipid nanoparticles.",

            "text": "Spleen B cells create PEG antibodies when PEG is bound to the surface of LNPs. Anti-PEG IgE and IgM may be responsible for the side effects caused by mRNA-LNP therapeutics. Furthermore, allergic reactions may result from anaphylatoxins produced by the ABC phenomenon that IgM intiates. Regulating the process of the ABC phenomenon is crucial to avoid this process. One strategy is to change the length of the PEG lipid. If the hydrophobic alkyl chain of the lipid is shortened, the PEG lipid can easily separate from the LNP surface 92 . The recognition of PEG attached to liposomes in vivo can lead to the production of antibodies against PEG. One study compared the results of using each LNP on 1,2-dimyristoylrac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (DMG-PEG) and 1,2-distearoyl-rac-glycero-3-methylpolyoxyethylene (DSG-PEG) with 14 and 18 carbon chain lengths, respectively 81 . The ability to produce serum anti-PEG IgM was higher in DSG-PEG LNPs than in DMG-PEG LNPs. The occurrence of complement reactions was also compared in this study. LNPs entered Kupffer cells more quickly when DSG-PEG LNPs were delivered than when DMG-PEG LNPs were delivered, indicating that complement was activated by elevated anti-PEG IgM concentrations. \n\nThe molecular weight of PEG is another factor that impacts the production of antibodies against PEG lipids. The PEG content/ density on the surface of nanomaterials is one of the most important elements that influences anti-PEG IgM responses because PEG is categorized as an epitope in basic immunology. The half-life increases with PEG molecular weight on the surface of lipid nanoparticles 93,94 . This enhancement of circulation time enriched the concentration of anti-PEG IgM. If the molecular weight of PEG escalates, more antibody against PEG is formed 95 . \n\nTo avoid the unforeseen results that PEG can cause, several scientists are exploring PEG substitutes.",

            "text": "To systematically study the LNPs and their newly formed corona, the unbound proteins must be separated after their in vivo administration or in vitro incubation with blood, plasma, or serum. However, a precise characterization of the BMC of soft nanomaterials, such as LNPs has proven difficult as the size and density of LNPs are similar to \"natural\" serum nanoparticles, for instance, chylomicrons, HDL, exosomes, and many more (19). \n\nCommon separation techniques such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or (ultra)centrifugation are based on, respectively, size or density, and therefore they can work well for the study of bigger or dense NPs (23) but do not allow an effective separation of LNP (30 to 100 nm) from lipoproteins and related nanostructures (7 to 80 nm) present in biological media (19). In addition, as a high g-force is commonly required in (ultra)centrifugation, proteins and LNP can aggregate and induce artifacts resulting in difficulty differentiating between unbound vs. adsorbed proteins. The lack of effective and high-throughput separation techniques for soft nanomaterials has led to alternative procedures such as cross-linking proteins on the LNP surface (24,25). This effectively removes the presence of unbounded proteins but potentially disrupts the proteins present on an intact LNP surface. Furthermore, a photoaffinity lipid probe is required in the LNP formulation which can also alter the BMC formation and profile due to deviations from clinically relevant lipid compositions. In some cases, affinity assays have been used for isolating the corona of PEGylated nanomedicines (26). However, since many affinity-based assays rely on ligand binding to the polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid, LNPs that contains diffusible PEG that are engineered to shed from the particle surface (i.e., Onpattro) may not be suitable for this method. \n\nIn this work, we demonstrate a magnetic separation (MS) technique that enables the study of LNP's BMC in a manner that is independent of their surface properties.",

[129] demonstrated that only 40% of total protein content was in common between in vitro and in vivo coronas and the in vitro PC resulted in being enriched in higher molecular weight with respect to the in vivo PC. Scientific evidence also demonstrated that in vivo formed LNP-PC presented higher heterogeneity and less amount of complement proteins, which could probably be correlated with a prolonged LNP blood circulation after the administration [129,132]. The in vivo formed PC showed a lower amount of coagulation proteins that are directly involved in the activation of immune system cells by Toll-like receptors; overall, less enrichment in complement and coagulation protein could reduce the particle uptake by immune cells increasing the circulating time [129]. In vivo, PC resulted in being enriched in lipoproteins with respect to the in vitro counterpart, while neither of the two PCs were enriched in immunoglobulins. \n\nMuch data on PC composition are published and it is possible to conclude that LC-MS/MS analyses resulted in faster, cleaner, and simpler measurements to obtain information from complex biological samples but the critical aspect is the nature of considered PC; only a few data are reported on in vivo formed LNP-PC and further research will be needed to understand the effect of many factors, such as the administration route, the LNPs' compositions, and the presence of any pathologies, on PC composition, and consequently, on the fate of LNPs once administered.",

In this sense, a more rapid dissociation of PEG-lipid from the LNP surface, though decreasing the circulation time of the particle, can increase its fusogenicity, allowing the LNP to more effectively deliver its cargo to target cells. This is known as the \"PEG dilemma\": improved pharmacokinetics of the LNP system mediated by PEG, at the cost of cellular uptake and a consequently reduced transfection efficiency [ 167 ]. Increasing the PEG content additionally affects particle size, and might therefore have a detrimental effect on the amount of nucleic acid that can be encapsulated and the transfection efficiency, which is especially relevant for pDNA. Optimizing the density and the chain length of the PEG-lipid component is therefore crucial for effective development of mRNA-LNP systems. 'Diffusible' PEG-lipid was developed to balance the transfection potency and stability of LNP systems. This consists of C14 acyl chain lipids which dissociate rapidly from the LNP surface after administration into blood circulation, allowing particle uptake by cells [ 163 , 170 ]. The use of diffusible PEG-lipid in siRNA-LNPs has shown enhanced accumulation and gene silencing in hepatocytes, through facilitating apolipoprotein E (ApoE) adsorption to the particle surface followed by rapid uptake via ApoE-dependent low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) [ 171 , 172 ].\n\nIn order to target extrahepatic tissues for vaccination purposes, incorporation of 'persistent' PEG-lipids, i.e. composed of C18 acyl chains rather than C14, can be more favorable to prevent premature clearance of LNPs. Formulations incorporating C18 PEG-lipids at molar ratios of more than 1.5% lead to increased LNP circulation time, consequently enhancing the accumulation of the LNP system at target tissues without loss of transfection potency [ 172 ]. However, a key challenge related to the longer half-life of formulations with persistent or long-chain PEG-lipid is the potential for accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon,",

            "text": "In the past few decades, it has been well shown that the protein corona formation on nanoparticles' surfaces influences their in vivo fate and may significantly interfere with the targeting yields, biodistribution, and cell internalization of nano-delivery systems [33,34]. Additionally, many research studies have confirmed that PC formation and evolution generally depend on nanoparticle properties, such as: size, surface charge, morphology, hydrophobicity, and the presence of ligands [35]. Therefore, it was important to obtain relevant information regarding the interactions between the prepared nano-carriers and human plasma proteins, in order to predict the process of PC formation in vivo. For this purpose, samples containing PEG (NLPEG and NLCPEG), nano-carriers covered with POL (NLPOL and NLCPOL), and formulations with no PEG or POL in the content (NL0 and NLC0) were prepared and incubated for 1 h in human plasma from healthy volunteers. The results from the protein adsorption studies are given in Table 2. From the results presented in Table 2, it can be concluded that the formulations prepared with no stealth polymer on their surface tended to have a significantly higher % of plasma protein adsorption (p = 0.0031 and p = 0.0290 for NL and NLC, respectively; p < 0.05; ANOVA) compared to the formulations containing PEG (NLPEG and NLCPEG) or POL (NLPOL and NLCPOL). The obtained results were expected, since PEGylation has been a traditionally used method for reducing the interaction of nanoparticles with plasma proteins [21,36]. Similar to PEG, the hydrophilic blocks of POL on the hydrophobic surfaces of lipid nanoparticles are capable of forming a hydrophilic barrier for protein adsorption, resulting in reduced mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) uptake and thus achieving a prolonged blood circulation time [20,[37][38][39].\n\nOn the other hand, it was revealed that there were no statistically significant differences between the percentage of the adsorbed plasma proteins onto the formulations covered with PEG (p = 0.1448; p < 0.05; t-test) and POL (",

Alternatively, PS contains a negatively charged phosphate group attached to the serine group, giving it an overall negative charge, mainly due to the low (2.2-3.6) pKa of the carboxyl group within the serine [42]. More recently, there is increased research interest in formulations of lipid-drug (or photosensitizer) conjugates to improve the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic index of liposomal therapeutics [43][44][45][46][47]. Similarly, the incorporation of PEG, a polymeric steric stabilizer, is widely used to increase the blood circulation time of liposomal formulations [48,49]. The addition of PEG into liposomal doxorubicin extended the terminal half-life from 16.4 h to 77 h in patients with metastatic breast cancer [50,51]. Once liposomes enter the bloodstream, plasma proteins interact with and adsorb onto the liposome surface. It has been previously shown that the liposomal surface chemistry (e.g., charge and pegylation) impacts the blood protein adsorption (known as the \"protein corona\"), which influences how liposomes interact with healthy and diseased cells [52][53][54]. Protein adsorption occurs due to an advantageous increase in entropy, resulting in a decrease in Gibbs free energy (\u2206G abs ) [55]. A comprehensive study by Hadjidemetriou et al. examined the in vitro and in vivo protein corona formation on three different types of liposomes, including pegylated liposomes, non-pegylated liposomes, and monoclonal antibody-conjugated liposomes [56]. In this study, pegylated liposomes had the lowest protein adsorption at~10,000 \u00b5g protein/\u00b5M lipid, while non-pegylated liposomes had double the amount of protein adsorption. However, all liposomes had relatively consistent protein corona compositions, with the most abundant bound proteins being apolipoproteins, immunoglobulins, and complement proteins.\n\nWhile the topic of nanoparticle-protein adsorption is",

            "text": "The recent emergence of COVID-19 vaccines composed of Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) and mRNA has highlighted the wide range of diseases that could be treated with lipid nanovectors. LNPs traditionally include nucleic acids (mRNA, siRNA) and four types of lipids: an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, a phospholipid, and a lipid bound to poly(ethylene glycol) (lipid-PEG) [1]. The lipid-PEG is known to play a major role in the outcome of vectors, and it should be selected according to the application. Indeed, both the lipid and the PEG portions have an important impact on the in vivo behavior of the LNPs. While the use of PEG is important in order to confer steric stability and increase the elimination half-time of particles, the type of lipid associated with the PEG can therefore have a significant impact on its in vivo behavior. It is indeed largely described that one of the most important limitation between in vivo and in vitro translation is the important changes to LNPs' identities when they reach biological fluids [2]. Regarding the PEG chain, an intermediate length-such as molecular weight of 2000 g/mol, i.e., ~45 repetition units (PEG 2000 )-is commonly used, as this provides a good compromise between increased elimination half-time and efficient gene delivery. Short PEGs (PEG 1000 or shorter) do not prevent protein corona formation and fail to increase the particles' blood circulation time, whereas long PEGs (PEG 5000 or longer) can strongly interfere with the cellular uptake or the endosomal escape process [3][4][5]. Moreover, the lipid anchoring the PEG also demonstrated a significant impact on nanovector's outcome. Previous studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG 2000 (C14, dimyristoyl-glycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG 2000 (C18, distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine) [6].",

            "text": "As previously commented, when NPs are exposed to bio-fluids containing proteins, like human serum, a dense layer of proteins eventually adsorb on the NPs surface forming the so-called protein corona [76]. This has a tremendous impact on the NPs stability and their behavior in the biofluids. In fact, the protein corona plays a major role in determining the fate of NPs circulating in blood as well as their macrophage uptake, or even the blockage of their functionalities [31]. Thus, major efforts have been devoted to preventing or diminishing the formation of the protein corona. For instance, Chan and coworkers [77] showed that by increasing the number of PEG molecules (molecular weight of 5 kDa) on the NPs surface the total protein adsorption is nonlinearly reduced. The protein adsorption is predominantly a function of PEG grafting density for PEG structures with molecular weights above ~1 kDa [78,79]. At the highest PEG density tested (1.25 PEG/nm 2 ), protein adsorption of serum was eliminated by 94-99% (relative to citrate-stabilized Au NPs). Importantly, the density of the PEG grafting, together with the NP size, also plays a key role in determining the specific composition of the protein corona, by reducing the adsorption of various proteins in serum to different extents. Moreover, it was reported that the PEG density also defines the mechanism and efficiency of the subsequent macrophage uptake. Below ~0.16 PEG/nm 2 , macrophage uptake depends on the presence of adsorbed serum proteins (serum-dependent uptake) meanwhile, above ~0.64 PEG/nm 2 , adsorbed proteins does not affect the macrophage uptake (serum independent uptake), see Figure 5 [77]. \n\nMaterials 2018, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 27",

            "text": "The introduction of PEG into lipid composition allows for selfassembly of LNPs and reduces nanoparticle aggregation and heterogeneity owing to steric stabilization. Furthermore, PEG improves the stability and durability of LNPs because of the formation of a shell that stabilizes the membrane (Hald et al., 2022). The downside of PEG addition is that an overly stable membrane prevents LNPs from fusing with an endosome, and hence the mRNA is unable to enter the cell. Some articles (Gueguen et al., 2024;Ryals et al., 2020;Lam et al., 2023) suggest that reducing the percentage content of a PEGylated lipid improves the expression of a target protein in animals. By varying the molar percentage and molar mass of PEG, an investigator can control the size and size distribution of the resultant nanoparticles. In one study (Sarode et al., 2022), a series of PEGylated lipids was investigated that differed in length (550-2000 Da) and architecture (linear or branched) of the polymer chain and in the nature of the lipid moiety (phosphoglyceride, diglyceride, or ceramide). Those authors revealed that LNPs containing a PEGylated lipid based on phosphoglycerides are characterized by a pronounced dependence of particle size on the molar proportion and molecular weight of PEG in contrast to lipids based on diglycerides and ceramides. Among particles with a high content of a long-chain PEGylated lipid, the size distribution was broad, which those authors attributed to the formation of a subpopulation of PEGylated lipid micelles. There was no obvious impact of the lipid moiety on the size of the LNPs. \n\nOf note, the use of LNP therapeutics containing a PEGylated lipid can cause unwanted immune responses in the body (Tenchov et al., 2021;Shiraishi and Yokoyama, 2019). In particular, the emergence of accelerated blood clearance has been documented. In the blood, anti-PEG antibodies appear that quickly remove the administered PEGylated nanoparticles.",

            "text": "As another important LNP component, PEGylated lipids have multiple roles in reducing the interaction of LNPs with serum proteins as well as in reducing the aggregation or fusion of LNPs and increasing the circulation time and stability of LNPs in vivo. Consisting of two structural domains (a hydrophilic PEG polymer bound to a hydrophobic lipid anchor), PEGylated lipids are located on the surface of lipid particles with the lipid structural domains buried deep within the particles and the PEG structural domains extending from the surface. They have been applied in the liposome system to prolong the circulation time because PEG polymers represent a spatial barrier that prevents the binding of plasma proteins that would otherwise lead to their rapid clearance by the RES. Due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, the longer the particles circulate in the bloodstream, the more likely they are to accumulate at disease sites such as solid tumors [108,109]. The content of PEGylated lipids is typically 0.5-5%, with DMG-PEG2000 in both the Moderna new crown mRNA vaccine and DMG-C-PEG2000 in the SiRNA drug Onpattro\u2122 at 1.5% and ALC-0159 in both the Pfizer-BioNTech new crown mRNA vaccines at 1.6%. \n\nTherefore, different PEGylated lipids control the circulation time of LNPs in vivo and influence the interaction of LNPs with cells. The choice of the PEGylated lipid depends primarily on the therapeutic target, the target organ, and the route of administration; the molar ratio and length of the hydrophobic chain portion of the PEGylated lipid must also be considered.",

            "text": "The colloidal stability of mRNA-LNPs is another critical factor that should be monitored carefully to ensure efficacy of the administered formulation. It is well-known that mRNA nanoparticles may interact with the different bodily biological fluids. This interaction may result in adsorption of biomolecules or endogenous proteins to the surface of the nanoparticles, which leads to formation of a complex known as a bimolecular or protein corona [90]. The formation of a nanoparticle-corona complex may decrease the colloidal stability of mRNA-LNPs and lead to particle aggregation and earlier release of the mRNA load [91,92]. Therefore, characterization of LNPs should be carried out in undiluted biological fluids to determine their stability, size, and mRNA encapsulation efficiency. In this context, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy can be used to determine the degree of complexation of mRNA, while the technique of fluorescence single-particle tracking can be adopted for measuring the LNPs' size and their extent of aggregation [91,92]. \n\nModifications of the helper lipid composition of LNPs may also contribute to their stability in serum. For example, incorporation of cholesterol was reported to reduce the permeability and increase the rigidity of the lipid membrane and, therefore, helps to preserve the integrity of LNPs when present in serum [93]. In addition, inclusion of PEGylated lipids in the LNP composition may provide a stealth effect and improve the colloidal stability by reducing the capability of adsorption to plasma protein, thereby avoiding aggregation in the bloodstream. However, LNPs containing PEGylated lipids were reported to exhibit low cellular uptake and transfection [94]. Therefore, careful selection of PEGylated lipids is important in this case. Conventional PEG lipids, such as distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-PEG2000, are known to remain firmly linked to LNPs and prohibit the release of the nucleic acid.",

If CSL3 formulations demonstrated a significantly higher size compared with SM-102 formulations, CSL3 formulations were able to encapsulate a higher level of siRNA, which should be interesting from the perspective of transfection. Nevertheless, the lipid-PEG showed no impact on siRNA internalization. LNPs showed neutral zeta potential values, which was not surprising considering that they include ionizable lipid with a pKa lower than 7.0 known to exhibit a neutral surface charge at physiological pH [18,28]. \n\nAs shown in Figures 3 and 4, NTA allowed the discrimination of the different behaviors of LNPs in serum depending on the lipid-PEG included. Particle distribution profiles (Figure 3) were consistent with the rapid dissociation from the lipid membrane of C14 lipids-PEG followed by the adsorption of serum proteins and the alteration of particles. Indeed, flattening of the curves was observed for DMG-and DTA-PEG formulations (C14) over time, and a significant increase in the mean size and decrease in the particle concentrations were observed, meaning important alteration of LNPs when they are not protected anymore by the polymer. On the contrary, the constant concentration-size profiles of DSPE-and DSG-PEG formulations over time were consistent with the theoretical strong anchoring of C18 lipid-PEG and the longer stealth properties they can provide. Regarding the differences observed between DMG-and DTA-PEG LNPs (more important size and concentration changes for DMG-PEG LNPs), it was hypothesized that the difference was related to the chemical structures of these lipids-PEG. Indeed, the DMG segment contains an ester function which could be cleaved more quickly compared to the amide function of the DTA segment (Figure 1A). It was even recently described that the desorption of DMG-PEG from LNPs used in COVID vaccine (Spikevax \u00ae ) is faster than that of DTA-PEG (Comirnaty \u00ae ) [29]. Cer-PEG formulations showed intermediate results for both size and concentration changes over time.",

Whether the ionizable surface lipids drive the ''Protein adsorption/uptake\" has not yet been thoroughly investigated but they are likely involved in protein/apoE corona formation on the LNP surface. Note that many structural and biological properties of LNPs should be ascribed not to a single lipid component but rather a combination of lipids, as illustrated above. This is illustrated by all the LNP components that contribute to the structure/morphology of LNPs. The PEG-lipids dictate the LNP size, and thus, influence the ratio of the surface to core distribution of the remaining components, and thereby ultimately their packing motif. The light blue highlight illustrates that PEG-lipids containing a long lipid tail improve the in vivo stability of LNPs.

[28,29]For example, the use of dynamic flow incubation versus static conditions for specific compositions of PEGylated liposomes, led to significantly different results. [28]Experimental implications on protein corona formation, including critical factors as protein to NP surface ratio and incubation time [30] have been considered by Farokhzad and colleagues.Although their specific results on corona formation of diverse inorganic NPs for plasma proteome profiling, [31] also in disease context, [32] cannot be directly translated to organic systems, they still give valuable insights into correlations between NP surface characteristics and protein corona profile.\n\nFinally, discussions around potential immunological reactions are also to be considered. [33]This immunogenicity has been associated to the complement activation observed for some compositions of PEG-liposomes. [34]Despite certain reports on this aspect, [34][35][36][37] there are discrepancies about the doses necessary to elicit this undesired effect. [35,38][41] Despite of this, the unquestionable success of these therapies coupled with the widespread administration of PEGylated LNP-mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have relativized the concerns about PEG immunogenicity.\n\nNevertheless, in the quest for sophisticated alternatives to PEG, various approaches are under exploration.",

            "text": "geometry may change rigidity, curvature strain, and deformability of LNP lipid membranes [212][213][214][215]. For example, Patel et al. explored the impact of varying the structure of cholesterol derivatives in LNPs on cellular uptake and trafficking and found up to 25-fold improvement in delivery efficiency [216], which may have been caused by morphological changes in mRNA-LNP internal and external structure [163,216]. Additionally, simulations of mRNA-LNP endosomal escape suggest that lateral diffusion and the tail protrusion of the peripheral lipids into the endosomal membrane may be key types of lipid dynamics responsible for achieving endosomal fusion [165]. The outermost lipid, PEG-lipid, might have other corrections to the properties of the LNP membrane.\n\nPEG-lipid, typically the least abundant lipid in the LNP formulation, affects the properties of LNPs in several ways. First, the amount of incorporated PEG-lipid dictates the particle size [217], although excessive PEGylation hinders transfection [218]. Second, PEG-lipids prevent destabilization and aggregation [217,219]. Third, PEG-lipids prevent rapid uptake of LNPs, and reduce opsonization by serum proteins and reticuloendothelial clearance, improving LNP circulation lifetime [220]. Finally, the hydrophilic coating of PEG may be beneficial in navigating viscous media such as lung mucus [116,221]. The extent of these properties depends on the chemical structure of PEG-lipid, which contains a hydrophilic part (PEG) and a hydrophobic part (lipid anchor). Both may affect the LNP size, lipid membrane permeability, and immune response [66,222,223]. Unlike other components of LNP, PEG-lipid is designed to eventually disassociate and shed the PEG, controlling the kinetics of cellular uptake. The PEG-shedding is necessary to prevent the potential induction of PEG-specific antibodies that cause rapid systemic clearance of subsequent doses of PEGylated nanomaterials via accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon [224]. The severity of ABC may also be suppressed by adjusting the",

            "text": "While surface charge impacts protein adsorption, it operates within a complex electrostatic environment, which could explain the subtler differences in protein-charge profiles compared with pI trends. These findings suggest that lipid composition influences not only protein adsorption but also the physicochemical characteristics of the corona, impacting organ-specific delivery. \n\nTo further investigate protein-corona-driven targeting, we analyzed the top 30 most abundant proteins in lung-and spleen-targeting LNP coronas (Tables S5-S10). Additionally, to provide a clearer interpretation of the results, we focused on proteins that were highly enriched in one organ-specific LNP corona while being absent or barely detected in the other (Figure 4E,F). Results showed that the predominant proteins absorbed in spleentargeting LNPs are actin, myosin, and the immunoglobulin lambda-like protein. These proteins exhibit a low correlation and are typically nonspecific and are often found in negative mass spectrometry controls. Therefore, the mechanism underlying spleen targeting remains unclear. However, the protein-corona composition of lung-targeting LNPs was clearly distinct from that of liver-and spleen-targeting LNPs. Notably, vitronectin and prothrombin, both extensively reported as key protein-corona components influencing lung targeting, were among the most enriched proteins [12,13,27]. These findings suggest that lung-targeting LNPs in our ionizable lipid library follow previously described mechanisms of proteincorona-mediated lung selectivity.",

At this stage, they are the most commonly used reagents to prevent the clearance of MPS and prolong the residence time of liposomes in the blood. The PEGylation of LNPs can effectively reduce the amount of LNP and serum proteins through the PEGylation of LNP. In addition, PEG-modified anionic liposomes can better diffuse into the lymphatic system after subcutaneous injection, reducing the retention at the injection site, and better aggregation and retention in the lymph nodes. Furthermore, shorter PEG modified chains allow for better particle retention and retention against lymph [26]. The modification of branched-chain PEG polymer and straight-chain PEG polymer can give the liposomes significantly different targeting and transfection ability [27]. However, recent studies have shown that the human body produces corresponding antibodies against PEG, which has always been associated with reduced vaccine effectiveness and further adverse reactions. For this reason, efforts are being made to find a better, equally biocompatible polymer to replace the PEG modification. However, some studies have found that adding a specific amount of dexamethasone into liposomes can effectively inhibit the adverse reactions caused by PEG modification [28]. \n\nDue to the inherent properties of lipid nanoparticles, most LNP-based vaccines target the liver if they rely on passive targeting by continuous circulation of the particles in the body and cellular uptake. \n\nChen and his colleagues have developed a positively charged PTX-LNP based on paclitaxel (PTX), modified with folic acid-modified bovine serum albumin (FB) to enable dual targeting of tumours [29]. Veiga and his colleagues achieved selective targeting of inflammatory leukocytes in the organism by combining anti-Ly6C antibodies with lipid nanoparticles loaded with siRNA.

Phospholipids, such as the 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) used in COVID-19 vaccines or the 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoethanolamine (DOPE)) are located at the periphery of LNP and organise into a bilayer structure, influencing the fluidity, membrane fusion, as well as the biodistribution of LNPs, as they can be designed for organ-specific targeting (41)(42)(43). Sterols (such as cholesterol, oxidised cholesterol derivatives and phytosterols) are the most abundant lipids in LNP formulation (20-50% of total lipids). They are essential for surface organisation through stabilisation of the lipid bilayer, shielding the positive charge, and influence the fluidity of the nanoparticles, protein fusion and endosomal escape (44,45). PEG-anchored lipids (2-5% of total lipids) are composed of the hydrophilic polyethylene glycol conjugated to an anchoring phospholipid. The amount, length and type of PEG-lipids regulate the size of LNPs by limiting lipid diffusion and protect them from aggregation and undesired interactions with biological environments, such as serum protein and macrophage phagocytosis. However, an excess of PEG lipids can reduce receptor-mediated cell uptake and transfection of LNPs, thus reducing mRNA delivery. This can be overcome by using a PEGylating agent with weak bilayer anchor or a cleavable linker, resulting in a progressive loss of PEGylation in biologic fluids (35, 43).

The PEG-lipid is essential to produce a stable LNP population with low polydispersity. However, short chain PEG-lipids are currently preferable to promote shedding of the steric barrier following IV administration to maximize hepatic gene-silencing in vivo. Studies using lipid compositions of MC3, distearoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and PEGlipid to quantitate hepatic gene-silencing showed increasing the concentration above 1.5 mol % substantially compromises hepatocyte gene knockdown for PEG-lipids with longer chains (C18) but not for shorter chains (C14 and C16). This is attributed to an increased PEG-lipid desorption time in vivo for C18 compared to C14. 187 The amount of PEG-lipid also impacts the LNP size\ue0d5as mentioned previously, the effect of particle size on activity is crucial for certain applications. By varying the amount of PEGlipid content, particle size can be controlled, with smaller LNPs being formulated at high ratios of PEG-lipid. 180,181,185 By altering the PEG-lipid composition, LNP-siRNA particles formulated to have a mean diameter of 78 nm showed maximum FVII gene-silencing in vivo. 181 While the size is controlled by the PEG-lipid content, LNP systems that do not contain enough DSPC to cover an external surface monolayer will incorporate additional cholesterol and/ or ionizable lipid in that monolayer, thus disturbing the activity.

            "text": "Controlling the particle size of LNPs also enables targeted delivery to specific tissues and cells. Typically, the optimal particle size range for LNPs is 20-200 nanometers, which provides ideal permeability and retention capabilities, allowing them to pass through stromal tissues. The components of LNPs also have certain drawbacks that require improvement. PEG is a significant potential source of peroxides and is generally unstable. Its degradation can lead to chain reactions and catalyze the degradation of ionizable lipids. Lipid degradation products can also react with mRNA, resulting in the formation of covalent mRNA-lipid adducts, which can affect mRNA bioactivity (34). Additionally, PEG-containing LNPs can bind to immunoglobulins on marginal zone B cells in the spleen, stimulating the production of anti-PEG IgM. Upon a second administration, the previously generated anti-PEG IgM binds to PEG on the LNPs, subsequently activating the complement system and enhancing the phagocytic activity of Kupffer cells, leading to increased clearance of the LNPs (121).

            "text": "Considering the previously mentioned rapid desorption of C14 lipid-PEG in serum, it could be hypothesized that the transfection of cells with SM-102 LNPs lacking PEG could disturb cell metabolic activity. Nevertheless, these results should be taken with caution due to the low level of siRNA encapsulation for the SM-102 LNPs, as, in order to work at constant concentrations of siRNA, they required the use of larger volumes and therefore a larger amount of LNPs compared with the CSL3 formulations. \n\nFinally, these LNPs, including siGFP, were tested regarding their efficacy in MDA-MB-231 cells expressing mEmerald fluorescent protein. The impacts of the lipid-PEG, the ionizable lipid and the serum were studied by live imaging over a period of 78 h. The results highlighted the promise of these LNPs, including two recent ionizable lipids (CSL3 and SM-102), as the fluorescence inhibition efficiency achieved in serum-free medium (80-90%) was very similar to that obtained with Lipofectamine, which was used as a positive control. This effect remained very high for C14 DMG-and Cer-PEG LNPs in serum-containing medium (about 80-90%). Nevertheless, that effect was significantly reduced for DSPE-LNPs in serum-containing medium (by about 50%, with no effect for SM-102 LNPs with DSPE-PEG in HI FBS). It was concluded that lipids-PEG with long acyl chains such as C18 could be an obstacle for efficient gene delivery in serum. Indeed, it has recently been described that lipids-PEG with long (C16-C18) alkyl chains could interfere with gene silencing when compared with shorter lipids-PEG, which quickly desorb from membranes [6]. This PEG dissociation was then associated with facilitating the cellular uptake and endosomal escape processes [31]. Recently, the transfection of HepG2 cells with LNPs also showed the impact of C18 lipid-PEG in serum-containing medium.",

One of the samples was regularly washed in three cycles and the other was repeatedly purified by centrifugation using ultrafiltration, until no free PEO-PPO-PEO was detected in the supernatants. FTIR evaluation showed two distinctive conformations, brush and loop, of the PEO-PPO-PEO hydrophilic layer for the purified and completely purified sample. Striking similarity of the circulation time of the \"brush\" corona conformation of PEO-PPO-PEO/ Poly(DL-lactide-co-caprolactone) NPs to PLGA-PEG-PLGA NPs with dense hydrophilic corona was found during the biodistribution studies of radiolabeled samples. Having in mind the close values of hydrodynamic diameters and the zeta potential of the compared NPs we may assume that the Mw, density and surface conformation of PEG corona determines protein corona patterns and the abundance of different proteins in primary and secondary corona, affecting the process of phagocytosis (Djurdjic, 2015;Geskovski, 2015). Compared to the \"brush\" conformation the \"trans\" or train/loop conformation of PEG chains of the NPs resulted in almost immediate sequestration and clearance. Therefore, PEG Mw, density or ethylene glycol units per surface area to achieve efficient surface coverage and \"brush\" conformation should be carefully optimized during the design process if long circulation time has to be achieved. Novel studies indicate to abundance of serum albumin and apolipoprotein E in the protein corona of low-density PEG hydrophilic shell PLGA NPs and higher level of clusterin for shells with increasing density and chain length, confirming that PEG conformation mediates a specific protein adsorption and shapes the protein corona profile.",

PEG chains extend from the surface of LNPs, forming a hydrated layer that spatially shields the surface, preventing LNP aggregation and fusion, reducing serum protein adsorption, opsonization, and phagocytosis, thus extending the circulation half-life. Additionally, PEG promotes lipid connectivity. Although PEG can reduce serum protein adsorption and improve stability, it also diminish interactions with the cell membrane, leading to decreased cellular endocytosis. Furthermore, after endocytosis, PEG can reduce interactions between LNPs and endosomal membranes, affecting the release of mRNA into the cytoplasm. Therefore, precise control of its dosage and molecular weight is necessary (19,34,(117)(118)(119). \n\nPhospholipids can spontaneously organize into lipid bilayers and have a relatively high phase transition temperature. Therefore, they are used as structural lipids and can promote the fusion of LNPs with endosomal membranes, which is helpful for the release of mRNA. Phospholipids account for about 10-20% of the total lipids in LNPs. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) can improve the transfection efficiency of mRNA and also affect the biodistribution of LNP in vivo (34,120). \n\nCholesterol is also a structural lipid that exists in the shell of LNP and accounts for about 20 -50% of the total lipids in LNPs. \n\nCholesterol enhances the stability of particles by regulating membrane integrity and rigidity. The molecular geometry of cholesterol derivatives can further influence the delivery efficiency and biodistribution of LNPs (19,34,117,118). \n\nThe particle size of LNPs affects their internalization, biodistribution, immunogenicity, degradation, and clearance. Controlling the particle size of LNPs also enables targeted delivery to specific tissues and cells.",

            "text": "-DSPE is facilitating. While PEG-DSPE ensures long circulation [49], PEG-c-DMG tends to desorb from the LNPs upon i.v. administration, to exploit an already established route for specific cellular uptake in the liver. Blood contains significant apoE, especially on LDLs and remanent chylomicrons which are taken up in the liver via the LDLR. PEG-lipids with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs [6,51,63], allowing the particles to adsorb apoE [34]. This allows LNPs to endogenously target hepatocytes in the liver, as exploited in Onpattro \u00d2 [34] (Fig. 3C). That said, other plasma components, in addition to apoE, could potentially also facilitate uptake of LNPs in hepatocytes or any other cell type.\n\nAs discussed above, PEG desorption rate can be controlled by formulating LNPs using PEG-lipids with different acyl chain lengths [24,49,51]. Relatedly, Mui et al. [51] showed that increasing the molar ratio of the PEG-lipid from 1.5 to 2.5 mol% compromised transfection efficiency in hepatocytes when the PEG chain was attached to a C18 lipid tail but not a C14 lipid tail. This indicates that only a C14 lipid tail facilitates PEG-lipid desorption followed by association with apoE, thereby promoting receptor-mediated uptake in the liver, and that the molar ratio of the PEG-lipid therefore has no impact on transfection efficiency as most PEG-lipids desorb rapidly following administration. Mui et al. [51] also showed that for 1.5 mol% PEG-lipids, the in vivo transfection level was almost independent of the carbon length of the PEG-lipids. Hence, the expected longer circulation time of LNPs coated with C18 compared to C14 PEG-lipids do not change final transfection efficacy and/or apoE adsorption levels. These data lead one to question whether PEG-lipid desorption (when using 1.5 mol% PEG",

            "text": "In recent times, novel opportunities have emerged in the realm of bionano interactions, presenting new avenues for the development of targeted NPs. These interactions result in the encapsulation of NPs by biomolecules, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona, commonly known as the protein corona, due to its predominant enrichment with plasma proteins. Initially, it was observed that the presence of a protein corona on NPs hinders the effectiveness of targeting ligands, 23 thereby impairing the NP's targeting ability. However, it was later recognized that complete avoidance of protein corona formation, even in PEGylated systems, is not feasible. 24 Consequently, efforts were redirected toward harnessing the protein corona as an inherent targeting moiety, as the proteins acquired from the bloodstream could potentially serve as targeting ligands. 25 ur research group has successfully provided direct evidence of targeted delivery of NPs by coating a cationic liposome with a protein corona enriched in vitronectin. 26 This plasma protein bestowed the liposome with the remarkable ability to selectively target and bind to cancer cells that exhibit an elevated level of expression of the vitronectin receptor. A recent scientific hypothesis has suggested that the high liver tropism and transfection potency exhibited by Onpattro may be attributed to the formation of a protein corona enriched with Apo-E. 2 This protein corona, in turn, enables the recognition of hepatocytes through the LDL receptor, potentially contributing to its liver-targeting capabilities. \n\nIn the context of vaccination, the translation of LNP vaccines into clinical practice faces challenges due to our limited understanding of their protein corona, which may influence the tissue accumulation of particles in physiological environments. Upon ID, LNP vaccines are exposed to the dermal interstitial fluid (DIF) 27 leading to the formation of a protein corona. Given that the protein source is a key determinant in shaping the composition of the protein corona, 28 we assert that conducting a thorough investigation of LNPs in the DIF is an essential and decisive step in advancing our comprehension of their mechanism of action upon intradermal injection.",

            "text": "Lipids that achieve this transition state can rapidly diffuse through the aqueous space down a concentration gradient to acceptor sites such as other membranes and lipoproteins. The large energy barrier associated with entering the activated state is why the majority of membrane phospholipids, which have two acyl chain lengths >16 carbons, form stable bilayers and exhibit extremely low rates of transfer, with typical half-times of hundreds of hours in the absence protein facilitators. 20 The rate of lipid desorption, however, increases exponentially with decreasing chain length and is further enhanced by large hydrophilic headgroups, such as PEG, that contribute to lower the energy required to adopt transition-state complexes. 13,19 y isolating plasma at various time intervals after injection and separating LNPs from lipoproteins, we determined the rate of loss for each PEG-lipid from LNPs in vivo to be >45%/hour, 1.3%/hour, and 0.2%/hour for C14, C16, and C18, respectively. Formulation optimization studies have consistently demonstrated that to form stable siRNA LNPs with diameters <100 nm the minimum amount of PEG 2000 -lipid required is ~1.5 mol %. 5,7 At this concentration, FVII siRNA LNPs containing PEG-C14, -C16, and -C18 exhibit similar siRNA ED 50 's of ~0.03 mg/kg. When the PEG-lipid content is raised to 2.5 mol % there is little or no effect on the ED 50 of PEG-C14 LNPs, whereas PEG-C18 LNPs completely lose activity in the dose range tested. This impact on activity resulting from such a small increase in mol percent highlights the effectiveness of the steric barrier provided by PEG-lipids. \n\nThe rate of PEG-C18 desorption from LNPs is 0.2% per hour, which is negligible relative to their circulation half-life of under 4 hours and consistent with the general assumption that PEG-C18 steric barriers can be considered permanently associated to circulating lipid-based delivery systems.",

This is probably because the interaction between LNPs and cells is reduced or the ability of LNP to adsorb ApoE is reduced, resulting in difficulty in uptake into hepatocytes. The length of fatty acid chains of the PEG lipid is responsible for the time of dissociation from the LNPs. Since PEGylated lipids with myristoyl (C14) chains are rapidly dissociated from the LNPs in the blood circulation, they do not interfere the process of FVII knockdown. We previously showed in mice that long circulation of siRNA-loaded pH-sensitive liposomes modified with PEG was observed only when DSPE-PEG but not distearoylglycerol (DSG)-PEG was used. Our results suggest that the electrostatic interaction between lipid molecules on the surface of the liposomes is a critical determinant for the in vivo effect of PEGylation [115].\n\nPEGylation of LNPs and chemical modification of siRNA reduce their immunogenicity, but it is difficult to completely eliminate the possibility of immune reactions, especially in susceptible individuals [116]. Recently, Chen et al. reported that incorporation of a small amount (4 mol% of total lipid content) of dexamethasone into LNPs can suppress the immune response [117]. Such an approach provides a positive perspective for future clinical trials and commercialization.",

            "text": "PC can change significantly the behavior of NPs in vivo, therefore its control has been extensively studied to facilitate applications of NPs in nanomedicine. One of the main strategies to reduce the formation of the corona has featured the functionalization of particles with hydrophilic ligands and coatings (Amoozgar & Yeo, 2012;Ke et al., 2017;Rampado et al., 2020). Functionalization with hydrophilic motifs promotes the formation of hydration shells, thus making the NP surface less available for interactions with proteins and other biomolecules. Among the potential ligands, PEG is certainly the most well-known and used surface motif. Although PEG chains reduce NP-protein interactions thanks to their hydrophilic character, other properties such as polymer chain length and density on the particle surface have also been found to play an important role. The effect of coating poly(lactic acid) (PLA) NPs with PEG ligands ranging from 2 to 20 kDa on PC formation was reported over two decades ago (Gref et al., 2000). A strong decrease in protein adsorption was initially observed when particles were functionalized with PEG ranging between 2 and 5 kDa. Only a small reduction was then seen for PEG chains longer than 5 kDa, suggesting that the optimum NP coverage had been reached at 5 kDa. In a different study, polymeric micelles coated with PEG ligands and incubated in whole human blood showed a progressive inhibition of PC formation when PEG size increased from 5 to 20 kDa, indicating that the increase in molecular weight of the PEG chains results in a decrease in the formation of PC (Miteva et al., 2015). Interestingly, the two studies also indicate that for different particles systems, the optimal length of the PEG chains might have to be tailored. Nevertheless, coating of NPs with PEG does not always reduce the PC formation efficiently. As described by Seneca et al., the amount of proteins adsorbed on PEGylated NPs varied significantly depending on the density of the PEG chains present on the surface (Seneca et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Delivery efficiency and biodistribution of mRNA vectors are affected by the surface composition of vectors. A prominent example of surface modification is the incorporation of PEG-chains. PEGylation of nanoparticles changes the trafficking of nanocarriers, extends half-life of delivery vectors in vivo by preventing interactions with serum proteins and phagocytes, and enhances the solubility and stability of delivery vectors by increasing hydrophilicity [264]. While PEG moiety plays a key role in biodistribution and half-life of nanocarriers, it hinders efficient uptake of nanoparticles by cells because of steric hindrance and inhibited interactions with the plasma membrane [218]. Therefore, PEG-chains are designed to detach in the serum to alleviate the steric hindrance and allow the nanocarriers to interact with ApoE and to subsequently enter the cells by ApoE-mediated endocytosis [218,265,266].\n\nAs with ApoE-mediated nanoparticle uptake, there is interest in biomolecular surface modification that may facilitate nanoparticlemediated gene transfer. A recent report by Sch\u00f6ttler et al. suggests that the \"stealth\" effect of PEG-coating may be due to the formation of a biomolecular corona via attractive interactions [267]. Although the formation of the protein corona is a well-known fact [268], studies considering and exploiting this aspect in the context of mRNA gene therapy have been limited [165]. This circumstance could explain why there has been a weak correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies of LNPs since biomolecular corona can cause particle agglomeration, premature release of LNP content, or lipid dissociation depending on the content of the corona [269,270].\n\nIncorporation of carbohydrates (such as mannose) on the nanocarriers can also influence the trafficking to the LNs and uptake to immune cells [271,272]. Tokatlian et al. demonstrated that trimannosylation of the HIV nanoparticle immunogens leads to strong GC reactions because of the facilitated accumulation in LNs with a complement-, mannose-binding lectin-mediated, immunogen glycandepen",

            "text": "Protein corona formation is an intrinsic property of nanoparticles that are exposed to biological environments and is often modulated by a nanoparticle's physicochemical properties [160][161][162][163]. Corona composition is dynamic, and protein mobility plays an important role in the desorption/adsorption process. The Vroman effect addresses protein corona formation in materials exposed to a physiological environment and postulates that protein exchange will change corona composition, while the overall quantity of proteins remains roughly the same [163,164]. As reported for many cellular types, the uptake levels and mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles are affected by the composition of this protein corona [165][166][167][168]. Particle biodistribution and clearance are also significantly influenced by the protein corona. Proteins such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, clusterin, and Ig gamma and light chains are commonly found in the protein corona of nanoparticles [163]. Many of these proteins are relatively featureless in terms of targeting; however, some are well-described ligands that cross the BBB via receptormediated transcytosis, e.g., Apo E. There have been promising attempts of controlling the corona formation to improve brain delivery of NPs. For example, Zhang et al. reported the functionalization of PEG-liposomes with a short peptide that binds to the lipid-binding domain of apolipoproteins, leaving the receptor-binding domain available to interact with lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and scavenger receptors class B, which affected intracranial glioma accumulation and notable increases in brain distribution [169]. Even though the protein corona is of interest in brain delivery, it also poses challenges in the investigation of particle properties [170][171][172]. \n\nCoating nanoparticles with molecules that avoid protein adsorption is a broadly implemented strategy in nanotherapeutic systems, and PEGylation is the most common approach.",

            "text": "During the nanoprecipitation process, lipid-PEG would self-assemble on the NP surface through hydrophobic interactions between the lipophilic alkyl chains and the PLGA core. Different from covalently conjugated PEG layer, physically adsorbed lipid-PEG molecules on NP surface are diffusible, which could thus result in de-PEGylation of the NPs over time. We hypothesized that both the assembly and the dissociation processes might be predominantly determined by the physicochemical properties of the lipid-PEG molecules. In this work, a series of eight lipid-PEGs with different alkyl chains and charges (Figure 2a) were used to evaluate their effect on the behaviors of the hybrid NPs for siRNA delivery, while keeping the PEG molecular weight (2 kDa) consistent. They are divided into two categories, neutral and anionic lipid-PEGs, according to the linkage (glycerol/serine vs. glycero-3phosphoethanolamine) between the lipophilic tails and the PEG chain. Both categories include three lipid-PEGs with saturated alkyl chains of different length (C14, C16 and C18) and one lipid-PEG with unsaturated chain(s) (ceramide or DOPE). We first quantified the amount of lipid-PEG that self-assembled on the NPs using a method based on the spectrophotometric measurement of complexes formed by PEG and barium iodide [43,44]. All NPs carried a similar amount of lipid-PEGs on the surface, which was ~ 35-40 \u03bcg/mg of the PLGA polymer (Figure 2b). It is worth noting that this self-assembly nanoprecipitation method requires no surfactant/stabilizer (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol) in the hybrid NP formulation, which was reported to significantly impede lipid-PEG association on the polymeric particle surface as a steric barrier [45]. This high surface lipid-PEG density may thus increase the NP stability in serum and reduce MPS recognition.",

We then used a size-exclusion column to isolate the \"hard protein corona\" with higher binding affinity of cKK-E12 LNPs, A6 LNPs, and Syn-3 LNPs (Fig. S7) 22,23 and used proteomics to analyze the composition of proteins on LNPs (Supplementary Table 1).

These proteins are involved in the function of complement activation, immune responses, coagulation, acute phase response and lipid metabolism (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 1). Previous studies identified apolipopro-teinE (ApoE) as an important protein for LNPs; which can mediate LNP delivery to the liver 24,25 . Consistent with this, we identified ApoE in the corona of all three LNPs, and as the dominant plasma protein in the corona of A6 LNPs. Although the amount of ApoE appears similar in the corona of all three LNPs, the corona of cKK-E12 and Syn-3 LNPs is dominated by a 5-6fold increase in serum albumin concentration, with ApoE composing a much smaller fraction of the corona of these LNPs (Fig. 2b). \n\nSerum albumin and ApoE-mediated cellular uptake.",

            "text": "We also observed a negative correlation between the level of in vitro monocyte phagocytosis of lipid nanoparticles and anti-PEG IgG expansion (Figure 6c). These findings suggest that the amounts of mRNA lipid nanoparticles that remain in the blood (and free of phagocytosis) may influence the PEG antibody immunogenicity in humans. This phenomenon only affected PEG immunogenicity as the mRNA levels in the blood were not significantly correlated with the expansion of spikebinding IgG or neutralizing antibodies (Figure 5d). This is consistent with PEG being expressed on the surface of the lipid nanoparticle, whereas the spike protein, the target of neutralization and spike binding IgG, is only expressed following the mRNA transfection of cells. Larger cohort studies and animal studies are required to confirm the causal relationship between the levels of mRNA lipid nanoparticles in blood and the expansion of anti-PEG antibodies. \n\nAdditional factors could influence the biodistribution and immunogenicity of mRNA lipid vaccines. Humans display a diverse range of plasma lipids and proteins. Similar differences are likely to be found in lymphatic fluids, which vaccines must traverse. \u221228 We previously showed that clinically relevant drug-loaded liposomes displayed a large variance in immune cell association in human blood, depending on the compositions of person-specific biomolecular coronas. 21 The formation of biomolecular corona on drugloaded liposomes in vivo in human blood has been previously described. 29 The composition of biomolecular coronas has been shown to influence the fate and functionality of lipid nanoparticles. 30,31 An analysis of the in vivo or ex vivo corona formation on mRNA vaccines could help further characterize mRNA vaccine distribution and immunogenicity. \n\nOverall, our study provides important information on the kinetics of mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines in human blood in vivo and their impact on vaccine and PEG immunogenicity. Enhancing our understanding on the biodistribution of mRNA lipid nanoparticles in humans should ultimately help improve the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.",

            "text": "Another key component of lipid nanoparticles is PEG, which has a significant effect on their properties. The most commonly used PEG in LNP structures is PEG2000 (PEG, MW = 2000), which was shown by Oberli et al. to contribute to smaller LNP particle sizes as well as stronger T-cell responses. 74 Rondine et al. explored the effect of the structure\u2212activity relationship of PEG-peptide complexes on the uptake of Kupffer cells and showed that the smaller the MW of PEG was, the more pronounced the hepatic escape effect of the nanoparticles was when the peptide's structure was fixed. 75 PEG can increase the ability of mRNA LNPs to escape conditioning and phagocytosis by macrophages. When PEG2000 was used, modulation of the PEG density and chain length allowed it to interfere with the binding of modulator molecules (e.g., C3b and iC3b) to their corresponding receptors expressed on macrophages by means of spatial site barriers, enhancing the mobility of the PEG chains, and softness and stretching have been shown to have similar significant effects. 76 PEG on the surface of LNPs can stabilize the spatial structure of LNPs and prevent nonspecific binding with some proteins. 77 Due to its hydrophilicity, the addition of PEG chains results in a hydration cloud with a large excluded volume of LNPs, which reduces the interaction of LNPs with neighboring LNPs or blood constituents. The flexibility of the PEG conformation, which has a large degree of freedom, renders the thermodynamic interpenetration of the PEG corona unfavorable for other substances. 78 Therefore, the addition of PEG can lead to a significant prolongation of the in vivo circulation time of LNPs. The PEG content in LNPs is usually positively correlated with the blood circulation time. 79 .3. Other Lipids. Cholesterol, phospholipids, and PEG are the components of LNPs, except for ionizable cationic lipids. Cholesterol is key to the stability of LNPs, and its role in cell transfection experiments has been proven.",

[12,92] The rapid clearance, indicated by the low CF of all three formulations in the ZFL tail region, is attributed to rapid interactions of these NPs with serum proteins, forming a protein corona, triggering de-PEGylation, and facilitating uptake by ZFL cells (Figure S12e, Supporting Information). This phenomenon aligns with other studies noting the quick de-PEGylation of C14-PEG-containing LNPs in serum. [14,16,93] Furthermore, the low EF is indicative of low extravasation of all formulations into the adjacent tissue (i.e., muscle of the ZFL tail) (Figure S12f, Supporting Information).

For lipid A, formulations made with DEPE showed higher hEPO expression than those made with DOPE for both IV and IM routes of administration (p < 0.05, Figure 2A,B). On the other hand, for lipid B, LNPs made with DEPE showed higher hEPO levels over B-DOPE LNPs only for IV (p < 0.05) but not for the IM dosing route (Figure 2C,D). \n\nIn the context of systemic delivery, LNPs in circulation undergo dynamic interactions with serum proteins forming a protein corona, which has significant implications on the kinetics, interactions, and affinity of the LNPs with different cell types. 24 Composition and formulation changes in LNPs can alter the protein corona, thereby modulating LNP\u2212cell interactions. 25 For instance, the binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) affects LNP uptake by hepatocytes through the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). PC-and PE-based helper lipids formulated into LNPs can differentially influence their ApoE adsorption and thus hepatic delivery. 13 Recently, Zhou et al. demonstrated efficient dendritic cell (DC) uptake of ApoE3-incorporated biomimetic nanoparticles through the macropinocytosis pathway for cancer immunotherapy. 26 In this work, we observed that incorporating PE-based helper lipids with differing tail lengths into LNPs resulted in significant differences in their potencies through different routes of delivery. To investigate if these differences could be attributed to differential ApoE binding, the four LNPs were evaluated for their ApoE affinity using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The dissipation and frequency shifts of all four sensors were monitored in real time (Figure 2E\u2212G).",

            "text": "The steric barrier provided by PEG-lipid is necessary to conparticle size during self-assembly of siRNA LNPs but has the negative attribute of inhibiting hepatic gene silencing in vivo. 7,8 In this study, we evaluate three PEG-lipids with dialkyl chains of 14, 16, and 18 carbons and correlate transfer rates with their effect on PK and activity in vivo. LNP delivery systems containing ionizable dialkylamino lipids require endogenous Apo E in order to access hepatocytes through Apo E-dependent, receptor mediated endocytosis. Therefore, one explanation for inhibition of activity is that PEG interferes with Apo E binding to LNPs. 8 However, it is also possible that a PEG shield prevents bound Apo E from undergoing the lipidinduced structural transition required for binding to hepatocyte receptors or the PEG barrier interferes with receptor recognition of Apo E on the LNP surface. 18,19 In this study, we characterize how a short chain PEG-lipid, with covalently attached PEG of molecular weight 2000, helps to mitigate this problem by rapidly exchanging from the LNP surface to plasma lipoproteins following i.v. administration. We evaluate three PEG-lipids with dialkyl chains of 14, 16, and 18 carbons and correlate transfer rates with their effect on PK and activity in vivo. \n\nThe spontaneous transfer of lipid from a membrane monolayer into the aqueous phase proceeds through a transition-state complex where the molecule is attached to the membrane by the tip of its hydrophobic tail. 20 The activation energy required to enter this state is very high and largely determined by the number and length of hydrophobic chains within the molecule. Lipids that achieve this transition state can rapidly diffuse through the aqueous space down a concentration gradient to acceptor sites such as other membranes and lipoproteins.",

This can again be credited to the zwitterionic nature of DPPC reducing the possibility of electrostatic interactions. 35 Similar to liposomes, a drawback of LPHNPs is their weak colloidal stability relative to the ionic strength of the solution; electrostatic interactions alone cannot stabilize hybrid particles in aqueous medium with .10 mM NaCl ionic strength. Again, like liposomes, this is mitigated by incorporating conjugated PEG-lipids into the lipid mixture (DPPC/DPTAP) to impart stabilizing PEG chains onto the surfaces of the LPHNP. To envisage the most advantageous conditions to attain colloidal stability, Thevenot et al thoroughly investigated the effects of the PEG chain length (n=16, 45, and 113) and mol% (1%, 5%, and 10%) of PEG-lipid in lipid formulation, where the polymer core was made up of PLA and lipid layers were comprised of DPTAP, DPPC, and PEG-phosphoethanolamine (PEG-PE). Keeping the lipid composition unchanged (DPPC:DPTAP:PEG-PE=40:50:10% w/w), and upon gradual increase in the degree of polymerization in the PEG chain, they observed that the mol% of the PEG-lipid inhabiting the lipid shell decreased with stretching chain length from ~3% for n=16 and 45 to ~2% for n=113. The observation was ascribed to spatial repulsion between the bulky lipid-PEG shells with longer PEG chains. Importantly, thickness of the lipid layer adsorbed onto PLA particles was increased with the amount of PEG-lipids adsorbed or with the PEG chain length, from 67 \u00c5 at n=16 to 98 \u00c5 at n=113. This resulted in an increased charge screening effect, which subsequently lowered the zeta potentials from (+) 51 mV at n=16 to (+) 22 mV at n=113. This is owed to a transition from mushroom-like confirmation to outward brush-like confirmation. In accordance with the quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS) study, the",

            "text": "The use of PPEs in drug delivery requires their circulation in the bloodstream for a certain time to be recognized by immune cells or target cells. The polymer interactions with the plasma proteins are important to predict the eventual trigger of the immune system, the potential degradation by certain enzymes, and the pathway that leads to the cellular uptake by specific or unspecific recognition. \n\nWhen a nanocarrier enters the bloodstream, it adsorbs proteins on its surfaces, leading to the formation of a protein shell (the so-called \"protein corona\") that alter the properties of the nanocarrier, such as size, charge, interactions with cells [116,117]. In many cases, the nanocarriers' chemical identity with properly installed targeting groups, might be masked by the protein corona and the resulting \"biological identity\" behaves differently as intended. It has been reported by Dawson and co-workers that protein adsorption reduced the efficiency of specific cell targeting [118], therefore the possibility to control the protein corona to permit the use of targeted nanocarriers is one of the current challenges in drug delivery. Some proteins present in the corona could belong to the class of opsonins, namely antibodies, complement or circulating proteins that are responsible for the recognition of a foreign substance by the immune system and the subsequent clearance from the body. The evaluation of the protein corona composition is, therefore, a fundamental task to predict the biological fate of the nanocarrier. \n\nPEG is currently used as a stealth coating for many drugs and nanocarriers as it decreases protein adsorption. However, certain protein types are \"recruited\" from the blood and still assembled on the nanocarriers' surface. This specific protein adsorption is believed to be responsible for the increased blood-half-life. This effect is generally called \"stealth effect\" and has been explained by several theories, linked to the polymer hydrophilicity, absence of charges, flexibility, and capacity of hydration (Fig. 6) [119,120]. All these factors seem to influence the stealth behaviour of a polymer; they also allowed the design of various PEG-alternatives with additional features, such as degradability and chemical functionality.",

The PC of N-LNPs and O-LNPs shared about 800 proteins absorbed on the surface but presented some proteins that specifically bounded only one LNP formulation; in detail, 246 specific proteins are revealed on N-LNPs' surface including the most abundant albumin, fibrinogen beta chain and fibrinogen gamma chain, while for O-LNPs' formulation found about 1000 specific proteins with the most abundance of albumin, apolipoprotein E, and complement C1. The study of PC composition by in vitro assays could be very important to define the targeting ability of LNPs before the in vivo administration.",

Previous work has shown that PEG-lipids with C 18 alkyl chains remain associated with LNP for days or longer, 14 leading to extended circulation lifetimes following i.v. administration relative to those with shorter PEG chains. 13,14,35 Consistent with these reports, 35 we found that LNP-siRNA, produced by microfluidic mixing incorporating 1.5% PEG-DSG, exhibited extended circulation properties compared to LNP with equivalent amounts of PEG-DMG. 14 ncreasing the total PEG-DSG lipid in the LNP from 2.5 to 5% resulted in a marked increase in circulation halftime from approximately 30 minutes to greater than 8 hours (Figure 5). To show that increased circulation lifetime translates to enhanced LNP accumulation in tumors, fluorescently labeled LNP-AR21-siRNA containing either 2.5 or 5 mol% PEG-DSG were prepared and administered intravenously once every day for 3 days at a dose of 10 mg siRNA/kg body weight in athymic nude mice bearing LNCaP tumors. Tumors were harvested at 4 and 24 hours following the final injection of LNP formulations, fixed in 10% formalin, cryosectioned, and analyzed for LNP accumulation by confocal microscopy. Consistent with the enhanced circulation lifetime, tumor tissues from mice treated with LNP containing 5 mol% PEG-DSG showed significantly higher accumulation of fluorescence than those from mice injected with LNP containing 2.5 mol% PEG-DSG (Figure 2b).",

            "text": "The dynamic interaction between NPs and surrounding proteins in a biological context can lead to the formation of a protein corona (PC), a collection of proteins attached to the NP's surface. In turn, PC determines the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and stability of the NPs and may influence their targeting properties and their plasmatic clearance [72]. Therefore, we first evaluated whether NLC/LN/SV exposed to FBS under static conditions modified the mean hydrodynamic diameter (MHD) of the particles. Before incubation, the NLC/LN/SV formulation presented a unimodal and centered DLS distribution at MHD = 94 \u00b1 1 nm, while the FBS solution showed a trimodal DLS distribution, characterized by peaks centered at 8 nm, 32 nm, and 220 nm attributable to representative serum protein sizes (Figure 7A). After incubation with FBS for 60 min, a single peak centered at MHD \u2248 101 nm \u00b1 1 was observed (Figure 7A). The observed shift of ~7 nm in the MHD of NLC/LN/SV is compatible with a single layer of low-and medium-MHD serum proteins, whose peaks were not detected after 60 min FBS incubation [73]. Moreover, these findings suggest that no clustering processes occur in the formulation in the presence of serum, unlike lipid NPs of similar size that exhibited a ~200 nm shift after FBS incubation under identical conditions [38]. Finally, it is important to note that the mean MHD of ~100 nm obtained for NLC/LN/SV after FBS incubation fits with the optimal conditions required for passive targeting of NPs to solid tumors through the EPR effect [46]. \n\nAs a complement to the preliminary evaluation of the interaction of NLC/LN/SV with plasma proteins, HSA, and fibrinogen were immobilized by physical adsorption onto a gold sensor surface (Figure 7B). NLC/LN/SV suspensions were injected across the functionalized surfaces to investigate the biomolecular interactions.",

            "text": "Typical LNP formulations include phospholipids, cholesterol, positively charged glycolipids, and PEGylated lipids that make up the cell membrane [25]. Phospholipids, a component of cell membranes, act as a skeleton for LNPs and aid in the release of LNPs from endosomes [26]. Although considered as the backbone, their immunogenicity differs depending on the type of phospholipid; therefore, it is necessary to optimize the phospholipid composition [25]. Owing to its hydrophobic nature, cholesterol is placed between the lipid bilayers to increase the rigidity of the LNPs, thus increasing the stability of the latter. Polyethylene-glycol (PEG)-modified lipids provide a shielding layer that minimizes the non-specific binding of LNPs to proteins or cells in vivo [27]. However, immune responses of PEGylated nanoparticles have recently been reported, leading to research on alternative materials [27,28]. When PEGylated drugs are administered intravenously, the formation of anti-PEG antibodies may occur, leading to an Accelerated Blood Clearance (ABC) phenomenon with subsequent doses. Consequently, the drug can be rapidly eliminated from the bloodstream. These phenomena have been observed repeatedly in PEGylated drugs and nanoparticles, resulting in reduced therapeutic efficacy by lowering drug residence time in the bloodstream. In addition, the rate of elimination from the body differs based on whether the lipid tail structure is symmetrical versus asymmetrical [29].",

            "text": "Besides, the effect of serum proteins on ligand-modified LNPs cannot be ignored. Although it is clear that serum proteins will be adsorbed onto the surface of LNPs following the desorption of PEG-lipids upon systemic injections, the protein corona of different ligand-modified LNPs is not well studied yet. A recent study has reported that the nanoparticle protein corona would achieve a maximum thickness in biological fluids when the protein adsorption and desorption rates reached an equilibrium (Stordy et al. 2022). And conjugating targeting ligands to the equilibrated protein corona of the nanoparticles enabled efficient delivery to target cells, while conjugating the ligands to the naked nanoparticles resulted in a 55% reduction of binding affinity to target cells in serum, indicating the potential negative impact of serum proteins on ligand-modified nanoparticles. \n\nWhile various types of ligands were incorporated into LNPs to improve the specific delivery of nucleic acids, the major accessible organs are still limited to the liver, lungs, spleen, and tumor tissues. Indeed, organspecific delivery is often dependent on passive distribution. Only when LNPs reach the organ of interest can they make full use of their targeting moieties to realize specific binding and enhanced uptake (Kedmi et al. 2018). Therefore, it is not surprising that the liver, lungs, and spleen, where LNPs distribute most, and tumors whose vascularization promotes LNP accumulation, are generally easier to reach than other organs. In our view, future directions in LNP-based targeted nucleic acid delivery will be mostly aimed at developing the targeted LNPs to reach the hard-to-access organs (e.g., the brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, and bone) and cell types. A recent study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of LNPs containing cationic helper lipids induced efficient and specific mRNA delivery in the pancreas, which was mediated by peritoneal macrophage exosome secretion (Melamed et al. 2023).",

However, a key challenge related to the longer half-life of formulations with persistent or long-chain PEG-lipid is the potential for accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon, which has been observed for long-circulating PEGylated liposomes. In this phenomenon, the clearance of PEGylated nanoparticles is increased and half-life is reduced on repeated administration due to induction of anti-PEG antibodies [ 173 , 174 ]. This may result in clearance of the LNP before the cargo is effectively delivered. How anti-PEG immune responses impact mRNA-LNP systems in vivo needs to be explored to ensure it does not impact the efficacy of mRNA-LNP vaccine candidates. Recent research, however, indicates that stable LNP systems can be generated utilizing alternative materials to PEG-lipids, and may even provide a superior vaccine. For example, LNPs containing 3% Tween 20 in the place of a PEG lipid specifically delivered a DNA cargo to the draining lymph nodes of mice after i.m. injection, outperforming a standard formulation that utilized DSPE-PEG20 0 0 for which expression was mainly seen at the injection site [ 175 ].",

Several environmental parameters (Fig. 2) affects the formation of PC in vitro particularly the medium surrounding the NPs and the exposure conditions. The biological \ue104uid or the medium is composed of different proteins which are known to control the cellular uptake of NPs. This was explained by Tekie et al. 45 for the uptake of chitosan and carboxylmethyl dextran complexes (MCF7 cell line). Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) enhances the uptake due to the presence of proteins in the serum such as alpha-trypsin inhibitor chains and lipoproteins which increase the cell function. Similarly, proteins concentration and exposure time contribute equally to the protein adsorption on NPs. Controlling the PC formation is undoubtedly a challenging task but several results highlight that altering the biological parameters along with the physicochemical properties of NPs enable to forecast the corona formation. As analyzed by Partikel et al. 46 , proteins adsorption on poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs depends on the serum type and concentration. In addition, human serum was shown to signi\ue103cantly modify the corona composition resulting in a concentration-dependent desorption of abundant proteins along with the adsorption of high affinity proteins with lower abundance. In addition, time-dependent cell interaction both in the absence and the presence of a preformed corona showed a signi\ue103cant in\ue104uence on a human liver cancer cell line (HepG2) in which the presence of corona increases the cell interaction compared to bare NPs which results in a higher uptake of NPs. Temperature and pH are also important factors in the interaction of NPs with proteins. Galdino et al. 47 explained that pH in\ue104uences the protein adsorption in the Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and SiO 2 NPs system. They concluded that enthalpy controls the interaction along with an electrostatic contribution that can be altered by changing pH. Gorshkov et al. 48 further explained that by varying pH and temperature in the human blood plasma and a silver NPs system, different tertiary protein structures and charge localizations are observed.

However, the biomolecular corona diminishes those cellular interactions by making the ligands inaccessible at their surfaces. Therefore, development of strategies to overcome the negative impact of the protein corona on NP targeting is necessary. Recently, attaching targeting ligands to longer PEG tethers in combination with backfilling of the remaining bare surface with short PEG chains has been shown to promote the formation of targeted interactions in vitro (Dai et al., 2014).

            "text": "In this work, we employed density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGC) to characterize four LNP formulations, synthesized with two different model ionizable lipids, lipid A and lipid B, and each with two different helper lipids: DOPE and DEPE (Figure 1A). DMG-PEG-2K as the PEGylated lipid and cholesterol were common to all four formulations. Differences in lipid chain lengths of ionizable lipids are known to affect the van der Waals interaction forces and lipid packing, thus impacting the stability of nanoparticles. 22 While both DOPE and DEPE helper lipids have the same phosphatidylethanolamine headgroup, DEPE has a longer carbon tail length (22C) compared to that of DOPE (18C) (Figure S1). Consequently, we sought to evaluate the effect of varying tail lengths of the two helper lipids formulated with the two structurally different ionizable lipids A and B. \n\nFour hEPO-containing mRNA-LNP formulations (A-DOPE, A-DEPE, B-DOPE, and B-DEPE) were generated. As a secreted protein, hEPO is rapidly quantifiable and used extensively in high-throughput screening studies. 23 All four LNPs demonstrated normal features and parameters within the expected threshold, including <125 nm particle size (Figure 1B), <0.22 PDI (Figure 1C), >80% encapsulation efficiency (EE%) (Figure 1D), and zeta potential \u223c25 mV (Figure 1E). Along with DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) control formulations, all four test LNPs were evaluated for hEPO expression in mice via IM and IV routes of administration. At 6 and 24 h postadministration, hEPO expression was quantified by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For both IV and IM dosing, LNPs made with lipids A and B, irrespective of the helper lipids used, showed significantly higher hEPO levels over the MC3 control (p < 0.005, Figure 2A\u2212D).",

            "text": "For many years, the main adopted strategies aimed to reduce protein adsorption to prevent immunological recognition and preserve ligand exposure. For instance, hydrophilic polymers are often grafted onto the surface of NPs in order to reduce interactions with plasma components. Currently, the most used polymer is Polyethylene glycol (PEG) due to its near-neutral and hydrophilic properties [14,15]. However, this functionalization does not completely suppress protein binding [16,17]. Actually, some results indicate that the PEG \"stealth\" effect could be due to the creation of a specific protein corona. Sch\u00f6ttler and colleagues studied human plasma protein adsorption onto PEG and poly(ethyl ethylene phosphate)-modified polystyrene NPs. The presence of polymer chains on the NP surface did not prevent protein adsorption, but changed the corona's composition, recruiting specific apolipoproteins. Among them, ApoJ (also called Clusterin) plays a predominant role as a dysopsonin, namely, it reduces non-specific cellular uptake in murine macrophages [5]. Although other unknown molecules contribute to this phenomenon, Clusterin has been shown to also prevent the internalization of non-PEGylated NPs, including silver and silica NPs [18]. Therefore, immune cell escape does not seem to be a feature of the polymer shell per se, but it does require specific protein binding. \n\nMany studies have demonstrated that pre-formed protein coronas of other dysopsonins can control NP-cell interactions. One of them is albumin, the most abundant protein in the blood, that has been used to develop a protective coating that avoids plasma protein adsorption and prolongs the NP circulation time. It is worth mentioning that albumin is and has been frequently identified in the protein corona of several types of NPs, modulating their tissue localization and cell targeting. Several studies on albumin-coated NPs made of different bulk materials can be found in the literature.",

In addition, TEM was used to visually confirm the nanocarrier size and morphology (Figure S8). There were no visual differences between the pristine and PEGylated nanocarriers detected. All formulations appeared to form small cluster duplets with a diameter of about 200 nm. In summary, the experiments conducted during this study exhibited a reduced but not fully diminished protein corona formation following PEGylation of mgHES nanocarriers, which in turn did not have an influence on the PEG-induced stealth properties. \n\nIn addition to avoiding non-specific clearance of nanocarriers by phagocytes, conjugating active targeting moieties onto nanocarriers is the main prerequisite for a precise Apart from complement C3, none of the other abundant murine proteins is thought to influence uptake by macrophages. C3 coated on nanocarriers, however, can lead to an increased internalization of NCs by macrophages through complement receptor ligation when being activated by pathway-specific C3 convertases [42,43]. However, the relatively low abundance of C3 on each nanocarrier formulation (~2%) indicates that C3induced uptake by macrophages only plays a minor role in this carrier system. Walkey et al. demonstrated that higher PEG grafting densities control a decrease and change in the composition of the protein corona, where the nanoparticle size and the PEG density together determine the macrophage uptake [44]. In contrast, PEGylation of the nanocarrier formulations described here increased the rate of protein adsorption in comparison to the pristine nanocarriers (Figure S7). Nevertheless, this increase in corona protein adsorption did not diminish the stealth effect of PEGylated nanocarriers. In addition, the physicochemical properties of the PEGylation with and without a protein corona were evaluated with respect to nanocarrier size and surface charge (Table S1).",

            "text": ", functionalized with targeting transferrin-PEG(5 kDa) was further modified at free reaction sites with PEG spacers of varying lengths, preventing the particles from protein corona formation. In order to enable receptor-recognition, PEG chains for shielding had to be shorter than the spacer between particle and targeting ligand [264]. Despite these difficulties, there are promising examples which have already demonstrated efficient, cell-or tissue-specific delivery of nucleic acids. Additionally, scientists have started to exploit the protein corona to tune particle distribution in vivo. It is commonly known that plasma proteins adsorption depends on particle surface characteristics. Hence, slight structural changes of the particle surface have shown to affect the protein corona composition. As a consequence of protein corona modification, transport to target cells by coating with certain plasma proteins which serve as endogenous ligands can be obtained in vivo. For example, DOTAP/DNA lipoplexes have shown to adsorb vitronectin which mediated receptor-dependent uptake by tumor cells expressing \u03b1 V \u03b2 3 integrins [265]. Patisiran is another prominent example for targeted transport to hepatocytes, mediated by coating with endogenous ApoE [104,137]. Manipulation of the interaction with receptors in vivo and therefore targeted delivery to other cell types could be achieved by an altered protein corona as a consequence of exchanging certain lipid components of the Patisiran formulation [146]. Additionally, Saunders et al. used \"nanoprimers\" administered shortly before injection of therapeutic LNPs that were taken up by cells of the hepatic RES (Fig. 6B). By inhibiting KCs and LSECs, LNPs could be preferentially delivered to hepatocytes, the desired target site [266].\n\nBased on these observations, methods which enable fast screening of broad libraries of nucleic acid carriers in vivo were developed [106][107][108][109]. By means of that, evaluation and characterization of predominant plasma proteins in the corona and tuning the biodistribution profile based on facile structural variations becomes feasible, pathing the way for improved targeted, cell-specific nucleic acid delivery in vivo (see Fig. 6C) [110,[142][143][144][145].  5 Interaction of i",

This indicates that PEG 1000 \u2212OH chains are proportionally more coiled than the PEG 500 \u2212OH chains. Moreover, PEG 1000 \u2212OH chains provide higher crowdedness on the ND surface and also an increase in the polymer layer thickness compared to PEG 500 \u2212OH chains, suggesting that protein adsorption on ND may be reduced, as experimentally observed. 22 Additionally, the higher solvation of the PEG 1000 \u2212OH chains compared to the PEG 500 \u2212OH ones may limit protein corona formation, 65 as PEG/water interactions are likely more favorable than PEG/ protein ones. Indeed, it has been proposed that the interaction between PEG and water forms a barrier of solvent between the NP surface and proteins, hindering their interaction. 66 umerous experimental studies have shown that moderate PEGylation (with PEG chains of 2000 Da in molecular weight) provides the best balance between preventing opsonization and promoting cellular uptake, 4 although this remains a topic of debate in the experimental literature. 67,68 However, atomistic MD simulations of PEGylated NDs with longer PEG chains, especially in the presence of serum proteins, would become challenging for current state-of-the-art computational resources to achieve satisfactory sampling of the phase space. Computational approaches with low resolution, such as coarse-graining methods, are most suitable for handling such large systems, as demonstrated in a previous work by some of us to study the interaction of polymer-coated inorganic NPs with lipid membranes. 36 Nevertheless, some experimental studies have also found that shorter PEG chains with low molecular weight (i.e., PEG 350 ) exhibit similar circulation lifetimes as the longer and heavier ones do (i.e., PEG 2000 ) 67 and may enhance cellular uptake in breast cancer and myeloma cells 68 making our model study more relevant. \n\n4.5.

            "text": "Nanoparticle (NP) size represents a critical parameter defining the blood circulation, biodistribution, tumor accumulation, and cellular uptake of NADS.Notably, NPs size profoundly influences their fate in vivo.For example, small NPs (< 5 nm) are extremely easy to pass through the renal filtration membrane and are eliminated by the kidney, whereas NPs greater than 10 nm can be enriched with tumors through EPR effects.Furthermore, NPs within the size range of 50-200 nm exhibit a propensity for spleen accumulation, likely due to \"protein coronas\" formed by proteins adsorbed on the surface of the NPs (Figure 3) [25].Particle size is a key physicochemical property of NADS that directly affects the contact area of NADS interaction with blood components, thereby influencing protein corona formation and blood circulation time of NADS [26].In general, the protein adsorption of NPs is size-dependent, especially for lipid-based vectors.Larger NPs with a larger volume tend to adsorb more proteins, resulting in greater protein coverage, while smaller NPs exhibit reduced interactions with blood proteins due to their higher surface curvature [27].For instance, Cui et al. [28] found that the 150 nm automated LNPs had higher mRNA lacking efficacy and stronger serum adsorption ability during blood circulation than the smaller ones (70 nm), highlighting the contribution of particle size to protein corona formation and excellent mRNA delivery.This underscores the role of particle size in protein corona formation and efficient mRNA delivery.These automated LNPs could facilitate cytoplasmic mRNA encoding luciferase (Luc-mRNA) delivery and mediate efficient and prolonged luciferase expression in vivo.However, there are exceptions, as suggested by Partikel's [29] study, which indicates that polymeric NPs exhibit protein adsorption independent of particle size within the 100-200 nm range.Therefore, the influence of the particle size of NADS on its protein crown adsorption is intricately related to the properties of the carrier itself.\n\nParticle size also has a significant influence on the distribution and accumulation of NADS in tumors.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are gaining traction in the field of nucleic acid delivery following the success of two mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. As one of the constituent lipids on LNP surfaces, PEGylated lipids (PEG-lipids) play an important role in defining LNP physicochemical properties and biological interactions. Previous studies indicate that LNP performance is modulated by tuning PEG-lipid parameters including PEG size and architecture, carbon tail type and length, as well as the PEG-lipid molar ratio in LNPs. Owing to these numerous degrees of freedom, a high-throughput approach is necessary to fully understand LNP behavioral trends over a broad range of PEG-lipid variables. To this end, we report a low-volume, automated, high-throughput screening (HTS) workflow for the preparation, characterization, and in vitro assessment of LNPs loaded with a therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). A library of 54 ASO-LNP formulations with distinct PEG-lipid compositions was prepared using a liquid handling robot and assessed for their physiochemical properties as well as gene silencing efficacy in murine cortical neurons. Our results show that the molar ratio of anionic PEG-lipid in LNPs regulates particle size and PEG-lipid carbon tail length controls ASO-LNP gene silencing activity. ASO-LNPs formulated using PEG-lipids with optimal carbon tail lengths achieved up to 5-fold lower mRNA expression in neurons as compared to naked ASO. Representative ASO-LNP formulations were further characterized using dose\u2013response curves and small-angle X-ray scattering to understand structure\u2013activity relationships. Identified hits were also tested for efficacy in primary murine microglia and were scaled-up using a microfluidic formulation technique, demonstrating a smooth translation of ASO-LNP properties and in vitro efficacy. The reported HTS workflow can be used to screen additional multivariate parameters of LNPs with significant time and material savings, therefore guiding the selection and scale-up of optimal formulations for nucleic acid delivery to a variety of cellular targets.",

            "text": "Additionally, the corona formation around the liposomes was visualized 44 with transmission electron microscopy (TEM, see Figure 5C). The spherical liposome structure was preserved during the centrifugation process, which is not universally valid for all liposomes. The liposomes were comparably stable because of the high amount of Chol that was incorporated into the lipid membrane. When zoomed in on the sample, even parts of the protein corona itself could be observed as indicated by the red arrows. \n\nAs the protein coronas were quite similar for all liposome samples, with only L-hbPG showing slight deviations with regard to their corona composition, the influence of the different surface functionalizations on the cellular uptake by macrophages (RAW264.7) was investigated. A decreased uptake of a nanocarrier by macrophages is known to lead to reduced clearance by the immune system and, therefore, to a potentially longer blood circulation time with a correspondingly higher probability for the nanocarrier to reach its target location in the body. 45,46 n Figure 6A, the cell uptake results obtained from flow cytometry measurements after 2 and 24 h of incubation for all liposome samples (7.5 \u03bcg mL \u22121 ) are represented. For the formation of the protein corona, different plasma concentrations (0, 5, and 100%) were chosen to detect any concentration dependency, as observed by Monopoli et al. for different systems. 47 Interestingly, when first comparing the liposome uptake behavior with and without protein corona, there was no significant change visible. After 2 h incubation time, the number of positive cells was generally very low (<10%). Liposomes functionalized with PEG chains (L-PEG) showed an even lower cellular uptake than the other two samples, even though their protein corona composition only differed very slightly from the unfunctionalized liposomes (Lun). This reduced cellular uptake of L-PEG could be caused by an inhibition of the scavenger receptor-mediated cellular uptake. These scavenger receptors can be found on macrophages and were reported to recognize PEG, especially in combination with albumin. 48,49",

The SM-102 lipid (Figure 1B) was recently used in the Spikevax \u00ae COVID-19 vaccine. It has a tertiary amine function allowing for electrostatic complexation with nucleic acids at acidic pH and then LNPs' stability at physiological pH [1,10]. The switchable cationic lipid CSL3 (Figure 1B) has previously demonstrated its ability to promote endosomal escape and deliver siRNA through a pH-triggered conformational switch [11][12][13]. For both formulations, five different lipids-PEG were used (Figure 1A): two C18 lipids (DSPE-and DSG-PEG), two C14 lipids (DMG-and DTA-PEG [ALC-0159]) and one asymmetric ceramide lipid (C16 and C8 [Cer-PEG]) with intermediary lipid length. LNPs were produced by a rapidmixing method. The commercial SM-102 lipid was compared with the recently developed CSL3 lipid. \n\nincreased elimination half-time and efficient gene delivery. Short PEGs (PEG1000 or shorter) do not prevent protein corona formation and fail to increase the particles' blood circulation time, whereas long PEGs (PEG5000 or longer) can strongly interfere with the cellular uptake or the endosomal escape process [3][4][5]. Moreover, the lipid anchoring the PEG also demonstrated a significant impact on nanovector's outcome. Previous studies have shown that PEGs with short lipid chains such as the DMG-PEG2000 (C14, dimyristoylglycerol) rapidly dissociate from the lipid membrane of LNPs in serum, thereby reducing their circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains, such as DSPE-PEG2000 (C18, distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine) [6].",

            "text": "The work showed that cationic lipids activated Toll-receptor 4, expressed on leucocytes, in a specific manner. [81]To address this issue, ionizable cationic lipids have been successfully developed and used in clinical products, i.e., Onpattro and the two COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.As reported in the literature, although the ionizable cationic lipids displayed improved efficacy over permanently charged lipids, individuals subjected to LNP-mRNA vaccines displayed side effects such as local pain, fever, swelling, and systemic inflammatory responses. [82]n addition, PEGylated lipids, which are typically used to increase the stability and circulation half-life of LNPs, induce the secretion of anti-PEG antibodies that may cause hypersensitivity reactions as well as the activation of the complement system. [83]This increases the risk of undesirable clearance of the nanoparticles, reducing the antitumor efficacy. [83]Nevertheless, PEG has been widely employed to coat the surface of lipid-based nanotherapeutics used in clinic, including Doxil, Onivyde, and Onpattro. [84]Several studies have focused on the role of PEG coating on nanoparticle interactions with immune cells, and their outcomes can be leveraged to improve the formulation of LNPs and maximize their association with the desired immune system components.For instance, varying PEG architecture influenced nanoparticle association with monocytes and ultimately their biological behavior in blood. [85]In addition, PEG-coated nanoparticles incubated ex vivo with plasma samples from various donors formed personalized coronas, which correlated with the blood immune cell interactions of nanoparticles. [86]Reports have also suggested the use of PEG alternatives, such as polysarcosine, which have similar physicochemical properties to PEG but are less immunogenic, and thus may potentially replace PEG in LNPmediated mRNA delivery.

            "text": "In addition, only in the \ue103rst type of cell did the uptake of GNP conjugates activate the expression of immune response genes. \n\nA recent article by Walkey et al. 41 described a thorough study of the effect of coating GNPs with serum proteins and PEG on macrophage uptake. The authors studied the adsorption of 70 blood serum proteins to PEG-coated GNPs with different densities of PEG coating. Increasing the PEG coating density reduced serum protein adsorption and changed the composition of the adsorbed protein layer. Particle size also affected serum protein adsorption through a change in the steric interactions between the PEG molecules. Both the density of PEG molecules on the GNP surface and the size of GNPs determined the mechanism and effectiveness of macrophage uptake, possibly because the composition of the adsorbed blood serum proteins and their availability to cells were regulated. If the density of PEG coating was lower than $0.16 PEG molecules per nm 2 , the macrophage uptake of GNPs depended on the presence of adsorbed proteins (serum-dependent uptake). If the density was higher than $0.64 PEG molecules per nm 2 , serumindependent uptake was seen (Fig. 3). \n\nSerum-dependent uptake was more effective than serumindependent uptake, apparently because of the difference in the energy of the GNP-cell interaction. Interestingly, serum-independent uptake was more effective for large GNPs (90 nm) whereas serum-dependent uptake was maximal for 50 nm GNPs. \n\nIt should be noted that immediately on contact of GNPs with blood, lymph, gastric juice, or any other biological liquid in vivo the interaction between GNPs and solvable proteins and other biomolecules results in the formation of a protein \"corona\". 42,43 imilarly to the concept of functionalized GNPs, the concept of  a GNP-protein corona is important in tuning the surface physicochemical properties of GNPs, such as charge, hydrodynamic size and colloidal stability.",

            "text": "LNPs are typically composed of four components: ionizable cationic lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipids (Fig. 1). LNP formulations used for gene silencing in hepatocytes entrap siRNA at a ratio of 0.095 (w/w, siRNA/lipid) and generate ~50 nm particles with narrow size distributions 64 ; this size is crucial to allowing these particles to pass through the fenestrated liver vasculature 65 . We discuss the following factors that have been critical for clinical translation: ionizable cationic lipid optimization, diffusible PEG-lipid design and a robust, scalable manufacturing process. \n\nThe ionizable lipid shape and acid-dissociation constant optimization dramatically improved LNP potency, thereby enabling clinical translation. Permanently cationic lipids such as DOTMA demonstrated toxicities that hindered rapid translation in vivo 66 . Comparatively, ionizable tertiary amine moieties in the lipid headgroup allowed for a net-positive charge at acidic pH and a neutral charge in circulation; the decreased toxicity and lower immune stimulation suggested improved clinical utility 67,68 . Rational design and iterative screening using the murine factor VII (FVII) model identified DLin\u2212MC3\u2212DMA 60 ; its development has been reviewed elsewhere 69 . Optimizing previous-generation lipids, such as DLin\u2212 DAP, improved the therapeutic index 8,000-fold. \n\nAnother key component in determining LNP\u2212siRNA transfection competency is the PEG-lipid, which was required to prevent aggregation during particle formation 70 . However, PEG-lipids inhibited uptake into target cells and were therefore counter-productive for transfection 71 . To find an optimal balance between stability and transfection competency, diffusible PEG-lipids containing C14 alkyl chains were developed 72,73 . In the presence of a lipid sink, these lipids rapidly dissociate from the LNP, generating transfection-competent systems.",

Similar values for the nano-systems' average diameters were obtained when they were incubated in human plasma, except with NLCPOL, where, after 24 h, there was an increase in particle size of ~25%, reaching 157.1 nm (p = 0.0000; p < 0.05; ANOVA) ( Figure 2b). This significant increase in particle size after the incubation of the samples in human plasma was probably related to the formation of protein corona, thus leading to physical instability of the system [28]. From the presented results, it can be concluded that the prepared lipid nano-systems showed an appropriate stability with a 24 h incubation time in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, as well as in the human plasma, except for the NLC sterically stabilized with POL. These results indicate the possible influence of the polymer for steric stabilization on the stability of the nano-systems. This phenomenon could be explained by the differences in the chemical structure and spatial arrangement of the two polymers within the lipid nano-carriers. Namely, in the samples covered with PEG2000-DSPE, PEG groups are anchored to a phospholipid tail (DSPE), which is aligned parallel within the membrane phospholipid molecules of the formulations, allowing for the hydrophilic PEG chains to extend outward. This configuration was shown to decrease the surface hydrophobicity, and therefore reduce the plasma protein adsorption [21]. On the other hand, the large hydrophobic polypropylene oxide block of Poloxamer was probably positioned deeper and closer to the lipid layer of the NLs and NLCs, thereby limiting the degree to which the PEG chains were projected and extended on the surface of the nano-formulations [29].\n\nAccording to the literature data, upon the intravenous administration of nanoparticles in vivo, the adherence of serum biomolecules on the nanoparticles' surfaces could result in particle integrity loss and severely alter the particle properties, which has a major influence on their key performances, including their aggregation behavior, circulation time in vivo,",

This success has motivated research to identify ways to further advance this delivery platform. Here, we characterize the polyethylene glycol lipid (PEG-lipid) components, which are required to control the self-assembly process during formation of lipid particles, but can negatively affect delivery to hepatocytes and hepatic gene silencing in vivo. The rate of transfer from LNPs to plasma lipoproteins in vivo is measured for three PEG-lipids with dialkyl chains 14, 16, and 18 carbons long. We show that 1.5\u2009mol % PEG-lipid represents a threshold concentration at which the chain length exerts a minimal effect on hepatic gene silencing but can still modify LNPs pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Increasing the concentration to 2.5 and 3.5\u2009mol % substantially compromises hepatocyte gene knockdown for PEG-lipids with distearyl (C18) chains but has little impact for shorter dimyristyl (C14) chains. These data are discussed with respect to RNA delivery and the different rates at which the steric barrier disassociates from LNPs in vivo.",

The incorporation of a PEG-lipid into lipid nanovehicles increases colloidal stability in vitro. For example, without a PEG-lipid, the ethanolic environment and low pH of the LNP manufacturing process can accelerate particle fusion to induce particle size amplification. Moreover, PEG-lipids in lipid nanovehicles can prevent serum protein opsonization and MPS clearance and thus prolong their circulation time in vivo. A longer retention time in the blood means that the particles are more likely to distribute to disease sites, such as solid tumors, via the enhanced penetration and retention (EPR) effect. \n\nHowever, a PEG polymer can form a steric barrier that prevents cellular uptake and endosome escape, decreasing RNA delivery efficiency 79 . Various strategies have been developed to address this dilemma. First, PEG can be adopted at a low mole percentage. For example, Semple et al. 58 revealed that a 5-fold increase in siRNA's in vivo delivery efficiency was achieved when the PEG content was decreased from 10% to w1.5%. Second, a PEG-lipid with a short hydrophobic tail can be used. For instance, PEG-C-DMA carries a relatively short myristic lipid anchor (14 carbons), not a stearoyl (18 carbons) tail, as in DSPE-PEG. Thus, PEG-C-DMA gradually detaches from the LNP surface in the circulatory system 80 . This detachment of PEG-C-DMA reduces the PEG density, which is conducive to liposome interaction with cellular or endosomal membranes and, thus, better intracellular delivery. Third, PEGlipids can be covalently decorated with ligands to target cellspecific membrane receptors to increase the cellular uptake of the lipid nanovehicles.",

            "text": "Another recent study shows that the type of sterol used also influences LNP structure and function [42]. In particular, the use of b-sitosterol induced a faceted LNPs surface and resulted in higher intracellular uptake, retention and transfection efficacy than the other analogues. The authors hypothesized that the presence of defects on the surface of b-sitosterol LNPs facilitated fusion with the endosomal membrane. Finally, a slight change in the inner structure of the core occurred as measured by SAXS, as expected, since the core contains sterols to some extent (see previous section and Figure 3g). The use of PEGylated lipids in LNP formulations raises some concerns about activity and safety. For example, PEGylation can accelerate blood clearance through the formation of anti-PEG antibodies, which are increasingly found in healthy population due to the high probability of exposure to PEG-containing product [43,44]. To prevent the disadvantages of PEGylation, efforts are being made to replace this molecule while keeping its essential function. Among these, polysarcosinylated (pSar) lipid was reported to improve safety profile of LNPs and maintain the same in vitro and in vivo effects [45]. LNPs containing pSar lipids mirrored the properties of LNP containing PEGylated lipids: LNP particle size decreased with increasing pSar headgroup and pSarlipid molar ratio, and longer pSar headgroup disrupted the internal order (at lower molar ratios than PEGylated lipids though). The in vitro and in vivo performance of the LNPs showed a similar protein expression for PEGlipid and pSar-lipid, while the safety profile improved for LNPs containing pSar-lipid. Another category of molecules to explore in the future is polyoxazolines, for example, which have been used for other type of NPs instead of PEGylated lipids.",

ApoE in blood serum showed specificity for hepatocytes leading to LNP accumulation in the liver as exploited in Onpattro \u00ae formulation. In this product, the drug patisiran is delivered using LNPs composed of ionizable lipid (DLin-MC3-DMA), phosphatidylcholine derivate (DSPC), cholesterol, and PEG-lipid (PEG2000-C-DMG). Once the drug is administered into the systemic circulation, the PEG-lipid is replaced by serum proteins, mainly ApoE, which interact with the cholesterol component of the lipid complex and target the drug to the liver [117,118]. Furthermore, PEG-lipids can be functionalized with specific ligands such as folate for siRNA delivery or N-acetylgalactosamine for targeting liver hepatocytes [80]. \n\nclearance (\"ABC phenomenon\") observed upon repeated administration, and a hypersensitivity reaction non-IgE-mediated pseudo-allergy, referred to as CARPA (complement activation-related pseudo-allergy), caused by the activation of the complement system, which significantly reduces the efficacy and safety of PEGylated nanocarriers (Figure 6).

With this aim, we now compare the ND 2 -100PEG 500 \u2212OH and ND 5 -360PEG 500 \u2212OH systems, for which, respectively, a 2 nm or 5 nm ND is coated with either 100 or 360 PEG 500 chains. Hence, these two systems are coated with PEG chains of the same length and with the same terminal group, both resulting in a grafting density of 4.6 chains\u2022nm \u22122 . \n\nResults in Table 1 indicate that increasing the dimension of the ND core, and thus reducing the surface curvature, results in a moderate increase in the PEG radius of gyration (5%), endto-end distance (5%) and layer thickness (9%) values. On the contrary, Table 3 shows a 15% decrease in the PEG/water nonbonded interaction energy, after normalization against the number of PEG chains, when going from ND 2 -100PEG 500 \u2212 OH to ND 5 -360PEG 500 \u2212OH. This decrease correlates with the increase in the PEG/PEG chain interaction for the latter system (Table 2). \n\nMoreover, an increase in the mass of the ND slows down the diffusion of the nanosystem (Table S4) but does not affect its zeta potential (Table S5). \n\nIn light of the previous considerations, we conclude that the dimension of the NP core, provided the same PEG length and grafting density, does not significantly affect the polymer presentation and, therefore, we can assume that it is not a crucial parameter that would influence protein corona formation. \n\nFor instance, Zou et al. 22 experimentally confirmed that human plasma corona protein adsorption, together with U937 macrophage cell uptake, is not impacted by the dimension of the NP (30, 50, or 100 nm-sized NDs or SPIONs), but depends on the polymer grafting density, as discussed in the previous section, and on the polymer type (PEG or PG).",

            "text": "Whether the ionizable lipids play a direct role in endosomal uptake has not been thoroughly investigated. Studies on LNP-siRNA accumulation in the liver show that the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on hepatocytes mediates the LNP uptake; in apoE-deficient or LDLR-deficient mice, LNP-siRNA do not display the same gene silencing potency [34]. ApoE is an exchangeable apolipoprotein and a ligand for LDLR-mediated uptake of remnant chylomicrons [35]. Consequently, the apoE adsorption on LNPs turn them into biomimicking remanent chylomicrons that are taken up by hepatocytes. This mechanism clearly demonstrates how, rather than being an obstacle, protein (apoE) corona formation on nanomedicines introduced into blood can be exploited for targeting strategies. ApoE adsorption to liposomes does not drive hepatocyte uptake of negatively charged liposomes [36], and hepatocyte uptake of neutral liposomes is >20-fold lower in apoE-deficient mice. Surface charge, including the composition of the protein adsorbed to lipid-based particles, thus plays a role in the clearance mechanism. When using ionizable lipids/LNPs with an apparent pK a of $6.4, about 10% of the ionizable lipids are positively charged in blood (pH 7.4) according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The surface charge may not only affect the protein corona composition on nanoparticles but also influence the conformation of the adsorbed proteins, including apoE. Taken together, these inquiries show the interplay between nanomedicines, including LNPs and biomolecules such as apoE in biological fluids, is affected by surface composition, surface charge, and particle size [37]. Such interplay determines the in vivo fate of many nanomedicines. More detailed discussions and recent literature about how size and surface charge affect LNP biodistribution will be presented in Section 5.\n\nThe internalization mechanism of the mRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccines following intramuscular (",

In the same cell model but using a different cationic lipid to formulate the LNP, Sahay et al. reported that downregulation of Cdc42 and Rac1 led to 80% decrease in LNP uptake, whereas inhibition of clathrin heavy chain-1 and caveolin-1 had little impact on LNP entry. 205 Together, these studies highlight areas in the design of LNP, which need further optimization and understanding to achieve efficient intracellular delivery.\n\nSince LNP delivery efficiency is influenced by the formation of a protein corona in biological media, one may expect that a healthy individual or a patient suffering of a pathology affecting the serum composition, will have different serum-protein diversity and concentration which could possibly affect the protein-corona composition of LNP and thus alter their activity in vivo, as observed for PLGA nanoparticles. 206 In addition, it is important to note that lipid self-assembly and therefore LNP morphology is driven by biophysical parameters including composition, temperature, pressure, electrostatics and lipid packing which have already been extensively reviewed and are therefore not addressed here. 207\u2212209 Therefore, the morphology and functional response of an RNA-LNP system administrated into a patient with abnormal body temperature (e.g., fever or low-body-temperature-related syndrome) may differ (e.g., protein-corona formation and delivery efficiency) when compared to a healthy volunteer. To date, LNPs have shown efficient delivery of RNA to the liver using passive cellular targeting (size control and protein adsorption). Compositional variations in LNPs have been demonstrated to enhance LNP accumulation in the lung and spleen; 210 however, delivery to other organs remains challenging. Like liposomal systems, LNPs can take advantage of \"natural\" and synthetic targeting processes to actively reach specific tissues and cells. The main strategies rely on proteins, peptides or natural ligands, antibodies or antibody fragments, as well as aptamers. Antibody-mediated targeting has demonstrated success in gene-silencing with LNP systems. As an example, Rameshetti et al. used an anti-CD4",

However, most of these efforts proceed in a \"trial and error\" 423 manner. How these designs can affect delivery efficacy and tissue tropism is largely unpredictable, 424 particularly due to the tremendous diversity of pathophysiological conditions. This severely 425 hinders the development of personalized precision nanomedicine. Understanding corona formation 426 is, on the other hand, an emerging approach for optimizing nanomedicine design towards desirable 427 biological outcomes. 428\n\nOur study demonstrated that individual physiological states can affect LNP function through 429 corona formation. The heterogeneity amongst patients/diseases can hinder the success of clinical 430 nanomedicines, whereas most nanomedicine studies are carried out in unstratified patient 431 populations 52 and, our data suggest that corona composition is more predictive than plasma biomarkers. For example, although animal 12 was classified as obese using relevant biomarkers, 433 its plasma resulted in an LNP corona composition closer to lean plasma-derived corona and eGFP 434 expression similar to the lean group. Our study is the first to show wew LNP designs, informed by 435 corona composition generated in a stratified patient populations or individuals, can improve the 436 delivery of and response to, nanomedicine therapies. 437 Therefore, unbiased corona analysis is essential for decoding the relationships between LNP 438 composition, corona composition, and LNP function. Using a streamlined process for corona 439 isolation, multi-omics corona assessment, and multivariate analysis, we successfully pinpointed 440 HDL as a determinate of LNP mRNA delivery and expression efficacy and, we confirmed this by 441 adding exogenous HDL. Interestingly, we uncovered a relationship between how HDL is 442 associated with the LNP coronas, the amount of free HDL and the cellular capacity for HDL-443 mediated uptake. At higher plasma concentrations, free HDL functioned antagonistically, whereas 444 reduced plasma concentrations resulted in lower free HDL, greater particle uptake and, 445 subsequently, improved mRNA expression.

            "text": "Due to the PEG-transformable end -OH-group, which can transform into various active functional groups, the uses of PEG and PEGylated lipids for LPNs have been one of the most efficient chemical modifications enabling conjunction for target delivery of micro-and nanoparticles [68]. Moreover, PEG can be used as a surfactant that promotes the formation of the hydrated layer of LNPs in solution, thus preventing aggregation of LNPs and enhancing LNP stability [69]. A typical LNP formulation contains four ingredients (Figure 1): ionizable lipids, PEGylated lipids, phospholipids, and cholesterol, in which the ionizable lipids are protonated to encapsulate negatively charged nucleic acids by electrostatic interactions. PEGylated lipids, phospholipids, and cholesterol contribute to the LNPs' structure and stability [70]. Upon administration of LNPs, PEGylated lipids disrupt the equilibrium of surface-lipid compositions, promoting the adsorption of LNPs to serum proteins [69][70][71][72]. For the delivery of nucleic acid materials for gene therapies, LNP surfaces with PEGylated lipids are often decorated with targeting ligands. Lipid-DNA nanoparticles (Genospheres\u2122) were made to effectively target specific cells by the addition of an antibody\u2212lipopolymer (anti-HER2 scFv (F5)-PEG-DSPE) conjugate into the highly PEGylated lipid particles. It was reported that Genospheres could be stably stored under a variety of conditions and were able to achieve a high degree of transfection activity [73]. \n\nLigands can be polymer or lipid molecules, drug-lipid conjugates, and protein\u2212 or peptide\u2212lipid conjugates. They are often synthesized and incorporated into LNPs by the \"in-lipid mixing\" or the \"post-insertion\" methods.",

            "text": "The size of LNPs is a critical parameter for cellular uptake [33,40]. In this work, three parameters impacting LNPs size were studied. First, the PEG-lipid content was shown to have a significant impact on the size of LNPs, as a decrease from 5% to 0.5% multiplies the hydrodynamic diameter by 4. The strong influence of the PEGlipid content has already been reported in the literature and the results obtained are in agreement with those of Belliveau et al. [41] and Yanez Arteta et al. [42]. Furthermore, Bao et al. [43]. showed that LNPs with higher PEG-C-DMA amount altered gene silencing efficacy by potentially reducing endosomal disruption. In addition, several studies reported the presence of anti-PEG antibodies [44,45], therefore the development of new strategies to optimize or replace the PEG lipid was explored [46][47][48][49][50]. But its replacement is tricky and other strategies must be considered for size optimization, especially trying to obtain small-sized LNPs with diameter <100 nm.\n\nTwo other parameters of the formulation that have also been reported to have an impact on LNP size [51] were studied, namely the TFR and the FRR. It appeared in this work that the higher the TFR and the FRR, the smaller the LNPs size. Indeed, the faster the dilution of the ethanol phase in the aqueous phase, the less time needed for lipids to group and stabilize, and the smaller the LNPs size. Therefore, the system used for mixing the organic and the aqueous phases is also a critical point for controlling the LNPs size. To obtain small LNPs of well-defined size, the system must allow a rapid and homogeneous dilution of the ethanolic phase into the aqueous phase by maximizing the contact interface between the two fluids [52,53].\n\nThe sizes, size distributions, and polydispersity indices of the LNPs formulations measured by TDA using CRLI fit [39] were compared to the ones obtained by DLS using Cumulant fit. The size distributions obtained by TDA were all narrower",

            "text": "of studies on nanoparticle organ targeting have focused on how plasma proteins impact delivery outcomes. The composition of the protein corona endows the nanoparticle with a 'biological identity' that has properties distinct from its original, pristine 'synthetic identity' and defines the subsequent fate of a nanoparticle 11,87-89 . The protein corona can even shield active targeting ligands, reducing their efficacy 90,91 . The hydrophobicity, surface chemistry and charge and molecular composition of a nanoparticle all impact the set of plasma proteins that bind to it [92][93][94] . Historically, the protein corona has been associated with detrimental delivery outcomes because of opsonization. Opsonins are proteins that bind to the surface of foreign particulates (including synthetic nanomaterials) in the blood, tagging them for sequestration and degradation by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS; also known as the reticuloendothelial system (RES)) 95 . Coating the nanoparticle surface with PEG or other non-fouling materials is a wellestablished strategy to limit protein corona formation and subsequent phagocytosis. For example, PEG-modified lipids enabled the prolonged plasma circulation of Doxil by reducing opsonization, resulting in one of the first FDA-approved nanoparticle therapeutics 17 . However, growing evidence suggests that proteins distinct from opsonins, such as apolipoproteins, can be incorporated into the protein corona and may play an active role in targeting nanoparticles to specific cells and organs in the body, forming the bedrock of the emerging concept of endogenous targeting 96,97 . As PEGylation can impair protein corona formation, strategies for the controlled removal of PEG to promote adsorption of specific proteins to the nanoparticle surface, such as PEG shedding 97,98 , may be necessary to fully leverage endogenous targeting.\n\nThe conformation of a protein can change following adsorption, resulting in the masking or revealing of epitopes responsible for functional receptor interactions. This conformational change suggests that the structure of the protein corona, beyond its composition, is important for cultivating a desired biological identity [99][100][101] .

These differences manifest in the hydrodynamic size of the NPs. 119 Porous particles decreased the amount of adsorbed proteins due to the size-exclusion effect. 227 In turn, coating NPs with polyethylene glycol (PEG), zwitterionic compounds or polysaccharides can also minimise protein adsorption. 233,234 owever, when targeting ligands are attached to the NP surface, serum proteins interfere with their binding to target cells.

            "text": "Background: When nanoparticles (NPs) are applied into a biological fluid, such as blood, proteins bind rapidly to their surface forming a so-called \u201cprotein corona\u201d. These proteins are strongly attached to the NP surface and confers them a new biological identity that is crucial for the biological response in terms of body biodistribution, cellular uptake, and toxicity. The corona is dynamic in nature and it is well known that the composition varies in dependence of the physicochemical properties of the NPs. In the present study we investigated the protein corona that forms around poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs at different serum concentrations using two substantially different serum types, namely fetal bovine serum (FBS) and human serum. The corona was characterized by means of sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Bradford protein assay, zeta potential measurements, and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). Additionally, the time-dependent cell interaction of PLGA NPs in the absence or presence of a preformed protein corona was assessed by in vitro incubation experiments with the human liver cancer cell line HepG2. Results: Our data revealed that the physiological environment critically affects the protein adsorption on PLGA NPs with significant impact on the NP\u2013cell interaction. Under comparable conditions the protein amount forming the protein corona depends on the serum type used and the serum concentration. On PLGA NPs incubated with either FBS or human serum a clear difference in qualitative corona protein composition was identified by SDS-PAGE and LC\u2013MS/MS in combination with bioinformatic protein classification. In the case of human serum a considerable change in corona composition was observed leading to a concentration-dependent desorption of abundant proteins in conjunction with an adsorption of high-affinity proteins with lower abundance. Cell incubation experiments revealed that the respective corona composition showed significant influence on the resulting nanoparticle\u2013cell interaction. Conclusion: Controlling protein corona formation is still a challenging task and our data highlight the need for a rational future experimental design in order to enable a prediction of the corona formation on nanoparticle surfaces",

            "text": "LNPs composed of five different lipids-PEG and two different ionizable lipids were produced using a rapid-mixing method and were characterized in terms of size (Z-average), polydispersity (PdI) and zeta potential using the DLS; in terms of mean size (Mean), SD, and concentration using the NTA; and in terms of siRNA encapsulation using the Quant-iTTM RiboGreen \u00ae RNA assay. Excepting the CSL3/Cer-PEG formulations, all of the formulations showed a Z-Average (DLS) between 70 and 195 nm and a Mean (NTA) between 80 and 162 nm (Figure 2A). Surprisingly, by DLS, CSL3/Cer-PEG LNPs showed a larger size (around 300 nm) than other LNPs, while by NTA, the size was similar to the others. Based on the results obtained by the two complementary DLS and NTA methods, several parameters were studied. Regarding the impact of the lipid-PEG on the LNP size, for both methods and both ionizable lipids (CSL3 or SM-102 formulations), the DSPE formulation was taken as a control and compared with the other formulations of the corresponding group. Although larger sizes were measured using DLS for the C14 and C8-Ceramide formulations compared to the C18 formulations (over 170 nm for CSL3 and over 100 nm for SM-102 formulations), no significant correlation between lipid-PEG length and LNP size could be made. The impact of the ionizable lipid was then studied for each method by comparing each CSL3 formulation with the corresponding SM-102 formulation including the same lipid-PEG. Slightly smaller sizes were observed for SM-102 formulations using both DLS and NTA methods, and statistical analysis confirmed that SM-102 formulations demonstrated significantly smaller sizes (Z-average and Mean size) compared to the same CSL3 formulation, except for DSPE-PEG LNPs, as shown in Figure 2A. Finally, the impact of the analytical method used was studied by comparing the data obtained by DLS or NTA for each formulation.",

Similar studies were performed on corona-coated Au NPs. Larger sizes favored an higher uptake in HepG2 cells. 55 This increase is possibly due to the difference in composition and conformation of the serum proteins forming PC. Proteins bound to larger NPs tend to undergo conformational changes to adjust in larger surface area and surface curvature. 34 Similar results were obtained by Binnemars-Postma et al. 56 when analyzing the uptake of silica NPs by M1 and M2 macrophages in the presence of serum. Remarkably, 500 nm and 1000 nm NPs had a greater uptake in Monocytic human THP-1 cells than the 200 nm ones. This suggests that the adsorption of serum proteins on larger particles favors the uptake, that the PC which is formed is enriched with complement factors and that IgG likely governs the higher uptake of larger NPs.\n\nConclusively, NPs surface curvature strongly affects the protein adsorption as protein-binding affinities are different for the bulk material and NPs surface. Thus, corona formed on NPs made of the same material differ in composition. 57 Undoubtedly, PC formation is a continuous process with changes in PC composition with time due to the motion of already adsorbed proteins which may be replaced by other proteins having stronger binding affinities until the process reaches an equilibrium which is known as the \"Vroman effect\". 58 On the other hand, in terms of sorting preferred biological medium, it depends on the choice of molecule to be selected in order to form PC which depends on the orientation on the surface and the degree of unfolding which permits various interactions based on the charge, hydrophobicity etc.",

Our LNPs with P80 stabilizer fall size-wise into this range (Z-average \u2248130 nm), which might be one factor explaining their good performance, although the compositional base is different. On the other hand, there is also evidence that LNP sizes < 100 nm are ideal for the performance, [42] suggesting that the effect of size might be highly dependent on the LNP system and cell model. All in all, comparing the data to the existing literature is challenging due to highly varying experimental parameters (e.g., LNP composition, cargo, formulation method, post-processing, buffers, and cell / animal models). Moreover, it is often hard or impossible to adjust only the parameter of interest in these highly dynamic systems. This complexity is demonstrated on a small scale in the work of Palchetti et al., which showed that in the panel of 16 different LNPs, none of the studied physicochemical characteristics (size, aggregation, charge, protein corona fingerprint) alone was exclusively able to account for interactions with HeLa cells.

            "text": "The physicochemical properties of LNPs such as particle size and surface charge are critical for siRNA delivery via systemic administration. When their properties are not satisfactory for systemic drug delivery, almost all LNPs injected are captured by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and rapidly eliminated from the blood, resulting in poor accumulation in a target tissue [108]. To avoid such unfavorable biorecognition, the particle size of LNPs is commonly in the range of 30 to 150 nm; and the surface of LNPs is often covered with PEG. Modification of LNPs with PEG is well known to enhance their dispersibility in aqueous solution and to improve their stability in the blood. On the other hand, the presence of PEG on the surface of LNPs reduces the interaction between LNPs and target cells, which reduction diminishes their internalization into the cells. Therefore, the formulation of PEGylated LNPs should be optimized for the purpose of PEGylation. The amount of a PEG-lipid conjugate for modifying the surface of LNPs strongly influences the physicochemical properties and gene-silencing efficiency of the LNPs [112,113]. It has been reported that the size of LNPs decreases as the proportion of the PEG-lipid conjugate in LNPs increases [31]. Increased PEG density on the surface of LNPs has been shown to reduce the immune response [114]. The structural differences in the length of PEG, fatty acids, and linker of the PEG-lipid conjugate used for modification of LNPs also strongly affect the potential of LNPs. LNPs modified with (R)-3-[(\u03c9-methoxy-PEG-carbamoyl)]-1,2-di-Ooctadecyl-sn-glyceride (C18) showed high blood retention but dramatically reduced gene-silencing effects in the liver [112,113]. This is probably because the interaction between LNPs and cells is reduced or the ability of LNP to adsorb ApoE is reduced, resulting in difficulty in uptake into hepatocytes.

Ultimately, however, the discrete pathways by which tuning the physicochemical properties of formulation components directs LNPs to selectively traffic and express in certain organs and tissues require more detailed mechanistic studies to establish.\n\nThe physicochemical properties of the LNP system also impacts its interactions with serum proteins and consequent formation of a 'protein corona' which further determines particle fate in vivo . A protein corona composed of plasma opsonins, such as fibrinogen, IgG, and complement factors, for example, usually promotes rapid clearance of particles from the circulation [ 203 ]. In contrast, adsorption of plasma proteins like apolipoproteins elongate particle circulation half-lives and enhances interaction with LDL receptors, which facilitate accumulation of the particles in the liver and transportation across the blood-brain barrier [ 46 , 204 ]. Lipoproteins such as ApoE have been utilized for siRNA-LNP decoration due to their capacity to induce internalization into hepatocytes [171] , with interactions between ApoE-bound LNPs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans shown to further promote rapid uptake [205] , and albumin coating has recently been harnessed for mRNA-LNP delivery to the liver through apolipoprotein E (ApoE) independent cellular pathways [ 206 ].

            "text": "One major feature, and limitation at times, with LNP delivery is their propensity for liver accumulation, where they are taken up by the RES [105]. Upon systematic administration [106], various serum electrolytes, proteins, and lipids will adsorb onto the LNP's surface and form the so-called \"biomolecular corona\" [107]. This corona can significantly influence the journey of systematically administered NPs from biodistribution and cellular uptake [108] to systematic circulations and nano-bio interactions [109]. The composition of ionizable lipid particles can have a considerable effect on the formed corona [110]. ApoE is one of the most implicated serum proteins that play a significant role in the clearance and endogenous LNPs targeting to hepatic cells [72]. The delivery of nucleic acids to the liver is partly attributed to the organ's well-perfused nature and its fenestrations as well [100]. It has been recognized that LNPs accumulate in different cells present within the liver [111][112][113]. Particle size, lipase sensitivity, and apparent pKa are some characteristics that govern the intrahepatic distribution of LNPs [114]. Chen et al. investigated the effect of particle size on influencing the tissue penetration and potential of LNP formulations of siRNA. They injected the LNPs intravenously into mice and found that regardless of the size, the majority of LNPs were found 24 h after injection in the liver. Less than 1% of the LNP formulations were found in the kidney, pancreas, lung, heart and femur. However, ~10% of the 80 nm size LNPs was found in the spleen. Since the particle size did not seem to be heavily involved in liver accumulation, they further investigated other parameters that can reduce the potency of small LNPs for silencing. In the end, they concluded that there was a clear hierarchy of LNP formulated siRNAs' capability for gene silencing (78 > 42 > 38 > 27 > 117 nm).",

            "text": "LNPs possess high free energy due to their small size and large surface area, which promotes their interactions with biological macromolecules in biological fluids. Upon entering systemic circulation, NPs acquire a protein corona (PC), a layer of adsorbed proteins that alters their biological identity [121]. Protein adsorption on LNPs depends on both the surface charge and the type of coating used. Studies have shown that high surface charge density increases protein adsorption, while specific coatings, such as Poloxamers, can enhance selective protein adsorption [122] and facilitate the BBB uptake process [123]. Conversely, proteins from the complement system, known as opsonins, mark LNPs for recognition by the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), thereby accelerating their clearance and reducing their systemic circulation time [124]. \n\nTo avoid rapid opsonization and MPS clearance, stealth NPs have been developed using PEG coatings, which delay PC formation and extend NP half-life in circulation. However, PEGylation has limitations, such as anti-PEG antibody production and reduced cellular internalization. Alternative strategies, including stimuli-responsive PEG derivatives, have been explored to address these challenges [125]. Other strategies have also been proposed to reduce or avoid PC formation, such as coating NPs with substances like glutathione or functionalizing their surfaces with polymers to minimize non-specific interactions [126]. Synthetic polymer conjugates, like amphiphilic N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer, can provide NPs with an \"invisibility cloak\" against serum proteins [127]. Recent advancements suggest that using cell membrane fragments as nanoparticle surface coatings can enhance their circulation time and targeting capability [128]. These hybrid nanomaterials combine the properties of biological cell membranes with those of synthetic nanoparticles [129]. This approach provides immune camouflage, reduces leukocyte uptake, and offers the potential to target non-immune cells like astrocytes and neurons. Membrane-coated nanoparticles and cell membrane-derived nanovesicles are emerging strategies for novel diagnostic and therapeutic applications across various diseases.",

            "text": "In the past two decades, nanoparticles (NPs) for medical applications have been investigated by numerous researchers. The NPs based theranostic agents combine, in a unique formulation, tracking, imaging, diagnosis, cell-targeting and drug delivery properties. In this emerging field of nanomedicine, Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (MSN) are considered as a promising platform for drug-delivery and cell targeting [1]. However, the major obstacle for NPs' accumulation at the site of interest is the rapid opsonization of the NPs by the liver and spleen macrophages. This opsonization is due to the formation of a protein corona at the surface of the NPs when they enter in contact with biological media [2]. The composition of the corona is particularly dependent on the NPs composition, surface charge and hydrophobicity [3]. Moreover, the protein corona influences the toxicity of the NPs [4]. Different proteins adsorb on native MSN [5], on liposomes prepared with various lipid compositions [6] and in the presence of polymeric groups [7][8][9][10][11]. Grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) groups on the NPs is well-known to induce a stealth effect of the NPs [12]. The NPs coated with PEG groups present a longer circulation time, and escape the reticuloendothelial system (RES) capture [13]. The PEG coating brings hydrophilicity at the surface of NPs. Water molecules interact via hydrogen bonds with the PEG moieties, enhancing the hydrodynamic diameter of the NPs [12]. However, this type of grafting induces aggregation in high saline concentration solution [14]. In fact, we previously demonstrated that MSN needed a precise amount of PEG in surface in order to avoid aggregation of particles. If the quantity was not optimized, PEG grafting did not improve colloidal stability [15].

            "text": "We present a workflow that combines in situ optical analysis of the protein corona by MP-SPR coupled with sensitive nLC-MS/ MS analysis of the hard and soft corona subsections. The synthesis of a reusable pTHMMAA-BDA-biosensor for liposome capture and reduced sensor protein binding is presented. For proof-of-concept, corona formation on regular liposomes and light-triggered liposomes was studied under dynamic conditions in 100% human plasma, revealing significant formulation-dependent differences in the structure and composition of both corona subsections. Separate clusters for HC and SC suggest differences in the ensuing biological responses for these corona subtypes. The clinically-optimized formulation covered with PEG-ICG clusters (F2) formed a distinct SC signature; it contained proteins reported to mediate nanoparticle stealth properties, previously reported only in the HC. This highlights the importance of complementary soft corona characterization to obtain a holistic picture of the acquired biological identity. The relative enrichment of stealth-mediating proteins on all liposome surfaces suggests that lipids alone may induce their selective accumulation in the corona regardless of pegylation. Pegylated surfaces accumulated more molecules on their surfaces and formed thicker coronas, overperformed by the repellent properties of phosphatidylcholine groups on bare liposomes, but this \"harvesting\" may be necessary for the stealth effect mediated by hydrophilic coatings. While surface mass densities were similar for the corona subsections, thickness and protein-to-lipid values clearly discerned between the different formulations. Combined, both the physical structures and the proteomic compositions of the coronas were modulated by the surface coating of the liposome and the constituent lipid composition. Notably, this is the first time that truly complementary proteomic compositions for a hard and soft corona have been reported along with non-invasively obtained in situ physical parameters in one experiment. By facilitating studies on tailored, personalized, and artificial coronas with liposomes and lipid nanoparticles, the workflow has potential to advance nanomedical development and clinical translation especially in the field of drug delivery.",

            "text": "lerability, we dosed mice at a constant siRNA dose of 1.5, 2, and 10 mg/kg using formulations of differing lipid:siRNA ratios. Consequently, animals dosed with formulations with higher lipid:siRNA ratios received higher doses of the lipid components. Animals were observed, body weights were recorded, and serum was collected for analysis of Factor VII gene silencing 2 days after administration. At the two lower doses, all formulations were well tolerated and normal weight gain was observed. However, at the  10 mg/kg dose, only the formulation with lipid:siRNA ratio of 7.5:1 was associated with normal weight gain. At the highest dose level we observed a dose-dependent trend in decreased tolerability as lipid:siRNA ratio increased from 7.5:1 to 30:1 as evidenced by a trend in weight loss and death of the animals in the 30:1 formulation group (Figure 2c). All formulations mediated effective silencing of Factor VII in vivo, with a slight trend in decreased efficacy as lipid:siRNA ratio is lowered (Figure 2d). Although we recognized the slight decrease in efficacy at lower lipid:siRNA ratios, we felt that the increase in tolerability outweighed this effect; thus, we confirmed our initial choice of using the minimum amount of lipid required to encapsulate siRNA and settled on a final lipid:siRNA ratio of 7.5:1 (wt:wt).\n\nPeG lipid alkyl chain length dramatically affects in vivo activity PEG influences particle interaction with cells, biological matrices, and blood components, which in turn affect efficacy and toxicity. 38 The extent of particle PEGylation and the rates at which particles lose PEG shielding are known to have significant effects on formulation pharmacokinetics. 39 Because the lipid portion of the PEGlipid conjugate enables PEG to be hydrophobically, rather than covalently, incorporated into the particles, the PEG exchange, and thus, deshielding rate, can be controlled by changing the hydrophobicity of the PEG lipid. This can be accomplished by varying the length of the alkyl chain lipid anchor. 40 Initially, we explored the use of lipid anchor lengths of 14,",

            "text": "In parallel to the protein group analysis, serum albumin was found to be by far the most abundant corona protein for every nanocarrier formulation. While serum albumin presence was detected in the range of 48% (5 kDa PEG-DBCO) to 72% (mgHES), the other six most abundant proteins were observed with a relative abundance of less than 7% each. The whole mouse plasma control group showed a comparable distribution with the most abundant proteins (Figure S6). \n\nApart from complement C3, none of the other abundant murine proteins is thought to influence uptake by macrophages. C3 coated on nanocarriers, however, can lead to an increased internalization of NCs by macrophages through complement receptor ligation when being activated by pathway-specific C3 convertases [42,43]. However, the relatively low abundance of C3 on each nanocarrier formulation (~2%) indicates that C3-induced uptake by macrophages only plays a minor role in this carrier system. Walkey et al. demonstrated that higher PEG grafting densities control a decrease and change in the composition of the protein corona, where the nanoparticle size and the PEG density together determine the macrophage uptake [44]. In contrast, PEGylation of the nanocarrier formulations described here increased the rate of protein adsorption in comparison to the pristine nanocarriers (Figure S7). Nevertheless, this increase in corona protein adsorption did not diminish the stealth effect of PEGylated nanocarriers. In addition, the physicochemical properties of the PEGylation with and without a protein corona were evaluated with respect to nanocarrier size and surface charge (Table S1). Multi-angle dynamic light scattering revealed a larger size of pristine nanocarriers compared to the PEGylated formulations in protein-free media, and a smaller particle size under protein corona conditions. This might be due to changes in the light scattering properties and/or a reduction in aggregation after PEGylation. Regarding the surface charge of the nanocarriers, all samples presented a rather neutral zeta potential, which consistently appeared slightly negative for all mouse plasma pre-incubated nanocarrier formulations.",

Indeed, we are currently unaware of any nanomaterial functionalization that can completely prevent the formation of a biomolecule corona in complex environments. The design and synthesis of such nanodevices represents one of the key challenges required not only to finally understand the regulation and impact of the biomolecule corona but also to allow novel nanomaterial applications.",

The peaks on the DLS fractograms of nanoparticles incubated with plasma over the range of the retention times between 10 and 20 min are likely to be plasma proteins, suggested by an overlay of the chromatogram of 20% human plasma (Supplementary Figure S17). LNP-RNP particles show a significantly higher derived count rate after incubation with plasma (Figure 2D). These results indicate that these LNP do interact with the plasma components, suggesting formation of a protein corona on the surface of the LNP [32].

            "text": "By changing the PEG lipid anchor length, it is possible to tune its shedding rate from the LNP surface, which is essential to promote cellular uptake and endosomal escape. Phospholipids and cholesterol are also employed as contributors to the LNP structural integrity and phase transition behavior. They assist on the mRNA encapsulation and ensure LNP stability over time (190). The versatility of the LNP platform allows for a multitude of modifications in the lipid components and/or proportions to achieve specific characteristics that make them preferentially accumulate in specific organs (195). Moreover, the LNP itself can possess immunogenic properties, which may be reduced to decrease inflammation and deleterious interactions (196)(197)(198). As addressed in this review, LNPs can also be functionalized with molecules that specifically interact with cellular receptors to increase their uptake by target cells. This is the concept behind the design of active targeting nanoparticles, which we believe represents the basis for the future of mRNA vaccines. \n\nAs seen above, antibodies are bullets of choice to target LNPs toward a specific receptor (Table 1). Antibodies are generally conjugated to LNPs after their formulation using PEGylated lipids with functional terminal groups, such as maleimide (199). This process is rather straightforward, but it is difficult to characterize the obtained functionalized particles and to quantify the conjugated antibodies (200). Moreover, chemically conjugating an antibody on the LNP surface does not offer full control of its orientation, and may result in antibodies unable to properly interact with their targets [although this field is making considerable progresses (201)]. \n\nRegarding LNP small molecule-functionalization, so far two main strategies have been described: through PEG or through cholesterol (Figure 3). Mannosylated PEG has been one of the first examples of sugar-based targeting to deliver GFP DNA to Kupfer cells in vitro and in vivo (86). PEG has been seen as the ideal candidate to ensure maximum ligand exposure as compared to cholesterol, since its hydrophilic tail is exposed toward the environment, as opposed to cholesterol, which is in the LNP inner structure.",

            "text": "The LNP formulation used in the current work (Scheme 1A) is composed of ionizable amino lipid (DLin-DMA), a zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine, DSPC), cholesterol and a coat lipid (polyethylene glycol-dimyristolglycerol, PEG-DMG) at a fixed molar ratio of 40:10:48:2 [30]. The head-group of DLin-DMA lipids contains tertiary amines with a pKa 6-7 which can be readily protonated at lower pH and become cationic in the endosomes, facilitating endosomal escape LNPs to cytosol. LNPs with neutral charge at physiological pH appear to be less immunoreactive than cationic lipids with a fixed charge such as DOTAP [10,11]. DSPC interacts with the mRNA through its choline group and helps stabilizing the LNP both during formulation and circulation. Cholesterol gets evenly dispersed on the surface and core, ensuring efficient lipid packaging and providing rigidity to the particles. PEG coating enables to control particle size during formulation, preventing aggregation and enhancing the stability of particles. LNPs herein described were designed to shed PEG rapidly upon intravenous injection [11], thus exposing the mannoses in vivo. \n\nFor mannose incorporation onto LNP, part of cholesterol was replaced with a hydrolytically stable conjugate of mannose glycans with cholesterol amine, as we described recently [30]. We also envisaged that the larger was the mannan, the lower would be the masking effect from PEG, so that receptor engagement would occur also in case of delayed PEG shedding. \n\nTo achieve the synthesis of the target conjugates, the mannan structures 1-4 were prepared with an aminopropyl linker as we recently reported in literature [40]. Mannose 1 was conjugated to cholesterol as described in our recent report [30].",

[38] went on to show that the binding to a solid-supported endosomal membrane was greater at pH 5 than pH 6 and that the onset of LNP binding was shifted to lower pH when the LNPs had been incubated with a protein corona. Complementary to these studies on the binding of LNPs to model membranes, serum protein binding to LNPs have been assessed using QCM-D to probe protein binding affinity on LNP-coated surfaces and to correlate this binding with LNP protein expression [39]. It will be intriguing to follow the ways in which such works extend in the future, such as the use of additional techniques to quantify aspects already discussed such as lipid exchange and transport across the membrane, among others. In this way, the ideas behind the molecular mechanisms for endosomal escape will be advanced, which will certainly represent a key step forward in the development of LNP-based therapies.",

            "text": "PK and BD data for siRNA LNPs indicate that the mechanism of LNP removal from the circulation does not exhibit the same PEG-lipid threshold effect as seen for hepatic gene silencing. At 1.5 mol % PEG-lipid the circulation half-life of 14 C-MC3-labeled LNPs (estimated over 24 hours) for PEG-C14, -C16, and -C18 LNPs is 0.64, 2.18, and 4.03 hours respectively. There is also a marked decrease in liver and spleen uptake with increasing chain length. These data indicate that both 1.5 mol % PEG-C16 and -C18 steric barriers reduce the association of opsonins with LNPs in the circulation. The reason for the different PEG effects for opsonin induced clearance and Apo E-mediated uptake are not known at this time, but may reflect the molecular weights of the various proteins involved and their ability to penetrate a low density PEG shield. \n\nDespite the differences in liver uptake between LNPs containing 1.5 mol % PEG-C14 and PEG-C18 they exhibit similar gene silencing activities, indicating that delivery to the liver alone is not a limiting factor for activity under these dosing conditions. As might be expected, a comparison of 14 C-MC3 to 3 H-PEG-lipid in liver shows that the amount of 3 H-label taken up reflects the rates of transfer to lipoproteins and erythrocytes while LNPs are in the circulation (Figure 5c,d). However, it is interesting to note that by 24 hours, >50% of the 3 H-PEG-C14 accumulated in the liver at 2 hours has been eliminated whereas the concentration of 3 H-PEG-C18 remains constant. The 3 H-label is located in the alkyl chains, which are joined to the headgroup by metabolically stable ether linkers. 17 Consequently, the differences in liver processing between the short and long chain PEG-lipids may also be related to lipid transfer rates and perhaps reflect PEG-C14 excretion into bile rather than metabolism.",

As seen from DSC curves, LNPs with higher concentrations > 20 mol% resulted in the disappearance of the melting peak due to lateral phase separation which is also supported by previous report [47].\n\nIn the presence of 1 mol% of DSPE-PEG5000 lipids, the T m was found to be 42.06 \u00b1 0.34 \u00b0C at the end of week 1, which increased to 44.11 \u00b1 0.78 \u00b0C and accompanied by a 23% decrease in enthalpy shown as narrowing of the melting peak.\n\nAt 10 mol% PEG-5000, a slight shift in T m to 42.92 \u00b0C is accompanied by a significant reduction enthalpy by 79%. Slight increase in transition temperature with a significant decrease in enthalpy at the end of four weeks in samples containing DSPE-PEG5000 is attributed to the increased mobility of PEG-5000 by virtue of the increased chain length that results in ancillary inter and intra molecular interactions, increasing the internal energy within the bilayer regions of LNPs. However, at 20 mol%, a very broad peak at 43.17 \u00b1 0.18 \u00b0C with an enthalpy of 0.49 \u00b1 0.12 J.g \u22121 , at the end of week 1 was observed. Subsequently, at week 4, there was a shift of T m to 42.79 \u00b1 0.42 \u00b0C, with an increase in 28% enthalpy. The longer the PEG chain length in LNP bilayer, larger are the van der Waals forces the between the PEG molecules in the lipid head group and outer leaflet regions, that furthers higher transition temperatures [98,99]. The overall reduction in enthalpy in the DSPE-PEG5000 formulations is congruent with formulations containing 10 and 20 mol% DSPE-PEG2000.\n\nConsequently, differential scanning calorimetry studies and thermodynamic correlations provide indications of thermal stability of the LNPs, and resultant molecular perturbations caused integration of DSPE-PEG lipids into the DC 8,",

A size dependency in biomolecular corona composition was observed for both types of charged PSt NPs. For example, 100 nm negatively charged PSt NPs displayed a higher fraction of unique proteins, including Ig mu chain C region, apolipoprotein L1, and complement C1q, present in their coronas, as demonstrated by low homology in biomolecule composition compared to similar 50 nm NPs. \n\nThe connection between NP hydrophobicity and protein association has been also demonstrated to be of great importance. Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to assess the stoichiometry, affinity, and enthalpy of NP-protein interactions (Cedervall et al., 2007;Lindman et al., 2007). Titration of human serum albumin into solutions of NPs comprised of different compositions of N-isopropylacrylamine (NIPAM): N-tertbutylacrylamide (BAM), it was found that more hydrophobic NPs (50:50) bound higher numbers of albumin than more hydrophilic NPs (85:15). Larger NPs bound more albumins than smaller NP counterparts. Importantly, it was also shown that apolipoprotein A-I association was 50-fold greater for 50:50 NPs than 65:35 NPs, demonstrating favorable interactions of the proteins with the hydrophobic NPs. \n\nAlthough correlations have been found with those properties, it should be noted that they could only act as predictive indicators of biomolecule association to NPs. This is important since the composition of biomolecules associated with NPs in vitro has been shown to be different than in vivo (Sakulkhu et al., 2014b).",

            "text": "Upon contact with protein-rich biofluids (e.g., blood, plasma), mRNA-LNPs are known to dynamically exchange the lipid components with proteins, generating the so-called \"protein corona\" which influences their biodistribution, efficacy, and toxicity in vivo. [42] A recent lipid profiling study has elucidated that ALC-LNP dissociates immediately after exposure to human plasma via desorption of lipid components, such as PEG-lipid and ALC-0315, resulting in a reduction in the particle molecular mass and DLS light scattering signal. [43] Since the lipid displacement is thought to occur mainly via hydrophobic interactions, [44] the poor mucus stability of ALC-LNP was likely caused by its interactions with mucin proteins having abundant hydrophobic domains. [7] It has been documented that the alkyl chain length of PEG-lipids strongly impacts their desorption rates from LNPs.  Hence, the existence of DSPE-PEG (C18 PEG-lipid), triolein (a triglyceride having three C18 oleoyl chains), and DOTMA (C18 cationic lipid) might, at least partly, render iLLN-2/mRNA complexes more resistant to mucin-mediated disintegration by increasing hydrophobic attractions among the lipid components. [46] o date, only a few studies have explored the possibility of mRNA-LNPs for intranasal administration, [11,47] but most of them have shown limited mucosal IgA response. 47c] In addition, a primeboost nasal vaccination with 10 \u03bcg of mRNA/poly(amine-co-ester) complexes generated antigen-specific IgG in BALF, but not IgA response, suggesting that IgA-secreting B cells in lymph nodes were not effectively recruited to the respiratory tract.

            "text": "Studies have demonstrated that anionic liposomes modified with PEGs could achieve enhanced clearance at the site of subcutaneous administration and increased retention in the lymph nodes when compared to liposomes that were not modified. Liposomes modified with shorter PEG chains exhibited higher retention but lower clearance in the lymph nodes compared to liposomes modified with longer PEG chains. Therefore, the targeting behavior and transfection capability of LNPs can be significantly influenced by the selection of a linear or branched PEG chain [110]. In addition to passive cellular uptake and prolonged circulation, nanoparticle uptake into target cells can be improved by attaching a receptor ligand to the particle surface. Enhancing the uptake of nanoparticles into target cells can be achieved through methods other than relying on prolonged circulation and passive cellular uptake, such as utilizing a receptor ligand that is conjugated to the particle surface. The incorporation of targeting ligands into lipid-based nanoparticles is a strategy for efficiently targeting delivery systems to specific tissues or cells, including the lymph nodes and other desired locations. The ASSET platform (Anchored Secondary scFv Enabling Targeting) was developed through the conjugation of anti-Ly6C antibodies onto lipid-based nanoparticles that were loaded with siRNA, which selectively targets inflammatory leukocytes in vivo [111,112]. Cell-penetrating peptides have demonstrated their effectiveness in facilitating the intracellular delivery of a diverse range of pharmacologically interesting molecules across various types of cells and show promise in enhancing the intracellular delivery of a wide array of biologically active agents [113]. LNPs have been modified with cell-penetrating peptides, such as R8 and GALA, to improve the uptake of these particles in dendritic cells and to enhance the immune response [114]. The exposure of LNPs to biological fluids causes the biomolecules to be rapidly adsorbed onto their surface, generating the protein corona. Initially, the protein corona comprises significant quantities of low-affinity proteins prevalent in the biological environment. As time progresses, the corona's makeup becomes enhanced with high-affinity proteins [115].",

            "text": "In the second maturation step, removal of ethanol by dialysis against physiological buffer (pH 7.4) deprotonates the ionizable lipid and stabilizes LNPs. Inherently, LNPs contain at least five additional kinds of dynamic elements that determine their potency in a bioresponsive fashion; i) a PEG-lipid that, based on short (commonly dimyristyl) lipid anchors, is sheddable upon interaction with serum proteins in blood circulation; ii) a cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine envelope that triggers the formation of an apolipoprotein E-rich surface protein corona, facilitating receptor-mediated endocytosis into liver hepatocytes via the low-density lipoprotein receptor; iii) a cationizable tertiary amine-containing lipid (Fig. 1A), which after cellular uptake into acidifying endosomes becomes positively charged and changes physical properties; iv) interaction of cationized and anionic lipids trigger membrane destabilization promoting crossing of the endosomal barrier (Fig. 1B); and v) merging nanoparticle lipids with the cellular lipid membrane lead to release of the nucleic acid payload into the cytosol to a significant extent in carrier-free, bioavailable form (32)(33)(34). Consequently, the LNP composition strongly influences protein corona formation, endogenous receptor targeting, and functional activity (35). \n\nAs multicomponent assemblies, LNPs can be improved by combinatorial variation of phospholipids, PEG-lipid, cholesterol analogs, and/or the ionizable lipid. Optimizing the cationizable lipid structure (Fig. 1A) by modifying hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic tails, optionally including degradable bonds, was key for the LNP efficacy (27,(36)(37)(38). First breakthrough was the replacement of permanent cationic lipids such as DOTMA or DOTAP by ionizable tertiary amine-containing lipids. The dynamic reversible protonation both enhances efficacy and eliminates potential toxicity problems of permanently cationic materials.",

            "text": "Suzuki et al. [67] revealed the influence of PEG shedding rate on the blood clearance of PEGylated LNPs.Specifically, faster PEG shedding led to attenuated production of anti-PEG immunoglobulin M (IgM), indicating that optimization of the kinetics of PEG shedding can improve the circulation and biodistribution of LNPs in the body.Moreover, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of siRNA-loaded LNPs could be influenced by the desorption rate of PEG.It is essential to understand the kinetics of PEG dissociation, as it directly impacts the duration and effectiveness of the therapeutic payload in target tissues.Mui et al. [35] first investigated the gene knockdown efficiency associated with PEG length and PEG content within LNPs.Their group found that hydrophobic interactions with cell membranes were proportional to the PEG alkyl length.Specifically, when fixing PEG content at 1.5%, C16 and C18 PEG need more time to shed from the surface of LNPs compared to C14 PEG.When increasing the PEG content from 1.5% to 3%, C14 PEG LNPs showed a gradual decline in gene knockdown, while C18 PEG completely lost its function when its content was higher than 1.5%.This phenomenon can be attributed to the longer alkyl length of C18 PEG, which increased the hydrophobicity of PEG lipid, and hindered the interaction with the cell membrane.As a result, longer alkyl length required more energy for LNPs to adopt a monolayer transition state, leading to shedding of PEG from the LNP surface.Thus, C18 PEG has a longer circulation time after administration but still holds its ability with 1.5% threshold concentration.\n\nIn another aspect, PEG shedding is due to the pH change during the endocytosis process.A study by Hashiba and colleagues [68] demonstrated the benefits of pH-labile PEGylation in siRNA-loaded LNPs for hepatocyte targeting and gene silencing activity.The study highlighted that pH-responsive PEG lipids facilitated improved active targeting and gene silencing efficacy in hepatocytes.",

The % injected dose that distributes to the spleen is much less than the liver as it is a much smaller organ but the chain length trends are similar. \n\nIn summary, we demonstrate that the presence of a 1.5 mol % PEG 2000 -lipid steric barrier does not significantly affect in vivo hepatic gene silencing for siRNA LNPs. However, increasing the PEG-lipid concentration by just 1 mol % can significantly reduce activity unless a short chain PEG-C14 is used, which rapidly desorbs from LNPs in the circulation and transfers to lipoproteins and erythrocytes. Moreover, different combinations of PEG-lipid chain length and concentration can be employed to modify the PK and BD of siRNA LNPs without greatly impacting hepatic gene silencing.",

            "text": "Although intensive research has been conducted in the last years, the protein corona still remains one of the biggest obstacles in successfully launching nanoparticulate drug formulations on the market [ 36 , 37 ]. Therefore, a closer look on corona proteins could contribute to identify NP parameters which are beneficial for effective active targeting after corona formation. For characterization of corona proteins, onedimensional SDS-PAGE as well as LC-MS/MS analysis was performed. The corona proteins of HSA-NP, different antibody-modified NPs and the proteins in native human serum were analyzed. As expected, SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the most intensive band for HS control was HSA as it is the most abundant protein in HS [38] . In contrast to that, HSA bands for NP systems were less intense. Additionally other bands appeared for the NP samples, showing that NPs could enrich different proteins in their corona compared to the native serum. Most strikingly, all NP systems showed similar band patterns only varying in their intensity. The increased surface hydrophilicity of PEGylated NPs consequently caused less protein adsorption compared to non-PEGylated NPs [39] . In conclusion, these results indicate that the selection of the spacer does not have an influence on the identity of the adsorbed proteins, but mainly affects their quantity. \n\nIn addition, data-dependent LC-MS/MS analysis was performed to identify corona proteins and gather more specific information on their corresponding physiological functions and other protein characteristics. This data was used to obtain new insights on favorable NP characteristics and modifications. Many different proteins were identified for all NP samples, but upon PEGylation the number of identified proteins decreased. One example was beta-2-glycoprotein 1, which acts as an opsonin. It was only identified on HSA-NP, but not on PEGylated NPs (Table S5). This was in accordance with a recent publication of our group, where beta-2-glycoprotein 1 was only found in the corona of PLGA-NP, but not in the corona of PLGA-PEG-NP [21] . Moreover, the decrease of identified proteins correlated with PEG spacer length.",

            "text": "One of the greatest advantages of PEGylation for biomedical applications is the high solubility in aqueous medium provided by the PEG chains (D'souza and Shegokar, 2016;Knop et al., 2010;Turecek et al., 2016). It has been reported that an ethylene oxide unit can bind two to three water molecules (Branca et al., 2002;Oelmeier et al., 2012;Kolate et al., 2014;Turecek et al., 2016). This solubility creates a \"conformational cloud\", generated by the flexible polymer chains, which hides the charges and provides a steric hindrance, preventing the interaction with other PEGylated NPs, reducing aggregation and providing a high chemical-physical stability (Knop et al., 2010;Gupta et al., 2019). At the same time, the conformational freedom of the PEG chains makes the interaction with other matter thermodynamically unfavourable, decreasing the interactions of the PEGylated products with other biomolecules (Pino et al., 2014;Yang and Lai, 2015;Suk et al., 2016;Fam et al., 2020). In this regard, it has been well established that NPs in contact with the biological environment adsorb biomolecules, such as lipids or proteins, forming the so-called bio-corona. This biomolecular coating dictates the biological \"identity\" of the NPs, affecting their activity, biodistribution and clearance (Cedervall et al., 2007;Nel et al., 2009;Monopoli et al., 2011;Monopoli et al., 2012;Clemente et al., 2022). When these proteins are opsonins, the NPs are recognized by the MPS, and they are eliminated. However, proteins in the corona may also act as dysopsonins (Sch\u00f6ttler et al., 2016). The MPS is a network of cells descending from monocytes, including tissue-resident macrophages in the liver and spleen, that engulf foreign substances (particles and pathogens).",

            "text": "The lifetime of the hard corona has been shown to be several hours and it can define the NP surface properties. Since the biomolecules compete for the limited surface on NPs, at first NPs will be covered by more abundant small molecules, and subsequently replaced by the larger and high affinity molecules over time, to form the hard corona [80,81]. Lipoproteins are formed when lipids bind to the apo-lipoproteins to facilitate their transportation. NPs can bind to the lipoproteins as a corona structure [82]. Recent investigations have shown that the NPs not only bind to the apo-lipoproteins but also interact with the lipoprotein [83]. \n\nOne of the major challenges for targeted delivery of NPs is their cellular uptake by phagocytes [84]. In a biological environment, NPs can be surrounded by various types of biomolecules including proteins of the extracellular matrix, serum albumin, apo-lipoproteins, complement components and immunoglobulins which will form the corona. The receptors expressed on the phagocytic cell membranes attach to the proteins on the surface of NPs and internalize them [84,85]. Even if the phagocytes do not uptake NPs, the corona layer covers the ligands, and the NPs are not recognized by the targeted cells, and lose their specificity [86]. One of the most common and efficient solutions for this problem is coating NPs with a barrier-like layer composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG), called PEGylation. PEG chains on the surface of NPs create steric hindrance, which inhibits the protein adsorption and decreases recognition by macrophages [87]. \n\nOne of main goals in targeted delivery is to internalize NPs into specific cells by an endocytosis pathway such as clathrin, caveolin, etc. Studies on targeted drug delivery have shown that NPs lose their specificity when coated with corona. Corona not only changes the surface composition and structure of NPs, which directly influences the cell-NP interactions, but also affects the geometry and size of NPs, which play a crucial role in cellular uptake [88].",

In order to investigate how the coating of the particles determines their biointeractions and how it governs their biological fate, the protein amounts were semi-quantitatively analysed by applying the spectral-counting method. The NpSpCk represents the total number of the MS spectra for all peptides attributed to a matched protein divided by its molecular weight (Mw) in Da. This ratio takes into account the protein size and evaluates the real contribution of each protein to the corona composition [29]. As shown in Figure 5, the relative abundance of proteins on the surface of both types of nanoparticles was comparable. In general, it is assumed that PEGylation extends blood circulation times through a significant reduction in protein binding, which is responsible for its \"stealth\" behaviour in vivo [66,67]. In line with this idea, different studies have correlated the amount of bound proteins (as an indicator of opsonization) with cell internalization or half-life circulation and measured reduced protein adsorption to nanoparticles incorporating PEGylated components [68][69][70]. In contrast, other studies have demonstrated that PEGylation increases half-life in the blood but does not reduce protein adsorption. In fact, several studies have reported that PEGylation increases protein binding [67].\n\nOverall, PEGylation of the nanoparticles did not show a significant variation in their interactions with the proteins according to their biological function. However, the analysis of the relative abundance of the top three most represented proteins in the corona of the nanoparticles (serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-I and Ig kappa chain C region) showed that PEGylation reduced the content of the apolipoprotein and has an enriched amount of albumin in the surface compared with NP-DMSA ( Figure 6). Proteins like immunoglobulins and apolipoproteins are considered opsonins that promote clearance of NPs via interaction with macrophage receptors [71]. In contrast, the enrichment in dysopsonins proteins like albumin promote prolonged",

            "text": "The protein corona acquired by nanoparticles within the first few hours of injection largely dictates their biological identity and affects their performance [78]. Control over protein corona formation and composition is therefore therapeutically relevant and has historically been reduced through PEGylation to prevent nanoparticle clearance. Interestingly, PEG often comprises the entire surface of polymersomes due to its incorporation into the block copolymer, while the degree of PEGylation for liposomes is limited to low molecular ratios [79]. Consequently, the polymersome surface most likely constitutes of dense PEG chains in 'brush' conformation, which may result in a distinct biological identity compared to that of liposomes with PEG chains in a collapsed 'mushroom' state. Nevertheless, the biological identity of PEGbased polymersomes has not been fully elucidated yet and may also depend on interactions between physicochemical properties, including surface chemistry and functionalization. \n\nRecently, Scott and colleagues have made initial steps towards controlling the biological identity of PEG-based polymersomes. They screened a small library composed of PEG-PPS micelles, polymersomes and filomicelles functionalized with methoxy, hydroxy or phosphate end groups to study the effect of surface chemistry and morphology on protein corona formation and composition [80]. Protein corona quantification and identification via proteomics revealed that human plasma proteins most abundantly adsorb to negatively charged phosphate surfaces, whereas the relatively inert methoxy end group displayed very low protein adsorption. A more detailed investigation into the protein corona composition disclosed a complex interplay between surface chemistry and morphology, of which the former largely dictated nanoparticle immunogenicity (i.e. complement activation) and the latter determined uptake by cells of the MPS. This suggests that the morphology-dependent biodistribution described in the previous sections is at least partially explained by a difference in biological identity [80]. Remarkably, regardless of surface chemistry, polymersomes adsorbed the most proteins associated with clearance by the MPS. \n\nThese findings suggest that PEG-based polymersomes intrinsically show enhanced internalization by immune cells because of a certain protein corona composition. So, their biological identity Fig. 3. | Overview of polymersomes with surface functionalization applicable in cancer immunotherapy.",

            "text": "In other words, the biomolecular corona formed in surfactantcontaining media becomes less biocompatible, with its composition varying based on the surface properties of the NPs. \n\nInvestigation of the lipid and protein corona composition after exposure to pulmonary surfactants from porcine lung lavage was reported by Raesch et al. 23 The study was performed for three different NP coatings: phosphatidylcholine coating (lipid-NP), PEG5000 coating (PEG-NP), and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) coating (PLGA-NP). It was found that the amount of lipids adsorbed was dependent on the NPs' surface properties. In particular, the highest amount of lipids was detected for lipid-NPs, while the smallest amount was detected for PEG-NPs. However, the total lipid composition did not show any relevant differences in both coronas, in contrast to the changes observed in the protein composition. These results indicate that the corona might be of great importance for further interactions with the lung cells, especially in the alveolar region, since some proteins induce agglomeration of NPs, which in turn favours phagocytosis by macrophages and/or protein-mediated binding for particle internalisation. Gasser et al. also used porcine lung lavage to understand how the presence of pulmonary surfactant influences the adsorption of biomolecules to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and MWCNTs functionalised with positively (-NH 2 ) and negatively (-COOH) charged side groups. 111 They showed that surfactant lipids exhibit nonspecific binding to different functionalized MWCNTs. This behavior contrasts with the selective and characteristic binding patterns observed in the blood plasma proteins during corona formation. In later research, they used the same particles to demonstrate that the pulmonary surfactant coating of the nanotubes decreases their oxidative and pro-inflammatory potential, highlighting the relevance of the corona. Moreover, this surfactant coating not only affects how NMs interact with lung cells, but also affects their biodistribution and toxicity in secondary target organs. 112 In vivo studies also support the latter findings.",

            "text": "PEG-lipids were originally utilized in liposomal systems in order to extend the half-life in circulation. This occurs due to the steric barrier produced by PEG that prevents it from binding to opsonins, which would lead to clearance by RES (Samaridou et al. 2020). PEG-lipids are important components of LNPs, located on their surfaces and conjugated with hydrophobic tails via connecting intermediates, with the lipid domain facing down into the particle, and the PEG domain extending out of the surface (Samaridou et al. 2020;Wu et al. 2024). Although the PEG-lipids constitute only around ~1.5 mol% of the composition of LNPs, these provide several benefits and are useful in preventing the binding of proteins, decreasing NP aggregation, improving LNP stability, increasing half-life in the bloodstream, and determining LNP size in manufacturing (Hou et al. 2021;Samaridou et al. 2020;Wu et al. 2024). PEG-lipids in LNPs are commonly used for RNA delivery; for example, PEG2000-C-DMG is used for the formulation of the first siRNA drug Onpattro approved by the FDA (Hou et al. 2021;Wu et al. 2024). Various other helper lipids, such as phospholipids and cholesterol, are used in LNP formulations to provide storage and plasma stability. Phospholipids, generally, are composed of a phosphate group with two hydrophobic tails linked together via glycerol. Phospholipids assist in endosomal escape and aid in enhancing the efficiency of mRNA delivery (Tenchov et al. 2021). For example, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) is a phosphatidylcholine characterized by its saturated fatty acid chains, which confer a cylindrical shape to its molecular structure. This geometry, coupled with its exceptionally low melting temperature of around \u221254\u00b0C, enables DSPC to form a stable lamellar phase. This property is crucial for the stabilization of LNPs.",

            "text": "These results could also be related to the higher amount of SM-102 LNPs used to transfect cells at a constant concentration of 100 nM siRNA considering that the percentage of siRNA encapsulation was found to be significantly lower for SM-102/Cer-and /DTA-PEG LNPs. Transfection in serum-containing medium seemed to highlight the potential toxicity of the mentioned LNPs. In contrast, the DSPE-and DSG-PEG formulations (C18) did not show flattened curves, as presented in Figure 3A-D. These formulations were characterized by the maintenance of a similar average size during incubation (size increase below 12 nm after 4 h of incubation) and the absence of a decrease in concentration. A surprising increase in the concentration was even observed, which could be related to the free serum particles being included in the total count, as they are not adsorbed around the LNPs. This confirmed the good protection against proteins' interactions provided by C18 lipids-PEG. Intermediate results were obtained for the Cer-PEG formulations. The mean size increase fell between that observed with the C14 lipids-PEG and the C18 lipids-PEG formulations (27 nm and 49 nm for the CSL3 and SM-102/Cer-PEG formulations, respectively, after 4 h). This increase in the mean size was significant for SM-102/Cer-PEG LNPs but not for CSL3/Cer-PEG LNPs. Moreover, a significant decrease in the normalized concentration was observed for both formulations. \n\nAlthough broadly similar observations can be made for both ionizable lipids (CSL3 and SM-102), differences can also be highlighted. As shown in Figure 4A, the SM-102-based formulations (dotted line) showed a larger size increase than the corresponding CSL3-based formulations (solid line). It can therefore be assumed that the SM-102 formulations provide a lower stability in serum.",

            "text": "The serum stability and compatibility of IL-NPs were tested by incubating them with whole-mouse serum. IL-NPs maintained their stability in serum for various periods of time depending on the IL composition (table S2). IL-NPs resisted size increase for a compositiondependent time period, followed by a monotonic size increase. The duration of no size growth was considered as an indicator of the ability of IL-NPs to resist protein corona formation. \n\nThe identity of the anion played a significant role in protecting the NP from protein adsorption. Anions with carbon chains six to eight carbons in length emerged as the best at resisting protein adsorption. The role of the double bond emerged as a critical factor-the addition of a double bond to hexanoate to create hexenoate improved the resistance to serum by a factor of 22. In the case of the serum test, the role of the ion ratio is anion dependent. For the hexenoate, the 1:2 ratio outperforms the 1:1 IL by sixfold, but for geranic acid, the 1:1 ratio outperforms the others by twofold. \n\nThe most successful candidate of the library of ILs tested was choline hexenoate (1:2). Therefore, it underwent further testing and is hereafter referred to as PAIL. \n\nStability of NPs against aggregation was tested in undiluted mouse serum in a timed DLS test. The diameter of bare PLGA particles, shown as black diamonds, increased within minutes to 200% of their original size (Fig. 2A). This is consistent with numerous reports on the formation of protein coronae on polymeric particles (6,7,30). The PEGylated particles (blue circles) fared better than the bare NPs, only growing 60% larger than their original measured size in buffer over 30 min. The PAIL-coated particles (red squares) exhibited no appreciable size change even after 60 min in neat serum, only changing size after 90 min. The surface charge of the particles was measured at the conclusion of the serum test (Fig. 2B). The surface of the bare particles is very close to neutral, while both the PEG and PAIL show zeta potentials of \u221215 mV.",

A longer circulation time of the bound PEG-lipid may promote immunogenicity and antibody response (against the surface PEG) of the LNPs enclosing nucleic acids. A strong antibody response may accelerate removal of the formulation from blood circulation, and repeated administration may initiate acute hypersensitivity [72,73]. \n\nAnti-PEG antibodies are known to develop in patients who have been treated with PE-Gylated drugs or consumed PEG-containing products. These antibodies develop following repeated intravenous administration of LNPs and bind specifically to the PEG portion of the formulation, resulting in accelerated clearance of the administered LNP formulation, acute hypersensitivity reactions, and reduced drug efficacy. This phenomenon is common in immunotherapy applications that require multiple dosing for long-lasting protection. Modification of PEG molecules to be less immunogenic or the use of different administration routes may provide possible solutions to overcome this antibody response issue [1].",

            "text": "LNPs' composition was optimized by performing a small design of experiment (DoE)-based screening. Briefly, different lipid critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical quality attributes (CQAs) were used to generate a custom design (Figure S1A) containing 20 formulations. After formulating and characterizing these LNPs, statistical analysis elucidated how the CPPs influencing LNPs' features were the different lipid proportions as well as the ionizable lipids' identity (Figure S1B). We used these CPPs to interpolate a mathematical model correlating them to CQAs and simulated 10,000 theoretical formulations using a Monte Carlo simulation. Among these LNPs, a series of thresholds were applied to select the formulations with the highest theoretical performance (top 10%). As shown in Figure S1C, the best-performing theoretical formulations presented a very similar composition, with the average composition being ionizable lipid, cholesterol, DSPC, and PEG-DMG in molar ratios of 40:48.5:10:1.5, respectively. Thus, LNPs were formulated with these molar ratios using the synthesized lipids. As model cargo, firefly luciferase mRNA (mLuc) was encapsulated using the Nano-Assemblr microfluidic mixing device, as described in the Experimental Section. \n\nThe pK a of LNPs formulated with different lipids was also estimated by using a 6-(p-toluidino)-2-naphthalenesulfonic acid (TNS)-based fluorometric assay. Most of the new lipids had a pK a between 5.9 and 6.5, which is considered suitable for most ionizable lipid-based LNP formulations (Figure S2). 49 nterestingly, LNPs formulated with lipids containing either urea or reverse-amide linkers (lipids 35, 36, 41, and 42) had a pK a close to or higher than 7, suggesting that the number and orientation of the amide linkers can influence the lipid environmental response.",

            "text": "There is limited understanding of the presence of lipid molecules and their adsorption on nanocarriers in the scientific research. In the blood, a lipid associated with protein is known as a lipoprotein. It is complex of apolipoprotein, cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids [106]. Apart from the transportation of lipoprotein in a biological fluid, it is also associated with several other biological processes including tissue repair, coagulation, and immunological responses. \n\nThe proteomic data have suggested that a significant amount of apolipoproteins are present in the protein corona of nanomaterials in vivo. Hellstrand and associates highlighted a report of lipid and plasma protein interaction with nanocarriers. They first pointed out the interaction of lipoprotein complexes with nanomaterials [107]. The surfaceactive agent present in the pulmonary route constituted the outset host defense in deeper part of lungs. The inhaled nanoparticle primarily formed a different corona protein due to the interaction with the lipid and the surfactant-rich pulmonary surface, but the protein corona formed here was different from the PC formed by plasma protein. Further, Raesch and coworkers presented the proteomic analysis of corona formation on NPs using a porcine surfactant as a prototype. The study analyzed the adsorbed biomolecules using LC-MS on to the surface of NPs with varying characteristics viz. lipid-NP, PEG, and PLGA NPs with incubation in a porcine surfactant. The quantitative measurements showed specific lipid compositions in coronas of all investigated NPs. The hydrophilic PEG NPs only showed minimal lipid concentrations, while other NPs indicated high lipid surface binding to nanomaterials. However, the corona formed on NPs was different from corona of plasma protein [108]. \n\nFor the application of nanomaterials in clinics, the physico-chemical properties have to be critically evaluated in a biological medium and the estimation of the results of in vivo studies will greatly help in the clinical translation of nanomaterials. The mouse model is widely used in nanomedicine research to investigate the corona on NPs by incubation with mouse serum.",

The interactions between NPs and plasma proteins at the nano-bio interface affect their biopharmaceutical properties and distribution in the organ and tissues due to protein corona (PrC) composition, and in turn, modification of the resulting targeting capability. Moreover, lipid and polymer NPs, at their interface, affect the composition of PrC and the relative adsorption and abundance of specific proteins. To investigate this latter aspect, we synthesized and characterized different liposomal formulations (LFs) with lipids and polymer-conjugated lipids at different molar ratios, having different sizes, size distributions and surface charges. The PrC composition of various designed LFs was evaluated ex vivo in human plasma by label-free quantitative proteomics. We also correlated the relative abundance of identified specific proteins in the coronas of the different LFs with their physicochemical properties (size, PDI, zeta potential). The evaluation of outputs from different bioinformatic tools discovered protein clusters allowing to highlight: (i) common as well as the unique species for the various formulations; (ii) correlation between each identified PrC and the physicochemical properties of LFs; (iii) some preferential binding determined by physicochemical properties of LFs; (iv) occurrence of formulation-specific protein patterns in PrC. Investigating specific clusters in PrC will help decode the multivalent roles of the protein pattern components in the drug delivery process, taking advantage of the bio-nanoscale recognition and identification for significant advances in nanomedicine.",

Recently, a number of studies have been reported to characterize the role of the PEG conformation (i.e., brush or mushroom) and its impact on biomolecular corona formation. \n\nThe effect of PEG density on corona formation has been evaluated on numerous occasions. For example, NPs prepared from the particle replication in non-wetting templates (PRINT) method were prepared with two different PEG densities corresponding to the brush (0.083 PEG/nm 2 ) and mushroom (0.028 PEG/nm 2 ) regimes (Perry et al., 2012). Brush NPs displayed lower binding of bovine serum albumin (BSA) by nearly three-fold and four-fold less than non-PEGylated NPs. Significant differences between NPs with the two PEG conformations in terms of diminished macrophage uptake or increased circulation half-lives were not directly measured, but brush NPs performed better than mushroom NPs on average. At constant size, a similar result was obtained using AuNPs, where an increase in PEG grafting densities resulted in decreased serum protein adsorption (Walkey et al., 2011). In contrast, distinct differences were observed in terms of protein adsorption when size was considered. The same study found an inverse correlation between particle size and protein adsorption. The increased protein binding onto the smaller NPs was attributed to higher surface curvature and lower PEG-PEG steric interactions, which allowed a greater amount of the bare surface of the AuNP exposed (Figure 1B) (Walkey et al., 2011). When macrophage uptake was considered, two trends were observed. First, increased PEG density on similarly sized NPs resulted in decreased uptake. Second, at similar PEG densities, smaller NPs were taken up to a lesser extent than larger ones.",

            "text": "PEGylated lipids are used in LNP formulation to confer steric stability, prevent opsonization, and increase systemic circulation time [69,244]. However, up to 72% of healthy blood donors tested positive for anti-PEG antibodies, with the prevalence and levels of anti-PEG antibodies increasing with time (compared to historical samples) and patient age [245,246]. The high prevalence of these antibodies may be due to the extensive use of PEG in consumer products [247]. Repeat injections of LNPs may therefore result in accelerated blood clearance [248,249]. Interestingly, this does not seem to be the case with patisiran, as repeat administrations have not resulted in significant differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or efficacy [250,251]. This may be due to the pre-dose cocktail or the particular composition of patisiran. Nonetheless, the increasing trends of anti-PEG antibody prevalence motivates the development of alternative materials.\n\nZwitterionic materials comprise both a cationic and anionic charge, such that the net charge is zero. This endows zwitterionic materials with unique properties including strong hydration and mimicry of endogenous lipids, both of which may mitigate protein adsorption and promote immune evasion [252]. Cheng et al. tested the pharmacokinetics of native uricase and uricase modified with PEG or encapsulated within zwitterionic carboxybetaine-based nanogels. While multiple injections of native or PEGmodified uricase led to greater rates of clearance, uricase encapsulated within zwitterionic nanogels exhibited essentially identical pharmacokinetic profiles compared to the first injection [253].",

            "text": "Under these conditions, and by controlling the amount of PEGylated lipids in the formulation, LNPs can be made with relatively small sizes of ~30-100 nm and low polydispersity, making them ideal for clinical translation [19]. These LNPs were shown to form through a fusion-dependent process, where, as a result of the ionizable lipid pH neutralization step, smaller particles fuse until the final particle accumulates sufficient PEG-lipid on the surface to sterically inhibit further growth [206]. The size is therefore controlled, to a large extent, by the amount of PEGylated lipid [121,124,180] (c.f Section 5.3). \n\nSeries of ionizable or pH sensitive cationic lipids have been developed with acid dissociation constant (pKa) values of 7 or lower [131,[207][208][209]. This means that in environments where the pH is below the pKa, the ionizable lipids are positively charged, promoting association with negatively charged NAs. When the pH of the medium is changed to physiological, the surface of the LNPs becomes almost neutral in charge. This makes them suitable for systematic administration avoiding the demerits of the permanent charge as with the conventional cationic lipids [14,210]. An additional relevant feature is the ability to bind to endogenous proteins in circulation, like apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which efficiently mediates the delivery to hepatocytes via the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor pathways [211]. The pKa of the ionizable cationic lipids is a critical parameter in order to obtain potent formulations. The pKa has to be low enough to prevent the LNP from having a high surface charge at physiological pH, which would lead to rapid clearance from circulation and toxicity. However, the pKa should be high enough so that the ionizable lipid can build up positive charges, critical in destabilizing the endosomal membrane [212].",

In contrast, the protein-charge distribution was less affected by lipid composition (Figure 4D). This may be due to the LNP charge being better described as charge density rather than absolute charge. While surface charge impacts protein adsorption, it operates within a complex electrostatic environment, which could explain the subtler differences in protein-charge profiles compared with pI trends. These findings suggest that lipid composition influences not only protein adsorption but also the physicochemical characteristics of the corona, impacting organ-specific delivery. Examination of key physicochemical properties of the enriched proteins in different selected LNPs samples, including of the isoelectric point, hydropathy (GRAVY index), secondary structure, charge, and stability, showed that lung-targeting LNPs exhibited a notable increase in charge and hydropathy, while spleen-and liver-targeting LNPs displayed distinct trends in protein stability and secondary structure (Figure 4B). Since zeta potential was identified as a key factor in organ targeting by our ionizable lipid library, we further analyzed its influence on related protein properties such as isoelectric point (pI) and overall charge. We found that in lung-targeting LNPs, the isoelectric point distribution of adsorbed proteins was slightly shifted toward pI ~5.5 compared with liver-and spleentargeting LNPs (Figure 4C). This may be attributed to their higher zeta potential, which likely influences protein binding. Notably, vitronectin [12], a key mediator of lung uptake, has a pI of ~5.5, suggesting a potential explanation for this enrichment. In contrast, the protein-charge distribution was less affected by lipid composition (Figure 4D).

            "text": "In another study (Meyer et al., 2022), LNPs containing a positively charged group of the additional lipid and a PLGA polymer also got distributed into lungs and the spleen, and the distribution was influenced by the ratio of a cationic lipid (DOTAP) to an ionizable lipid (MC3). Of note, switching the method of mRNA introduction from encapsulation to adsorption made it possible to achieve up to 80% expression of a target protein in the lungs when composition with a DOTAP/MC3 ratio of 1:1 was employed, and up to 50% expression in the spleen with composition featuring a DOTAP/MC3 ratio of 3:1. Nanoparticles carrying adsorbed mRNA had a size of ~200 nm and did not accumulate in kidneys during excretion, likely indicating the suitability of such particles for subsequent pharmaceutical research and development. In addition, these nanoparticles did not contain cholesterol, and Cy5-labeled mRNA was detectable but not expressed in the liver; this finding may be predictive of the behavior of other cholesterolfree particles. These data are consistent with another study (Gueguen et al., 2024), where LNPs of five-component composition containing cationic lipid IM21.7c also got distributed into lungs and the spleen (and very little into the liver), and >95% of the reporter protein was expressed in the lungs when the LNPs were administered intravenously. The zetapotential of the LNPs containing cationic lipid IM21.7c was positive, in contrast to the previously obtained nanoparticles (Dilliard et al., 2021), which also got distributed into lungs and the spleen but had negative zeta-potential. We believe that zeta-potential has insufficient predictive value to determine a target organ. \n\nThus, the addition of a charged lipid into LNPs affects pK a of the particles, which in turn determines the formation of a protein corona on the surface of the LNPs and accordingly their subsequent distribution throughout organs, which is modulated by proteins of the corona.",

            "text": "Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations are a proven method for the delivery of nucleic acids for gene therapy as exemplified by the worldwide rollout of LNP-based RNAi therapeutics and mRNA vaccines. However, targeting specific tissues or cells is still a major challenge. After LNP administration, LNPs interact with biological fluids (i.e., blood), components of which adsorb onto the LNP surface forming a layer of biomolecules termed the \"biomolecular corona (BMC)\" which affects LNP stability, biodistribution, and tissue tropism. The mechanisms by which the BMC influences tissue-and cell-specific targeting remains largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in isolating LNPs and their corona from complex biological media. In this study, we present a new technique that utilizes magnetic LNPs to isolate LNP-corona complexes from unbound proteins present in human serum. First, we developed a magnetic LNP formulation, containing >40 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)/LNP, the resulting LNPs containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IOLNPs) displayed a similar particle size and morphology as LNPs loaded with nucleic acids. We further demonstrated the isolation of the IOLNPs and their corresponding BMC from unbound proteins using a magnetic separation (MS) system. The BMC profile of LNP from the MS system was compared to size exclusion column chromatography and further analyzed via mass spectrometry, revealing differences in protein abundances. This new approach enabled a mild and versatile isolation of LNPs and its corona, while maintaining its structural integrity. The identification of the BMC associated with an intact LNP provides further insight into LNP interactions with biological fluids.",

            "text": "By simply adjusting the head structure of N-series LNPs, different subpopulations of lung cells can be targeted. The doping LNPs with lipids containing quaternary ammonium groups can selectively deliver mRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 for specific lung diseases in the lungs. 47 Similarly, both zwitterionic amino lipids and cationic quaternary sulfonamide amino lipids have permanent cationic quaternary ammonium functional groups and can also be used to design lung-targeted LNPs. 25 The more detailed LNPs compositions for extrahepatic delivery are summarized by Dilliard S.A. and Siegwart D.J. 20 Furthermore, the length of the alkyl chain on the phosphate side determines organ selectivity. The iPhos with 9-12 and 13-16 carbon chain lengths deliver mRNA to the liver and the spleen, respectively. 47 The possible underlying mechanism for only small difference in structure to cause such astonishing organ specificity may be the result of a specific protein or the synergistic action of several proteins, but further research is still needed. Once injected into the bloodstream, LNPs can selectively control the adsorption of specific plasma proteins, acting as targeted ligands to direct LNPs to selected organs. Taking O-series and N-series LNPs as an example, the first three proteins in the coronoid of 306-N16B LNPs are serum albumin, fibrinogen b chain, and fibrinogen gamma chain, among which fibrinogen encapsulation can improve endothelial cell adhesion and endothelalization, which may be the main reason for lung targeting. However, the highest enriched protein in 306-O12B LNPs corona is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and mediates LNPs delivery to the liver. In addition, the zeta potential of the two LNP S did not differ significantly, and both showed a slightly negative surface charge, suggesting that surface charge may not be the only factor influencing the interaction between NPs and proteins in biological fluids. 35 verall, the ionization of lipid structure can be driven by the type of organs and cells.",

Additionally, PEG-lipids protect the LNP shell, inhibit LNP aggregation, and extend the formulation half-life. This influences LNP biodistribution in vivo and shields them from nonspecific endocytosis by immune cells (Table 1). \n\nThe core-shell structure of LNPs constitutes an efficient drug delivery platform capable of protecting and delivering various cargoes, including small-molecule drugs, mRNA, proteins, or peptides. The core is formed by the combination of these loads and lipid molecules through electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions. The shell is composed of lipids that encapsulate the core and exhibits good biocompatibility, which can effectively protect the core and enhance its stability. Functionalized auxiliary components are often modified on the surface of the shell to improve the cellular uptake efficiency and targeting of the nanoparticles. For example, PEG-lipids can be modified on the surface of the shell to form a hydrophilic protective layer, reducing recognition and clearance by the immune system and thereby prolonging the circulation time of LNPs in vivo. In addition, the targeting of LNPs to specific cells can be further enhanced by introducing specific targeting ligands (such as antibodies, peptides, and glycans). The design flexibility of LNPs makes them important tools in drug delivery and gene therapy. The pharmacokinetics, cellular uptake efficiency, and therapeutic efficacy of LNPs can be optimized by adjusting the composition of the core and shell layers.

            "text": "Dendrimer lipids with ionizable amine cores have been incorporated into LNP formulations to enable nucleic acid encapsulation and delivery. \u221256 Tissue-and cell-type-specific delivery can be tuned by altering the ratios at which dendrimer ionizable lipids are combined with other LNP components and by modifying the branches conjugated to the ionizable amine. 28,53 Bioreducible chemistry can also be incorporated into the design of dendrimer ionizable lipids. These combined elements, which confer both safety and targeted delivery, mean that LNP systems prepared with dendrimer ionizable lipids may be well-suited for CRISPR/ Cas9 applications. LNPs incorporating dendrimer ionizable lipids have been used to deliver both Cas9 mRNA and RNP and have achieved potent editing and homology-directed repair both in vitro and in vivo. 28,56 EG Lipids. PEG lipids improve LNP stability, regulate particle size, decrease immunogenicity, and increase circulation time. 16,57 PEG lipids are comprised of PEG molecules attached to lipid head groups. When PEGylated lipids are used to prepare LNPs, the outer LNP surface is coated with PEG molecules. This coating preserves particle size by preventing particle aggregation during formulation, storage, and in circulation, 11,16,57,58 and it also increases systemic circulation time by preventing opsonization and phagocytosis. 57 Opsoni-        zation occurs when opsonins bind the LNP surfacem which triggers recognition and subsequent clearance by phagocytes. For example, complements C3, IgG, and the serum opsonin fibrinogen can coat the particles' surface which are then recognized and sequestered by Kupffer cells. 59 PEGylated lipids have a hydrophilic property, and their incorporation into LNP formulations create a barrier of water molecules around the outer surface that sterically hinders and protects against opsonization and particle aggregation. Therefore, PEG lipids are an especially important LNP component for in vivo applications by allowing to maintain the administered dose concentration in circulation.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles are prone to interact with a myriad of biomolecules present in the bloodstream when delivered in vivo. This process usually generates two layers of proteins that are adsorbed onto the NPs' surface, namely hard and soft corona. The analysis and isolation of such adsorbed proteins have revealed that corona composition may change over time until reaching an equilibrium state [60] and is mainly composed of abundant proteins such as albumin and other less abundant ones that tend to interact selectively with the NPs' surface [41,61]. Interestingly, the presence of this corona layer may produce significant changes in their biological activity affecting the long-term fate of NPs. Consequently, a full understanding of the effect of such corona on the stability of NPs is essential for the appropriate design of nanotherapeutics. The formation of PC NPs between polymeric NPs (e.g., PLGA and PLGA-PEG) with plasma proteins (FBS), their biophysical characterization, and isolation have been reported [60,[62][63][64][65][66]. In these studies, NPs were mainly prepared via solvent emulsification-diffusion methods [66] using PVA as a stabilizer together with the use of high-energy methods (e.g., ultracentrifugation or high-speed homogenizer). \n\nThe adsorption process of serum proteins, as well as other kind of model proteins onto the surface of PLGA NPs prepared by nano-emulsion templates and low-energy methods, have been recently reported. These studies evaluated the colloidal stabilities of such PC NPs in the presence of different serum concentrations [64,65] as well the formation, isolation, and analysis of proteins adsorbed on the surface of different functionalized polymeric NPs using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) [41,62,63,66].",

[52] Future studies screened ionizable lipids in vitro in order to understand the impact of the lipomer-RNA ratio, PEG chain length, and particle size on an LNP's pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. [53] In one example, the lipid C12-200 delivered siRNA to the liver in mice and NHPs at low doses and was formulated with cholesterol, PEG2000 DMG, and DSPC at a formulation ratio of 50:38.5:1.5:10. [54] In a second example, researchers first formulated the lipid MC3 with cholesterol, PEG2000, and DSPC at a ratio of 40:40:10:10. They then optimized this formulation ratio for siRNA-mediated silencing in NHPs such that the lipid was formulated with cholesterol, PEG-C-DMA, and DPPC at a ratio of 57.1:34.3:1.4:1.7. [55] Finally, as a third example, authors identified the lipid cKK-E12 as a potent material for siRNA and mRNA delivery, [56,57] typically formulating this LNP with cholesterol, PEG2000 DMG, and DSPC at a ratio of 50:38.5:1.5:10 for siRNA delivery and with cholesterol, PEG2000, and DOPE at a ratio of 35:46.5:2.5:16 for mRNA delivery. Thus, the molar ratio that may be used by Moderna has been reported to work well with other commonly used ionizable lipids such as C12-200, cKK-E12, and MC3, [54,56,58] making it a valid choice as a vaccine candidate.\n\nStudies have also highlighted the importance and impact of PEG structure as well as PEG molar ratios on LNP delivery.",

            "text": "Composition-wise, LNPs typically contain a helper lipid to enhance cell binding, cholesterol to cushion the lipids, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to minimize recognition by serum proteins and clearance by the reticuloendothelial system, with the proportions of these components significantly influencing LNP efficacy [32]. Covalent binding of PEG to the LNP construct (PEGylation) effectively creates a steric barrier to reduce the binding of blood proteins and decrease clearance by macrophages, thus improving bioavailability [38,39]. Additionally, PEGylation impacts overall LNP stability and half-life, with factors such as PEG length and concentration playing a role in preventing LNP aggregation [40]. Recent work on modifications to the PEG construct via fluorination has demonstrated enhanced mRNA delivery through LNPs, with improved expression of the delivered mRNA in dendritic and tumor cells as well as effective cellular uptake and endosomal escape even when administered in vivo [41]. In a practical setting, LNPs have been successfully used as the delivery system in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, developed rapidly and proven highly effective in controlling disease [42]. The LNP composition of both vaccines is similar, as they contain an ionizable lipid that is positively charged at low pH for RNA binding and neutral at physiological pH to minimize toxicity and aid in payload release. Additionally, they include a PEGylated lipid to reduce opsonization and clearance by phagocytes. Furthermore, the phospholipid distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and cholesterol assist in packing the mRNA cargo into LNPs. The molar ratios of cationic lipid, PEG-lipid, cholesterol, and DSPC are 46.3:1.6:42.7:9.4 and 50:1.5:38.5:10 for the Pfizer and Moderna LNP constructs, respectively [43]. These nanoparticles are 80-100 nm in diameter [44] and contain about 100 mRNA molecules each [45].",

            "text": "Natural or synthetic nanoparticles such as liposomes, hydrogels, dendrimers, nanosheets, and polymeric and metallic nanoparticles have been widely studied for delivering genes, drugs, or sensing molecules to specific cells [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. When these nanoparticles pass through the bloodstream, they encounter hundreds of plasma proteins, leading to the formation of a protein layer on the nanoparticle surface called the \"protein corona\" [10][11][12]. The protein corona consists of a hard corona (irreversible binding between proteins and the nanoparticle surface, forming the first layer adjacent to the nanoparticle) and a soft corona (reversible binding between proteins, forming a low-density protein layer between the hard corona and the water region) [10,11]. Protein corona modulates the size and surface properties of nanoparticles, thereby influencing their circulating lifetime, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and targeting efficiency, which can either enhance or reduce drug delivery efficiency [13][14][15][16]. For instance, the protein corona can guide nanoparticles toward specific cell surfaces composed of receptors with a high affinity for the protein corona [17]. To achieve this, nanoparticles can be pre-coated with a specific protein in vitro, which directs subsequent protein adsorption in vivo through protein-protein interactions, resulting in a dual-layered protein corona structure that influences the fate of nanoparticles in the body [18]. \n\nTo control protein corona formation, nanoparticles are often modified by grafting hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), which sterically shield nanoparticles from plasma proteins [19,20]. However, grafting PEG at high concentrations destabilizes nanoparticle stability and blocks ligand molecules, limiting the amount of PEG that can be grafted [21][22][23]. Therefore, PEGylation cannot entirely prevent protein corona formation, Pharmaceutics 2024, 16 making it essential to understand this process.",

            "text": "Findings from screening indicated that LNPs containing ionizable lipids with distinct bonds in their tails, O-series (ester bonds) versus N-series (amide bonds) lipids shifted the delivery from liver to lung.Analysis of the protein corona composition revealed that N-series LNPs were enriched in vitronectin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, and proteins that are known to bind the vitronectin receptor  v  3, [81] possibly accounting for their lung tropism.Conversely, the O-series LNPs' corona exhibited a high ApoE enrichment, a fact that might explain their liver tropism. [82]This study underscores the impact of seemingly minor changes in the lipids' chemical features on corona constituents.\n\nThe mentioned SORT approach has demonstrated its applicability beyond lung targeting, as on a similar note the incorporation of a negatively charged phospholipid like phosphatidic acid into LNPs was reported to promote the attachment of  2glycoprotein I.As a result, specific delivery to the spleen was achieved. [77]The interaction between  2 -glycoprotein I and acidic phospholipids has been described previously, reinforcing the rational incorporation of these lipids into NPs to specifically attract serum proteins facilitating spleen targeting. [83]ome authors have argued that it is possible to extend the circulation time of PEGylated liposomes through their conjugation with an albumin-binding domain (ABD).This led to eightfold enrichment in albumin content within the corona, contributing to increased tumor accumulation. [84,85]Similarly, arginine-lipid based siRNA polyplexes, which exhibited notable albumin association on their surface, were also associated with prolonged circulation times. [86]he examination of the concepts around endogenous targeting necessitates cautious assessment in terms of their translatability, given the multifaceted factors contributing to specific protein corona formation.Among these, hydrophobicity, surface chemistry, and charge do not depend only on NP components but on their structural arrangement.

Therefore, developing strategies for enhancing LNPs' ability to target diverse organs is of great clinical significance. On one hand, following systemic administration, LNPs interact with specific proteins and biomolecules in the bloodstream, forming a layer of adsorbed ''protein corona'' on their surface. 25 The composition of this protein corona varies based on the type and properties of LNPs, including factors, such as composition, charge, size, surface chemistry, etc., predominantly affecting cellular uptake and biodistribution. 26 On the other hand, LNPs modified with ligands (small molecules, peptides, antibodies, etc.) are widely employed as active targeting strategies.

LNP suspensions were incubated with an equal amount of mouse serum for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C (total volume of 350 \u03bcL). The serum coated LNPs were separated from free serum proteins by gel permeation chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B (Sigma) using phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) as the eluent. To confirm the separation of LNP and serum, mouse serum was labeled with Alexa Fluor Tm 488 protein labeling kit (Invitrogen, Inc.) and purified according to manufacturer's instructions. LNPs were labeled with Rhodamine-PE. The separation of LNPs (with corona) and proteins was analyzed by measuring fluorescence intensities in different flow fractionations (Fig. S6).

            "text": "The stability of an artificial protein corona in a protein-rich environment (such as the bloodstream and the cytoplasm) is a key requirement for its effectiveness. This is because the corona stability influences its ability to maintain its composition and structure over time 1,2 . In a protein-rich environment, various proteins are present that can potentially interact with the corona. If the corona is not stable, it may undergo structural changes or disintegrate, leading to alterations in its composition. This can have significant implications for the corona's functionality, including its ability to influence interactions between the NP and biological systems. As an example, Qin et al. 3 demonstrated that an intracellular protein corona (IPC) can form on nanoparticles once they are taken up by cells. This IPC has the potential to significantly impact the intracellular transport network of these NPs. A stable protein corona is therefore crucial for maintaining the specific interactions and properties that were designed or intended. It helps ensure that the corona continues to serve its intended purpose, whether it is to enhance biocompatibility, modulate cellular uptake by engaging specific receptors, or influence other aspects of nanoparticle behavior. \n\nFor this purpose, we prepared coronated LNP and LNPi at different plasma percentages. Each batch was aliquoted into two portions. The first represents the formulation as synthesized in the laboratory, constituting the system ready for in vivo applications. This batch was kept as is for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Simultaneously, the second batch was exposed to 50% HP, i.e., the percentage of plasma commonly used in literature to mimic the injection of NPs into the circulatory system. Finally, we employed SDS-PAGE to compare the corona composition of coronated LNP and LNPi before and after plasma exposure (the electrophoretic gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 6a). First, we observe that the electrophoretic profiles of coronated LNP (light gray) change as a function of protein concentration. This first observation is in line with previous results obtained with lipid gene vectors 4 , and other NP types 5 . After exposure to 50% high protein concentration (depicted in dark grey), LNP displayed very similar protein profiles.",

            "text": "administration of the LNP. Remarkably, the potency of LNP-siRNA systems improved from \u223c10 mg siRNA/kg body weight to result in 50% gene silencing for LNP containing DODAP to 0.005 mg siRNA/kg body weight for the LNP containing DLinMC3DMA (Jayaraman et al., 2012;Semple et al., 2010). This improvement in potency is attributed to the use of ionizable cationic lipids with optimized pKa values and maximized bilayer destabilizing capabilities given the presence of anionic lipids that exist within the endosome. DLinMC3DMA, with a pKa of 6.4, is currently the most potent ionizable cationic lipid for hepatic gene silencing in vivo (Jayaraman et al., 2012). \n\nThe type of PEG lipid can also influence the potency of LNP-siRNA systems. PEG lipids are incorporated into LNP-siRNA formulations to prevent particle aggregation during the formulation process as the PEG moiety provides a hydrophilic steric barrier on the particle surface (Maurer, Fenske, & Cullis, 2001;Maurer et al., 2001). Without the PEGlipid coating, it is impossible to produce small LNP-siRNA systems with diameters of less than 100 nm, and large micron sized aggregates are instead formed. Although the PEG coating is important for forming small and stable particles, it can also inhibit LNP association with the plasma membrane of target cells, indicating a need to remove the coating before cellular uptake can proceed. One potential solution is to use acid-labile PEG lipids where the PEG moiety dissociates from the lipid anchor at low pH (Choi, MacKay, & Szoka, 2003;Guo, & Szoka, 2001;Shin, Shum, & Thompson, 2003). However, the pH required is too low (pH < 5) to exist in the extracellular medium and thus the PEG lipids remain on the LNP surface, preventing close association with the cell membrane. Another approach is to use a PEG lipid that dissociates from the LNP in circulation following i.v. administration.",

While the protein corona depends on the details of the surface chemistry (Guerrini et al., 2018), here we wanted to probe only colloidal stability. The data of Figure 6 demonstrate that up to high BSA concentrations, there was no protein-induced agglomeration of the IONPs (apart from the PMA-DDA-coated IONPs at the maximum concentration).

            "text": "In an attempt to understand the biomolecular corona, several studies have been reported wherein, the concentration of the protein in the medium was varied. It was suggested that exposure of NPs at a low protein concentration allows relatively few proteins to adhere and distribute on the NPs surface forming a stable NP-protein complex. The protein layers experience a higher degree of conformational changes while masking the NPs surface. However, when the exposure media contains a high concentration of proteins, dense layering occurs and in this case, the majority of the interactions are governed by the adjacent polypeptide fragments. Comparatively lesser conformational changes are noticed since the contact between the NPs surface and the proteins are minimized. 44,45 olystyrene-and silica-NPs (200 nm) demonstrated varied patterns of bound corona upon incubation with an increasing concentration of plasma (3-80%). Densitometric analysis showed that for polystyrene NPs increasing the protein concentration directly increased the amount of bound corona, whereas for silica NPs the amount of protein decreased. SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis suggested that in a multiprotein system such a blood plasma, high binding proteins which are present in smaller amounts such as histidine-rich glycoprotein tends to replace low-binding affinity protein such as \ue103brinogen and proteins with a molecular weight in the 50-70 kDa range (present in comparatively much higher amounts in the blood plasma). 44 Similarly, for MNPs, for increasing serum concentration the apolipoprotein E-1 (ApOE-1) protein component signi\ue103cantly increased as compared to albumin and transferrin. 46 Analysis of potential protein adsorptive property of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) demonstrated that variation in the protein source such as fetal bovine serum (FBS) or human serum, can impact corona formation in terms of both quantity and quality. For 0.08 m 2 area of PLGA-NPs incubated with 50 mL human serum or FBS, the bound protein was observed to be 160.91 mg and 23.08 mg respectively.",

            "text": "It is interesting to observe that the increase in protein absorption on NPs is not only a cause of destabilization but can also cause hydrophobic cargo leakage, even with stable particles, as demonstrated by Dil and DiO release measured by FRET. This can be explained by a two-step process: first, the partition of the hydrophobic drug from the particle core to the proteins, followed by dynamic interchange of proteins on the NP surface leading to more drug leeching (Figure 3). \n\nThis concept of PEG capable of manipulating the PC emerges in another study by Chen et al. (2019), in which the different composition and coating of siRNA-loaded solid lipid NPs (SLNs) could modulate the composition of PC, with either positive or negative repercussions on the cellular uptake rate and efficacy. In this study, particles were functionalized with different ratios of either C14-PEG or C18-PEG. Notably, SLNs coated with C14-PEG had their uptake and transfection efficiently increased by the presence of FBS during incubation. This could be due to the easier removal of C14 compared to C18 by the proteins composing the PC. The removal of PEG from the surface of SLNs could enhance the interactions with the cells and thus their uptake and consequent gene silencing effect. The most abundant proteins composing the PC were found to be either ApoA1 or ApoA2, with only one formulation having albumin as the most relevant protein. Interestingly, after incubating the different formulations with ApoA1, it was found that there was no substantial effect of this protein on NP efficacy, and conversely, only after incubating the C14-PEG-coated SLNs with ApoE was the efficacy enhanced. \n\nDespite the many studies that focused on the definition of minimal PEG density on NPs to guarantee good stealthiness, even at the highest PEG density, a small amount of proteins is able to penetrate the polymeric coating, coming into contact with the NP surface and bypassing the PEG itself.",

This high protein adsorption property of RIPL-NLCs may be mainly due to the van der Waals interaction between the plasma protein and the positively charged RIPL peptide. 35 In contrast, PEGylated RIPL-NLCs showed a significant reduction of BSA adsorption: compared with RIPL-NLCs, PEG-RIPL-NLCs (P=0.0001) and cPEG-RIPL-NLCs (P=0.0001) showed ~1.97and 1.75-fold less protein adsorption at 2 hours.

            "text": "Protein coronas have been studied predominantly for cancer applications, where numerous reports have investigated the influence of coronas on chemotherapeutic delivery and targeting in vivo and how they impact interactions of NPs with specific cell receptors [7][8][9][10]. However, the influence of protein coronas is broad, and they can impact many other biological uses of NPs including LFAs. Previously, it has been shown that presence of protein coronas improves the efficacy of paper immunoassays, where they prevent false positives by diminishing non-specific adsorption [11,12]. However, this was done without the knowledge about the protein corona composition, so the effects of individual proteins was not known and there are still opportunities to engineer the protein corona to improve LFA performance. \n\nHere, we examined the effect of the composition of protein coronas on dipstick immunoassays (Figure 1). We characterized the protein corona composition in an immunoassay for a dengue biomarker run in human serum (HS) using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We then preformed coronas from two different proteins identified in the corona, apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1) and human serum albumin (HSA). We find that the preformed PCs influence immunoassay performance differently depending on the protein used, altering the K D and LOD values. Results could be used to improve immunoassay performance, which can impact the capability of a diagnostic for its use in infectious disease surveillance and quarantining.

            "text": "mizing the total amount of administered lipids. We hypothesized that maximizing siRNA loading would lead to a better-tolerated formulation, but we were unsure how the ratio of lipid to siRNA would affect in vivo efficacy. To address this question, we prepared and tested formulations with different initial lipid:siRNA weight ratios (Figure 2). We first measured entrapment efficiency to determine the point of maximal siRNA loading, which occurred at a lipid:siRNA ratio of ~7.5:1 (wt:wt).\n\nIn vivo testing demonstrated that reducing the lipid:siRNA ratio had only a slightly negative effect on efficacy, while having a very significant positive effect on tolerability. Thus, we found that maximizing siRNA loading resulted in an optimized formulation. We then turned our attention to optimizing the alkyl chain length of the PEG lipid. We expected the alkyl chain length to affect the rate of PEG lipid disassociation, and thus, particle unshielding. The rate of particle unshielding may in turn affect in vivo pharmacodynamics. We synthesized PEG lipids with various anchor lengths ranging from C10 to C16. We found that increasing the anchor length led to improved tolerability, but that efficacy was optimized for anchor lengths of C13-C15. Therefore, we concluded that C14-and C15-based PEG-lipids yielded formulations with the optimal balance of efficacy and tolerability (Figure 3a,b). However, due to the relative availability of synthetic starting materials, we ultimately selected the PEG-C14 lipid. Finally, we verified our assumption that smaller particles would have more efficient access to hepatocytes via the fenestrated endothelium of the liver. We prepared formulations of identical composition, but with particle sizes ranging from 50 to 150 nm. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed a clear trend of increasing in vivo efficacy with decreasing particle size (Figure 3c).\n\nThe final optimized formulation, \"LNP01, \" had a lipid composition of 98N 12 -5(1):cholesterol:PEG lipid = 42:48:10 (mol:mol:mol),",

            "text": "When NPs enter biological fluids, e.g., the blood after systemic administration or the cytosol after cell uptake, they are coated by biomolecules, in particular proteins, which adsorb onto their surface [7,8].The new layer, or corona, confers to NPs properties which might be very different from those of the bare NPs, markedly affecting their behaviour with regards to pharmacokinetics (biodistribution, interaction with immune system and clearance) and pharmacodynamics (interaction with cells and putative biological targets) [6,7].\n\nThe formation and composition of protein corona is a complex process depending on the physicochemical properties of NPs (e.g., size, composition and charge) [5,30,[35][36][37] and on the biological fluid (protein's abundance and affinity for NPs surface) [7,35,38].The protein adsorption is also a dynamic and competitive process, where more abundant proteins might adsorb at first, even with weak bonds, being displaced thereafter by less abundant proteins with higher affinity for the NPs surface [30,39,40].For example, experimental data [41] and the results of a simulation model [40] suggest that human serum albumin (HSA) forms the early corona, and is soon replaced by higher-affinity and slower-exchanging apolipoproteins.The labile corona formed at initial time points is usually indicated as the \"soft corona\" and is characterized by a fast exchange rate with free proteins all around, whereas the latter is indicated as \"hard corona\" and is due to a more stable layer of proteins.Proteins adsorbed after incubation of NPs in plasma can be identified by proteomic analysis, and previous studies [5,8,36] indicated that the hard corona is mainly composed by 10-50 proteins including HSA, specific lipoproteins and proteins involved in coagulation and the complement pathway, with different consequences relevant to nanomedicine and nanosafety.",

            "text": "Unprotected lipid-based delivery systems are rapidly cleared by the mononuclear phagocyte system [31,32]. In order to overcome this, hydrophilic polyethylene glycol has been widely used to coat lipid-based delivery systems, which prevents aggregation during the formulation process as well as provide \"stealth\" like characteristics post i.v. administration. The optimized PEG-lipid characteristics in current LNP siRNA systems were largely derived from earlier work on PEGylated liposomes [33][34][35] and stabilized plasmid or antisense lipid particles (SPLP or SALP). It was found that SPLP or SALP with PEG-ceramide that have C 20 anchors (PEG-CerC 20 ) exhibited poor transfection efficiency in cultured cells compared to its shorter anchor counterparts such as PEG-CerC 14 or PEG-CerC 8 [36][37][38]. The length of the ceramide lipid anchor dictated how long the PEG-lipid remained associated with the LNP. PEG-lipids with longer acyl anchors remain associated with the LNP longer, thus preventing LNP interaction with cells and subsequently with the endosomal membranes. They also provide the LNP with a more durable coat, which extends circulation lifetime [39,40]. Consistent findings were observed when PEG-ceramides were replaced with PEG-succinoyl-diacylglycerols (PEG-s-DAG) that have various acyl anchor lengths [41]. Due to the ease of synthesis and purification, PEG-s-DAG replaced PEG-Cer in later SPLP formulations and long acyl chain PEG-s-DAG such as PEG-s-distearoylglycerol (PEG-s-DSG) were used to increase circulation lifetime in the hope of exploiting the enhanced permeability and retention effect at tumor sites.",

            "text": "However, the increase in surface tension becomes smaller as the chain density of the PEG-AuNP increases, as the more hydrophilic the NP the less the monolayer is disturbed (at the same time as the PEG-AuNPs remain relatively close to the PS monolayers they do not signi\ue103cantly affect the water layer). For chain lengths of 0 to 3 the increase in surface tension is   approximately constant, however, for the longest chain length of 4 a higher surface tension is observed (in fact this is the highest surface tension observed for any compressed system simulated). The length of the chain for this PEG-AuNP give it a particular structure with a hydrophobic core, a hydrophobic inner shell and a hydrophilic outer shell. Thus, a PEG-AuNP with a chain density of 1.56 chain per nm 2 and a chain length of 4 is able to strongly adsorb a signi\ue103cant amount of PS monolayer material but still able to diffuse into the water layer (Fig. 6(d)). The adsorption of lipids (and proteins) to the PEG-AuNP varies with the chain length of the PEG ligands (Fig. 6 and 9). A previous study has shown that hydrophobic part of phospholipids interacts strongly with the hydrophobic bare AuNP, which supports the preference of cholesterol adsorption to the AuNP compared to DPPC and POPG. 36 However, the presence of a ligand shell, and the properties of a shell, results in different adsorption behaviour. For the shortest PEG ligands, the chains lie very close to the core and there is limited adsorption of lipids, with POPG adsorbing preferentially to DPPC and cholesterol. As the chain length increases the amount of lipids that are able to adsorb to the PEG-AuNP increases and a genuine corona of lipids is present around the NP.",

            "text": "This hypothesis is supported by the finding that other cationic helper lipids (EPC and DDAB) within such LNPs cause similar protein expression in the pancreas (Melamed et al., 2023). For the LNPs based on lipid 306O i10 , the distribution among different types of liver cells has been assessed too (Hajj et al., 2020). The expression of the reporter protein proved to be distributed among hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells at a 70:15:15 ratio. \n\nAnother area of research is assessment of a distribution of LNPs based on ionizable lipids containing an amino head group and an acrylamide tail with a disulfide bond (Qiu et al., 2022). In vivo efficiency of luciferase synthesis (by translation) when fourcomponent LNPs were employed improved with increasing acrylamide tail length, and all the nanoparticles got distributed to lungs. After replacement of helper lipid DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine) with either DSPC or DOPE, the lung distribution persisted for LNPs based on the most effective lipid: 306-N16B. Of note, LNPs based on a similar ionizable lipid, 306-O12B (containing an ester bond instead of an amide bond) got completely distributed to the liver. In an analysis of the protein corona of LNPs based on either lipid 306-N16B or lipid 306-O12B, it was found that the LNPs targeted to the liver contain albumin, ApoE, and complement component C1 in the protein corona at 9%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins, whereas LNPs targeted to lungs contain albumin, fibrinogen \u03b2-chain, and fibrinogen \u03b3-chain at 17%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of the total corona proteins. It was also revealed that negatively charged proteins predominantly (80%) constitute the protein corona of the LNPs targeted to the lungs.",

            "text": "The steric stabilization of HNPs systems to withstand salt solutions, buffer actions and uptake by macrophages is provided by the appropriate surface modification by employing PEG. The term is called as PEGylation. PEGs can escalate circulation times of HNPs by preventing particle aggregation, opsonization and adsorption of plasma proteins [27,78].\n\nIncorporation of PEG-lipid affects the colloidal stability of HNPs by two ways (i) chain length of PEG-lipid and (ii) molar Ratio of PEG-lipid. HNPs coated with PEG-lipid longer chains exhibited more stability than the shorter chain PEG-lipid coated particles. Similarly, at the fixed chain length more PEG-lipid incorporated onto polymer core and thickness of lipid shell increased which lowered the zeta potential and hence stability is enhanced [78,80].\n\nYang et al. studied the effect of lipid/polymer ratio and PEGylation on HNPs prepared from PLA/mPEG-PLA polymer and BHEM-Chol cationic lipid. HNPS prepared from mPEG-PLA were smaller and more stable in PBS at the given lipid/polymer ratio than PLA alone [61].\n\nFang et al. formulated HNPs using 0.10-0.35 lipid-PEG/PLGA ratios without incorporating lecithin. Initially particle reduced with increase in lipid amount and optimized at 0.30 lipid-PEG/PLGA ratio after which further increase in lipids did not affect particle size and PDI. At an optimized (0.30 lipid-PEG/PLGA) ratio, lipid-PEG was replaced with mole equivalents of lecithin. The stable particles of 60 nm were obtained at 50% lipid-PEG replacement. Upon 70% lipid-PEG replacement, the size was increased to 100 nm and at 80% lipid-PEG replacement with lecithin, the unstable particles were obtained. This instability of particles is due to the replacement of higher lipid-PEG content, a major stability component of HNPs [63].",

Firstly scientific developments now suggest that biological recognition of nanoscale surfaces entails levels of complexity and subtlety not previously recognised. For example, the identity of the protein corona may influence drug release profiles. 19 Blood circulation times may require the recognition of specific proteins or protein motifs on the particle surface. 20 onversely other proteins may lead to a lower probability of recognition and longer nanoparticle (NP) circulation times in vivo. 5 The complexity is well described in the work of Cai  et al., where the authors suggest that \"appropriate surface ligands with reduced protein binding and desired long blood circulation time could be predicted from acquired corona composition\". 21 29][30][31][32] In particular, questions about how interactions with environmental molecules are influenced by the ligand coverage (surface density) and conformation have been raised. \n\nThe original paradigm of nanoscale biomolecular recognition that was framed around the 'biomolecular corona' 24 may be briefly summarised as follows. Those environmentally derived biomolecules presented 'accessibly' 22,23 on the nanoparticle surface with residence times exceeding a critical 'processing time' are deemed to be involved in biological recognition and processing and termed 'hard corona', whereas those that exchange faster are termed 'soft corona' and while they affect physicochemical aspects of the material they are unlikely to contribute directly to recognition.",

            "text": "One of the major challenges for targeted delivery of NPs is their cellular uptake by phagocytes [84]. In a biological environment, NPs can be surrounded by various types of biomolecules including proteins of the extracellular matrix, serum albumin, apo-lipoproteins, complement components and immunoglobulins which will form the corona. The receptors expressed on the phagocytic cell membranes attach to the proteins on the surface of NPs and internalize them [84,85]. Even if the phagocytes do not uptake NPs, the corona layer covers the ligands, and the NPs are not recognized by the targeted cells, and lose their specificity [86]. One of the most common and efficient solutions for this problem is coating NPs with a barrier-like layer composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG), called PEGylation. PEG chains on the surface of NPs create steric hindrance, which inhibits the protein adsorption and decreases recognition by macrophages [87]. \n\nOne of main goals in targeted delivery is to internalize NPs into specific cells by an endocytosis pathway such as clathrin, caveolin, etc. Studies on targeted drug delivery have shown that NPs lose their specificity when coated with corona. Corona not only changes the surface composition and structure of NPs, which directly influences the cell-NP interactions, but also affects the geometry and size of NPs, which play a crucial role in cellular uptake [88].",

            "text": "Currently, modifying the surface of NPs with polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a common strategy to improve the stability of vaccines in the body. In the bloodstream, conjugation of NPs and PEG reduces the binding of plasma proteins, prevents clearance of NPs by MPS, and isolates mRNA from the plasma enzyme with the hydrophilic steric hindrance 5 . Moreover, the hydrophilic nature of PEG also facilitates the transport of vaccines in the cellular interstitium. However, an excessive amount of PEG-lipid can have detrimental effects on cellular uptake and transfection of the delivery system 13 . Therefore, the benefits of enhancing the stability of the delivery system by increasing the content of PEG are limited. Based on of PEGylated LNPs, Chander et al. 29 achieved improved carrier stability by adjusting the ratio of helper lipids. The research suggested that the proportion of high levels of helper lipids, such as distearoyl phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) or egg sphingomyelin (ESM), significantly influences the properties of LNPs. Results demonstrated that LNPs containing 40% (mol/mol) DSPC or ESM can form an aqueous compartment bounded by a lipid bilayer, exhibiting enhanced stability in the presence of serum. In comparison to systems with 10% (mol/mol) DSPC or ESM, LNP-mRNA systems with 40% (mol/mol) DSPC or ESM showed significantly improved transfection properties in vitro, along with prolonged circulation lifespan and significant improvement in gene expression in the spleen, bone marrow, and liver upon intravenous injection. This adjustment of helper lipid proportions also provides new insights for the design of carriers for tumor vaccines. \n\nAlthough PEG has shown its ability to increase retention time in vivo, studies demonstrated that linear PEG-modified NPs will induce anti-PEG-Immunoglobulin M (IgM) at the first injection, which causes accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon upon repeated injection 30,31 .",

The interaction of nanoparticle formulations with cells and proteins in blood has long been discussed [39e41]. Recently, proteins bound to LNPs, called protein corona or biomolecular corona because of their shape, have been the subject of much research attention as factors that contribute greatly to LNP pharmacokinetics [42e45]. The latest findings concerning protein coronas of LNPs, including the analytical technical aspects, were recently reviewed [46]. Although there are still many unknowns owing to the immaturity of the technology, a list of constituents of protein coronas has been developed, that includes serum albumin, complement factors, immunoglobulins, and apolipoproteins. Proteins present in smaller quantities may be important; improving the methods of separation of LNP-protein corona complexes and the sophistication of proteomics technology are key to a more detailed analysis of the protein coronas. The physiological and pathological conditions of patients and animal models, and the route of administration, and their impact on pharmacokinetics are also important factors to consider.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of the intratissue distribution of LNPs, a method that makes use of the Cre/loxP recombinase system is beginning to be used [47e49]. This method uses transgenic mice that have reporter genes (especially fluorescent proteins) downstream of the loxP-flanked stop cassette, which blocks reporter gene expression in the absence of cyclization recombinase (Cre) in the cells, but in the presence of Cre, the stop cassette is removed, and the gene is expressed (Fig. 2) [50]. For example, the typical Ai14 mouse has Lox-Stop-Lox-tdTomato (LSL-tdTomato) inserted into the Rosa26 region, which is a known safe harbor locus for gene insertion into the mouse genome [50]. These",

Higher protein binding by the L-aC-PC25 formulation together with higher fluorescence build-up in FRET assay can be interpreted as more probe (and, presumably, matrix lipids) leaving the bilayer to bind proteins. \n\nAccording to silver stained SDS-PAGE gels (Figure 4a), all liposomes carried a wide spectrum of proteins upon incubation in 50% human plasma. These are mostly midweight proteins, the most pronounced band probably corresponding to human serum albumin (HSA) in all coronas. aC-PC-free liposomes reproducibly carried the highest amount of proteins in the corona (Figure 4a, lane 3 vs. lanes 4 and 5). This contradicts the P B values. The reason could be the uneven distribution of plasma proteins between chloroform-methanol, methanol-water, and interface during delipidization for different compositions of the corona. Notably, L-aC-PC25 carried the highest relative amount of ~75 and 45-50-kDa proteins. We used western blotting with antibodies against most prominent opsonins frequently identified in protein coronas of liposomes (complement factor C3 and immunoglobulins G and M) to identify the proteins. b-d) Western blot (WB) of protein corona proteins with anti-C3 (b), anti-IgM (c), and anti-IgG (d) antibodies.",

Whilst both contain a C14-acyl chain and PEG 2k , DMPE contains a phosphate group giving the overall molecule a negative charge compared to DMG that is neutral. Substitution to DMG-PEG 2k resulted in reduced uptake and slower kinetics, lower endosomal escape induction and ultimately impaired EGFP production across all particles surveyed (Fig. 6b, e). It has been shown that the half-life of DMPE-PEG on nanoparticle surfaces is shorter than DMG-PEG 13 and this may account for some of the changes observed. In addition, particle charge variance may also lead to differential interactions with serum proteins that are important for cellular uptake and/or endosomal escape 13 . Representative microscopy images demonstrating changes to key particle components on the uptake, GAL9 recruitment and EGFP translation are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9. \n\nAltogether, the screen presented in Fig. 6 illustrates that LNPs with similar physical properties such as size, PDI and encapsulation but formed from different lipids can demonstrate great variation in terms of how they are taken up by cells and are able to deliver mRNA. Integration of the mCherry-GAL9 reporter into a screening platform with multiple cellular read-outs have allowed us to probe in greater detail to which delivery step a certain lipid alteration can modulate LNP potency and highlights the benefits of utilising such a reporter system for deriving greater insights into nanoparticle function.",

This molecule prevents aggregation and provides stability by causing steric hindrance on the LNP surface. 31 Varying PEG lipid concentrations in LNPs is known to alter LNP size and transfection efficiency. 31,50 Once injected, PEG lipid can disassemble in the serum, followed by ApoE binding and internalization. The third component is cholesterol which is involved in the intracellular delivery of LNPs. Absence of cholesterol receptors that recycle it from the endosomes can enhance the accumulation of LNPs, and thus increase the level of gene silencing. 44 Arteta et al. stated that LNP surface may include cholesterol crystals due to its limited solubility and this surface configuration of LNPs may promote endosomal escape. 50 Recent studies revealed that liver microenvironment other than hepatocytes can be targeted with LNPs containing oxidized cholesterols. 38 We have reported that plant-based cholesterol analogs transformed LNP morphology and stimulated endosomal escape of LNPs. 36 Finally, LNPs contain structural lipid which is primarily present on their surface. 23,48 As the name suggests, it contributes to nucleic acid packaging and stability of the nanoparticles. 22 Moreover, literature has highlighted that these helper or structural lipids enable structural transition of LNPs in endosomes, stimulating cytosolic release of nucleic acid. 30,47 Li et al. and Kauffman et al. compared 1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) as structural lipids, and found that LNPs containing DOPE instead of DSPC more effectively delivered mRNA. 18,24 It may suggest that the most effective LNP for mRNA delivery can be distinct from the current standard formulation which contains DS",

This is since protein adsorption is mediated (in part) by hydrophobic interactions. 57 As demonstrated by Maiorano et al. utilising Dulbecco's Modi\ue103ed Eagle medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI), supplemented with Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), bio\ue104uid composition is a prominent extrinsic in\ue104uencer of corona formation. The two media (which vary in their salt, glucose and amino acid content) induced dissimilar adsorption patterns, with citrate-stabilised gold nanoparticles gaining a more abundant and stable corona in DMEM at all tested sizes. 58 Consistently, an increase in plasma concentration (from 3% to 80%) corresponded to a notable increase in protein adsorption for polystyrene nanoparticles. For silica nanoparticles, increasing plasma concentration instead induced considerable changes in the protein pattern, illustrative of competitive adsorption by less-abundant, high-affinity proteins due to enhanced adhesion at higher plasma concentrations. 59 Finally, nanoparticles which interact with proteins electrostatically have been reported to experience pH-dependent corona formation by reason of an altered protein binding affinity. 60 The instantaneous adsorption of proteins by nanoparticles may alter their physicochemical attributes (including size and surface charge), thereby providing them with a new biological identity. Thus, it is not pristine nanoparticles, but those which are biomolecule-coated that largely govern physiological responses such as systemic circulation time, bioavailability, cellular uptake and cytotoxicity. 61 For instance, the formation of a protein corona around transferrin-functionalised silicon dioxide nanoparticles was shown to eliminate their transferrinmediated targeting capability due to masked receptor-binding sites (Fig. 3). In another study, the coating of gold nanoparticles with polyacrylic acid was shown to cause the unfolding of adsorbed \ue103brinogen which, consequently, evoked an in\ue104ammatory cascade. 11 By",

            "text": "A better understanding of the evolution of protein corona is explained by the dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) which combines the steric and electrostatic interactions. In addition to the classical diffusion-based Vroman effect, the non-monotonic adsorption pattern of corona formation is rather dependent on parameters such as adsorption energy, bulk density, and charge of the protein. It also suggests that inter-particle interaction can promote cooperative binding of proteins on the NPs surface and not just competitive binding. 24 6][27][28] The difference in the opinions is possibly due to the diversity of the experimental protocols in terms of variation in NPs, analytical methods, and choice of protein source. The principle of competitive displacement of proteins was not applicable and a stable protein composition throughout an extended period of 4 h was observed in the case of metal oxide NPs. 29 Label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) studies conducted by Tenzer et al. also revealed that protein corona formation does not solely depend on the principles of the Vroman effect but instead complex interplay of multiple parameters determine the presence of any particular protein on the NPs surface. 30 The Vroman effect of time-bound protein displacement also does not apply to solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) incubated with dilute human plasma. 31 Oil-in-water emulsions and iron oxide NPs have also shown similar trends. 25,32 Table 2 summarizes a few of the studies wherein theories of protein coronation varied for different NPs. \n\nReporting a discrete mechanism of protein corona formation is a challenging task. A case-by-case approach is thus required to address the questions related to the formation of corona on NPs. The understanding of the interactive process would enable us to answer the vital questions regarding the biological response of these coronated NPs. Considering the inevitable nanobiointeractions it is necessary to tactfully work on the architectural framework of the NPs. Several reviews have summarized and categorized the varying nature of protein corona formation over a plethora of NPs and how it in\ue104uences the cellular interactions. 8,17,33",

[58] When present at high percentages, cholesterol seems to enhance the activity of cationic lipids and promote gene transfer, possibly by promoting bilayer destabilization. [58,59] Shielding Lipids: Careful construction of the LNP formulation with a combination of the right excipients is the most critical aspect for optimizing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. While doing so, curtailing the potential for adverse effects due to activation of the immune response is paramount to obtaining the product in the clinic. To a oid the activation of the immune response, LNPs should be inconsiderable to immune cells during in vivo administration. PEG is widely used as a stealth coating. [60] The recent development of PEG-lipids is a key milestone for the clinical use of LNPs. The shielding effect of PEG-lipids protects the LNP surface against opsonins and uptake by the mononuclear phagocyte system and averts their aggregation in circulation. [61] This multifunctional role of shielding lipids extends during production and storage by preventing the aggregation that maintains the nanosize of LNPs. \n\nAdding a PEGylated lipid can improve in vitro LNP colloidal stability and in vivo circulation time but may decrease uptake and impede endosomal release at the cellular level. [55] This \"PEG dilemma\" can be approached by opting for reversible PEGylation, in which the PEG moiety is gradually released into the blood circulation. pH-sensitive anionic helper lipids can trigger low-pHinduced changes in LNP surface charge and destabilization that can facilitate the endosomal release of genetic materials.",

On the other hand, there was lots of binding of proteins from serum for PEG-lipid-modified liposomes. In particular, a band at around 65 kDa (albumin) was strongly detected. We considered that the exogenous modification of liposome by adding PEG-lipid could not cover the whole liposome surface, so that albumin was bound onto the liposome surface. In fact, when we studied the protein binding onto PEG-lipid-modified liposomes from human plasma, where PEG-lipid was premixed with DPPC and cholesterol, the protein adsorption level was comparable to PMPC-lipidmodified liposomes [23].\n\nWhen the liposomes were stored in 100% FBS, the particle diameter of the unmodified liposomes significantly increased, whereas the PMPC-lipid-modified liposomes had similar particle sizes although there was a significant",

[220] Nanoparticle functionalization with hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and dextran is achieved to inhibit protein corona formation. This system increases systemic circulation of the nanoparticles prior to reaching target sites owing to macrophage uptake avoidance. [109] s mentioned earlier, hard protein corona formation alters nanomaterial's identity. Accordingly, employing specific artificial protein corona (protein corona shield) on nanoparticles that could inhibit adsorption of undesired proteins such as opsonin protein can be considered a promising strategy to elude the immune system and increase the targeting ability of nanoparticles. For example, recombinant fusion protein consisted of HER2-binding affibody combined with a glutathione-S-transferase create a functional protein corona shield with minimal reactivity to proteins in physiological fluids. [221] n addition to target delivery impairment, protein corona affects drug sustained release. It is concluded that protein corona significantly decreases the drug release burst effect, which plays a key role in controlled drug release and reduces the systemic adverse effect of anticancer drugs. [219,222] rotein corona formation on MBG surfaces is a complex process influenced by a variety of factors. As mentioned earlier, surface characteristics, protein properties, and environmental factors are influential in determining the composition, amount, and activity of the adsorbed protein. [189] Despite the significant role of protein corona in defining nanoparticle drug delivery and release characteristics, there is a lack of studies on MBGs as a specific class of BGs with promising potential in anticancer drug delivery. Hence, several purposeful, well-designed in vitro and in vivo studies with particular attention to MBGs distinct protein adsorption characteristics compared with conventional BGs are required to specify the influence of protein corona on MBGs and drug interactions.",

            "text": "The 3%PEG-LNPs showed a 4-fold lower FVII gene silencing activity compared to the 1%PEG-LNPs. Fluorescent microscopic observations of intrahepatic siRNA distribution revealed that most of the siRNAs showed a punctate pattern in the case of the 3%PEG-LNPs, indicating failure of endosomal escape, while substantial amounts of siRNAs showed a diffused pattern in the case of 1%PEG-LNPs, indicating the successful cytosolic delivery of siRNAs. The quantification of siRNAs also permitted the amount of siRNAs delivered by 3%PEG-LNPs to be measured and the findings indicated that the amount was significantly lower than that delivered by 1%PEG-LNPs, suggesting the premature release of siRNAs from the 3%PEG-LNPs in the blood stream. An in vitro study confirmed that the siRNAs released from the 3%PEG-LNPs showed a lower gene silencing activity only in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) but not in the absence of FBS (Fig. 9B), suggesting that serum components promote the destabilization and inactivation of small-sized LNPs. Measurement of the relative surface area using a TNS probe revealed that the actual relative surface area of 3%PEG-LNPs was 2.99-fold higher than that of the 1%PEG-LNPs (Fig. 9C), which was significantly higher than the theoretically calculated relative surface area (1.72-fold) (Fig. 9D), indicating that lower lipid packing on the interface may have occurred, possible due to packing stress derived from strain between the actual positive curvature on the interface of the LNPs and the spontaneous negative curvature of the fusogenic CLs (Fig. 9E). Measurement of the hydration level of the interface of the LNPs using laurdan supported the above finding (Fig. 9F).",

            "text": "The database access on PubMed makes it easy to judge a relevant scientific theme of important concern. As exemplified in Figure 1, a timeline search on PubMed with the title, \"nanoparticle and corona\" disclosed > 2000 publications from the years 2000 to 2020, and this number has increased eight-fold in the last decade. The surface coating of the NPs with PC in a living organism is indeed a prominent unresolved topic of discussionfrom a scientific and economic point of view. For decades there has been a steadily growing interest in the analysis of nanomaterials in biological fluid to trace the true molecular structure as expected during the preparation. This is valuable for nanotechnology and for biomedical and theranostic application. There is a wide gap between the drug discovery process and the biological identity of nanomaterials in the biological milieu. It has been identified that the surface of NPs alters due to the adsorption of protein, lipids, and biomolecules post-incubation in biological fluid. The protein-masked nanomaterials behave as new biological entities inferred as protein corona [1,2]. The formation of corona is a dynamic phenomenon governed by a lowering of the surface free energy in which various biological substrates compete for the same binding site onto the nanocarrier surface [3]. The protein adsorption on the surface of nanomaterials is considerably affected by their type, geometry, and conformation in biological fluid [4]. A lack of understanding associated with the in vivo performance of nanocarriers related to their physico-chemical characteristics, nanobiointeractions, blood circulation time, and corona formation could be rational explanations for the minimal translation of nanomedicines into clinical practice. The binding of proteins to the nano-surface is a complex, unpredictable process, affecting the fate of NPs related to biological and toxicological responses [5,6]. Numerous attempts have been made in the past to chemically modify the nanosurface to combat protein adsorption on to them. For instance, the functionalization of the NPs' surface with the polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain through PEGylation was designed to make it biocompatible and to allow a specific interaction with the cells and tissues of the biological compartment.",

            "text": "The number of publications focusing on the study of the PC has increased exponentially in recent years. It has been seen that a better understanding of protein adsorption to nanosystems is necessary, since this is going to be decisive for the biological response of NPs, pharmacokinetics, including biodistribution, and, in short, the therapeutic result. \n\nNanosystems have low stability and high systemic toxicity due to their high surface free energy. Therefore, the formation of PC increases the stability and decreases the toxicity of NPs. However, the formation of the PC through the non-specific binding of the different physiological biomolecules shows disadvantages for in vivo applications. PC can sterically mask ligands, and, as a consequence, NPs can lose their targeting capacity. In addition, the surface ligand can undergo structural changes when interacting with PC proteins, which causes an undesirable bio-distribution and immune response [23,41]. \n\nDifferent strategies to overcome NP opsonization and sequestration by MPS have been defined and are currently being implemented in order to achieve longer circulation times. Several studies have focused on the benefits of PC formation and have suggested approaches to control the biological behaviour of NPs. In this context, two main strategies have been developed: (1) to control the molecular composition of PC and improve biocompatibility, and (2) to prevent PC formation. These two strategies can be carried out by promoting in vivo adsorption with specific proteins (1) or by decorating the surface of nanosystems in vitro with specific proteins (PC) (2), which decreases the absorption of MPS and/or leads preferentially to a targeted delivery [11,23,42]. \n\nThe influence of the NP physicochemical properties and the medium and experimental conditions on the formation of a protein corona has been also analysed. The main results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. [20].",

            "text": "This is exacerbated by the slower elimination of IR780-oleyl from the blood stream (Fig. 1), and the stabilization towards a relatively high (> 25 ng/mL) residual concentration. Besides the marker dose applied, several factors could influence this difference between the two delivery systems, PEBCA and LipImage. Physicochemical aspects such as size, chemical composition of the nanoparticle and surface coverage of PEG are known to influence targeting; e.g. for LNPs, Dilliard et al. investigated the extrahepatic targeting, and proposed a mechanism where shedding of PEG from the particle surface is followed by selective interactions with plasma proteins, based on the chemical identity of the lipids present, and eventually tissue targeting based on the adsorbed proteins [37]. In our work, it could be noted that the length distribution of PEG moieties in the LipImage formulation is slightly shifted towards longer PEG than in the PEBCA formulation. Anselmo et al. [38] showed that for polymeric nanoparticles, material elasticity did influence circulation time and cellular uptake. Another factor that could strongly influence biodistribution of the nanoparticle payload (Cbz, IR780-oleyl) is the extent to which it exists as released, free compound, as opposed to encapsulated in the nanoparticle. Release can, in turn, happen along several routes, either by diffusion from (an intact) particle, by gradual erosion, or by complete dissociation of the particle. Release kinetics of drug molecules from therapeutic nanoparticles can vary dramatically and is influenced by PEGylation and protein corona, especially for hydrophobic drugs and a release diffusion-based release mechanism [39,40]. Thus, it becomes important to try to quantify which fraction of the payload is released, and which is still encapsulated. At the same time, quantification of the intactness of organic nanoparticles in vivo is very challenging, e.g. due to the presence of high concentrations of plasma proteins that can severely affect light scattering-based particle detection techniques.",

            "text": "Additionally, stringent quality control requirements must be met, depending on the type of drug carriers employed [97]. With respect to in vivo targeting ability, when NPs are administered systemically to transport substances across the BBB, there is a possibility that they may become coated with serum albumin, immunoglobulins, and other blood components. This coating can cause the NPs to be engulfed by macrophages and results in a substantial accumulation of NPs in the liver and spleen. Consequently, only a small portion of the drugs actually reach the brain tumors, leading to a significant reduction in the effectiveness of the therapy [90,98]. Coating NPs with stealth-imparting polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been proposed to address this issue because it can hide the NPs from the immune system and increase their circulation time in the organism [31,99,100]. However, PEG has been associated with an unanticipated immune response known as the accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon [101,102]. The ABC phenomenon has been widely documented in cases involving the repetitive use of PEGylated substances as well as PEGylated nanocarriers, where the presence of PEG increases their elimination rates and diminishes their effectiveness [103][104][105][106]. Moreover, functionalizing the surface of NPs with targeting ligands can result in the formation of a protein corona. This protein corona has a significant impact on the properties of the NPs, influencing their behavior in vivo and disrupting the ligand-receptor interactions leading to a loss of targeting capability. Additionally, it can hinder lysosomal escape and the transcytosis process across the BBB [107][108][109]. \n\nVarious strategies have been proposed to mitigate the nonspecific adsorption of the protein corona. These include surface modification with stealth polymers such as PEG and the use of biomimetic membrane camouflage. Another intriguing approach involves pre-coating the NPs with specific proteins or peptides to regulate the formation of the protein corona. For instance, iron-mimicking peptides such as T10 and CTR can be used to facilitate the recruitment of the Tf corona onto NPs in situ.",

            "text": "To further evaluate the recorded data, we analyze the kinetics of the corona formation in detail. To this end we highlight that the applied protein concentrations are low compared to native protein concentrations in blood. For this reason, the kinetics of corona formation is likely significantly accelerated in in vivo situations. We also note that, due to an increased sensitivity factor, a larger NPS peak shift is expected upon corona formation when the size of the Au core increases. Thus, the observed adsorption rates during corona formation at the surface of the differently sized nanostructures are not easily quantitatively compared. To account for the different sensitivity of the sensor structures, we have normalized the data using experimentally determined calibration factors derived from the measured peak shift induced by atomic layer deposition of 5 nm Al 2 O 3 , i.e. a thin homogenous oxide layer (see ESI \u2020 for details). In Fig. 3 we show the sensitivity-factor-normalized peak shift signal induced by corona formation plotted versus the accumulated mass of protein the sensor has been exposed to. The flow rate is the same for all experiments but the protein concentration differs between the samples (see the Experimental section in ESI \u2020 for details). For this reason, it is convenient to use the exposure (accumulated mass of protein) to compare the kinetics for the different samples. Here, we have assumed an initial protein content of 80 mg mL \u22121 in the two serum samples. Due to the applied sensitivity-factor normalization, the obtained data from the three different nanoparticle sizes are now directly and quantitatively comparable. The data show that the initial rate of the corona formation is lower for BSA compared to the two serum samples, independent of the size of the core/shell nanostructures. This implies that BSA may, despite its high concentration, not be a dominant protein in the early events of the corona formation as in competition with other serum proteins many other proteins, including IgG with a relative high concentration, will bind faster. However, the kinetics of IgG adsorption varies significantly with the size. For the smallest nanostructures, IgG exhibits a fairly low rate of adsorption, although higher than for BSA.",

Unfortunately, opsonins are also adsorbed. These proteins are immediately recognized by the phagocyte system with rapid clearance of the NPs from the bloodstream. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating of NPs (PEGylation) is the most efficient anti-opsonization strategy. Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages. However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system. To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains. Nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis allowed us to accurately determine the corona composition showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins. Due to the abundance of apolipoproteins, we exploited the \"protein corona effect\" to deliver cationic liposome-human plasma complexes to human prostate cancer PC3 cells that express a high level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in order to evaluate the cellular uptake efficiency of the systems used. Combining laser scanning confocal microscopy with flow cytometry analysis in PC3 cells we demonstrated that MC-PEG2k is the best compromise between an anti-opsonization strategy and active targeting and could be a promising candidate to treat prostate cancer in vivo.",

Branched polyethylenimine (25 kDa) or a linear beta-cyclodextrin-containing polymer are each used to formulate polyplexes, which can be PEGylated (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) to create particles stable in physiological salt concentrations. Particle size, cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and reporter gene expression are reported for polyplexes and for their PEGylated variants. PEGylation confers salt stability to particles but produced a reduction in luciferase expression. Examination of in vitro particle internalization by transmission electron microscopy shows unmodified polyplexes entering cells as large aggregates while PEGylated particles remain small and discrete, both outside and within cells. Unmodified and PEGylated particles enter cells through the endocytic pathway and accumulate in a perinuclear region. Immunolabeling reveals unpackaged exogenous DNA in the cytoplasm and nuclei. It appears all particle types traffic towards the nucleus within vesicles and undergo degradation in vesicles and/or cytoplasm, and eventually some exogenous DNA enters the nucleus, where it is transcribed.

We used PEG-lipids that varied in acyl chain composition because of recent results demonstrating acyl chain dependent transfer of PEG-lipids from lipid vesicles, providing the potential to allow a transformation of the surface properties due to loss of surface grafted PEG. The addition of PEG-modified lipids does not interfere in LDP formation and its presence favors formation of smaller particles (75 nm in contrast to 130 nm in the absence of the PEG-modified lipid). PEG-lipid incorporation causes a concentration dependent reduction in LDP-mediated transfection of B16/BL6 melanoma cells, a result that can be partially attributed to a reduction in particle binding to cells. However, significant LDP binding to B16/BL6 cells was still observed under conditions where LDP transfection activity was reduced by more than 85%.

The present study determined the effects of PEG anchors in PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes on in vitro gene-silencing effects and siRNA biodistribution after intravenous injection. Three types of dialkyl or trialkyl cationic lipids were used in the current study for the preparation of cationic liposomes. Additionally, various PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes that contained PEG-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE), PEG-1,2-distearoyl-rac-glycero-3-methylpolyoxyethylene (DSG), PEG-cholesterol (PEG-Chol) and PEG-chondroitin sulfate conjugate (PEG-CS) were prepared. The results revealed that PEGylation of siRNA lipoplexes with PEG-DSPE strongly decreased gene-silencing effects in cells. In contrast, those with PEG-DSG, PEG-Chol and PEG-CS did not largely decrease gene-silencing effects. However, regardless of the PEG-derivative type, PEGylation of siRNA lipoplexes decreased their agglutination with erythrocytes. Furthermore, intravenous injection of PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes markedly decreased the accumulation of siRNA in the lungs, regardless of the type of PEG-derivative. However, non-PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes accumulated mainly in the lungs regardless of the siRNA lipoplex cationic lipid type. The results indicated that PEGylation of siRNA lipoplexes with PEG-DSG, PEG-Chol and PEG-CS may improve systemic stability without losing transfection activity by PEGylation."

The de-PEGylation kinetics of a series of different lipid-PEGs is measured with their respective NPs, and the NP performance is comprehensively investigated in vitro and in vivo. This systematic study reveals that the lipophilic tails of lipid-PEG dictate its dissociation rate from NP surface, determining the uptake by tumor cells and macrophages, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and gene silencing efficacy of these hybrid siRNA NPs. Based on our observations, we here propose that lipid-PEGs with long and saturated lipophilic tails might be required for effective siRNA delivery to tumor cells and gene silencing of the lipid-polymer hybrid NPs after systemic administration."

Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

When comparing a series of alkyl chain lengths (18, 16, 14) in PEGylated lipids, an inversely proportional desorption rate (0.2, 1.3, 45% h\u22121) to the chain length was observed. [21] This trend is potentially translatable to other systems, although specific rates are applicable only to the evaluated carrier and for specific PEG lengths. Furthermore, the significance of conformational alterations in NPs upon protein adsorption should not be underestimated, [22][23][24] as these changes could generate a modified NP during circulation, thereby influencing anticipated effects by altering intracellular trafficking."

BNT162b2 encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the expression of which elicits immune responses against the antigen in recipients. In early December 2020, BNT162b2 received a temporary emergency use authorization (EUA) in the UK and, subsequently, a series of approvals or authorizations for emergency use in Bahrain, Canada, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the USA. Soon after, BNT162b2 received conditional marketing authorizations in Switzerland (19 December 2020) and the EU (21 December 2020) for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 16 years of age and older. BNT162b2 is administered intramuscularly in a two-dose regimen. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of BNT162b2 leading to these first approvals for the prevention of COVID-19."

C18 acyl chains are efficiently anchored in the membrane, while shorter C14 lipids are quickly desorbed and replaced by a protein corona responsible for the completely different fate of LNPs. In this context, a method to predict the biological behavior of LNPs depending on the lipid-PEG dissociation was developed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) method in serum. Two formulations of siRNA-containing LNPs were prepared including CSL3 or SM-102 lipids and were grafted with different lipids-PEG (C18, C14 lipids-PEG, and Ceramide-PEG). The impact of the lipid-PEG on the interactions between LNPs and serum components was demonstrated by monitoring the mean particle size and the concentration over time. In vitro, these formulations demonstrated low toxicity and efficient gene knockdown on tumor MDA-MB-231 cells, but serum was found to significantly impact the efficiency of C18-PEG-based LNPs, while it did not impact the efficiency of C14-PEG-based LNPs.

This will be in synthesis format to give the reader context for understanding the rest of the content.\n\n2. PEG-Lipid Chain Length Effects on Desorption Rate - The quotes contain specific data about how different chain lengths (C14, C16, C18) affect the desorption rate from LNPs in vivo, which directly impacts protein adsorption. This should be synthesis format to explain the relationship between chain length and desorption.\n\n3. Influence of PEG-Lipid Chain Length on Serum Protein Adsorption - This dimension will focus specifically on how different chain lengths affect the actual adsorption of proteins. This should be synthesis format as it requires integrating evidence about the mechanism.\n\n4. PEG-Lipid Concentration and Density Effects - Several quotes mention how the concentration/density of PEG-lipids affects the formation of steric barriers and protein adsorption. This should be synthesis format to properly explain this relationship.\n\n5. Protein Corona Composition and Specificity - This dimension will address what types of proteins adsorb to LNPs and how PEG-lipids influence the specificity of adsorption. This should be synthesis format to provide a coherent explanation of these complex interactions.\n\n6. Functional Implications of PEG-Lipid Properties on LNP Performance - This will discuss the biological consequences of the protein corona formation as influenced by PEG-lipids.

                "text": "\nLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as promising delivery vehicles for nucleic acid therapeutics, including mRNA vaccines and siRNA therapies. When administered intravenously, LNPs immediately encounter blood components, leading to the formation of a biomolecular corona - a layer of proteins and other biomolecules that adsorb onto the nanoparticle surface. This corona significantly alters the biological identity of LNPs and determines their in vivo fate. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nPEG-lipids (polyethylene glycol-modified lipids) are key components in LNP formulations that serve to stabilize the particles and provide a hydrophilic surface. These PEG-lipids consist of a lipid anchor connected to a PEG chain, with variations in both the lipid component and the length of the PEG chain. The density, architecture, and chain length of PEG-lipids directly influence how serum proteins interact with the LNP surface. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nThe process of protein corona formation is dynamic and complex, occurring within seconds to minutes after LNPs enter the bloodstream. The composition and characteristics of the corona are determined by both the properties of the LNP surface and the protein composition of biological fluids. For LNPs, the PEG-lipid component creates a steric barrier that can reduce, but not completely prevent, protein adsorption. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">\n\nUnderstanding how PEG-lipid properties influence protein adsorption is critical for designing LNPs with improved pharmacokinetic profiles, reduced immune responses, and enhanced targeting capabilities. The chain length of PEG-lipids is particularly important as it affects the stability of the PEG-lipid within the LNP as well as the thickness and density of the PEG layer on the particle surface. <Model name=\"Anthropic\" version=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\">",

                "text": "\nThe desorption rate of PEG-lipids from LNP surfaces is inversely proportional to the length of their lipid anchor chains, a relationship that has been consistently demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. When administered intravenously, LNPs containing PEG-lipids with C14 dialkyl chains exhibit rapid desorption rates exceeding 45% per hour, while those with C16 and C18 dialkyl chains show substantially slower desorption at only 1.3% and 0.2% per hour, respectively <Paper corpusId=\"18413960\" paperTitle=\"(Mui et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"250244349\" paperTitle=\"(Albertsen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"266347459\" paperTitle=\"(Lopez-Estevez et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This significant difference in retention time directly influences the LNP's interaction with serum components and subsequent biological behavior.\n\nPEG-lipids with short alkyl chains such as DMG-PEG2000 (C14, dimyristoylglycerol) rapidly dissociate from the LNP membrane in serum, reducing circulation time compared to LNPs composed of longer lipid-chains like DSPE-PEG2000 (C18, distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine) <Paper corpusId=\"256802846\" paperTitle=\"(Berger et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. The process of PEG shedding is particularly important for certain applications, as the presence of long-lived PEG-coatings (with C18 or C20 lipid anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity by inhibiting cellular uptake <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. \n\nShort-chained PEG-lipids, while providing sufficient stability during LNP assembly, are prone to dissociating in the presence of a lipid sink such as plasma, which contains endogenous lipid-based particles including lipoproteins and extracellular vesicles <Paper corpusId=\"250244349\" paperTitle=\"(Albertsen et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This dissociation creates an opportunity for serum proteins, particularly apolipoprotein E (ApoE), to adsorb onto the LNP surface, forming a biomolecular corona that can facilitate hepatocyte targeting through ApoE-dependent low-density lipoprotein receptors <Paper corpusId=\"235596708\" paperTitle=\"(Pilkington et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"267076387\" paperTitle=\"(John et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe strategic control of PEG-lipid desorption rates through chain length selection has emerged as a critical design parameter for LNPs. Formulations incorporating PEG-lipids with shorter chains (C14) demonstrate enhanced gene silencing in hepatocytes compared to those with longer chains (C18) at higher PEG-lipid concentrations <Paper corpusId=\"18413960\" paperTitle=\"(Mui et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This improved efficacy is attributed to the rapid shedding of the PEG coating, which facilitates interactions with the biological environment and target cells <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Conversely, LNPs with longer PEG-lipid chains provide better anchoring in lipid membranes, offering enhanced protection against serum protein interactions and prolonged circulation times, which may be advantageous for non-hepatic targeting applications such as tumor delivery <Paper corpusId=\"256802846\" paperTitle=\"(Berger et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThis phenomenon, referred to as \"PEG shedding,\" has been studied using techniques such as pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) NMR, which enables direct measurement of PEG dissociation kinetics in biological fluids without requiring labels <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Formulation optimization studies have consistently demonstrated that to form stable siRNA LNPs with diameters <100 nm the minimum amount of PEG 2000 -lipid required is ~1.5 mol %. 5,7 At this concentration, FVII siRNA LNPs containing PEG-C14, -C16, and -C18 exhibit similar siRNA ED 50 's of ~0.03 mg/kg. When the PEG-lipid content is raised to 2.5 mol % there is little or no effect on the ED 50 of PEG-C14 LNPs, whereas PEG-C18 LNPs completely lose activity in the dose range tested. This impact on activity resulting from such a small increase in mol percent highlights the effectiveness of the steric barrier provided by PEG-lipids."

                            "The lipid tail structure in PEG-lipids also influences LNPs biological activity. Since the PEG-lipid is incorporated into the LNP membrane through the hydrophobic tail (the alkyl/acyl chains), PEGlipids with longer tails are less likely to dissociate from the LNP. Studies have reported this correlation between desorption rate and lipid tail length both in vitro (Suzuki et al., 2020)(Harvie et al., 2000) and in vivo [51]. Mui et al. [51] showed that PEG-lipid desorption from LNPs in circulation, measured one hour after in vivo administration, was 45% for PEG-lipids with C14 dialkyl chains (the length of the alkyl/acyl groups is reported as CX, where X is the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl/acyl chain) and only 1.3% and 0.2% for PEG-lipids with C16 and C18 dialkyl chains, respectively. Studies have generally found that longer alkyl chains improve LNP stability in biological fluids. That said, even short C12 and C14 dialkyl/diacyl chains provide sufficient stability during LNP self-assembly (Suzuki et al., 2020)[51]. However, in the presence of a lipid sink (e.g. plasma), which contains endogenous lipid-based particles including lipoproteins and extracellular vesicles plus high levels of albumin with its many hydrophobic pockets (2019), the short-alkyl-chained PEG-lipids are prone to dissociating into the endogenous lipid-associating entities."

When comparing a series of alkyl chain lengths (18, 16, 14) in PEGylated lipids, an inversely proportional desorption rate (0.2, 1.3, 45% h\u22121) to the chain length was observed. [21] This trend is potentially translatable to other systems, although specific rates are applicable only to the evaluated carrier and for specific PEG lengths. Furthermore, the significance of conformational alterations in NPs upon protein adsorption should not be underestimated, [22][23][24] as these changes could generate a modified NP during circulation, thereby influencing anticipated effects by altering intracellular trafficking."

                            "The PEG-lipid is crucial to maintain the size and stability of the LNPs before administration and any PEG molecules that are present on the particle surface will also minimize in vivo serum protein adsorption. This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEGcoating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. 181,187,188 To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. 181,189 Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. 187,190 The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. 191 Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment. 192\u2212194"

The short-chained diacyl PEG-lipid PEG-carbamate-1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol (PEG-c-DMG), which was introduced in the Onpattro\u00ae formulation, tends to desorb from the LNPs upon intravenous administration. PEG-lipids with short lipid tails enable them to desorb from LNPs, allowing the particles to adsorb apoE, facilitating LNPs to endogenously target hepatocytes in the liver [32]."

On the contrary, LNPs with longer lipid chains, such as C18 acyl chain (distearoyl-glycerol), show completely different in vivo behavior with a better anchoring ability on lipid membranes, protecting LNPs and decreasing their interaction with blood proteins (Berger et al., 2023). siRNA-loaded LNP formulations containing PEG2000-DMG (1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000) have shorter circulation times and higher in vivo delivery efficacy than formulations containing PEG2000-DSG (1,2distearoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000), due to the faster dissociation from the LNPs, which may favor cellular uptake and endosomal escape [115]",

This differential desorption rate directly impacts the formation of the protein corona, as the exposed LNP surface becomes available for protein binding once the PEG-lipids dissociate <Paper corpusId=\"261091800\" paperTitle=\"(2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"245405261\" paperTitle=\"(Dilliard et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe rate at which PEG-lipids shed from LNPs is inversely proportional to their lipid hydrocarbon chain length <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This shedding phenomenon appears essential for maintaining particle stability, facilitating cellular uptake, and generating functional responses <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"483292\" paperTitle=\"(Mishra et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>. Notably, when PEG-lipids with shorter chains desorb from LNPs, they allow for the specific adsorption of serum proteins such as apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which facilitates LNP targeting to hepatocytes through ApoE-dependent low-density lipoprotein receptors <Paper corpusId=\"235596708\" paperTitle=\"(Pilkington et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe density of PEG on the LNP surface also influences protein adsorption, with higher PEG density generating better steric barriers through the formation of brush-like conformations. Studies have found that approximately 2% PEGylation of liposomes is optimal to limit serum protein binding to the liposome surface during short incubation periods <Paper corpusId=\"235596708\" paperTitle=\"(Pilkington et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. Judge et al. demonstrated that LNPs containing high amounts of C18 PEG-lipids showed longer circulation times and enhanced efficacy compared to LNPs with lower amounts of C14 PEG-lipids, which was attributed to reduced association with ApoE due to the highly shielded LNP surface <Paper corpusId=\"253795111\" paperTitle=\"(Kalita et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"883401\" paperTitle=\"(Judge et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nInterestingly, while acyl chain length significantly affects the rate of protein corona formation, recent research suggests it may not substantially influence the types of proteins that compose the corona. Kong et al. found no significant differences in the protein corona composition among LNPs containing DMG-PEG2k (C14), DSG-PEG2k (C16), and DSPE-PEG2k (C18) when exposed to fetal bovine serum <Paper corpusId=\"272593672\" paperTitle=\"(Kong et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"256802846\" paperTitle=\"(Berger et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that the observed variations in cellular uptake between different PEGylated lipids are primarily attributable to the length of the acyl chain and specific functional groups, rather than differences in the protein corona composition itself <Paper corpusId=\"272593672\" paperTitle=\"(Kong et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe composition of the protein corona evolves over time, initially comprising significant quantities of low-affinity proteins prevalent in the biological environment before transitioning to a corona enhanced with high-affinity proteins <Paper corpusId=\"267076387\" paperTitle=\"(John et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

The short-chained diacyl PEG-lipid PEG-carbamate-1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol (PEG-c-DMG), which was introduced in the Onpattro\u00ae formulation, tends to desorb from the LNPs upon intravenous administration.

                            "Significance Liver accumulation represents a significant barrier in the development of therapeutically efficacious nanoparticle drug delivery systems. Using a series of lipid nanoparticles with distinct organ-targeting properties, we provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of action for nanoparticle delivery to non-liver tissues. Following intravenous injection, specific proteins in the blood are recruited to the nanoparticle\u2019s surface based on its molecular composition and they endow it with a unique biological identity that governs its ultimate fate in the body. An innovative paradigm emerges from this mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle delivery\u2014endogenous targeting\u2014wherein the molecular composition of a nanoparticle is rationally engineered to interact with specific proteins in the blood to overcome liver accumulation and to target specific organs. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP\u2019s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle\u2019s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver."

This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEGcoating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. 181,187,188 To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. 181,189 Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. 187,190 The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. 191 Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment. 192\u2212194"

We determine if polycation-plasmid DNA complexes (polyplexes) exploited for in vitro studies behave similarly to variants more applicable to in vivo use by examining their cellular uptake and trafficking. Branched polyethylenimine (25 kDa) or a linear beta-cyclodextrin-containing polymer are each used to formulate polyplexes, which can be PEGylated (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) to create particles stable in physiological salt concentrations. Particle size, cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and reporter gene expression are reported for polyplexes and for their PEGylated variants. PEGylation confers salt stability to particles but produced a reduction in luciferase expression. Examination of in vitro particle internalization by transmission electron microscopy shows unmodified polyplexes entering cells as large aggregates while PEGylated particles remain small and discrete, both outside and within cells. Unmodified and PEGylated particles enter cells through the endocytic pathway and accumulate in a perinuclear region. Immunolabeling reveals unpackaged exogenous DNA in the cytoplasm and nuclei. It appears all particle types traffic towards the nucleus within vesicles and undergo degradation in vesicles and/or cytoplasm, and eventually some exogenous DNA enters the nucleus, where it is transcribed. In comparing polyplexes and their PEGylated variants, significant differences in particle morphology, cellular uptake, and resultant expression suggest that in vitro studies should be conducted with particles prepared for physiological conditions if the results are to be relevant to in vivo performance."

                            "PEG-lipids further aid in the aqueous solubility of LNP systems and provide a 'stealth' effect to particles in vivo, through shielding the LNP surface to limit the adsorption of serum proteins, ensuring protection against mononuclear phagocyte systemic uptake and thus contributing to increased circulation time [162]. Generally, higher PEG density on the surface of lipid delivery systems generates better steric barriers through the formation of brush-like conformations; around 2% PEGylation of liposomes was found to be optimal to limit serum protein binding to the liposome surface on incubation with serum for 10 min [167]",

On the contrary, LNPs with longer lipid chains, such as C18 acyl chain (distearoyl-glycerol), show completely different in vivo behavior with a better anchoring ability on lipid membranes, protecting LNPs and decreasing their interaction with blood proteins (Berger et al., 2023). siRNA-loaded LNP formulations containing PEG2000-DMG (1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000) have shorter circulation times and higher in vivo delivery efficacy than formulations containing PEG2000-DSG (1,2distearoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000), due to the faster dissociation from the LNPs, which may favor cellular uptake and endosomal escape [115]",

However, it remains critical to determine the true mechanism of their therapeutic effects. Here, we describe the preclinical development of chemically modified siRNA targeting the essential cell-cycle proteins polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and kinesin spindle protein (KSP) in mice. siRNA formulated in stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALP) displayed potent antitumor efficacy in both hepatic and subcutaneous tumor models. This was correlated with target gene silencing following a single intravenous administration that was sufficient to cause extensive mitotic disruption and tumor cell apoptosis. Our siRNA formulations induced no measurable immune response, minimizing the potential for nonspecific effects. Additionally, RNAi-specific mRNA cleavage products were found in tumor cells, and their presence correlated with the duration of target mRNA silencing. Histological biomarkers confirmed that RNAi-mediated gene silencing effectively inhibited the target's biological activity. This report supports an RNAi-mediated mechanism of action for siRNA antitumor effects, suggesting a new methodology for targeting other key genes in cancer development with siRNA-based therapeutics."

Optimal PEGylation levels (around 2%) create effective steric barriers against protein binding, while even small increases in PEG-lipid concentration (from 1.5% to 2.5%) can dramatically impact LNP activity depending on chain length.

                "text": "\nThe concentration and surface density of PEG-lipids on LNP surfaces play crucial roles in controlling protein adsorption during biomolecular corona formation. Studies have consistently shown that approximately 2% PEGylation of liposomes provides optimal protection against serum protein binding during short incubation periods, as the higher PEG density generates more effective steric barriers through the formation of brush-like conformations on the LNP surface <Paper corpusId=\"235596708\" paperTitle=\"(Pilkington et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This protective effect occurs because the PEG coating creates a hydrophilic shield that reduces interactions with opsonins and other serum proteins, thereby limiting recognition by the reticuloendothelial system <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"261730930\" paperTitle=\"(Monopoli et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe relationship between PEG-lipid concentration and LNP activity is particularly sensitive to the lipid anchor chain length. Formulation optimization studies have demonstrated that while a minimum of approximately 1.5 mol% PEG2000-lipid is required to form stable siRNA LNPs with diameters <100 nm, increasing this concentration to just 2.5 mol% has dramatically different effects depending on the chain length. For LNPs containing PEG-C14 lipids, this increase has minimal impact on efficacy, whereas LNPs with PEG-C18 lipids completely lose activity at the higher concentration <Paper corpusId=\"18413960\" paperTitle=\"(Mui et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This striking difference in activity resulting from such a small change in concentration highlights the potency of the steric barrier provided by PEG-lipids, particularly those with longer anchor chains.\n\nThe density and length of PEG chains on LNP surfaces directly determine their circulatory half-life by influencing interactions with different-sized opsonins present in the bloodstream <Paper corpusId=\"253795111\" paperTitle=\"(Kalita et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Judge et al. demonstrated that LNPs containing higher amounts of C18 PEG-lipids exhibited longer circulation times and enhanced efficacy compared to those with lower amounts of C14 PEG-lipids, attributed to reduced association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) due to the more effective surface shielding provided by the longer-chain PEG-lipids <Paper corpusId=\"253795111\" paperTitle=\"(Kalita et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"883401\" paperTitle=\"(Judge et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThis relationship creates what researchers have termed the \"PEG dilemma\" in LNP drug delivery: while longer and denser PEG coatings reduce nonspecific interactions with serum components in the bloodstream, they also inhibit fusion between the LNP and endosomal membranes, potentially reducing intracellular delivery efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.

Generally, higher PEG density on the surface of lipid delivery systems generates better steric barriers through the formation of brush-like conformations; around 2% PEGylation of liposomes was found to be optimal to limit serum protein binding to the liposome surface on incubation with serum for 10 min [167]",

                            "siRNAs that specifically silence the expression of cancer-related genes offer a therapeutic approach in oncology. However, it remains critical to determine the true mechanism of their therapeutic effects. Here, we describe the preclinical development of chemically modified siRNA targeting the essential cell-cycle proteins polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and kinesin spindle protein (KSP) in mice. siRNA formulated in stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALP) displayed potent antitumor efficacy in both hepatic and subcutaneous tumor models. This was correlated with target gene silencing following a single intravenous administration that was sufficient to cause extensive mitotic disruption and tumor cell apoptosis. Our siRNA formulations induced no measurable immune response, minimizing the potential for nonspecific effects. Additionally, RNAi-specific mRNA cleavage products were found in tumor cells, and their presence correlated with the duration of target mRNA silencing. Histological biomarkers confirmed that RNAi-mediated gene silencing effectively inhibited the target's biological activity. This report supports an RNAi-mediated mechanism of action for siRNA antitumor effects, suggesting a new methodology for targeting other key genes in cancer development with siRNA-based therapeutics."

The composition of this corona evolves over time from low-affinity to high-affinity proteins and can be strategically modulated through PEG-lipid design to achieve desired biodistribution and therapeutic outcomes.

                "text": "\nWhen LNPs enter the bloodstream, they rapidly acquire a protein corona that defines their biological identity and subsequent interactions with cells and tissues. The composition of this corona is not random but is influenced by the intrinsic properties of the nanoparticles, particularly their surface characteristics determined by PEG-lipids <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"261730930\" paperTitle=\"(Monopoli et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper>.

When PEG-lipids with shorter chains (C14) rapidly desorb from LNP surfaces in circulation, they create opportunities for ApoE to adsorb onto the exposed surface <Paper corpusId=\"235596708\" paperTitle=\"(Pilkington et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This ApoE adsorption facilitates uptake via ApoE-dependent low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR), making it a critical mediator of hepatocyte targeting <Paper corpusId=\"235596708\" paperTitle=\"(Pilkington et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"267076387\" paperTitle=\"(John et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. In contrast, LNPs with longer PEG-lipid chains (C18) exhibit reduced association with ApoE due to their highly shielded surfaces, which explains their longer circulation times but potentially reduced hepatic uptake <Paper corpusId=\"253795111\" paperTitle=\"(Kalita et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"883401\" paperTitle=\"(Judge et al., 2009)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nInterestingly, while the rate of protein corona formation is significantly affected by PEG-lipid chain length, recent research suggests that the types of proteins comprising the corona may not differ substantially between formulations with different PEG-lipid chain lengths. Kong et al. found no significant differences in the protein corona composition among LNPs containing DMG-PEG2k (C14), DSG-PEG2k (C16), and DSPE-PEG2k (C18) when exposed to fetal bovine serum <Paper corpusId=\"272593672\" paperTitle=\"(Kong et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that the variations in cellular uptake observed between different PEGylated LNPs are primarily attributable to the rate of PEG shedding rather than differences in the corona composition itself <Paper corpusId=\"272593672\" paperTitle=\"(Kong et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe inclusion of PEGylated lipids generally lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins, helping LNPs escape macrophage recognition <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This \"stealth\" effect is particularly pronounced with longer PEG-lipid chains, which create more effective barriers against opsonization <Paper corpusId=\"235596708\" paperTitle=\"(Pilkington et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, this protection comes with a trade-off in the form of the \"PEG dilemma\" - while longer and denser PEG coatings reduce nonspecific interactions with serum components, they also inhibit fusion between the LNP and endosomal membranes, potentially reducing intracellular delivery efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe strategic modulation of protein corona formation can be leveraged for therapeutic advantage. For instance, the controlled desorption of PEG-lipids from LNPs following administration enables selective interactions with the biological environment and target cells, a phenomenon referred to as \"PEG shedding\" <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"46643688\" paperTitle=\"(Wilson et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper>. The synergy between PEG shedding and subsequent coronation with biomolecules appears essential for maintaining particle stability, facilitating cellular uptake, and generating functional responses <Paper corpusId=\"237470166\" paperTitle=\"(Bost et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"483292\" paperTitle=\"(Mishra et al., 2004)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nFor applications requiring tumor targeting rather than hepatic delivery, LNPs with longer PEG-lipid chains like DSPE-PEG2000 (C18) display better anchoring ability in lipid membranes, effectively protecting LNPs by decreasing interactions with blood proteins and allowing for prolonged blood circulation time and increased tumor accumulation <Paper corpusId=\"256802846\" paperTitle=\"(Berger et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"222167392\" paperTitle=\"(Hattori et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. In contrast, mRNA-LNP formulations for hepatic targeting often utilize shorter PEG-lipids (C14) that quickly dissociate from the lipid membrane in serum, allowing for ApoE adsorption and subsequent hepatocyte targeting <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe protein corona formation can also influence the endosomal escape and nucleic acid release properties of LNPs. Studies have shown that upon intravenous administration, PEG-lipids with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, inducing a change in surface structure that allows protein adsorption, which affects the LNPs' endosomal escape and mRNA release capabilities <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This understanding has led to the strategic design of LNP formulations where the choice of PEG-lipid is tailored to the specific therapeutic target, target organ, and administration route <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "siRNAs that specifically silence the expression of cancer-related genes offer a therapeutic approach in oncology. However, it remains critical to determine the true mechanism of their therapeutic effects. Here, we describe the preclinical development of chemically modified siRNA targeting the essential cell-cycle proteins polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and kinesin spindle protein (KSP) in mice. siRNA formulated in stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALP) displayed potent antitumor efficacy in both hepatic and subcutaneous tumor models. This was correlated with target gene silencing following a single intravenous administration that was sufficient to cause extensive mitotic disruption and tumor cell apoptosis. Our siRNA formulations induced no measurable immune response, minimizing the potential for nonspecific effects. Additionally, RNAi-specific mRNA cleavage products were found in tumor cells, and their presence correlated with the duration of target mRNA silencing. Histological biomarkers confirmed that RNAi-mediated gene silencing effectively inhibited the target's biological activity. This report supports an RNAi-mediated mechanism of action for siRNA antitumor effects, suggesting a new methodology for targeting other key genes in cancer development with siRNA-based therapeutics."

The longer the PEG length, the less easily nonspecific interaction with serum components in the bloodstream. Nonetheless, it also inhibits fusion between LNP and endosome membrane, widely known as the \"PEG dilemma\" in LNP drug delivery [64]. The lipid structure of pegylation also has a significant effect on LNP function",

After the administration of LNPs, serum proteins are adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles evidently, forming a protein corona. This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition. Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs."

This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEGcoating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. 181,187,188 To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. 181,189 Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. 187,190 The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. 191 Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment. 192\u2212194"

                            "Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a novel therapeutic modality that benefits from nanoparticle mediated delivery. The most clinically advanced siRNA-containing nanoparticles are polymer-coated supramolecular assemblies of siRNA and lipids (lipid nanoparticles or LNPs), which protect the siRNA from nucleases, modulate pharmacokinetics of the siRNA, and enable selective delivery of siRNA to target cells. Understanding the mechanisms of assembly and delivery of such systems is complicated by the complexity of the dynamic supramolecular assembly as well as by its subsequent interactions with the biological milieu. We have developed an ex vivo method that provides insight into how LNPs behave when contacted with biological fluids. Pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) NMR was used to directly measure the kinetics of poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) shedding from siRNA encapsulated LNPs in rat serum. The method represents a molecularly specific, real-time, quantitative, and label-free way to monitor the behavior of a nanoparticle surface coating. We believe that this method has broad implications in gaining mechanistic insights into how nanoparticle-based drug delivery vehicles behave in biofluids and is versatile enough to be applied to a diversity of systems."

We determine if polycation-plasmid DNA complexes (polyplexes) exploited for in vitro studies behave similarly to variants more applicable to in vivo use by examining their cellular uptake and trafficking. Branched polyethylenimine (25 kDa) or a linear beta-cyclodextrin-containing polymer are each used to formulate polyplexes, which can be PEGylated (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) to create particles stable in physiological salt concentrations. Particle size, cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and reporter gene expression are reported for polyplexes and for their PEGylated variants. PEGylation confers salt stability to particles but produced a reduction in luciferase expression. Examination of in vitro particle internalization by transmission electron microscopy shows unmodified polyplexes entering cells as large aggregates while PEGylated particles remain small and discrete, both outside and within cells. Unmodified and PEGylated particles enter cells through the endocytic pathway and accumulate in a perinuclear region. Immunolabeling reveals unpackaged exogenous DNA in the cytoplasm and nuclei. It appears all particle types traffic towards the nucleus within vesicles and undergo degradation in vesicles and/or cytoplasm, and eventually some exogenous DNA enters the nucleus, where it is transcribed. In comparing polyplexes and their PEGylated variants, significant differences in particle morphology, cellular uptake, and resultant expression suggest that in vitro studies should be conducted with particles prepared for physiological conditions if the results are to be relevant to in vivo performance."

The present study determined the effects of PEG anchors in PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes on in vitro gene-silencing effects and siRNA biodistribution after intravenous injection. Three types of dialkyl or trialkyl cationic lipids were used in the current study for the preparation of cationic liposomes. Additionally, various PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes that contained PEG-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE), PEG-1,2-distearoyl-rac-glycero-3-methylpolyoxyethylene (DSG), PEG-cholesterol (PEG-Chol) and PEG-chondroitin sulfate conjugate (PEG-CS) were prepared. The results revealed that PEGylation of siRNA lipoplexes with PEG-DSPE strongly decreased gene-silencing effects in cells. In contrast, those with PEG-DSG, PEG-Chol and PEG-CS did not largely decrease gene-silencing effects. However, regardless of the PEG-derivative type, PEGylation of siRNA lipoplexes decreased their agglutination with erythrocytes. Furthermore, intravenous injection of PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes markedly decreased the accumulation of siRNA in the lungs, regardless of the type of PEG-derivative. However, non-PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes accumulated mainly in the lungs regardless of the siRNA lipoplex cationic lipid type. The results indicated that PEGylation of siRNA lipoplexes with PEG-DSG, PEG-Chol and PEG-CS may improve systemic stability without losing transfection activity by PEGylation."

                "tldr": "The choice of PEG-lipid properties creates crucial trade-offs in LNP performance, where longer chains (C18) provide extended circulation and reduced protein interactions but hinder cellular uptake, while shorter chains (C14) enable better cellular uptake and endosomal escape but reduce circulation time. These properties must be strategically selected based on therapeutic application, with shorter PEG-lipids favoring hepatic delivery and longer chains benefiting tumor targeting. (15 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe functional performance of LNPs in vivo is directly governed by the strategic selection of PEG-lipid properties, creating a series of design trade-offs that must be balanced for specific therapeutic applications. One of the most significant challenges in LNP design is navigating what researchers have termed the \"PEG dilemma\" - while longer and denser PEG coatings reduce nonspecific interactions with serum components in the bloodstream, they simultaneously inhibit fusion between the LNP and endosomal membranes, potentially reducing intracellular delivery efficiency <Paper corpusId=\"269120128\" paperTitle=\"(Huang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This fundamental trade-off necessitates careful optimization of PEG-lipid properties for each specific application.\n\nThe therapeutic target and administration route heavily influence the optimal PEG-lipid selection. For applications requiring tumor targeting rather than hepatic delivery, LNPs with longer PEG-lipid chains such as DSPE-PEG2000 (C18) demonstrate superior anchoring ability in lipid membranes, effectively protecting LNPs by decreasing interactions with blood proteins, allowing for prolonged blood circulation time and increased tumor accumulation <Paper corpusId=\"256802846\" paperTitle=\"(Berger et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"222167392\" paperTitle=\"(Hattori et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. In contrast, mRNA-LNP formulations targeting hepatocytes frequently utilize shorter PEG-lipids (C14) that quickly dissociate from the lipid membrane in serum, creating opportunities for ApoE adsorption and subsequent hepatocyte targeting <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe impact of PEG-lipid concentration on LNP performance is remarkably sensitive to chain length. Studies have shown that while a minimum of approximately 1.5 mol% PEG2000-lipid is required to form stable siRNA LNPs with diameters <100 nm, increasing this concentration to just 2.5 mol% has dramatically different effects depending on the chain length. For LNPs containing PEG-C14 lipids, this increase has minimal impact on efficacy, whereas LNPs with PEG-C18 lipids completely lose activity at the higher concentration <Paper corpusId=\"18413960\" paperTitle=\"(Mui et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This striking difference in activity resulting from such a small change in concentration highlights the potency of the steric barrier provided by longer-chain PEG-lipids.\n\nFunctional studies with reporter proteins have confirmed that longer aliphatic PEG anchors, which show poorer desorption from LNP surfaces, result in noticeably lower expression levels across all organs <Paper corpusId=\"273570097\" paperTitle=\"(Vasileva et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This relationship between PEG-lipid retention and functional efficacy extends to the endosomal escape capabilities of LNPs. Upon intravenous administration, PEG-lipids with short lipid tails tend to desorb from LNPs, inducing changes in surface structure that allow protein adsorption, which affects the LNPs' endosomal escape and mRNA release capabilities <Paper corpusId=\"274333034\" paperTitle=\"(Catenacci et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe inclusion of PEGylated lipids generally lowers the tendency of nanoparticles to adsorb complement proteins and immunoglobulins, helping LNPs escape macrophage recognition <Paper corpusId=\"231820159\" paperTitle=\"(Aldosari et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"16024780\" paperTitle=\"(Neagu et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This \"stealth\" effect is particularly pronounced with longer PEG-lipid chains, which create more effective barriers against opsonization.

                            "Typically, the half-life of LNPs depends on the length of PEG lipid. The longer the PEG length, the less easily nonspecific interaction with serum components in the bloodstream. Nonetheless, it also inhibits fusion between LNP and endosome membrane, widely known as the \"PEG dilemma\" in LNP drug delivery [64].

This corona may impede targeted efficacy by shielding surface ligands necessary for specific cell or receptor recognition. Surface-exposed PEGylated lipids play a crucial role in determining and regulating the composition of the corona proteins on LNPs."

The present study determined the effects of PEG anchors in PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes on in vitro gene-silencing effects and siRNA biodistribution after intravenous injection. Three types of dialkyl or trialkyl cationic lipids were used in the current study for the preparation of cationic liposomes. Additionally, various PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes that contained PEG-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE), PEG-1,2-distearoyl-rac-glycero-3-methylpolyoxyethylene (DSG), PEG-cholesterol (PEG-Chol) and PEG-chondroitin sulfate conjugate (PEG-CS) were prepared. The results revealed that PEGylation of siRNA lipoplexes with PEG-DSPE strongly decreased gene-silencing effects in cells. In contrast, those with PEG-DSG, PEG-Chol and PEG-CS did not largely decrease gene-silencing effects. However, regardless of the PEG-derivative type, PEGylation of siRNA lipoplexes decreased their agglutination with erythrocytes. Furthermore, intravenous injection of PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes markedly decreased the accumulation of siRNA in the lungs, regardless of the type of PEG-derivative. However, non-PEGylated siRNA lipoplexes accumulated mainly in the lungs regardless of the siRNA lipoplex cationic lipid type. The results indicated that PEGylation of siRNA lipoplexes with PEG-DSG, PEG-Chol and PEG-CS may improve systemic stability without losing transfection activity by PEGylation."

Formulation optimization studies have consistently demonstrated that to form stable siRNA LNPs with diameters <100 nm the minimum amount of PEG 2000 -lipid required is ~1.5 mol %. 5,7 At this concentration, FVII siRNA LNPs containing PEG-C14, -C16, and -C18 exhibit similar siRNA ED 50 's of ~0.03 mg/kg. When the PEG-lipid content is raised to 2.5 mol % there is little or no effect on the ED 50 of PEG-C14 LNPs, whereas PEG-C18 LNPs completely lose activity in the dose range tested. This impact on activity resulting from such a small increase in mol percent highlights the effectiveness of the steric barrier provided by PEG-lipids."

Undeniably, bio-corona generation influences the efficacy of the nanodrug and guides the actions of innate and adaptive immunity. Exploiting the dynamic process of protein bio-corona development in combination with the new engineered horizons of drugs linked to nanoparticles could lead to innovative functional nanotherapies. Therefore, bio-medical nanotechnologies should focus on the interactions of nanoparticles with the immune system for both safety and efficacy reasons."

Generally, higher PEG density on the surface of lipid delivery systems generates better steric barriers through the formation of brush-like conformations; around 2% PEGylation of liposomes was found to be optimal to limit serum protein binding to the liposome surface on incubation with serum for 10 min [167]",

This will facilitate access to tissues other than phagocytes. However, if the PEG-lipid is not optimized for the application and lipid composition it can inhibit cellular uptake. It had been observed that the presence of a long-lived PEGcoating (i.e., PEG molecules with C18 or C20 lipids anchors) can dramatically reduce RNA activity. 181,187,188 To avoid this, the PEG-lipids have to date mostly been designed to partly dissociate from the LNPs following injection. It is thought that this enables access to the LNP surface and therefore interactions with the biological environment and the target cells. This phenomenon is called \"PEG shedding\". NMR studies have shown that the rate of \"PEG shedding\" is inversely proportional to the lipid hydrocarbon chain length, meaning that formulations with shorter PEG-lipids shed more than those with longer tails. 181,189 Inhibition of cellular uptake and immune response effects were observed by using a C14 anchor PEG-lipid which sheds off from the surface in few minutes postinjection. 187,190 The mechanism behind this process and the proteins involved remain obscure; however, it is possible that a synergy between PEG shedding and coating of the RNA-LNPs by biomolecules in the surrounding medium, i.e., coronation, is essential to maintain particle stability, cellular uptake, and functional response. 191 Coronation, or protein corona formation, is described as the protein adsorption layer that forms and defines the biological \"identity\" of a particle as well as mediates further interactions between the particles and the biological environment. 192\u2212194"

However, in vitro and in vivo nanoparticle delivery efficiency is influenced by the formation of a protein corona in biological media. In this study, we have formulated four types of EnCore nanoparticles (F1 to F4) with a similar composition, but different polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated lipid chain lengths (carbon 14 vs. carbon 18) and molar ratios (6% vs. 3%). These LNPs showed dramatic differences in cellular delivery and transfection in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells in the absence and presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS). The presence of proteins inhibited the cellular uptake of C18 (3%) nanoparticles, while it facilitated the cellular uptake of C14 nanoparticles. Among the adsorbed proteins from FBS, apolipoprotein E, but not apolipoprotein A1, affected the cellular uptake of the carbon 14 LNPs. Additionally, surface PEG was one of the determinants for the protein corona amount and composition. Finally, different serum to LNP volume ratios resulted in different protein enrichment patterns. Overall, the results showed a correlation between surface chemistry of LNPs and the protein corona composition suggesting a potential use for targeted delivery."

                            "Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a novel therapeutic modality that benefits from nanoparticle mediated delivery. The most clinically advanced siRNA-containing nanoparticles are polymer-coated supramolecular assemblies of siRNA and lipids (lipid nanoparticles or LNPs), which protect the siRNA from nucleases, modulate pharmacokinetics of the siRNA, and enable selective delivery of siRNA to target cells. Understanding the mechanisms of assembly and delivery of such systems is complicated by the complexity of the dynamic supramolecular assembly as well as by its subsequent interactions with the biological milieu. We have developed an ex vivo method that provides insight into how LNPs behave when contacted with biological fluids. Pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) NMR was used to directly measure the kinetics of poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) shedding from siRNA encapsulated LNPs in rat serum. The method represents a molecularly specific, real-time, quantitative, and label-free way to monitor the behavior of a nanoparticle surface coating. We believe that this method has broad implications in gaining mechanistic insights into how nanoparticle-based drug delivery vehicles behave in biofluids and is versatile enough to be applied to a diversity of systems."

                            "In vitro studies of non-viral gene delivery vectors are typically not performed at physiological conditions, and thus may not provide meaningful results for in vivo investigations. We determine if polycation-plasmid DNA complexes (polyplexes) exploited for in vitro studies behave similarly to variants more applicable to in vivo use by examining their cellular uptake and trafficking. Branched polyethylenimine (25 kDa) or a linear beta-cyclodextrin-containing polymer are each used to formulate polyplexes, which can be PEGylated (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) to create particles stable in physiological salt concentrations. Particle size, cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and reporter gene expression are reported for polyplexes and for their PEGylated variants. PEGylation confers salt stability to particles but produced a reduction in luciferase expression. Examination of in vitro particle internalization by transmission electron microscopy shows unmodified polyplexes entering cells as large aggregates while PEGylated particles remain small and discrete, both outside and within cells. Unmodified and PEGylated particles enter cells through the endocytic pathway and accumulate in a perinuclear region. Immunolabeling reveals unpackaged exogenous DNA in the cytoplasm and nuclei. It appears all particle types traffic towards the nucleus within vesicles and undergo degradation in vesicles and/or cytoplasm, and eventually some exogenous DNA enters the nucleus, where it is transcribed. In comparing polyplexes and their PEGylated variants, significant differences in particle morphology, cellular uptake, and resultant expression suggest that in vitro studies should be conducted with particles prepared for physiological conditions if the results are to be relevant to in vivo performance."
