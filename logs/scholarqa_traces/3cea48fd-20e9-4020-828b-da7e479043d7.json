Comparing to the previously established system, this optimized system has a higher gene editing efficiency and less operating time, almost 100% for codon replacements and knockout genes within 2 days. It was noteworthy that using a double-strand DNA as a donor template has a better performance than a single-strand DNA in gene deletions. Subsequently, this optimized system was employed to strengthen the MEP pathway by substituting the promoters and ribosome binding sites, inserting a heterologous \u03b2-carotene biosynthetic pathway and optimizing the central carbon metabolism (Li et al., 2015). Finally, the best producer yielded 2.0 g/L \u03b2-carotene in fed-batch fermentation. This extensive work can hardly be completed without employing CRISPR-based tools, revealing their great potential for efficient and diverse manipulation of genomic DNA. The Cas9-recombineering method was further exploited with the development of the CRISPR-enabled trackable genome engineering (CREATE) tool (Garst et al., 2017). Application of this tool in E. coli allowed for simultaneous transformation of multiple libraries of plasmid-borne recombined templates (Garst et al., 2017). The CREATE strategy was employed to construct genome libraries of isopropanol pathway by introducing multiple ribosome binding site variations in E. coli, leading to the construction and testing of \u223c1,000 strains in a few days. The best performer reached a titer of 7.1 g/L isopropanol within 24 h (Liang et al., 2017). \n\nBesides the versatile applications in E. coli, the CRISPR-based tools also had satisfactory performances in other bacteria (Table 1). For instance, genetic engineering technologies for solventogenic Clostridium were still immature due to low transformation efficiency, inadequate endogenous homologous recombination, and poorly understood physiology and metabolism (Papoutsakis, 2008;Pyne et al., 2014;Bruder et al., 2016).",

Dong, Jie Zhou, Wenming Zhang, F. Xin, M. Jiang\n## Abstract\nIndustrial biology plays a crucial role in the fields of medicine, health, food, energy, and so on. However, the lack of efficient genetic engineering tools has restricted the rapid development of industrial biology. Recently, the emergence of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system brought a breakthrough in genome editing technologies due to its high orthogonality, versatility, and efficiency. In this review, we summarized the barriers of CRISPR/Cas9 and corresponding solutions for efficient genetic engineering in industrial microorganisms. In addition, the advances of industrial biology employing the CRISPR/Cas9 system were compared in terms of its application in bacteria, yeast, and filamentous fungi. Furthermore, the cooperation between CRISPR/Cas9 and synthetic biology was discussed to help build complex and programmable gene circuits, which can be used in industrial biotechnology.\n## CRISPR/CAS9-MEDIATED GENETIC ENGINEERING IN INDUSTRIAL BIOLOGY\nIndustrial microorganisms can produce various value-added chemicals from low-cost feedstock including renewable biomass and organic wastes (Yao et al., 2018). To enhance the performances of industrial microorganisms, genetic modifications were usually implemented to construct desired microbial cell factories. Although various methods are available for genetic modifications, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Fortunately, as a surprising \"gift, \" the CRISPR/Cas9 system greatly improved the efficiency of genetic engineering. Here, we reviewed the applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi with special emphasis on E. coli and S. cerevisiae, which were the most commonly used cell factory.\n\n## The Application of CRISPR/Cas9 in Bacteria\nEscherichia coli is often used to produce a variety of valuable chemicals, drugs, and biofuels in industrial biotechnology. A traditional method of gene knockout in E. coli was to adopt the Red homologous recombination system to mediate the homologous recombination of DNA. However, it is inefficient and especially not suitable for recombination of multiple sites (Murphy and Campellone, 2003). To improve the genetic engineering efficiency, Jiang et al. construct a triple-plasmid system as mentioned above.

This fast and easy procedure for genome editing could perform continuously, as multiple loci only required one plasmid construction and one step of transformation. To further improve the simultaneous editing efficiency of multiple loci, a CRISPR/Cas9-assisted multiplex genome editing technique was developed. The CRISPR/Cas9-assisted multiplex genome editing technique contained three plasmids: pRedCas9 containing both \u03bb-Red recombineering and Cas9 system under the control of pBAD promoter, pMgRNAs containing gRNAs, and pDonorDNAs carrying multiple donor DNA cassettes (Feng et al., 2018). In another versatile study, Li et al. firstly coexpressed a plasmid containing a gRNA targeting the bla gene and Cas9 with the \u03bb-Red recombineering system into E. coli (Li et al., 2015). Then, the genetic editing started with cotransformation of donor DNA and gRNA plasmid into preceding cells.\n...\nThen, the genetic editing started with cotransformation of donor DNA and gRNA plasmid into preceding cells. Comparing to the previously established system, this optimized system has a higher gene editing efficiency and less operating time, almost 100% for codon replacements and knockout genes within 2 days. It was noteworthy that using a double-strand DNA as a donor template has a better performance than a single-strand DNA in gene deletions. Subsequently, this optimized system was employed to strengthen the MEP pathway by substituting the promoters and ribosome binding sites, inserting a heterologous \u03b2-carotene biosynthetic pathway and optimizing the central carbon metabolism (Li et al., 2015). Finally, the best producer yielded 2.0 g/L \u03b2-carotene in fed-batch fermentation. This extensive work can hardly be completed without employing CRISPR-based tools, revealing their great potential for efficient and diverse manipulation of genomic DNA. The Cas9-recombineering method was further exploited with the development of the CRISPR-enabled trackable genome engineering (CREATE) tool (Garst et al., 2017). Application of this tool in E. coli allowed for simultaneous transformation of multiple libraries of plasmid-borne recombined templates (Garst et al., 2017). The CREATE strategy was employed to construct genome libraries of isopropanol pathway by introducing multiple ribosome binding site variations in E. coli, leading to the construction and testing of \u223c1,000 strains in a few days. The best performer reached a titer of 7.1 g/L isopropanol within 24 h (Liang et al., 2017). \n\nBesides the versatile applications in E. coli, the CRISPR-based tools also had satisfactory performances in other bacteria (Table 1). For instance, genetic engineering technologies for solventogenic Clostridium were still immature due to low transformation efficiency, inadequate endogenous homologous recombination, and poorly understood physiology and metabolism (Papoutsakis, 2008;Pyne et al., 2014;Bruder et al., 2016).",

To this end, genome editing and expression control are performed by recruiting a series of genetic tools, including RecA-, Red-based homologous recombination, zincfinger nucleases (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) [1], transposon mutagenesis [2], RNA interference (RNAi) [3] and antisense RNA approaches [4]. Implementation of these approaches is laborious and time-consuming compared to the prevailing CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The emergence of CRISPR-Cas9 tools has augmented our ability to sculpt the genome and program the gene expression of model industrial microorganisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae [5]and Escherichia coli [6]. However, the growing interest in other microorganisms, whereby genome editing options remain limited, necessitates further research and development of such engineering tools. In this review, we portray a picture of CRISPR-Cas9-based tools for genome editing and transcription regulation of both model and non-model microbes. Additionally we propose strategies for further improvement and expansion of these tools toward overproduction of desired chemicals.",

Tian, Jia Wang, Xiaolin Shen, J. Rey, Qipeng Yuan, Yajun Yan\n## Abstract\nNone\n## Introduction\nOne central goal of microbial metabolic engineering and synthetic biology is to overproduce intended metabolites including green chemicals and fuels. To this end, genome editing and expression control are performed by recruiting a series of genetic tools, including RecA-, Red-based homologous recombination, zincfinger nucleases (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) [1], transposon mutagenesis [2], RNA interference (RNAi) [3] and antisense RNA approaches [4]. Implementation of these approaches is laborious and time-consuming compared to the prevailing CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The emergence of CRISPR-Cas9 tools has augmented our ability to sculpt the genome and program the gene expression of model industrial microorganisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae [5]and Escherichia coli [6]. However, the growing interest in other microorganisms, whereby genome editing options remain limited, necessitates further research and development of such engineering tools. In this review, we portray a picture of CRISPR-Cas9-based tools for genome editing and transcription regulation of both model and non-model microbes. Additionally we propose strategies for further improvement and expansion of these tools toward overproduction of desired chemicals.",

However, simultaneously modulating multiple genes on the chromosome remains challenging in Bacillus subtilis. Thus, developing an efficient and convenient method for B. subtilis multiplex genome editing is imperative. Here, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9n-based multiplex genome editing system for iterative genome editing in B. subtilis. This system enabled us to introduce various types of genomic modifications with more satisfying efficiency than using CRISPR/Cas9, especially in multiplex gene editing. Our system achieved at least 80% efficiency for 1\u20138 kb gene deletions, at least 90% efficiency for 1\u20132 kb gene insertions, near 100% efficiency for site-directed mutagenesis, 23.6% efficiency for large DNA fragment deletion and near 50% efficiency for three simultaneous point mutations. The efficiency for multiplex gene editing was further improved by regulating the nick repair mechanism mediated by ligD gene, which finally led to roughly 65% efficiency for introducing three point mutations on the chromosome. To demonstrate its potential, we applied our system to simultaneously fine-tune three genes in the riboflavin operon and significantly improved the production of riboflavin in a single cycle. We present not only the iterative CRISPR/Cas9n system for B. subtilis but also the highest efficiency for simultaneous modulation of multiple genes on the chromosome in B. subtilis reported to date. We anticipate this CRISPR/Cas9n mediated system to greatly enhance the optimization of diverse biological systems via metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.",

It readily secretes products into the extracellular medium and can metabolize nearly any carbon source, making it an attractive biomanufacturing platform [9]. While B. subtilis is an ideal organism for metabolic engineering applications, the development of genetic tools is lagging behind popular production hosts such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, especially in multiplex genome editing. In E. coli and S. cerevisiae, efficient genome editing tools and a range of established multiplex pathway-optimization techniques (MAGE [10], YOGE [11], TRMR [12], RAGE [13], CREATE [14], CHAnGE [15], and so on) have been developed, which enabled the simultaneous modification of several loci, and greatly enhanced the ability to engineer complex pathways. Although a substantial collection of counter-selectable markers [16][17][18], or \u03bb-Red phage mediated singlestranded DNA recombination [19] tools are available for engineering B. subtilis, these techniques requires time-consuming sequential transformation steps and are unable to achieve highly efficient complex gene editing. The current genetic engineering tools, therefore, still represent a bottleneck for multiple genes modulation in B. subtilis. \n\nRecently, microbial genome editing techniques have progressed significantly due to the extensive research conducted on the CRISPR system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), derived from the RNA-guided immune systems found in many bacteria and archaea [1,20]. The introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system not only eliminated the need for selection markers in genome editing but also dramatically increased the editing efficiency [21][22][23][24]. Current genome editing applications based on the type II-CRISPR/Cas9 system in bacteria are classified into two categories: Cas9-mediated genome editing and Cas9 nickase (Cas9n)-mediated genome editing [25].",

However, simultaneously modulating multiple genes on the chromosome remains challenging in Bacillus subtilis. Thus, developing an efficient and convenient method for B. subtilis multiplex genome editing is imperative. Here, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9n-based multiplex genome editing system for iterative genome editing in B. subtilis. This system enabled us to introduce various types of genomic modifications with more satisfying efficiency than using CRISPR/Cas9, especially in multiplex gene editing. Our system achieved at least 80% efficiency for 1\u20138 kb gene deletions, at least 90% efficiency for 1\u20132 kb gene insertions, near 100% efficiency for site-directed mutagenesis, 23.6% efficiency for large DNA fragment deletion and near 50% efficiency for three simultaneous point mutations. The efficiency for multiplex gene editing was further improved by regulating the nick repair mechanism mediated by ligD gene, which finally led to roughly 65% efficiency for introducing three point mutations on the chromosome. To demonstrate its potential, we applied our system to simultaneously fine-tune three genes in the riboflavin operon and significantly improved the production of riboflavin in a single cycle. We present not only the iterative CRISPR/Cas9n system for B. subtilis but also the highest efficiency for simultaneous modulation of multiple genes on the chromosome in B. subtilis reported to date. We anticipate this CRISPR/Cas9n mediated system to greatly enhance the optimization of diverse biological systems via metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.\n## Open Access\nBiotechnology for Biofuels Bacillus subtilis, which was granted GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status by the US Food and Drug Administration, has long been widely used for the production of enzymes, drug precursors, platform compounds, biofuels and biopolymers [8]. It readily secretes products into the extracellular medium and can metabolize nearly any carbon source, making it an attractive biomanufacturing platform [9]. While B. subtilis is an ideal organism for metabolic engineering applications, the development of genetic tools is lagging behind popular production hosts such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, especially in multiplex genome editing. In E. coli and S. cerevisiae, efficient genome editing tools and a range of established multiplex pathway-optimization techniques (MAGE [10], YOGE [11], TRMR [12], RAGE [13], CREATE [14], CHAnGE [15], and so on) have been developed, which enabled the simultaneous modification of several loci, and greatly enhanced the ability to engineer complex pathways. Although a substantial collection of counter-selectable markers [16][17][18], or \u03bb-Red phage mediated singlestranded DNA recombination [19] tools are available for engineering B. subtilis, these techniques requires time-consuming sequential transformation steps and are unable to achieve highly efficient complex gene editing. The current genetic engineering tools, therefore, still represent a bottleneck for multiple genes modulation in B. subtilis. \n\nRecently, microbial genome editing techniques have progressed significantly due to the extensive research conducted on the CRISPR system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), derived from the RNA-guided immune systems found in many bacteria and archaea [1,20]. The introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system not only eliminated the need for selection markers in genome editing but also dramatically increased the editing efficiency [21][22][23][24]. Current genome editing applications based on the type II-CRISPR/Cas9 system in bacteria are classified into two categories: Cas9-mediated genome editing and Cas9 nickase (Cas9n)-mediated genome editing [25].",

Additionally, they have a clear genetic background and use diverse genetic modification methods, such as CRISPR/Cas9 technology, making it easy to optimize recombinant protein production [ 8 , 14 ]. Importantly, as a eukaryotic model organism, yeast can efficiently complete the posttranslational modification process [15] . S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris have been used to produce many FDA-approved recombinant protein drugs [ 16 , 17 ], including insulin and insulin analogs, human serum albumin, hepatitis vaccines, and virus-like particles for vaccination against human tumor viruses [ 18 , 19 ]. Furthermore, S. cerevisiae is often used to produce industrial enzymes, including -amylase and cellulase [20][21][22][23][24] . \n\nSecretion of recombinant proteins does not require cell lysis, resulting in fewer interfering proteins. This simplifies the separation and purification processes and reduces production costs, making it a widely used method for recombinant protein production. The surface-display of recombinant proteins has extensive applications in vaccine and antibody development, library screening, biosensor detection systems, biodegradation, and biofuels [25] . Therefore, it has become a powerful tool for biotechnological and biomedical applications [ 26 , 27 ]. However, production of secreted or surface-displayed proteins by S. cerevisiae is often limited to low amounts. Consequently, various approaches, such as optimizing gene transcription levels and engineering secretory pathways, have been explored to enhance recombinant protein production. In this review, we summarize the function of these strategies for improving the production of recombinant proteins in S. cerevisiae .",

Additionally, they have a clear genetic background and use diverse genetic modification methods, such as CRISPR/Cas9 technology, making it easy to optimize recombinant protein production [ 8 , 14 ]. Importantly, as a eukaryotic model organism, yeast can efficiently complete the posttranslational modification process [15] . S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris have been used to produce many FDA-approved recombinant protein drugs [ 16 , 17 ], including insulin and insulin analogs, human serum albumin, hepatitis vaccines, and virus-like particles for vaccination against human tumor viruses [ 18 , 19 ]. Furthermore, S. cerevisiae is often used to produce industrial enzymes, including -amylase and cellulase [20][21][22][23][24] . \n\nSecretion of recombinant proteins does not require cell lysis, resulting in fewer interfering proteins. This simplifies the separation and purification processes and reduces production costs, making it a widely used method for recombinant protein production. The surface-display of recombinant proteins has extensive applications in vaccine and antibody development, library screening, biosensor detection systems, biodegradation, and biofuels [25] . Therefore, it has become a powerful tool for biotechnological and biomedical applications [ 26 , 27 ]. However, production of secreted or surface-displayed proteins by S. cerevisiae is often limited to low amounts. Consequently, various approaches, such as optimizing gene transcription levels and engineering secretory pathways, have been explored to enhance recombinant protein production. In this review, we summarize the function of these strategies for improving the production of recombinant proteins in S. cerevisiae .",

However, the accumulation level of a target protein in plant expression systems is still rather low compared with the other existing systems, namely, mammalian, yeast, and E. coli cells. To solve this problem, numerous methods and approaches have been designed and developed. At the same time, the random nature of the distribution of transgenes over the genome can lead to gene silencing, variability in the accumulation of recombinant protein, and also to various insertional mutations. The current research study considered inserting target genes into pre-selected regions of the plant genome (genomic \u201csafe harbors\u201d) using the CRISPR/Cas system. Regions of genes expressed constitutively and at a high transcriptional level in plant cells (housekeeping genes) that are of interest as attractive targets for the delivery of target genes were characterized. The results of the first attempts to deliver target genes to the regions of housekeeping genes are discussed. The approach of \u201ceuchromatization\u201d of the transgene integration region using the modified dCas9 associated with transcription factors is considered. A number of the specific features in the spatial chromatin organization allowing individual genes to efficiently transcribe are discussed.",

M. Rozov, N. Permyakova, Y. Sidorchuk, E. Deineko\n## Abstract\nPlant expression systems are currently regarded as promising alternative platforms for the production of recombinant proteins, including the proteins for biopharmaceutical purposes. However, the accumulation level of a target protein in plant expression systems is still rather low compared with the other existing systems, namely, mammalian, yeast, and E. coli cells. To solve this problem, numerous methods and approaches have been designed and developed. At the same time, the random nature of the distribution of transgenes over the genome can lead to gene silencing, variability in the accumulation of recombinant protein, and also to various insertional mutations. The current research study considered inserting target genes into pre-selected regions of the plant genome (genomic \u201csafe harbors\u201d) using the CRISPR/Cas system. Regions of genes expressed constitutively and at a high transcriptional level in plant cells (housekeeping genes) that are of interest as attractive targets for the delivery of target genes were characterized. The results of the first attempts to deliver target genes to the regions of housekeeping genes are discussed. The approach of \u201ceuchromatization\u201d of the transgene integration region using the modified dCas9 associated with transcription factors is considered. A number of the specific features in the spatial chromatin organization allowing individual genes to efficiently transcribe are discussed.\n## Introduction\nThis particular fact underlies the observed variation in the expression level of transgenes among the individually constructed transgenic plants [5]. The existing technologies for the production of recombinant proteins in plant expression systems comprise the routine stage of selection of the most favorable transformation events associated with a high yield of the recombinant protein [6]. \n\nThe development of molecular biological and genetic engineering methods and their enhancement as well as the rapid development of the genome editing techniques utilizing CRISPR/Cas allows researchers to set forth the targeted gene delivery to almost any selected constitutively transcribed genomic regions. This will further make it possible to dispense with the laborious screening of a large number of transgenic lines to purposefully construct highly efficient producers of recombinant proteins carrying the target genes delivered to transcriptionally active regions.

Moreover, while high-throughput cloning strategies and the reduced cost of de novo DNA synthesis now allow swapping entire heterologous pathways or protein complexes into yeast, such efforts frequently require the deletion of corresponding yeast loci, such as in the case of efforts to systematically humanize yeast genes, 11,12 which may entail replacing genes at their corresponding genomic loci to retain native regulation. Beyond these aspects, the expression of each new gene often reveals incompatibilities associated with the engineered pathway. Thus, there is a need for rapid, multi-site, progressive genome editing strategies to address these issues.\n\nThe efficiency and speed of CRISPR-Cas9-based genome engineering allow straightforward editing of multiple yeast loci in a single strain, eliminating the need for markers. [13][14][15][16][17] However, the approach gets progressively more challenging for multi-gene systems when the fitness of the intermediate genotypes is unknown. Therefore, rationally building heterologous genetic modules in a yeast surrogate requires a highly scalable and combinatorial genome editing technology.\n\nSynthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis permits the combination of loci in a fitness-driven manner, requiring markers linked to the modified loci and haploid-specific selections. 18 Using an SGA-like strategy to build a heterologous multigene system would need several unique markers linked to each gene. However, the lack of adequate selection markers limits its application. The Green Monster (GM) method bypasses the marker dependency by using green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression as a readout to combine engineered loci. 19 However, implementing the GM strategy can be challenging for heterologous pathway engineering, with an added burden of expressing fluorescent cassettes. 20 Thus, accomplishing large-scale combinatorial genome editing in yeast necessitates genetic tools that circumvent these requirements.\n\nThis work describes a CRISPR-Cas9-based method to readily combine genetically engineered loci without requiring markers",

Decades of fundamental research, together with the development of high-throughput toolkits and genome engineering capacities, have established yeast as an ideal model eukaryote for system genetics and synthetic biology. 1 In addition, the availability of many selectable genetic markers and simple conversion between haploid and diploid forms has provided avenues to easily combine pairs of genetically engineered loci to understand gene-gene interactions at a global scale. 2 For more extensive genetic alterations, yeast's highly efficient homologous recombination (HR) pathway even enables the synthesis of entire chromosomes, although this approach requires iterative use of selection markers and tedious repetitive procedures. 3 Nonetheless, the ability to alter large contiguous segments of genomic loci has many applications, such as genome minimization, 4 multiplex genome editing, 5 and the total synthesis of the Mycoplasma and E. coli and yeast genomes using yeast HR. [6][7][8][9] Despite the progress in whole-genome engineering, editing intermediate numbers of independent genomic loci-greater than two and in discontiguous regions of the genome-still presents a significant challenge.

Greco, J. M. Laurent, Riddhiman K. Garge, D. Boutz, Michelle Vandeloo, E. Marcotte, Aashiq H. Kachroo\n## Abstract\nNone\n## INTRODUCTION\nBaker's yeast has long served as a convenient chassis for bioengineering owing to its genetic tractability, versatile metabolism, and ease of culture in the lab. Decades of fundamental research, together with the development of high-throughput toolkits and genome engineering capacities, have established yeast as an ideal model eukaryote for system genetics and synthetic biology. 1 In addition, the availability of many selectable genetic markers and simple conversion between haploid and diploid forms has provided avenues to easily combine pairs of genetically engineered loci to understand gene-gene interactions at a global scale. 2 For more extensive genetic alterations, yeast's highly efficient homologous recombination (HR) pathway even enables the synthesis of entire chromosomes, although this approach requires iterative use of selection markers and tedious repetitive procedures. 3 Nonetheless, the ability to alter large contiguous segments of genomic loci has many applications, such as genome minimization, 4 multiplex genome editing, 5 and the total synthesis of the Mycoplasma and E. coli and yeast genomes using yeast HR. [6][7][8][9] Despite the progress in whole-genome engineering, editing intermediate numbers of independent genomic loci-greater than two and in discontiguous regions of the genome-still presents a significant challenge. While strategies exist for E. coli 10 (e.g., multiplex automated genome engineering), diploid MOTIVATION Engineering entire biological processes in yeast, controlled for expression and genomic context, is challenging due to inefficient homology-directed repair (HDR) using linear exogenous repair templates, often resulting in non-quantifiable readouts. Thus, an inability to obtain the edit can be attributed to inefficient HDR or inviable genotype. Therefore, accomplishing multiplexed and scalable genomic editing necessitates compatible technology. We developed a CRISPR-Cas9-based combinatorial genome editing method (MERGE) that facilitates a fitness-driven combination of all individual genetic edits, eliminating the need for selection markers while using a quantitative readout of colony-forming units. organisms such as yeast present the additional editing challenge of multiple alleles for each (independently assorting) genomic locus.

Moreover, while high-throughput cloning strategies and the reduced cost of de novo DNA synthesis now allow swapping entire heterologous pathways or protein complexes into yeast, such efforts frequently require the deletion of corresponding yeast loci, such as in the case of efforts to systematically humanize yeast genes, 11,12 which may entail replacing genes at their corresponding genomic loci to retain native regulation. Beyond these aspects, the expression of each new gene often reveals incompatibilities associated with the engineered pathway. Thus, there is a need for rapid, multi-site, progressive genome editing strategies to address these issues.\n\nThe efficiency and speed of CRISPR-Cas9-based genome engineering allow straightforward editing of multiple yeast loci in a single strain, eliminating the need for markers. [13][14][15][16][17] However, the approach gets progressively more challenging for multi-gene systems when the fitness of the intermediate genotypes is unknown. Therefore, rationally building heterologous genetic modules in a yeast surrogate requires a highly scalable and combinatorial genome editing technology.\n\nSynthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis permits the combination of loci in a fitness-driven manner, requiring markers linked to the modified loci and haploid-specific selections. 18 Using an SGA-like strategy to build a heterologous multigene system would need several unique markers linked to each gene. However, the lack of adequate selection markers limits its application. The Green Monster (GM) method bypasses the marker dependency by using green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression as a readout to combine engineered loci. 19 However, implementing the GM strategy can be challenging for heterologous pathway engineering, with an added burden of expressing fluorescent cassettes. 20 Thus, accomplishing large-scale combinatorial genome editing in yeast necessitates genetic tools that circumvent these requirements.\n\nThis work describes a CRISPR-Cas9-based method to readily combine genetically engineered loci without requiring markers\n...\npathway engineering, with an added burden of expressing fluorescent cassettes. 20 Thus, accomplishing large-scale combinatorial genome editing in yeast necessitates genetic tools that circumvent these requirements.\n\nThis work describes a CRISPR-Cas9-based method to readily combine genetically engineered loci without requiring markers and exogenous repair templates. The approach involves generating CRISPR-Cas9-mediated double-strand breaks (DSBs) and highly efficient homology-directed repair (HDR) along with yeast mating and sporulation to randomly assort edited sites performing multi-site and marker-less combinations of engineered loci. This selective and successive elimination of specific yeast loci mimics a gene drive 21-24 and facilitates marker-less enrichment and recombination of genetically engineered yeast loci (MERGE).\n\nWe show that CRISPR-mediated selection operates similarly to classical selection markers, enabling MERGE to efficiently explore many combinations of genetically engineered loci, revealing a fitness-driven path to engineering any heterologous system in yeast. We further demonstrate that MERGE enables rapid assembly of an entire carotenoid biosynthesis pathway by performing a multi-site and marker-less combination of distinct engineered loci. Finally, using a multiplexed version of MERGE, we humanize a near-complete a-proteasome core (6 of 7 subunits) in yeast while revealing a fitness-driven path to the humanization of complex processes.",

Yet, yeast researchers are faced with the challenge to further its transition from the old workhorse to a modern cell factory, fulfilling the requirements for next generation bioprocesses. Many of the principles and tools that are applied for this development originate from the field of synthetic biology and the engineered strains will indeed be synthetic organisms. We provide an overview of the most important aspects of this transition and highlight achievements in recent years as well as trends in which yeast currently lags behind. These aspects include: the enhancement of the substrate spectrum of yeast, with the focus on the efficient utilization of renewable feedstocks, the enhancement of the product spectrum through generation of independent circuits for the maintenance of redox balances and biosynthesis of common carbon building blocks, the requirement for accurate pathway control with improved genome editing and through orthogonal promoters, and improvement of the tolerance of yeast for specific stress conditions. The causative genetic elements for the required traits of the future yeast cell factories will be assembled into genetic modules for fast transfer between strains. These developments will benefit from progress in bio-computational methods, which allow for the integration of different kinds of data sets and algorithms, and from rapid advancement in genome editing, which will enable multiplexed targeted integration of whole heterologous pathways. The overall goal will be to provide a collection of modules and circuits that work independently and can be combined at will, depending on the individual conditions, and will result in an optimal synthetic host for a given production process.",

The use of Cre recombinase or other recombination based approaches, like the 50:50 method [7], allow for marker recycling and performing delitti perfetti, leaving no foreign DNA in the yeast genome. Although such techniques are currently an important tool for synthetic biology, they are relatively time consuming and therefore not suitable for the introduction of whole heterologous metabolic pathways or deletions of several genes in a reasonably short time. In the last few years, new approaches like Zinc finger nucleases [8], Yeast Oligo-Mediated Genome Engineering (YOGE) [9], transcription activator like (TAL) effector nucleases [10] and the CRISPR-Cas system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) [11,12] have been developed for deleting or inserting genes and for controlling gene expression. The main advantages of these tools over traditional techniques lie in their efficiency, accuracy and speed. They all rely on site-specific endonucleases forming a double strand break that is repaired either with non-homologous end joining or homology-directed repair. The versatility of the methods stems from the ability to customize the DNA binding domains, allowing for site-specific genome editing. From the techniques mentioned, the use of CRISPR, together with the site specific Cas9 endonuclease, appears as the most promising tool for editing a genome at any number of different loci in a short time. Remarkably, DiCarlo et al. reported a close to 100% recombination efficiency of a linear dsDNA after transformation, together with a plasmid bearing the guiding RNA [11]. Similar approaches were already used for multiplex deletions of up to five genes [13,14]. Hence, the CRISPR/Cas9 tool makes the use of marker-flanked integration cassettes obsolete and paves the way for rapid and efficient genome editing.",

Petrovi\u010d\n## Abstract\nThe yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the oldest and most frequently used microorganisms in biotechnology with successful applications in the production of both bulk and fine chemicals. Yet, yeast researchers are faced with the challenge to further its transition from the old workhorse to a modern cell factory, fulfilling the requirements for next generation bioprocesses. Many of the principles and tools that are applied for this development originate from the field of synthetic biology and the engineered strains will indeed be synthetic organisms. We provide an overview of the most important aspects of this transition and highlight achievements in recent years as well as trends in which yeast currently lags behind. These aspects include: the enhancement of the substrate spectrum of yeast, with the focus on the efficient utilization of renewable feedstocks, the enhancement of the product spectrum through generation of independent circuits for the maintenance of redox balances and biosynthesis of common carbon building blocks, the requirement for accurate pathway control with improved genome editing and through orthogonal promoters, and improvement of the tolerance of yeast for specific stress conditions. The causative genetic elements for the required traits of the future yeast cell factories will be assembled into genetic modules for fast transfer between strains. These developments will benefit from progress in bio-computational methods, which allow for the integration of different kinds of data sets and algorithms, and from rapid advancement in genome editing, which will enable multiplexed targeted integration of whole heterologous pathways. The overall goal will be to provide a collection of modules and circuits that work independently and can be combined at will, depending on the individual conditions, and will result in an optimal synthetic host for a given production process.\n## Development of genome editing tools\nTraditional DNA editing techniques, such as transformation and deletion of genes by homologous recombination, have been readily feasible for many years in S. cerevisiae. The use of Cre recombinase or other recombination based approaches, like the 50:50 method [7], allow for marker recycling and performing delitti perfetti, leaving no foreign DNA in the yeast genome. Although such techniques are currently an important tool for synthetic biology, they are relatively time consuming and therefore not suitable for the introduction of whole heterologous metabolic pathways or deletions of several genes in a reasonably short time. In the last few years, new approaches like Zinc finger nucleases [8], Yeast Oligo-Mediated Genome Engineering (YOGE) [9], transcription activator like (TAL) effector nucleases [10] and the CRISPR-Cas system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) [11,12] have been developed for deleting or inserting genes and for controlling gene expression. The main advantages of these tools over traditional techniques lie in their efficiency, accuracy and speed. They all rely on site-specific endonucleases forming a double strand break that is repaired either with non-homologous end joining or homology-directed repair. The versatility of the methods stems from the ability to customize the DNA binding domains, allowing for site-specific genome editing. From the techniques mentioned, the use of CRISPR, together with the site specific Cas9 endonuclease, appears as the most promising tool for editing a genome at any number of different loci in a short time. Remarkably, DiCarlo et al. reported a close to 100% recombination efficiency of a linear dsDNA after transformation, together with a plasmid bearing the guiding RNA [11]. Similar approaches were already used for multiplex deletions of up to five genes [13,14]. Hence, the CRISPR/Cas9 tool makes the use of marker-flanked integration cassettes obsolete and paves the way for rapid and efficient genome editing.",

CRISPR/Cas9-based technologies are revolutionising the way we engineer microbial cells. One of the key advantages of CRISPR in strain design is that it enables chromosomal integration of marker-free DNA, eliminating laborious and often inefficient marker recovery procedures. Despite the benefits, assembling CRISPR/Cas9 editing systems is still not a straightforward process, which may prevent its use and applications. In this work, we have identified some of the main limitations of current Cas9 toolkits and designed improvements with the goal of making CRISPR technologies easier to access and implement. These include 1) A system to quickly switch between marker-free and marker-based integration constructs using both a Cre-expressing and standard Escherichia coli strains, 2) the ability to redirect multigene integration cassettes into alternative genomic loci via Golden Gate-based exchange of homology arms, 3) a rapid, simple in-vivo method to assembly guide RNA sequences via recombineering between Cas9-helper plasmids and single oligonucleotides. We combine these methodologies with well-established technologies into a comprehensive toolkit for efficient metabolic engineering using CRISPR/Cas9. As a proof of concept, we developed the YaliCraft toolkit for Yarrowia lipolytica , which is composed of a basic set of 147 plasmids and 7 modules with different purposes. We used the toolkit to generate and characterize a library of 137 promoters and to build a de novo strain synthetizing 373.8\u2009mg/L homogentisic acid.",

In particular, the metabolic engineering of yeasts is one of the fastest growing areas in engineering biology, enabling the sustainable production of chemicals, fuels, materials, foods and pharmaceuticals 1 . While having the large metabolic potential of eukaryotic cells, due to their single cell nature and rapid growth, yeasts are easier to engineer and cultivate at scale. \n\nBecause of that, CRISPR systems have been developed for yeasts [2][3][4] . One of the most important advantages of CRISPR is that, due to its high efficiency, it allows markerless genomic modifications. During traditional strain engineering, the elimination of selectable markers from the genome, known as marker recovery, is a common bottleneck 5 . Even fast-growing yeast cultures require at least five days for marker recovery 6 , while integrative transformation itself takes only two or three. Therefore, in the past years several marker-free integration techniques facilitated by CRISPR have been developed [6][7][8][9] . In spite of these developments, many current metabolic engineering projects still rely on marker-based approaches, which may limit or delay success in strain optimization. In this work, we have identified 3 improvements of CRISPR/Cas9 systems which may facilitate the use of Cas9-based yeast engineering, (1) the easy swap between marker and markerless modifications (2) the quick exchange of homology arms to target different integration locations and (3) an easy method to clone gRNAs. \n\nConvenient return to marker-based integration. During CRISPR-based marker-free integration, the only selective factor is the double strand break (DSB) induced by Cas9. To proliferate, cells need to repair this lesion. This may happen either by using a template (donor) that is integrated via homologous recombination (HR) or by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), i.e. without integration. NHEJ activity is observed in most fungal species including baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 5,10 .",

Yuzbasheva, O. Melkina, Davina Patel, Dmitrii M Bubnov, Heiko Dietz, R. Ledesma\u2010Amaro\n## Abstract\nUsing CRISPR/Cas9 technology and Golden Gate Assembly, a toolkit including 147 plasmids and 137 promoters enables chromosomal integration of markerless DNA and easy assembly of new gRNAs, effectively proven in a novel Y. lipolytica production strain. CRISPR/Cas9-based technologies are revolutionising the way we engineer microbial cells. One of the key advantages of CRISPR in strain design is that it enables chromosomal integration of marker-free DNA, eliminating laborious and often inefficient marker recovery procedures. Despite the benefits, assembling CRISPR/Cas9 editing systems is still not a straightforward process, which may prevent its use and applications. In this work, we have identified some of the main limitations of current Cas9 toolkits and designed improvements with the goal of making CRISPR technologies easier to access and implement. These include 1) A system to quickly switch between marker-free and marker-based integration constructs using both a Cre-expressing and standard Escherichia coli strains, 2) the ability to redirect multigene integration cassettes into alternative genomic loci via Golden Gate-based exchange of homology arms, 3) a rapid, simple in-vivo method to assembly guide RNA sequences via recombineering between Cas9-helper plasmids and single oligonucleotides. We combine these methodologies with well-established technologies into a comprehensive toolkit for efficient metabolic engineering using CRISPR/Cas9. As a proof of concept, we developed the YaliCraft toolkit for Yarrowia lipolytica , which is composed of a basic set of 147 plasmids and 7 modules with different purposes. We used the toolkit to generate and characterize a library of 137 promoters and to build a de novo strain synthetizing 373.8\u2009mg/L homogentisic acid.\n## body\nT he development of CRISPR/Cas9-based technologies has enabled quick, precise and scarless genomic modifications, which shows a great potential for microbial strain design and bioproduction. In particular, the metabolic engineering of yeasts is one of the fastest growing areas in engineering biology, enabling the sustainable production of chemicals, fuels, materials, foods and pharmaceuticals 1 . While having the large metabolic potential of eukaryotic cells, due to their single cell nature and rapid growth, yeasts are easier to engineer and cultivate at scale. \n\nBecause of that, CRISPR systems have been developed for yeasts [2][3][4] . One of the most important advantages of CRISPR is that, due to its high efficiency, it allows markerless genomic modifications. During traditional strain engineering, the elimination of selectable markers from the genome, known as marker recovery, is a common bottleneck 5 . Even fast-growing yeast cultures require at least five days for marker recovery 6 , while integrative transformation itself takes only two or three. Therefore, in the past years several marker-free integration techniques facilitated by CRISPR have been developed [6][7][8][9] . In spite of these developments, many current metabolic engineering projects still rely on marker-based approaches, which may limit or delay success in strain optimization. In this work, we have identified 3 improvements of CRISPR/Cas9 systems which may facilitate the use of Cas9-based yeast engineering, (1) the easy swap between marker and markerless modifications (2) the quick exchange of homology arms to target different integration locations and (3) an easy method to clone gRNAs. \n\nConvenient return to marker-based integration. During CRISPR-based marker-free integration, the only selective factor is the double strand break (DSB) induced by Cas9. To proliferate, cells need to repair this lesion. This may happen either by using a template (donor) that is integrated via homologous recombination (HR) or by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), i.e. without integration. NHEJ activity is observed in most fungal species including baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 5,10 .",

In this study, we systematically investigated the expression of recombinant SpCas9-His in four distinct Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains (Rosetta2, BL21(DE3), BL21(DE3)-pLysS, and BL21(DE3)-Star). Through optimization of culture conditions, including temperature and post-induction time, the BL21(DE3)-pLysS strain demonstrated efficient SpCas9 protein expression. This study also presents a detailed protocol for the purification of recombinant SpCas9, along with detailed troubleshooting tips. Results indicate successful SpCas9 protein expression using E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS at 0.5 mM IPTG concentration. Furthermore, the findings suggest potential avenues for further enhancements, paving the way for large-scale Cas9 production. This research contributes valuable insights into optimizing E. coli strains and culture conditions for enhanced Cas9 expression, offering a step forward in the development of efficient genome editing tools and therapeutic proteins.\n",

                    "text": "The design and construction of microbial cell factories is more than ever an attractive approach to develop bioengineering processes to produce chemicals, fuels, or pharmaceutics. Furthermore, S. cerevisiae is an appealing model for bioengineering processes because allied with its rapid production cycles, it is easy to maintain, to manipulate, and is suitable for large-scale fermentation. The molecular \"tools\" available have helped the researchers to make yeast cell factories increasingly adapted to produce a desired product [46]. The development of efficient cell factories is associated with several genetic modifications, since not only the insertion of the heterologous genes is required but also the rewiring of the carbon flux toward the precursor synthesis or even other convenient modifications to improve the process. The CRISPR-Cas9 system appeared as a \"Swiss army knife\" [16] in the researcher's molecular toolbox because it allowed the performance of several genetic modifications in a fast and efficient way. Furthermore, the requirement of a constant selective pressure during fermentation is negated since CRISPR-Cas9 allows a markerless genetic manipulation. In addition, several design-build-test cycles are always necessary, which increases the number of modifications required [6,7]. By using CRISPR-Cas9 systems, genetic editing has become multiplex possible, which may significantly decrease the time to perform the designed genetic modifications for a cell factory construction. The flexibility of CRISPR-Cas9 allied with the researcher's inventiveness resulted in the development of systems that facilitate and accelerate metabolic engineering processes. Researchers are not only focused on developing new CRISPR-based strategies for direct genome engineering but also on applying CRISPR-Cas9 to improve other conventional molecular biology lab practices, speeding up the strain building process. For example, Li et al. [47] developed a CRISPR system capable of sequential rounds of gene targeting with simultaneous gRNA plasmid curing mediated by CRISPR-Cas9. Moreover, in Zhang et al.'s work [44], the developed CRISPR method skips the Escherichia coli transformation and verification steps. The flexibility and simplicity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system made it well accepted by genetic engineers for the development of yeast cell factories (Table 1).",

Rodrigues\n## Abstract\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae has been for a long time a common model for fundamental biological studies and a popular biotechnological engineering platform to produce chemicals, fuels, and pharmaceuticals due to its peculiar characteristics. Both lines of research require an effective editing of the native genetic elements or the inclusion of heterologous pathways into the yeast genome. Although S. cerevisiae is a well-known host with several molecular biology tools available, a more precise tool is still needed. The clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats\u2013associated Cas9 (CRISPR-Cas9) system is a current, widespread genome editing tool. The implementation of a reprogrammable, precise, and specific method, such as CRISPR-Cas9, to edit the S. cerevisiae genome has revolutionized laboratory practices. Herein, we describe and discuss some applications of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in S. cerevisiae from simple gene knockouts to more complex processes such as artificial heterologous pathway integration, transcriptional regulation, or tolerance engineering.\n## Cell Factory Development\nThe design and construction of microbial cell factories is more than ever an attractive approach to develop bioengineering processes to produce chemicals, fuels, or pharmaceutics. Furthermore, S. cerevisiae is an appealing model for bioengineering processes because allied with its rapid production cycles, it is easy to maintain, to manipulate, and is suitable for large-scale fermentation. The molecular \"tools\" available have helped the researchers to make yeast cell factories increasingly adapted to produce a desired product [46]. The development of efficient cell factories is associated with several genetic modifications, since not only the insertion of the heterologous genes is required but also the rewiring of the carbon flux toward the precursor synthesis or even other convenient modifications to improve the process. The CRISPR-Cas9 system appeared as a \"Swiss army knife\" [16] in the researcher's molecular toolbox because it allowed the performance of several genetic modifications in a fast and efficient way. Furthermore, the requirement of a constant selective pressure during fermentation is negated since CRISPR-Cas9 allows a markerless genetic manipulation. In addition, several design-build-test cycles are always necessary, which increases the number of modifications required [6,7]. By using CRISPR-Cas9 systems, genetic editing has become multiplex possible, which may significantly decrease the time to perform the designed genetic modifications for a cell factory construction. The flexibility of CRISPR-Cas9 allied with the researcher's inventiveness resulted in the development of systems that facilitate and accelerate metabolic engineering processes. Researchers are not only focused on developing new CRISPR-based strategies for direct genome engineering but also on applying CRISPR-Cas9 to improve other conventional molecular biology lab practices, speeding up the strain building process.

            "abstract": "Numerous important pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals originate from plant specialized metabolites, most of which are synthesized via complex biosynthetic pathways. The elucidation of these pathways is critical for the applicable uses of these compounds. Although the rapid progress of the omics technology has revolutionized the identification of candidate genes involved in these pathways, the functional characterization of these genes remains a major bottleneck. Baker\u2019s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has been used as a microbial platform for characterizing newly discovered metabolic genes in plant specialized metabolism. Using yeast for the investigation of numerous plant enzymes is a streamlined process because of yeast\u2019s efficient transformation, limited endogenous specialized metabolism, partially sharing its primary metabolism with plants, and its capability of post-translational modification. Despite these advantages, reconstructing complex plant biosynthetic pathways in yeast can be time intensive. Since its discovery, CRISPR/Cas9 has greatly stimulated metabolic engineering in yeast. Yeast is a popular system for genome editing due to its efficient homology-directed repair mechanism, which allows precise integration of heterologous genes into its genome. One practical use of CRISPR/Cas9 in yeast is multiplex genome editing aimed at reconstructing complex metabolic pathways. This system has the capability of integrating multiple genes of interest in a single transformation, simplifying the reconstruction of complex pathways. As plant specialized metabolites usually have complex multigene biosynthetic pathways, the multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 system in yeast is suited well for functional genomics research in plant specialized metabolism. Here, we review the most advanced methods to achieve efficient multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 editing in yeast. We will also discuss how this powerful tool has been applied to benefit the study of plant specialized metabolism.",

                    "text": "Finally, yeast can also carry out some posttranslational modifications. \n\nDespite all these advantages, reconstructing complex specialized pathways in yeast is still hindered by two major factors. First, there are a limited number of selection markers for yeast transformation. Selection markers can be recycled, but this is time consuming. Secondly, due to plasmid instability and imbalance, it is often difficult to achieve consistent levels of recombinant proteins in individual cells, which can lead to different degrees of toxicity and metabolic burden in each yeast cell (Da Silva and Srikrishnan, 2012). Thus, the integration of heterologous genes into the yeast genome is preferred for stable expression. Gene integration techniques in yeast, such as in vivo homologous recombination and pre-CRISPR endonucleases-based systems (e.g., I-SceI, HO endonuclease, ZFNs, and TALENs), have been extensively developed. These techniques have been reviewed in several excellent articles (Da Silva and Srikrishnan, 2012;David and Siewers, 2015;Yang and Blenner, 2020). However, these integration techniques are relatively laborious as they require selection markers, and there is limited availability of efficient integration sites. \n\nIn the past decade, the emergence of endonuclease-based techniques, especially clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and its associated protein 9 (Cas9), has revolutionized the field of genome editing. This elegant and simple technique has been applied in various organisms, such as human cells, zebrafish, plants, and S. cerevisiae (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014). The simplicity, efficiency, and flexibility of CRISPR/Cas9 have allowed for the expansion of its application to include multiple simultaneous genomeediting events, termed \"multiplexing\" (Mali et al., 2013).",

C. Utomo, Connor L Hodgins, D. Ro\n## Abstract\nNumerous important pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals originate from plant specialized metabolites, most of which are synthesized via complex biosynthetic pathways. The elucidation of these pathways is critical for the applicable uses of these compounds. Although the rapid progress of the omics technology has revolutionized the identification of candidate genes involved in these pathways, the functional characterization of these genes remains a major bottleneck. Baker\u2019s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has been used as a microbial platform for characterizing newly discovered metabolic genes in plant specialized metabolism. Using yeast for the investigation of numerous plant enzymes is a streamlined process because of yeast\u2019s efficient transformation, limited endogenous specialized metabolism, partially sharing its primary metabolism with plants, and its capability of post-translational modification. Despite these advantages, reconstructing complex plant biosynthetic pathways in yeast can be time intensive. Since its discovery, CRISPR/Cas9 has greatly stimulated metabolic engineering in yeast. Yeast is a popular system for genome editing due to its efficient homology-directed repair mechanism, which allows precise integration of heterologous genes into its genome. One practical use of CRISPR/Cas9 in yeast is multiplex genome editing aimed at reconstructing complex metabolic pathways. This system has the capability of integrating multiple genes of interest in a single transformation, simplifying the reconstruction of complex pathways. As plant specialized metabolites usually have complex multigene biosynthetic pathways, the multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 system in yeast is suited well for functional genomics research in plant specialized metabolism. Here, we review the most advanced methods to achieve efficient multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 editing in yeast. We will also discuss how this powerful tool has been applied to benefit the study of plant specialized metabolism.\n## INTRODUCTION\nFinally, yeast can also carry out some posttranslational modifications. \n\nDespite all these advantages, reconstructing complex specialized pathways in yeast is still hindered by two major factors. First, there are a limited number of selection markers for yeast transformation. Selection markers can be recycled, but this is time consuming. Secondly, due to plasmid instability and imbalance, it is often difficult to achieve consistent levels of recombinant proteins in individual cells, which can lead to different degrees of toxicity and metabolic burden in each yeast cell (Da Silva and Srikrishnan, 2012). Thus, the integration of heterologous genes into the yeast genome is preferred for stable expression. Gene integration techniques in yeast, such as in vivo homologous recombination and pre-CRISPR endonucleases-based systems (e.g., I-SceI, HO endonuclease, ZFNs, and TALENs), have been extensively developed. These techniques have been reviewed in several excellent articles (Da Silva and Srikrishnan, 2012;David and Siewers, 2015;Yang and Blenner, 2020). However, these integration techniques are relatively laborious as they require selection markers, and there is limited availability of efficient integration sites. \n\nIn the past decade, the emergence of endonuclease-based techniques, especially clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and its associated protein 9 (Cas9), has revolutionized the field of genome editing. This elegant and simple technique has been applied in various organisms, such as human cells, zebrafish, plants, and S. cerevisiae (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014). The simplicity, efficiency, and flexibility of CRISPR/Cas9 have allowed for the expansion of its application to include multiple simultaneous genomeediting events, termed \"multiplexing\" (Mali et al., 2013).",

Biyani\n## Abstract\nBiogenetic engineering is a significant technology to sensibly manage microbial metabolic product factories. Genome modification methods for efficiently controlling and modifying genes at the genome level have progressed in biogenetic engineering during the last decade. CRISPR is genome editing technology that allows for the modification of organisms\u2019 genomes. CRISPR and its related RNA-guided endonuclease are versatile advanced immune system frameworks for defending against foreign DNA and RNAs. CRISPR is efficient, accessible, and trustworthy genomic modification tool in unparalleled resolution. At present, CRISPR-Cas9 method is expanded to industrially manipulate cells. Metabolically modified organisms are quickly becoming interested in the production of different bio-based components. Here, chapter explore about the control productivity of targeted biomolecules in divergent cells based on the use of different CRISPR-related Cas9.\n## Modern achievements in CRISPR-Cas9 mediated system\nCRISPR/Cas9 technology has enabled a qualitative change in the range of gene functions for transcriptional control, gene targeting, epigenetic correction, gene therapy, and drug delivery of host genomes [51]. CRISPR/Cas technology possesses multiloci genome editing without the integration of a gene marker on the selection genome and saves time and exertion in metabolic engineering. Although several genetic modifications are available; the CRISPR/Cas9 technology significantly enhanced the efficiency of genetic engineering and is adopted as an extraordinary \"gift.\" The CRISPR/Cas9 technology improved industrial micro-organisms' performance in strengthening of microbial factories that are valuable in processing of new value-added molecules from the low-cost feedstock. \n\nThere are abundant examples of bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi which are reviewed in several studies of solicitations of the CRISPR/Cas9 system [51][52][53][54][55][56][57]. For example, E. coli, S. cerevisiae, Bacillus sp., Clostridium sp., Corynebacterium sp., Lactobacillus sp., Mycobacterium sp., Pseudomonas sp., Streptomyces sp. etc. [52,[58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69] are employed in the CRISPR/Cas system to improve yield of various metabolic products in field of industrial biotechnology. As a proof of concept, Zheng et al. employed Type I-F system to engineer Zymomonas mobilis as a synthetic chassis for sustainable economic biofuel and biochemical productions [70]. \n\nA study was designed to distinguish the orthogonal CRISPR method using E. coli for chromosomal addition of the Spd-Cas9based CRISPR module. Here found that out of SaCas9, St1Cas9, and FnCas12a, the St1Cas9 and SaCas9 are highly efficient to cause double stranded DNA break without associating with the sgRNA.",

However, the engineering of metabolic systems requires dynamic redistribution of cellular resources, the creation of novel metabolic pathways, and optimal regulation of the pathways to achieve higher production titers. Thus, the design principles and tools developed in synthetic biology have been employed to create novel and flexible metabolic pathways and to optimize metabolic fluxes to increase the cells\u2019 capability to act as production factories.

                    "text": "Recently, there has been growing evidence that the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing approach enables efficient, intricately controlled gene expression and versatile cross-species genome editing in various micro-organisms [5,113,114]. Briefly, the action mechanism of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is that the complex of small crRNAs produced by the coordinated action of a small, trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), the Cas9 nuclease, and the host RNaseIII directs Cas9 to cleave the target DNA, which is followed by an adjacent protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). The target DNA is recognized by its alignment with the 12-15 nucleotides at the 3 end of the crRNA guide sequence as well as the NGG sequence of PAM. Unlike the effort to manipulate other transcription factors, the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be simply applied to genome editing and metabolic pathway engineering by only altering the target sequence without any protein engineering. For example, Jiang et al. reported the introduction of point mutations and codon changes in the E. coli genome using the CRISPR/Cas9 method [5]. For instance, the \u03b2-carotene biosynthetic pathway, the methylerythritol-phosphate pathway, and the central metabolic pathways in E. coli were systematically optimized for \u03b2-carotene production by iterative editing of the 2-day editing cycle, and the best production was 2.0 g/L \u03b2-carotene (fed-batch fermentation) [92]. \n\nWith respect to the regulation of gene expression, CRISPRi-based interference (CRISPRi) has also been applied to metabolic engineering using a nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) that contains two point mutations, one each in the RuvC (D10A) and HNH (H840A) domains [4,113]. Due to the gRNA binding ability of dCas9, it has been used as a programmable transcription repressor by circumventing the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter sequence or as a transcription terminator by binding to the target gene.",

Na\n## Abstract\nSynthetic biology has undergone dramatic advancements for over a decade, during which it has expanded our understanding on the systems of life and opened new avenues for microbial engineering. Many biotechnological and computational methods have been developed for the construction of synthetic systems. Achievements in synthetic biology have been widely adopted in metabolic engineering, a field aimed at engineering micro-organisms to produce substances of interest. However, the engineering of metabolic systems requires dynamic redistribution of cellular resources, the creation of novel metabolic pathways, and optimal regulation of the pathways to achieve higher production titers. Thus, the design principles and tools developed in synthetic biology have been employed to create novel and flexible metabolic pathways and to optimize metabolic fluxes to increase the cells\u2019 capability to act as production factories. In this review, we introduce synthetic biology tools and their applications to microbial cell factory constructions.\n## CRISPR-Based Regulation\nRecently, there has been growing evidence that the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing approach enables efficient, intricately controlled gene expression and versatile cross-species genome editing in various micro-organisms [5,113,114]. Briefly, the action mechanism of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is that the complex of small crRNAs produced by the coordinated action of a small, trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), the Cas9 nuclease, and the host RNaseIII directs Cas9 to cleave the target DNA, which is followed by an adjacent protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). The target DNA is recognized by its alignment with the 12-15 nucleotides at the 3 end of the crRNA guide sequence as well as the NGG sequence of PAM. Unlike the effort to manipulate other transcription factors, the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be simply applied to genome editing and metabolic pathway engineering by only altering the target sequence without any protein engineering. For example, Jiang et al. reported the introduction of point mutations and codon changes in the E. coli genome using the CRISPR/Cas9 method [5]. For instance, the \u03b2-carotene biosynthetic pathway, the methylerythritol-phosphate pathway, and the central metabolic pathways in E. coli were systematically optimized for \u03b2-carotene production by iterative editing of the 2-day editing cycle, and the best production was 2.0 g/L \u03b2-carotene (fed-batch fermentation) [92]. \n\nWith respect to the regulation of gene expression, CRISPRi-based interference (CRISPRi) has also been applied to metabolic engineering using a nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) that contains two point mutations, one each in the RuvC (D10A) and HNH (H840A) domains [4,113]. Due to the gRNA binding ability of dCas9, it has been used as a programmable transcription repressor by circumventing the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter sequence or as a transcription terminator by binding to the target gene.",

This study reports the CRISPR-Cas9-based highly efficient strategy for targeted chromosomal integration and in-frame expression of a foreign gene in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) by homology-dependent recombination (HDR); our optimized methods show that CRISPR-Cas9-based chromosomal targeted integration of small constructs at multiple target sites of the yeast genome can be achieved with an efficiency of 74%. Our study also suggests that 15 bp microhomology flanked arms are sufficient for 50% targeted knock-in at minimal knock-in construct concentration. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that there is no off-target effect. This study provides a comprehensive and streamlined protocol that will support the targeted integration of essential genes into the yeast genome for synthetic biology and other industrial purposes.

During the last two decades, in industrial settings, yeast has been the attractive host for genetic manipulations to produce molecules such as hybrid bioethanol, butanol, lactic acids, artemisinin, etc. [3][4][5][6][7]. Despite its wide use, challenges as well as more room for improvement remain in yeast engineering to achieve higher yields of existing products and obtain new products [8]. Advances in targeted genome manipulation tools for precise genome editing over the past few decades have revealed more significant opportunities for further improvements in cellular metabolic engineering. In this aspect, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) brought about a paradigm shift in genome editing with features such as high efficiency, accuracy, integrity, convenience, and cost-effectiveness [9]. \n\nCRISPR-Cas is an RNA-dependent tool for targeted genome editing that creates a double-strand break in DNA [10,11]. A synthetic single-stranded RNA (about 105 bases of single-stranded nucleotide) called guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 protein isolated from the Streptococcus pyogenes are the main two components of the CRISPR-Cas system. The gRNA binds the Cas9 protein to guide it to dock at the target-specific recognition site upstream of the genome's protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). Then, the Cas9 protein, which is an endonuclease, makes specific double-strand breaks (DSBs) three nucleotides before the PAM site. The double-strand break is repaired by Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Dependent Recombination (HDR).",

Chandel, Arijit Ghosh, A. Gautam, D. Huson, V. Ravichandiran, Dipanjan Ghosh\n## Abstract\nABSTRACT During the last two decades, yeast has been used as a biological tool to produce various small molecules, biofuels, etc., using an inexpensive bioprocess. The application of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) techniques in yeast genetic and metabolic engineering has made a paradigm shift, particularly with a significant improvement in targeted chromosomal integration using synthetic donor constructs, which was previously a challenge. This study reports the CRISPR-Cas9-based highly efficient strategy for targeted chromosomal integration and in-frame expression of a foreign gene in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) by homology-dependent recombination (HDR); our optimized methods show that CRISPR-Cas9-based chromosomal targeted integration of small constructs at multiple target sites of the yeast genome can be achieved with an efficiency of 74%. Our study also suggests that 15 bp microhomology flanked arms are sufficient for 50% targeted knock-in at minimal knock-in construct concentration. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that there is no off-target effect. This study provides a comprehensive and streamlined protocol that will support the targeted integration of essential genes into the yeast genome for synthetic biology and other industrial purposes. Highlights \u2022 CRISPR-Cas9 based in-frame expression of foreign protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using Homology arm without a promoter. \u2022 As low as 15 base pairs of microhomology (HDR) are sufficient for targeted integration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. \u2022 The methodology is highly efficient and very specific as no off-targeted effects were shown by the whole-genome sequence.\n## Introduction\nOwing to various advantages such as rapid growth on cheap carbon sources, well-studied genetics, tolerance to harsh cultivation conditions, high metabolic flux in the TCA cycle, the strong amino acid synthesis ability and strong protein secretion, easy genome manipulation for metabolic bioengineering, and robustness to large-scale fermentation, S. cerevisiae is widely used as a cell factory for the production of a variety of small and large molecules [1,2]. During the last two decades, in industrial settings, yeast has been the attractive host for genetic manipulations to produce molecules such as hybrid bioethanol, butanol, lactic acids, artemisinin, etc. [3][4][5][6][7]. Despite its wide use, challenges as well as more room for improvement remain in yeast engineering to achieve higher yields of existing products and obtain new products [8]. Advances in targeted genome manipulation tools for precise genome editing over the past few decades have revealed more significant opportunities for further improvements in cellular metabolic engineering. In this aspect, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) brought about a paradigm shift in genome editing with features such as high efficiency, accuracy, integrity, convenience, and cost-effectiveness [9]. \n\nCRISPR-Cas is an RNA-dependent tool for targeted genome editing that creates a double-strand break in DNA [10,11]. A synthetic single-stranded RNA (about 105 bases of single-stranded nucleotide) called guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 protein isolated from the Streptococcus pyogenes are the main two components of the CRISPR-Cas system. The gRNA binds the Cas9 protein to guide it to dock at the target-specific recognition site upstream of the genome's protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). Then, the Cas9 protein, which is an endonuclease, makes specific double-strand breaks (DSBs) three nucleotides before the PAM site. The double-strand break is repaired by Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Dependent Recombination (HDR).",

Moreover, expensive antibiotics is required to exert a selection pressure on host cells for prevention of plasmid loss, which increases a production cost. However, genome-based expression of production pathway could deliver stable and reproducible production with no use of antibiotics, which is important for mass scale production of industry. The top portion of MVA pathway was integrated into genomic loci of adhE and ldhA in E. coli, and atpFH genes were deleted to increase glycolytic rate.

Plasmid-based expression of production pathway has a problem of segregational or structural instability of plasmids, which becomes worse in case of inhibitory products to host cells. Moreover, expensive antibiotics is required to exert a selection pressure on host cells for prevention of plasmid loss, which increases a production cost. However, genome-based expression of production pathway could deliver stable and reproducible production with no use of antibiotics, which is important for mass scale production of industry. The top portion of MVA pathway was integrated into genomic loci of adhE and ldhA in E. coli, and atpFH genes were deleted to increase glycolytic rate. The genome-engineered strain exhibited both high productivity (\u223c1.01 g/liter/h) and yield (86.1% of theoretical yield) after 48 h of shaking flask culture (Wang J. et al., 2016). However, engineering of genome integrated production pathway is a cumbersome task compared to plasmid-based engineering.",

Robust tools for building and optimizing yeast chassis cells were made possible by the quick development of synthetic biology, especially in engineering evolution. In this review, we focused on methods and tools from synthetic biology that are used to design and engineer S. cerevisiae's evolution. A detailed discussion was held regarding transcriptional regulation, template\u2010dependent and template\u2010free approaches. Furthermore, the applications of evolved S. cerevisiae were comprehensively summarized. These included improving environmental stress tolerance and raising cell metabolic performance in the production of biofuels and bulk and value\u2010added chemicals. Finally, the future considerations were briefly discussed.",

Moreover, a precise and trackable edit engineering technique, named CHAnGE, was also created with the help of CRISPR/Cas9 and single-nucleotide-mediated HDR, allowing for the rapid evolution on a genome scale and improving tolerance to growth inhibitors of S. cerevisiae 45 . Previous studies have also investigated and employed largesize donors for robust directed evolution. With the assistance of error-prone PCR and Cas9-mediated genome editing, CasPER allowed the integration of large-scale donor-mediated variant mutant libraries into multiple genomic sites with efficiencies of almost 100.0% 46 . Moreover, a homologyintegrated CRISPR (HI-CRISPR) strategy enabled the insertion of a 100-bp dsDNA mutagenized homologous recombination donor into target locations for multiple gene knockouts and genome evolution 47 . Si et al. also developed an automated multiplex genome-scale engineering in a completely automated manner using CRISPR-Cas and a full-length cDNA library 48 (Figure 2B).",

Robust tools for building and optimizing yeast chassis cells were made possible by the quick development of synthetic biology, especially in engineering evolution. In this review, we focused on methods and tools from synthetic biology that are used to design and engineer S. cerevisiae's evolution. A detailed discussion was held regarding transcriptional regulation, template\u2010dependent and template\u2010free approaches. Furthermore, the applications of evolved S. cerevisiae were comprehensively summarized. These included improving environmental stress tolerance and raising cell metabolic performance in the production of biofuels and bulk and value\u2010added chemicals. Finally, the future considerations were briefly discussed.\n## Template-dependent synthetic evolution\n(B) CRISPR-editing. The CRISPR technology offers an unprecedented tool for yeast genome engineering. The development of CREATE and CHAnGE allows yeast to rapidly modify the genome and improve tolerance to growth inhibitors. (C) Synthesis and assembly. Chromosome rearrangements and alterations produced by the LoxP-mediated evolution (SCRaMbLE) system are critical in the efficient design of sites that promote genotypic variation and speeded up genome evolution. CHAnGE, CRISPR-Cas9-and homology directed-repair (HDR)-assisted genome-scale engineering; CREATE, CRISPR-enabled trackable genome engineering; eMAGE, eukaryotic multiplex automated genome engineering; SCRaMbLE, synthetic chromosome rearrangement and modification by LoxP-mediated evolution; YOGE, yeast oligo-mediated genome engineering. developed using a combination of CRISPR/Cas9 and massively parallel oligomer synthesis and has since been applied to site saturation mutagenesis for protein engineering, as well as adaptive evolution in bacteria, with preliminary results in S. cerevisiae 43,44 . Moreover, a precise and trackable edit engineering technique, named CHAnGE, was also created with the help of CRISPR/Cas9 and single-nucleotide-mediated HDR, allowing for the rapid evolution on a genome scale and improving tolerance to growth inhibitors of S. cerevisiae 45 . Previous studies have also investigated and employed largesize donors for robust directed evolution. With the assistance of error-prone PCR and Cas9-mediated genome editing, CasPER allowed the integration of large-scale donor-mediated variant mutant libraries into multiple genomic sites with efficiencies of almost 100.0% 46 . Moreover, a homologyintegrated CRISPR (HI-CRISPR) strategy enabled the insertion of a 100-bp dsDNA mutagenized homologous recombination donor into target locations for multiple gene knockouts and genome evolution 47 . Si et al. also developed an automated multiplex genome-scale engineering in a completely automated manner using CRISPR-Cas and a full-length cDNA library 48 (Figure 2B).",

Since this technology emerged 3 years ago, it has shown great potential in engineering the cell lines or strains with new functions or phenotypes and creating new platforms which are used for producing enzymes, chemicals and so on. As the most rapidly developing research field in life science, the development and application of the genome editing technologies, including PE, has brought the genetic engineering of organisms into an unprecedented depth and breadth. Genome editing technology based on CRISPR-Cas9 has become a powerful and widely used genetic tool. Recently, PE has added more powerful functions to genome editing. As mentioned in this review, these outstanding studies highlight characteristics of the PE system, such as high efficiency, less by-products and wide editing scope (Xu et al., 2020;Caso and Davies, 2022). It is believed that with the further optimization and updating of this technology, PE will have a farreaching impact on basic research, precision molecular breeding and disease treatments. \n\nComparing the BE system, the PE system is more efficient and has less by-products. However, in the classic base editing window, the BE system has higher editing efficiency and less risk of producing offtargeted indels. If the designed nucleotide location is poor, the PE system is more efficient because it is less dependent on the PAM sites (Anzalone et al., 2019;Marzec et al., 2020). Although the PE system has made some breakthroughs, there are still some deficiencies. First, the editing efficiency of PE needs to be improved further. Through constantly optimizing, the efficiency of PE system has been greatly increased compared with that of the original PE system. However, comparing the CRISPR-Cas system, the editing efficiency of PE is still very low. Meanwhile, it was reported that the editing efficiency of PE system was various in different species (Lu et al., 2022), which could be related to the expression level of PE effecter protein and pegRNA in different species. Second, the ratio of off-target editing is needed to be reduced and the mechanism of off-target editing is needed to be clarified.",

Comparing the base editing technology, the editing scope of prime editing has been widely expanded. Prime editing has been successfully applied in a variety of plant cells, animal cells and the model microorganism Escherichia coli so far, and it has shown a good application potential in breeding and genomic functional study of animals and plants, disease treatment, and modification of the microbial strains. In this paper, the basic strategies of prime editing are briefly described, and its research progress is summarized and prospected from the application of multiple species. In addition, a variety of optimization strategies for improving its efficiency and specificity of prime editing are outlined.\n## Summary and prospect\nThe PE system based on CRISPR-Cas9 can be used for deletion, replacement and insertion of the targets in genome, and it shows extraordinary versatility, product purity and target specificity. Since this technology emerged 3 years ago, it has shown great potential in engineering the cell lines or strains with new functions or phenotypes and creating new platforms which are used for producing enzymes, chemicals and so on. As the most rapidly developing research field in life science, the development and application of the genome editing technologies, including PE, has brought the genetic engineering of organisms into an unprecedented depth and breadth. Genome editing technology based on CRISPR-Cas9 has become a powerful and widely used genetic tool. Recently, PE has added more powerful functions to genome editing. As mentioned in this review, these outstanding studies highlight characteristics of the PE system, such as high efficiency, less by-products and wide editing scope (Xu et al., 2020;Caso and Davies, 2022). It is believed that with the further optimization and updating of this technology, PE will have a farreaching impact on basic research, precision molecular breeding and disease treatments. \n\nComparing the BE system, the PE system is more efficient and has less by-products. However, in the classic base editing window, the BE system has higher editing efficiency and less risk of producing offtargeted indels. If the designed nucleotide location is poor, the PE system is more efficient because it is less dependent on the PAM sites (Anzalone et al., 2019;Marzec et al., 2020). Although the PE system has made some breakthroughs, there are still some deficiencies. First, the editing efficiency of PE needs to be improved further. Through constantly optimizing, the efficiency of PE system has been greatly increased compared with that of the original PE system. However, comparing the CRISPR-Cas system, the editing efficiency of PE is still very low. Meanwhile, it was reported that the editing efficiency of PE system was various in different species (Lu et al., 2022), which could be related to the expression level of PE effecter protein and pegRNA in different species. Second, the ratio of off-target editing is needed to be reduced and the mechanism of off-target editing is needed to be clarified.",

In 2012, Jinek et al. [43] found that Cas9, which is a component of the CRISPR/Cas system, is a DNA endonuclease dependent on RNA, which generates site-specific double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). In 2013, several groups succeeded in genome engineering of mammalian cultured cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system [44,45].

The Cas9 protein forms a complex with gRNA that has a homology sequence of target DNA and induces a site-specific DSB. In the CRISPR/Cas9 system, it is only 20 bases in the gRNA of approximately 100 bases, which prescribe the target sequence of the DSB. Therefore, only 20 bases need to be changed for each target and all other base sequences and Cas9 are common. Additionally, the gRNA can be easily obtained from a manufacturing company.

The integration of donor DNA was limited to the small single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) and the insertion efficiency was low at first, but the integration rate of kb",

Moreover, the natural homologous recombination (HR) depends on a DNA break which occurs accidentally at the target locus (Raschmanov\u00e1 et al., 2018). In the last few decades, several new, better, and more accurate genetic tools have been developed to improve the efficiency of genome editing, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) (Doyon et al., 2011) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENS) (Li et al., 2011). The targeting of specific DNA sequences by ZNFs and TALENs depends on the protein-DNA interaction, and then the DNA break is introduced by FokI. However, the construction of specific DNA binding proteins is still a laborious and time-consuming task. \n\nRecently, the CRISPR/Cas system has revolutionized genome editing technology due to its efficiency, accuracy, and convenience (Hsu et al., 2014). This system essentially comprises a DNA endonuclease (e.g. Cas9 or Cpf1) which can bind to the target DNA sequence by the guidance of sgRNA, and then generating DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), and later the repair mechanism including HR, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is activated (Zetsche et al., 2015;Burstein et al., 2017) (Figure 1A).

In recent years, the emerging of CRISPR/Cas technology has improved the efficiency and accuracy of genome editing. Utilizing the advantages of CRISPR/Cas in bioengineering of non-conventional yeasts, quite a few advancements have been made. Due to the diversity in their genetic background, the ways for building a functional CRISPR/Cas system of various species non-conventional yeasts were also species-specific. Herein, we have summarized the different strategies for optimizing CRISPR/Cas systems in different non-conventional yeasts and their biotechnological applications in the construction of cell factories. In addition, we have proposed some potential directions for broadening and improving the application of CRISPR/Cas technology in non-conventional yeasts.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe traditional gene manipulation tools such as Cre-loxP system can improve the genome editing efficiency to some extent, but these systems can only modify single locus in one step, and the marker recycling is time-consuming and left many scars in genome, which is not conducive to genomic stability (Xie et al., 2014). Moreover, the natural homologous recombination (HR) depends on a DNA break which occurs accidentally at the target locus (Raschmanov\u00e1 et al., 2018). In the last few decades, several new, better, and more accurate genetic tools have been developed to improve the efficiency of genome editing, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) (Doyon et al., 2011) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENS) (Li et al., 2011). The targeting of specific DNA sequences by ZNFs and TALENs depends on the protein-DNA interaction, and then the DNA break is introduced by FokI. However, the construction of specific DNA binding proteins is still a laborious and time-consuming task. \n\nRecently, the CRISPR/Cas system has revolutionized genome editing technology due to its efficiency, accuracy, and convenience (Hsu et al., 2014). This system essentially comprises a DNA endonuclease (e.g. Cas9 or Cpf1) which can bind to the target DNA sequence by the guidance of sgRNA, and then generating DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), and later the repair mechanism including HR, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is activated (Zetsche et al., 2015;Burstein et al., 2017) (Figure 1A). The CRISPR/Cas system relies on the DNA-RNA recognition for inducing precise DNA cleavage, which is markerfree and capable of simultaneous multi-loci editing, thus greatly accelerates the genome editing. \n\nThe genome-editing system mediated by CRISPR/Cas has already been widely employed in the genetic engineering of non-conventional yeasts and promoted the biotechnological development of these yeasts.",

However, deep cellular understanding is required for improvement of current biofuel cell factories to truly transform the Bioeconomy. Modifications in microbial metabolic pathways and increased resistance to various types of stress caused by the production of these chemicals are crucial in the generation of robust and efficient production hosts. Recent advances in systems and synthetic biology provide new tools for metabolic engineering to design strategies and construct optimal biocatalysts for the sustainable production of desired chemicals, especially in the case of ethanol and fatty acid production. Yeast is an efficient producer of bioethanol and most of the available synthetic biology tools have been developed for the industrial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Non-conventional yeast systems have several advantageous characteristics that are not easily engineered such as ethanol tolerance, low pH tolerance, thermotolerance, inhibitor tolerance, genetic diversity and so forth. Currently, synthetic biology is still in its initial steps for studies in non-conventional yeasts such as Yarrowia lipolytica, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Issatchenkia orientalis and Pichia pastoris. Therefore, the development and application of advanced synthetic engineering tools must also focus on these underexploited, non-conventional yeast species. Herein, we review the basic synthetic biology tools that can be applied to the standard S. cerevisiae model strain, as well as those that have been developed for non-conventional yeasts. In addition, we will discuss the recent advances employed to develop non-conventional yeast strains that are efficient for the production of a variety of chemicals through the use of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.",

The introduction of the DSB must be repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or alternatively, homology-directed repair, to prevent the death of the host [18,116]. \n\nThe CRISPR-Cas based editing systems can be utilized for high throughput, multiplex genome editing technologies for genotype-phenotype discovery. Array-based oligo technologies enable creating hundreds of thousands of cassettes containing a donor template and a genome-targeting gRNA and a pooled plasmid library generates designed mutations in parallel. After CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, each plasmid can be served as a genetic barcode and the frequency of each designed mutation can be tracked by next-generation sequencing (NGS). This approach was applied to improve ethanol tolerance and production in S. cerevisiae by perturbing 25 regulatory genes with 43,020 mutations [117]. Also, genetic parts encoding overexpression and knockdown mutations of >90% yeast genes were iteratively integrated into the repetitive genomic sequences in a modular manner based on multiplex integration by CRISPR/Cas9. This approach with the aid of robotic automation allowed functional mapping and multiplex optimization on a genome scale for diverse phenotypes such as acetic acid tolerance [118]. A unique advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is that multiple gRNAs can be combined with Cas9, achieving efficient multiplex genome editing. The system could accelerate future genome-scale engineering in polyploid industrial strains [118]. Furthermore, the use of lab-on-chip, ultra-low volume nanoreactors allows for high index of selection of variants [119]. If the variant library is pooled and a growth selection to enrich for improved variants is not available for the desired phenotype, other methods for high throughput screening or selection are required. \n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been applied to non-model yeasts, based on the foundation of S. cerevisiae systems.",

Lacerda, E. Oh, C. Eckert\n## Abstract\nMicroorganisms are effective platforms for the production of a variety of chemicals including biofuels, commodity chemicals, polymers and other natural products. However, deep cellular understanding is required for improvement of current biofuel cell factories to truly transform the Bioeconomy. Modifications in microbial metabolic pathways and increased resistance to various types of stress caused by the production of these chemicals are crucial in the generation of robust and efficient production hosts. Recent advances in systems and synthetic biology provide new tools for metabolic engineering to design strategies and construct optimal biocatalysts for the sustainable production of desired chemicals, especially in the case of ethanol and fatty acid production. Yeast is an efficient producer of bioethanol and most of the available synthetic biology tools have been developed for the industrial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Non-conventional yeast systems have several advantageous characteristics that are not easily engineered such as ethanol tolerance, low pH tolerance, thermotolerance, inhibitor tolerance, genetic diversity and so forth. Currently, synthetic biology is still in its initial steps for studies in non-conventional yeasts such as Yarrowia lipolytica, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Issatchenkia orientalis and Pichia pastoris. Therefore, the development and application of advanced synthetic engineering tools must also focus on these underexploited, non-conventional yeast species. Herein, we review the basic synthetic biology tools that can be applied to the standard S. cerevisiae model strain, as well as those that have been developed for non-conventional yeasts. In addition, we will discuss the recent advances employed to develop non-conventional yeast strains that are efficient for the production of a variety of chemicals through the use of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.\n## Classical Genetics Tools and Emerging Technologies\nThe Cas9 protein breaks the double strand (DSB) into three nucleotides upstream of the PAM site (adjacent protospacer motif). The introduction of the DSB must be repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or alternatively, homology-directed repair, to prevent the death of the host [18,116]. \n\nThe CRISPR-Cas based editing systems can be utilized for high throughput, multiplex genome editing technologies for genotype-phenotype discovery. Array-based oligo technologies enable creating hundreds of thousands of cassettes containing a donor template and a genome-targeting gRNA and a pooled plasmid library generates designed mutations in parallel. After CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, each plasmid can be served as a genetic barcode and the frequency of each designed mutation can be tracked by next-generation sequencing (NGS). This approach was applied to improve ethanol tolerance and production in S. cerevisiae by perturbing 25 regulatory genes with 43,020 mutations [117]. Also, genetic parts encoding overexpression and knockdown mutations of >90% yeast genes were iteratively integrated into the repetitive genomic sequences in a modular manner based on multiplex integration by CRISPR/Cas9. This approach with the aid of robotic automation allowed functional mapping and multiplex optimization on a genome scale for diverse phenotypes such as acetic acid tolerance [118]. A unique advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is that multiple gRNAs can be combined with Cas9, achieving efficient multiplex genome editing. The system could accelerate future genome-scale engineering in polyploid industrial strains [118]. Furthermore, the use of lab-on-chip, ultra-low volume nanoreactors allows for high index of selection of variants [119]. If the variant library is pooled and a growth selection to enrich for improved variants is not available for the desired phenotype, other methods for high throughput screening or selection are required. \n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been applied to non-model yeasts, based on the foundation of S. cerevisiae systems.",

            "text": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a revolutionary tool in genetic engineering, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency in genome editing. Cas9, an enzyme derived from bacteria, is guided by RNA to edit DNA sequences within cells precisely. However, while CRISPR-Cas9 presents notable benefits and encouraging outcomes as a molecular tool and a potential therapeutic agent, the process of producing and purifying recombinant Cas9 protein remains a formidable hurdle. In this study, we systematically investigated the expression of recombinant SpCas9-His in four distinct Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains (Rosetta2, BL21(DE3), BL21(DE3)-pLysS, and BL21(DE3)-Star). Through optimization of culture conditions, including temperature and post-induction time, the BL21(DE3)-pLysS strain demonstrated efficient SpCas9 protein expression. This study also presents a detailed protocol for the purification of recombinant SpCas9, along with detailed troubleshooting tips. Results indicate successful SpCas9 protein expression using E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS at 0.5 mM IPTG concentration. Furthermore, the findings suggest potential avenues for further enhancements, paving the way for large-scale Cas9 production. This research contributes valuable insights into optimizing E. coli strains and culture conditions for enhanced Cas9 expression, offering a step forward in the development of efficient genome editing tools and therapeutic proteins.",

            "text": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) systems, originally discovered as an immunological mechanism in bacteria and archaea [1], are now widely used as genome editing tools. While many types of CRISPR systems have been discovered, CRISPRassociated protein 9 (Cas9), which is an RNA-guided endonuclease that cleaves target DNA, is the most commonly used for genome editing [2]. The genome editing process requires complementarity between the target site in the genome with Cas9-associated guide RNA (gRNA), which guides Cas9 to perform a double-strand break adjacent to a protospacer adjacent motif. \n\nBesides editing, an endonuclease-inactive Cas9 mutant (dCas9) can be employed to modulate gene expression in a gRNA-dependent manner. Fusion of dCas9 protein to either transcriptional repressors or activators enables efficient transcriptional regulation and is widely employed for gene interference (CRISPRi) and gene activation (CRISPRa) in several organisms [3]. \n\nCRISPR multiplex gRNA systems have been employed in genome engineering to mutate or modulate the expression of several target genes in one single cell, and this strategy is effective for genome engineering in a variety of yeast strains [3]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the efficiency of editing two genes is about 65-87%, although efficiency declines for multiplex editing of three (57-75%) and four (15-27%) genes [4]. A similar efficiency was demonstrated for Cas9-mediated multiplex editing in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris [5], whereas markedly lower efficiency was reported for multiplex editing in another methylotrophic yeast Ogataea parapolymorpha and O. polymorpha [6,7]. In addition to editing, the expression of multiple yeast genes can be modulated in parallel with dCas9. In Yarrowia lipolytica, multiplexed CRISPRa with five gRNAs targeting the promoters of two native \u03b2-glucosidase genes led to increased proliferation and cellobiose consumption [8].",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is often used to produce a variety of valuable chemicals, drugs, and biofuels in industrial biotechnology. A traditional method of gene knockout in E. coli was to adopt the Red homologous recombination system to mediate the homologous recombination of DNA. However, it is inefficient and especially not suitable for recombination of multiple sites (Murphy and Campellone, 2003). To improve the genetic engineering efficiency, Jiang et al. construct a triple-plasmid system as mentioned above. This novel genetic engineering tool significantly improved the efficiency of genetic modification and thus accelerated the development of industrial biology. In previous studies, Cas9 and gRNA were expressed in two plasmids, respectively, as the simultaneous expression would burden the organism metabolism and cause cell death. Hence, Cas9 or gRNA should be repressed before a genome editing event. Cas9 and gRNA can be assembled into one plasmid containing a pBAD promoter, which is repressed by glucose and induced by arabinose and a temperature-sensitive replicon repA101ts, so that transformed E. coli could grow on glucoseamended plates and be edited under the induction with 2 g/L of arabinose. This fast and easy procedure for genome editing could perform continuously, as multiple loci only required one plasmid construction and one step of transformation. To further improve the simultaneous editing efficiency of multiple loci, a CRISPR/Cas9-assisted multiplex genome editing technique was developed. The CRISPR/Cas9-assisted multiplex genome editing technique contained three plasmids: pRedCas9 containing both \u03bb-Red recombineering and Cas9 system under the control of pBAD promoter, pMgRNAs containing gRNAs, and pDonorDNAs carrying multiple donor DNA cassettes (Feng et al., 2018). In another versatile study, Li et al. firstly coexpressed a plasmid containing a gRNA targeting the bla gene and Cas9 with the \u03bb-Red recombineering system into E. coli (Li et al., 2015). Then, the genetic editing started with cotransformation of donor DNA and gRNA plasmid into preceding cells.",

            "text": "The advent of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized genome editing in non-conventional yeasts, offering unparalleled precision, flexibility, multiplexing, and simplicity (Bai et al., 2023) (Figure 1, Table 1). The CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing tool introduces targeted double-strand breaks (DSBs) at specific loci, enabling precise and programmable modifications guided by customized simple single-guide RNA (sgRNA), with the assistance of intracellular DNA repair pathways such as HR and NHEJ. CRISPR/ Cas9 streamlines the editing workflow, improves accuracy, and accelerates strain engineering to achieve desired properties (Zha et al., 2023;Wu et al., 2023;Schwartz et al., 2016;Li M. et al., 2021;Burghardt et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2024;Liu K. et al., 2024). \n\nIn Y. lipolytica, CRISPR/Cas9 was first adapted in 2016 using a codon-optimized Cas9 and sgRNA expression under a synthetic RNA polymerase III promoter to disrupt genes such as Ku70, as well as lipid oxidation-related Pex10 and Mfe1 (Schwartz et al., 2016). More recently, a base editor combining CRISPR/Cas9, cytidine deaminase, and uracil glycosylase inhibitor enabled targeted base modifications without introducing DSBs, further expanding the genome editing toolbox in Y. lipolytica. This system achieved editing efficiencies of 94% for single genes and 34% for dual genes, demonstrating its potential for precise genetic engineering (Bae et al., 2020). Additionally, the CRISPR-Cas12a/Cpf1 system has been implemented, allowing for the retention of PAM sites after NHEJ repair and enabling efficient multiplexed editing (Yang et al., 2020). Using this system, the single-gene disruption efficiencies reached 99%, while triplex edits achieved up to 30%, highlighting its utility for complex genetic modifications.",

            "text": "In summary, researchers have been taking advantage of the specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, not only to perform direct genetic modifications but also to direct other molecules (activators or DNA polymerases) to a previously defined locus. Engineering Cas9 protein (dCas9 or nCas9) allowed the targeting of specific sequences without introducing a DSB, which can be used to guide these molecules. Moreover, the use of truncated gRNAs allowed the development of multifunctional CRISPR systems, such CRISPR-AID and CRISPR-ARE, which will facilitate fast and multifunctional engineering of the S. cerevisiae chassis. \n\nKey Messages: The CRISPR-Cas9 system's discovery is with no doubt a landmark in the synthetic biology field. The simplicity and flexibility of the system enabled the researchers to develop a panoply of CRISPR applications. Consequently, it is now possible to build more and more complex designs in yeast by multiplexed CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. Besides allowing multiple modifications, the emergence of CRISPR-Cas9 enabled the researchers to perform genetic modifications faster, cheaper, and more efficiently. The possibility to perform genetic modifications without the requirement of selective markers or the multiplex genomic edits are examples of the possibilities brought by this technology. The scientific community is taking advantage of the fantastic teamwork between CRISPR and yeast with results ranging from the introduction of large chromosomal segments to point mutations and by developing improved genome editing systems. Moreover, CRISPR applications have transgressed the conventional genome editing application through the creation of novel mutated versions of Cas9 such as nCas9 or dCas9. CRISPRi/a is a tremendously useful tool for transcriptional regulation because it allows to balance and optimize gene expression without genome editing. This tool may be tremendously useful when dealing with essential genes in S. cerevisiae mainly for the development of industrial strains where the metabolic fluxes need to be meticulously balanced. The application of multifunctional systems, such as CRISPR-ARE, accelerates the design-build-test processes and consequently the productivity of the research. The EvolvR technology may facilitate the development of highly adapted S. cerevisiae strains or even simplify the study of the eukaryotic genetic mechanisms.",

However, Cas9n has not been adopted for Streptomyces genome editing. We believe that the Cas9n-assisted genome editing technology may be suitable for engineering streptomycetes with low DNA transformation efficiency. \n\n(ii) Developing genome editing tools based on endogenous CRISPR/Cas systems. CRISPR/Cas systems are reported in approximately 45% of bacterial genomes, including streptomycetes, which are a rich source for the development of endogenous CRISPR/Cas nuclease-based genome editing tools [30]. In addition to mitigating the toxicity of heterologous Cas nucleases by harnessing endogenous CRISPR/Cas systems, the DNA transformation frequency can be improved as the size of the editing plasmid is approximately 4.2 kb (the size of the S. pyogenes cas9 gene) smaller than that based on heterologous Cas9. Therefore, endogenous CRISPR/Cas machinery provides a superior foundation for genome editing by precluding heterologous cas9 expression. For example, Pyne et al. reported the detailed characterization of a functional native Type I-B CRISPR/Cas system in Clostridium pasteurianum [70]. This CRISPR/Cas system was repurposed for precise markerless genome editing. Compared to the widely employed S. pyogenes type II CRISPR-Cas9 system that generated 25% of the total yield of edited cells, the endogenous Cas system-based tool could achieve gene deletion with an efficiency of 100% by only introducing a synthetic crRNA array and templates for DSB repair.",

CRISPR/Cas technology possesses multiloci genome editing without the integration of a gene marker on the selection genome and saves time and exertion in metabolic engineering. Although several genetic modifications are available; the CRISPR/Cas9 technology significantly enhanced the efficiency of genetic engineering and is adopted as an extraordinary \"gift.\" The CRISPR/Cas9 technology improved industrial micro-organisms' performance in strengthening of microbial factories that are valuable in processing of new value-added molecules from the low-cost feedstock. \n\nThere are abundant examples of bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi which are reviewed in several studies of solicitations of the CRISPR/Cas9 system [51][52][53][54][55][56][57]. For example, E. coli, S. cerevisiae, Bacillus sp., Clostridium sp., Corynebacterium sp., Lactobacillus sp., Mycobacterium sp., Pseudomonas sp., Streptomyces sp. etc. [52,[58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69] are employed in the CRISPR/Cas system to improve yield of various metabolic products in field of industrial biotechnology. As a proof of concept, Zheng et al. employed Type I-F system to engineer Zymomonas mobilis as a synthetic chassis for sustainable economic biofuel and biochemical productions [70]. \n\nA study was designed to distinguish the orthogonal CRISPR method using E. coli for chromosomal addition of the Spd-Cas9based CRISPR module.

            "text": "The design and construction of microbial cell factories is more than ever an attractive approach to develop bioengineering processes to produce chemicals, fuels, or pharmaceutics. Furthermore, S. cerevisiae is an appealing model for bioengineering processes because allied with its rapid production cycles, it is easy to maintain, to manipulate, and is suitable for large-scale fermentation. The molecular \"tools\" available have helped the researchers to make yeast cell factories increasingly adapted to produce a desired product [46]. The development of efficient cell factories is associated with several genetic modifications, since not only the insertion of the heterologous genes is required but also the rewiring of the carbon flux toward the precursor synthesis or even other convenient modifications to improve the process. The CRISPR-Cas9 system appeared as a \"Swiss army knife\" [16] in the researcher's molecular toolbox because it allowed the performance of several genetic modifications in a fast and efficient way. Furthermore, the requirement of a constant selective pressure during fermentation is negated since CRISPR-Cas9 allows a markerless genetic manipulation. In addition, several design-build-test cycles are always necessary, which increases the number of modifications required [6,7]. By using CRISPR-Cas9 systems, genetic editing has become multiplex possible, which may significantly decrease the time to perform the designed genetic modifications for a cell factory construction. The flexibility of CRISPR-Cas9 allied with the researcher's inventiveness resulted in the development of systems that facilitate and accelerate metabolic engineering processes. Researchers are not only focused on developing new CRISPR-based strategies for direct genome engineering but also on applying CRISPR-Cas9 to improve other conventional molecular biology lab practices, speeding up the strain building process. For example, Li et al. [47] developed a CRISPR system capable of sequential rounds of gene targeting with simultaneous gRNA plasmid curing mediated by CRISPR-Cas9. Moreover, in Zhang et al.'s work [44], the developed CRISPR method skips the Escherichia coli transformation and verification steps. The flexibility and simplicity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system made it well accepted by genetic engineers for the development of yeast cell factories (Table 1).",

            "text": "The design and construction of microbial cell factories is more than ever an attractive approach to develop bioengineering processes to produce chemicals, fuels, or pharmaceutics. Furthermore, S. cerevisiae is an appealing model for bioengineering processes because allied with its rapid production cycles, it is easy to maintain, to manipulate, and is suitable for large-scale fermentation. The molecular \"tools\" available have helped the researchers to make yeast cell factories increasingly adapted to produce a desired product [46]. The development of efficient cell factories is associated with several genetic modifications, since not only the insertion of the heterologous genes is required but also the rewiring of the carbon flux toward the precursor synthesis or even other convenient modifications to improve the process. The CRISPR-Cas9 system appeared as a \"Swiss army knife\" [16] in the researcher's molecular toolbox because it allowed the performance of several genetic modifications in a fast and efficient way. Furthermore, the requirement of a constant selective pressure during fermentation is negated since CRISPR-Cas9 allows a markerless genetic manipulation. In addition, several design-build-test cycles are always necessary, which increases the number of modifications required [6,7]. By using CRISPR-Cas9 systems, genetic editing has become multiplex possible, which may significantly decrease the time to perform the designed genetic modifications for a cell factory construction. The flexibility of CRISPR-Cas9 allied with the researcher's inventiveness resulted in the development of systems that facilitate and accelerate metabolic engineering processes. Researchers are not only focused on developing new CRISPR-based strategies for direct genome engineering but also on applying CRISPR-Cas9 to improve other conventional molecular biology lab practices, speeding up the strain building process. For example, Li et al. [47] developed a CRISPR system capable of sequential rounds of gene targeting with simultaneous gRNA plasmid curing mediated by CRISPR-Cas9. Moreover, in Zhang et al.'s work [44], the developed CRISPR method skips the Escherichia coli transformation and verification steps. The flexibility and simplicity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system made it well accepted by genetic engineers for the development of yeast cell factories (Table 1).",

            "text": "Shi et al. (2019) developed a CRISPR-cas system for genome editing in F. fujikuroi as the first time at the beginning of 2019. In their work, three nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides, the classical SV40 NLS, an endogenous histone NLS and an endogenous Velvet NLS, was tested to import the Cas9 protein into the nucleus. Finally, the NLS of native histone H2B was chosen to fuse with the Cas9 protein, as it gave the best mutagenesis rate. The promoter selection for gRNA transcription was the second challenge. Shi et al. (2019) evaluated three promoters, the polymerase II promoter, the endogenous polymerase III U6 promoter and the endogenous 5SrRNA promoter, of which the 5SrRNA promoter gave the best editing efficiency. The resulted CRISPR-Cas system showed a genome editing efficiency of approximately 60-80%. \n\nThe advantage of this F. fujikuroi CRISPR-Cas system is that the expression of Cas9 protein did not show any effect to the cell growth, while the non-specific toxicity resulting from Cas9 expression or nuclease activity has been widely noticed in many other organisms (Morgens et al., 2016(Morgens et al., , 2017;;Munoz et al., 2016;Cen et al., 2017). In some other microorganisms, such as E. coli and baker's yeast, usually the CRISPR-Cas elements can be eliminated after the genetic manipulation, which not only avoided the possible toxicity of the Cas9 nuclease, but also enabled continuous genome editing. In E. coli, a dual-plasmidbased system was employed. The gRNA sequence was included in one plasmid (named as pTarget). The cas9 gene, a temperaturesensitive replicon repA101(Ts) and an arabinose induced gRNA expression cassette that targets the pTarget plasmid were edited in another plasmid (named as pCas). The pTarget can be eliminated by adding arabinose, while the pCas can be removed by rising the temperature (Jiang et al., 2015).",

In order to shorten the editing time, the CRISPR/Cas9 system and \u03bb-Red recombination system were co-expressed, enabling the introduction of gene knockouts, insertions or substitutions on the E. coli chromosome without a selectable marker gene, thereby omitting the work needed for the deletion of the marker and greatly shortening the editing time [28][29][30]. \n\nIn order to further shorten the experimental procedure, the genes encoding Cas9, sgRNA, \u03bb-Red recombinase and templates were integrated into the same plasmid, which shortened the genome editing cycle to 3 days [31]. Similarly, a time-saving CRISPR/Cas9 system (pCasSA) was developed for knockout, knock-in and single-base mutations in Staphylococcus aureus [32]. \n\nIn order to further improve the efficiency of genome editing, CRISPR/Cas9 and \u03bb-Red recombinase-based MAGE technology (CRMAGE) was established, which could edit three genes simultaneously in E. coli with a recombination efficiency between 96.5 and 99.7%. By contrast, the efficiency of traditional recombination systems was only between 0.68 and 5.4% [33]. The researchers used the plasmid pKCcas9dO encoding a codon-optimized cas9, two homology-directed repair templates, and a target-specific guide RNA to successfully achieve gene editing in Streptomyces coelicolor M145 with efficiencies of 60-100% [34]. The editing efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 tool specifically optimized for E. coli was nearly 100%, and it could be used to induce three mutations simultaneously [35]. \n\nIn order to develop a Cas9 protein adapted to a broader temperature range, ThermoCas9 was developed in Geobacillus thermodenitrificans T12.",

Due to its simplicity, the type II system from Streptococcus pyogenes is the most intensively studied, developed and applied system in genome editing. The signature Cas9 protein, a dual RNA-guided DNA endonuclease enzyme, can introduce a double-strand break (DSB) three base pairs (bp) upstream of PAM (5\u2032-NGG-3\u2032) (Figure 1a). In 2012, Cas9 protein, assisted by the dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, was demonstrated to bind and cleave DNA in vitro (Jinek et al., 2012). Since then, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been widely explored and adapted as a powerful genetic tool to modify genomes of various microbes, including yeasts, lactic acid bacteria, E. coli, Corynebacterium and Streptomyces species.

Multiple systems using different plasmids and their editing efficiencies on gene knockout, knockin as well as large fragment deletion were outlined. These authors also thoroughly discussed the engineering of B. subtilis to produce industrially relevant compounds using CRISPR tools.

            "text": "The model bacteria E. coli has also been intensively researched as a host for CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing. However, E. coli lacks the NHEJ mechanism for DSB repair (Chayot et al., 2010), and is highly reliant on a native homology-directed repair system with low efficiency, challenging the DSB producing CRISPR/Cas9 system (Jiang et al., 2015). Thus, co-expression of heterologous phage-derived recombinase to improve the frequency of homologous recombination showed significant improved survival rates when CRISPR/Cas9 and gRNA expressed (Jiang et al., 2015;Pyne et al., 2015;Bassalo et al., 2016). In E. coli, inducible promoters were mostly used for both Cas9 and gRNA expression. \n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 system has also been constructed with similar strategy for non-model microorganisms (Yan and Fong, 2017;Cho et al., 2018;Raschmanova et al., 2018;Wang and Coleman, 2019). Generally, species-specific strong promoters should be used for Cas9 expression, either constitutively or inducible expressed. Codon optimization should also be conducted when the Cas9 protein cannot be efficiently expressed. In eukaryotic microorganisms, NLS should be fused to Cas9 at one or both termini for cell nucleus localization. The NLS of SV40 from S. cerevisiae has been proven effective and applied in other yeast species. Native DNA repair types and efficiency also largely determined genome editing rate, because DSB induced by CRISPR/Cas9 can be repaired by NHEJ, resulting in indels and gene inactivation, or be repaired by HDR, resulting in precise genome editing by supplying proper DNA donors. Thus, in some organisms with both NHEJ and HDR pathways, deletion of KU70/KU80 often repressed NHEJ and increased CRISPR mediate genome editing rate through HDR (Gao S. et al., 2016;Schwartz et al., 2016;Cao et al., 2018;Bae et al., 2020).",

            "text": "Moreover, the system has been used in C. glutamicum to manipulate the expression levels of specific genes [12], but not for genome editing, such as gene deletion or insertion, or the generation of point mutations. A C. glutamicum genome editing tool based on the CRISPR-Cpf1 system was recently reported; however, the authors of this study were unsuccessful in developing a CRISPR/Cas9-based system for use in C. glutamicum [34]. Here, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing method to investigate the function of C. glutamicum genes involved in recombinant protein expression. We analyzed the transcriptomes of C. glutamicum grown under different dissolved oxygen conditions to identify genes that might affect substance and energy metabolism and, therefore, might play important roles in the ability of C. glutamicum to express recombinant proteins [35]. We identified four genes, porB, mepA, clpX, and Ncgl0911, and used the system to disrupt them in C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 to investigate their endogenous functions and their effects on recombinant protein production. Highly efficient gene deletions were obtained via homolog-directed repair through the introduction of a DNA repair template. In addition, point mutations and gene insertions were achieved with an efficiency of 100 and 66.7%, respectively. We also expanded the system to C. glutamicum CGMCC1.15647, a host strain for recombinant protein production. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a model protein to examine the effect of different genedeletion strains produced by the CRISPR/Cas9 system on recombinant protein expression and the results showed varying GFP expression levels in different strains. Overall, our CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing method enabled rapid and efficient genome editing in a single step without the need for a marker gene, making this an effective tool for gene analysis and genome engineering in C. glutamicum.",

Schwartz et al. (2016) constructed a codon-optimized Cas9 Y. lipolytica strain and tested various promoters to express the gRNA on a centromeric plasmid. The highest disruption efficiencies for their NHEJ system for gene PEX10 were achieved with a SCR1-tRNA promoter (>90% after 4 days of outgrowth) and a SNR52\u2212tRNA promoter (>80% after 4 days of outgrowth). Subsequently, they tested the efficiency of the HR system by deleting the KU70 gene and targeting another (PEX10). The efficiency was 86% in this case. \n\nAnother group (Gao et al., 2016) created a Y. lipolytica codon-optimized Cas9 and used a single plasmid system to deliver the gRNA in order to test the efficiency of NHEJ and HR. After 4 days of outgrowth, 86, 37 and 19% efficiency was achieved for one, two or three targeted genes, respectively, when no donor DNA was present. A higher rate of efficiency occurred when the donor DNA was delivered in the KU70/80 mutants. \n\nEfforts have been made to enhance the genome engineering capabilities in the important recombinant producer K. phaffii. In the study by Weninger et al. (2016) the authors tested various codon-optimized Cas9 genes and Cas9 promoters, and different gRNA sequences as well as gRNA promoters; however, only ~6% of their tested constructs were functional for efficient genome editing. The use of human codon-optimized Cas9 and the ribozyme-flanked gRNA resulted in the highest NHEJ efficiency (~90% for a single gene nonsense mutation and ~70% for two genes). Introducing the donor DNA containing ~1 kb gene homologous sequences into the cell provided a very low integration efficiency of ~2.5%.",

            "text": "Fermentation offers alternative production of a wide variety of compounds ranging from primary-and secondary metabolites to enzymes and therapeutic proteins. Hence, cell factories may replace productions depending on polluting resource-demanding petro-chemistry and/ or productions where natural bio-production is difficult, unstable, and costly. However, development of new economically viable cell factories is often labor intensive, technically difficult, and time consuming. New tools to speed up and simplify cell factory construction are therefore highly desirable as they pave the way for sustainable production of high-quality and cost-effective products for the benefit of the environment and the consumers [1,2].\n\nAlthough efficient methods for genome engineering of popular cell factories like Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) have been available for decades, strain development and optimization are still time consuming processes requiring a diverse range of multidisciplinary techniques, expertise and practical skills. One important reason for this is that it is rare that one or a few genetic engineering steps lead to formation of an efficient cell factory. Rather extensive multi-step metabolic engineering and/or tedious improvements via classical mutagenesis or evolution based methods are required to achieve economically attractive titers. Construction time may therefore be reduced by developing general techniques to speed up the experimental cycle for strain construction. Here we address this possibility using CRISPR/Cas9 derived technologies for construction of yeast-based cell factories.\n\nRecently, CRISPR/Cas9 based technologies have been introduced as advanced and flexible tools for metabolic engineering that may radically speed up cell factory construction. For example, it is well documented that Cas9, due to its ability to introduce specific RNA guided DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), can be used to greatly stimulate homologous recombination (HR) based genetic engineering at specific loci [3,4]. Accordingly, Cas9 sets the stage for modifying several target genes, or introducing multiple genes, in single transformation experiments [5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. With Cas9, genetic engineering is so efficient that accompanying selection markers are not required. This is important, as iterative gene targeting can then be performed without need for marker recycling. Moreover, in most cases industrial producer strains",

            "text": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system is continuously advancing genome editing by developing technologies with various characteristics due to its ability to accept the fusion of other elements into Cas9 [116,117] and gRNA [118]. Recently, genome editing for medical applications in mammalian cells and breeding non-model organisms has received attention. However, efforts to establish novel genome-editing technologies using yeast cells, which are some of the simplest model organisms for genome modification, are still ongoing. Pursuing novel genome-editing technologies using yeast cells is still valid, as progress has been made in expanding the CRISPR-Cas9 system in yeast cells, including the reduction of off-target effects, epigenome editing, and mitochondrial genome editing. The use of the nicking activity of nCas9 is a core of emerging methods that have lower off-target effects, which have been successfully developed using yeast with its high HDR activity [33]. This concept was followed by more modern concepts of protein engineering, resulting in obtaining high-fidelity Cas9 variants through the use of the yeast platform with genetically tractable selective marker sets [43]. Beyond the DNA sequences, epigenome editing has focused on altering the chromatin chemical modification by fusing dCas9 to chromatin remodeling enzymes. Yeast has also been used in epigenome editing, such as in establishing a chromatin loosening system at a heterochromatic locus [84]. The most emerging topic is expanding CRISPR-Cas9 systems to mitochondrial genome editing, whereas the established successful example of modifying mtDNA sequences using Cas9/gRNA complexes remains insufficient in editing efficiency. In this area, yeast will be recognized as a possible organism for developing a mitochondrial CRISPR-Cas9 system suggested by mtDNA depletion by the MTS-Cas9 with normal gRNA expressions [104]. Yeast cells are excellent chassis for assessing and screening CRISPR-Cas9 systems for diverse applications. \n\nIn the future, improved CRISPR-Cas9 methods that address the current limitations of yeasts will be integrated into cutting-edge genome editing applications [5][6][7] and extend their capabilities to broader cellular processes. The proposed transport of RNA to mitochondria in yeast cells holds one of the most attractive aspects of yeast.",

Studies on genome editing with CRISPR-Cas in various microorganisms, such as archaea, bacteria, and yeasts, are summarized in Table 1. \n\nCRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing was first reported in Escherichia coli among microorganisms (Jiang et al., 2013). In Staphylococcus aureus, gene deletion, insertion, and base substitution are performed using a single plasmid containing Cas9, sgRNA, \u03bb-Red recombinase, and donor DNA (Chen et al., 2017). The CRISPR-Cas9 system is also used in Trichoderma reesei, a filamentous fungus, and a relatively high homologous recombination efficiency (> 93%) is achieved when the length of the donor DNA homology arm is 200 bp (Liu et al., 2015). Genes are edited with > 70% efficiency in Streptomyces by using a single plasmid containing Cas9, sgRNAs, and donor templates (Cobb et al., 2015). Up to three heterologous genes are simultaneously inserted into various regions of the E. coli genome by using CRISPR-Cpf1 and \u03bb-Red recombinase (Ao et al., 2018). \n\nRecently, Cas12f1, which has a relatively smaller gene than Cas9 and Cpf1, was discovered from metagenomic data (Harrington et al., 2018); studies have reported gene deletion in E. coli and Bacillus anthracis by using CRISPR-Cas12f1 (Okano et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2022c).",

Specific genes in cellular pathways involved in protein biogenesis can be temporarily or permanently modified in a targeted manner by using RNA interference, Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) gene editing systems. Global genetic or strain engineering and whole genome analysis tools, such as random mutagenesis, RNA interference screens, whole genome fluxomic, metabolomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic analyses, have also been employed to identify novel target molecules involved in protein biogenesis.

The toolkit includes 23 Cas9-sgRNA plasmids, 37 promoters of various strengths and temporal expression profiles, and 10 protein-localization, degradation and solubility tags. We facilitated the use of these parts via a web-based tool, that automates the generation of DNA fragments for integration. Our system builds upon existing gene editing methods in the thoroughness with which the parts are standardized and characterized, the types and number of parts available and the ease with which our methodology can be used to perform genetic edits in yeast. We demonstrated the applicability of this toolkit by optimizing the expression of a challenging but industrially important enzyme, taxadiene synthase (TXS). This approach enabled us to diagnose an issue with TXS solubility, the resolution of which yielded a 25-fold improvement in taxadiene production.",

            "text": "As an eukaryotic model microorganism, S. cerevisiae was one of the earliest hosts for CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing (DiCarlo et al., 2013). In order to improve genome editing efficiency, the Cas9 protein is usually highly expressed by a strong constitutive promoter [e.g., TEF1 promoter (DiCarlo et al., 2013;Gilbert et al., 2013;Bao et al., 2015), TDH3 promoter (Gilbert et al., 2013;Laughery et al., 2015;Jensen et al., 2017)] in a episomal CEN low copy plasmid (DiCarlo et al., 2013;Gilbert et al., 2013) or episomal 2 \u00b5 high copy plasmid (Ryan and Cate, 2014;Bao et al., 2015;Shi et al., 2016;Jensen et al., 2017). However, in some researches, expression of Cas9 with strong promoter (e.g., promoter of TEF1, HXT7, and TDH3) showed toxic effect to cell growth (Ryan and Cate, 2014;Generoso et al., 2016). Nevertheless, medium strength or weak promoters showed similar editing efficiency, and no significant negative impact on the strain's growth rate. For efficient CRISPR editing rate, codon usage in heterologous organisms should be also considered to guarantee sufficient Cas9 abundance in vivo. In eukaryotes, Cas9 protein should be transported to nuclei to facilitate genome editing, and thus the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) should be fused to the Cas9 protein (Figure 1B). In S. cerevisiae, the SV40 NLS ('PKKKRKV') is typically fused to the N-or C-terminus of the Cas9, and two NLSs fused to one terminus or both were also applicable. \n\nThe model bacteria E. coli has also been intensively researched as a host for CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing.",

            "text": "Microbial metabolic engineering is not an easy task, especially for the identification of efficient strains, but it is indispensable for the advancement of the biofuel production industries. The important metabolic pathways must be well understood, and the relevant enzymes identified. The limiting regions of pathways are being identified by metabolic engineers and synthetic biologists using different approaches [204,[210][211][212]. The process of metabolic engineering for enhancing recombinant protein expression keeps on evolving and becoming sophisticated. Industrial microbes have been modified or designed to improve recombinant metabolite productivity while saving time and money [204,213,214]. \n\nAdvanced technologies such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 is being used to accelerate genetic engineering of microbes as it permits rapid and efficient editing of the genome by replacing 20-nucleotide sequences of a chimeric single-guide RNA (sgRNA) complementary to the target sequence of interest [215]. Immediately, the Cas9-sgRNA complex binds to the target DNA sequence, the endonuclease activity of the CRISPR-associated protein (Cas9 protein) cleaves the DNA [215]. This hastens metabolic engineering of proteins and editing of useful genes that could enhance tolerance to inhibitors, or promote utilization of different substrates used for biofuel production. The mechanism and major components of the Streptococcus pyogenes Type II CRISPR-Cas9 system have been well characterized. It consists of a Cas9 protein with endonuclease activity which is guided by two types of small RNAs, a target-recognizing CRISPR RNA (crRNA) which binds the target DNA and guides cleavage, and auxiliary non-coding trans-activating crRNAs (tracrRNAs) which base-pairs with the crRNA and permits the formation of Cas9-crRNA complex [216][217][218][219]. Genes relevant to biofuel-producing bacterial strains could be edited for better performances, novel genes inserted, or unwanted genes deleted or knocked out. For the activation of specific genes, CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system is used.",

            "text": "Off-target effects arise when the nuclease activity of Cas9 is triggered at sites where the RNA guide sequence exhibits imperfect complementarity with off-target genomic sites, presenting a significant challenge for genome editing applications [26]. To improve specificity and efficiency in gene editing, several variants of SpCas9 were initially created through mutagenesis of protein regions involved in target DNA binding [27]. One such variant, eSpCas9, was engineered with K848A, K1003A, and R1060A mutations using alanine mutagenesis of positively charged residues in the non-target strand binding groove. This was to reduce affinity and promote rehybridization between the target and non-target DNA strands, resulting in highly efficient and more specific gene editing in mammalian cells compared to wild-type cells [23]. Building upon the CRISPR/Cas9 system established by Gao [19], we developed all-in-one CRISPR plasmids, termed peCASyl, containing a de novo codon-optimized version of the eSpCas9 gene, with the aim of achieving higher gene editing efficiency in Y. lipolytica. \n\nTo assess the efficacy of peCASyl in gene editing, we targeted the TRP1 gene for editing, as its absence renders strains unable to grow in tryptophan-deficient media (Figure 1A). As the results demonstrate, a disruption efficiency of 35.5% was observed in strains transformed with peCASyl, and the disruption efficiency further increased to 71.23% and 77.21% after outgrowth periods of 2 and 4 days, respectively (Figure 2). It is worth noting that the introduction of eSpCas9 significantly enhances the efficiency of gene editing compared to the original CRISPR/Cas9 system, whether engaging in an additional outgrowth step or not (Figure 2). The efficient expression of the recombinant protein, facilitated by codon optimization and minimal off-target effects, likely contributes to this improvement in gene editing efficiency.",

            "text": "We have developed a B. subtilis specific, rapid, in situ protein engineering technique based on the ground breaking CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The rapid engineering of established and novel industrially relevant proteins yielding markerless, and potentially non-GMO compliant strains, is an attractive proposition for industrial biotechnology. This is due to the lowering in costs and time associated with product development and governmental regulatory compliance, while increasing the time a product is in production. \n\nInitial exemplification of our system on the \u03b1-amylase encoding gene, amyE, showed an average editing efficiency of 76% across the three targeted PAM sites selected. While our cotransformation-based approach to genome editing may result in lower transformation efficiencies due to the requirement that both plasmid and dDNA molecules enter the cell, the rate of editing efficiency observed enables a high degree of confidence that most colonies obtained have been edited as designed. This system, where one round of plasmid construction is required and transformed alongside an easily prepared PCR product, represents an alternative to the B. subtilis CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing strategies published to date. These involve previous chromosome integration of the cas9 gene and subsequent eviction of cas9/tracrRNA and crRNA expression cassettes after editing, or a two-step plasmid construction to introduce the sgRNA expression cassette and dDNA [2,3,5,6]. \n\nIn under a week we carried out two rounds of in situ CRISPR-Cas9 editing of the subtilisin E gene, aprE. A salt bridge triad was introduced and the Q337E + Q381R variant showed an increase of 46.5% in subtilisin E activity, as well as a 1.4\u02daC increase in thermostability. To the best of our knowledge these modifications have not been combined before in B. subtilis subtilisin E. \n\nInterestingly, the Q125R + Q377E + Q381R variant did not retain its activity levels to the same level as the Q377E + Q381R variant.",

            "text": "At present, CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing has become the most widely used tool in various organisms. Numerous CRISPR-Cas9 tools and platforms have been developed, including the expanded nucleases and their variants, expression systems for multiplexing, precise genome editing with HDR or base editing, epigenome editing and transcriptome regulation (Liang et al., 2017;Lowder et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2019;Mao et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2019;Zhou et al., 2019). Most of studies focus on increasing the editing efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 system, especially the precise editing efficiency; expanding the genomic target ranges, achieving the sustained whole-genome editing; reducing off-target effect and improving specificity (Chen et al., 2019;Mao et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2019). As mentioned before, improving the genome editing efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 is mainly from two aspects: improving CRISPR-Cas9 system activity and improving the accessibility of genomic target sites. \n\nIt is well known that protein expression level can be increased by enhancing the transcription and translation. Many previous studies are about how to increasing the expression level of Cas9 in cells. In this study we attempt to improve the genome editing efficiency of Cas9 from another perspective. The cleavage activity of Cas9 protein is closely related to its intracellular content, and the intracellular content of each protein is precisely regulated by cell. The balance of protein content is not only related to the expression level (input), but also to the degradation of the protein (output). It could be an effective strategy to increase the intracellular protein content by regulating the \"input\" and \"output\" of a protein at the same time. Most previous reports only focus on increasing Cas9 protein expression level (increasing input), but ignore the inhibition of Cas9 protein degradation (reducing output). Therefore, we consider to further enhance the stability of Cas9 protein and extend its half-life while maintaining high-level expression of Cas9 protein. This could increase the intracellular content of Cas9 protein, and improve the genome editing efficiency of Cas9 efficiently, stably and indiscriminately in the whole genome.",

It can be seen that, after 36 h culturing in galactose medium, the ratio of plasmid-free cells was observed to be nearly 100% (Table 1), which was higher than that obtained using Cre/loxP in yeast Pichia (65%) [29]. Thus, the engineered yeast strain could be applied to a new round of genome editing using the gRNA vector (based on P426-CL) targeting another gene of interest (knock-in or knock-out). Ryan et al. [30] reported a scarless and marker-free genome editing method based on CRISPR-Cas9 in S. cerevisiae. However, the plasmid that coexpresses the Cas9 endonuclease and guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassette will still be remained in the host cell, and the selection marker on the plasmid could not be recycled. In the study of Stovicek et al. [31], researchers focused on the development of the genetic manipulation on unrelated prototrophic polyploidy S. cerevisiae strains with the efficiency ranging between 65% and 78%. Although it is claimed that marker-free recombinants were isolated through natural loss of plasmid, the loss efficiency was not stable and satisfactory. The high loss rate of P426-CL under galactose induction gave us a guarantee on the recyclable CRISPR/Cas9 system.

            "text": "Improving the editing efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas system, especially the multiplexed genome engineering efficiency, is beneficial for expanding its application in synthetic biology. Thus, this is a primary focus area for researchers developing novel CRISPR/Cas systems. Multiple editing technologies of CRISPR/Cas have been developed for a wide range of conventional industrial microbes, including E. coli, Streptomyces avermitilis, and Bacillus subtilis (Banno et al., 2018;Zhong et al., 2019;Yu et al., 2020). For instance, by requiring a separate promoter/terminator for each sgRNA transcription unit (Figure 3D), Banno et al. achieved the simultaneous editing of six genes in E. coli with an efficiency of 87.5% (Banno et al., 2018). Similarly, Zhong et al. achieved the simultaneous base editing of five (60% efficiency) and nine genes (efficiency not shown) in Streptomyces avermitilis (Zhong et al., 2019). Moreover, Yu et al. achieved the simultaneous editing of 3-4 genes in Bacillus subtilis, with efficiencies of 100% and 50%, respectively (Yu et al., 2020). In conclusion, this strategy enables high efficiency and wide application in multiplexed base editing, despite shortcomings such as large structure, repeated sequences, and unstable plasmids. Another alternative method can be found in the original CRISPR/ Cas system, wherein multiple spacers and repeat sequences can be transcribed through the crRNA array via a promoter and terminator (Figure 3E). Li et al. (2020) applied CRISPR/ dCas12a and crRNA arrays in Corynebacterium glutamate to inhibit four genes of the lysine synthesis pathway concurrently by CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), whose inhibition exhibited an efficiency of over 90%. Bao et al. applied CRISPR/Cas9 and crRNA arrays to concurrently edit three genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Bao et al., 2015).",

            "text": "For example, in C. autoethanogenum, the initial attempt to express Cas9 under a native strong constitutive promoter was not successful, likely due to toxicity caused by its uncontrolled expression. Thus, a library of tetracycline-inducible promoter variants was screened, and the selected synthetic inducible promoter, IPL12, fine-tuned Cas9 expression, leading to an improved editing efficiency of > 50% [40]. Similarly, several well-known inducible promoters were screened for Cas9 expression in E. limosum, and the anhydrotetracycline-inducible promoter was adopted for the CRISPR-Cas9 system in E. limosum [44]. Following its initial exemplification in several clostridial species [80], a synthetic, theophylline responsive riboswitch has also been exploited for Cas9-based mutant generation and complementation studies in C. autoethanogenum [81]. For the latter, unique 24-nucleotide \"bookmark\" sequences were incorporated into the mutant allele that acted as guide RNA targets during subsequent CRISPR-Cas9-mediated replacement with the complementing wildtype allele. \n\nGeneral bottlenecks for applying CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria are the requirements of DNA cleavage, HR, and donor DNA. This renders its application even more difficult for acetogens, which are recalcitrant to foreign DNA uptake and have low recombination efficiencies [40,41,44,45]. Recently, an advanced genome editing tool at a one-nucleotide resolution, namely base editing, has been developed to circumvent these bottlenecks and was demonstrated in C. ljungdahlii [43]. This tool utilizes catalytically deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) fused with cytidine deaminase to generate cytosine-to-thymine substitutions. It requires only a gRNA cassette for targeting, without the need to induce lethal DSBs and offering donor DNA for recombination.",

            "text": "The traditional gene manipulation tools such as Cre-loxP system can improve the genome editing efficiency to some extent, but these systems can only modify single locus in one step, and the marker recycling is time-consuming and left many scars in genome, which is not conducive to genomic stability (Xie et al., 2014). Moreover, the natural homologous recombination (HR) depends on a DNA break which occurs accidentally at the target locus (Raschmanov\u00e1 et al., 2018). In the last few decades, several new, better, and more accurate genetic tools have been developed to improve the efficiency of genome editing, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) (Doyon et al., 2011) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENS) (Li et al., 2011). The targeting of specific DNA sequences by ZNFs and TALENs depends on the protein-DNA interaction, and then the DNA break is introduced by FokI. However, the construction of specific DNA binding proteins is still a laborious and time-consuming task. \n\nRecently, the CRISPR/Cas system has revolutionized genome editing technology due to its efficiency, accuracy, and convenience (Hsu et al., 2014). This system essentially comprises a DNA endonuclease (e.g. Cas9 or Cpf1) which can bind to the target DNA sequence by the guidance of sgRNA, and then generating DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), and later the repair mechanism including HR, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is activated (Zetsche et al., 2015;Burstein et al., 2017) (Figure 1A). The CRISPR/Cas system relies on the DNA-RNA recognition for inducing precise DNA cleavage, which is markerfree and capable of simultaneous multi-loci editing, thus greatly accelerates the genome editing. \n\nThe genome-editing system mediated by CRISPR/Cas has already been widely employed in the genetic engineering of non-conventional yeasts and promoted the biotechnological development of these yeasts.",

In addition, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was discovered in bacteria or archaea, and therefore, the Cas9-encoding gene usually needs to be fungal codon-optimized and a nuclear localization signal when the genome editing system is used in fungi (Generoso et al., 2016;Nodvig et al., 2018). In recent years, some studies have shown that the CRISPR/Cas9 technique has been used in the production of recombinant proteins in the Aspergilli species (Dong et al., 2020;Rojas-Sanchez et al., 2020). \n\nTo develop the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technique in A. oryzae, plasmids that express the Cas9 nuclease gene and sgRNAs were constructed and introduced into an A. oryzae strain for the mutagenesis of target genes (Katayama et al., 2016). In this study, the codon usage of cas9 with a sequence encoding an SV40 nuclear localization signal at its 5 -and 3 -ends was optimized to improve the nuclear localization of Cas9 nuclease. The generated transformants contained mutations in which each target gene showed the expected phenotype. Mutation rates between 10 and 20% with 1 bp of deletion or insertion are the most common induced mutations, and genome editing technology will contribute to the efficient use of targeted mutagenesis in many A. oryzae industrial strains without a clear genetic background. To further improve the targeting efficiency in A. oryzae industrial strains, the ligD gene involved in NHEJ was mutated by employing the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Nakamura et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Serum IgG in both yeast expressing OVA-CPE (pIP-FG1 construct) and yeast expressing OVA (pIP-FG2 construct) groups was significantly higher than control groups (PBS and yeast only). Fecal IgA was higher in pIP-FG1 group in comparison to pIP-FG2 and the control groups ( * P < 0.05, * * * P < 0.001). \n\nto knock out the ura3 gene activity. CRISPR/cas9 methodology is a simple, reliable, and cheap method of genome editing. It promotes the sequence-specific dsDNA breaks, followed by repair via non-homologous end joining or homologous recombination. This method is particularly efficient when the host contains more than one copy of the target gene (Wilkinson and Wiedenheft, 2014). Zhang et al. (2014) have constructed a quadruple auxotrophic mutant of S. cerevisiae using RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease. Recently, Liu et al. (2016) have used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to create a triple auxotroph of S. boulardii used in metabolic engineering. \n\nTo drive the transcription of expression cassettes, three different promoters, GAL-1, transcriptional elongation factor EF-1\u03b1 (Tef-1), and phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk-1) were used. Our expression experiments showed that S. cerevisiae (BY4742) but not S. boulardii CNCM I-745 (Yomogi R ) is able to express OVA when Gal-1 promoter is used. This finding is in agreement with other studies that demonstrated the lack of galactose utilization by S. boulardii (Mitterdorfer et al., 2001). Using two other promoters, Tef-1 and Pgk-1, our target protein was successfully expressed and secreted into the culture medium. These promoters have been examined before, and it has been shown that Tef-1 promoter had stronger activity in both glucose-consuming and glucose-exhausted phases compared to Pgk-1 promoter (Partow et al., 2010).",

However, compared to traditional hosts like Escherichia coli or yeast, only basic genetic tools exist for gas-fermenting acetogens. To advance the process, a robust genetic engineering platform\u00a0for acetogens is essential.ResultsIn this study, we report scarless genome editing of an industrially used model acetogen, Clostridium autoethanogenum, using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Initial efforts to retrofit the CRISPR/Cas9 system for C. autoethanogenum resulted in poor efficiency likely due to uncontrolled expression of Cas9. To address this, we constructed and screened a small library of tetracycline-inducible promoters that can also be used to fine-tune gene expression. With a new inducible promoter, the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated desired gene deletion in C. autoethanogenum was improved to over 50\u00a0%, making it a viable tool for engineering C. autoethanogenum.ConclusionsAddition of both an inducible promoter library and a scarless genome editing tool is an important expansion to the genetic tool box of industrial C. autoethanogenum strain.",

            "text": "CRISPR/Cas9 has become the most popular approach in recent years. In CRISPR/Cas9 system, the effector (Cas9) is activated and targeted to specific genomic loci by forming a complex with CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) or a single guide RNA that merged from the crRNA and tracrRNA (Jinek et al., 2012;DiCarlo et al., 2013;Mans et al., 2015). Moreover, the development of Cas9 protein variants and the availability of mutually orthogonal Cas9 proteins have greatly maximized its functions and applications (Lian et al., 2017(Lian et al., , 2018a;;Si et al., 2017). In a word, remarkable improvements in the effectiveness and scope of CRISPR/Cas9 system have made it powerful and versatile for almost all possible genetic manipulations needed for constructing microbial cell factories. Due to its countless applications, two scientists who pioneered the CRISPR technology won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020 1 . \n\nThis review mainly focused on the latest advances of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in the model yeast S. cerevisiae. Special attention was paid to examples in four application areas: flexible and precise genetic manipulation, multiplexed editing, transcriptional regulation, and genome-scale engineering/screening. Finally, perspectives on the challenges and opportunities were discussed and highlighted.",

            "text": "CRISPR/Cas9-based tools are considered revolutionary and versatile platforms for genetic manipulations and synthetic biology. This review summarized recent developments and applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in the construction and optimization of S. cerevisiae cell factory. However, these tools still have some limitations and challenges. \n\nThe design and expression of gRNAs is a crucial factor severely affecting editing efficiency between genes. One possible reason could be the formation of secondary structures of gRNAs (Thyme et al., 2016). Usually, several gRNAs should be tested for a new target; however, verifying the target efficiency of each gRNA is a time-consuming process. The predictable accuracy needs further improvement. Some software, websites, rules, and algorithms have been established, for example, Zhang Lab Guide Design Resources2 , CRISPR direct3 (Naito et al., 2015), CHOPCHOP (Montague et al., 2014), and yeast proprietary gRNA tool4 . \n\nAnother key problem limiting further applications of the CRISPR system is the yeast transformation efficiency, especially for multisite integration and genome-scale engineering. A large size and an increased number of adopted donor DNAs might reduce the likelihood to simultaneously enter the cells, thus limiting the use of repair templates for gene editing. It was also revealed that the integration efficiency facilitated by CRISPR could be enhanced if more donor DNA could enter the cells (Shi et al., 2016a). The reported HI-CRISPR (Bao et al., 2015) and multiplexed accurate genome editing with short, trackable, integrated cellular barcodes (MAGESTIC) (Roy et al., 2018) both linked HDR donors with gRNA cassette in one plasmid, providing a useful strategy to facilitate DNA delivery at high efficiency. \n\nThe currently adopted activation domain for CRISPRa could only provide a limited activation compared with inducible promoter with upregulated strength up to 1,000-fold (Lian et al., 2018b). Hence, a more efficient activation domain should be screened or engineered, or a novel strategy should be developed to activate genes. \n\nDespite the limitations, the development of the CRISPR system has undoubtedly created a new era for genomic manipulation.",

            "text": "Microbial biofuel and bioproduct platforms provide access to clean and renewable carbon sources that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly than petroleum-based carbon sources. Furthermore, they can serve as useful conduits for the synthesis of advanced molecules that are difficult to produce through strictly chemical means. R. toruloides has emerged as a promising potential host for converting renewable lignocellulosic material into valuable fuels and chemicals. However, engineering efforts to improve the yeast\u2019s production capabilities have been impeded by a lack of advanced tools for genome engineering. While this is rapidly changing, one key tool remains unexplored in R. toruloides: CRISPR-Cas9. The results outlined here demonstrate for the first time how effective multiplexed CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption provides a framework for other researchers to utilize this revolutionary genome-editing tool effectively in R. toruloides. ABSTRACT Microbial production of biofuels and bioproducts offers a sustainable and economic alternative to petroleum-based fuels and chemicals. The basidiomycete yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides is a promising platform organism for generating bioproducts due to its ability to consume a broad spectrum of carbon sources (including those derived from lignocellulosic biomass) and to naturally accumulate high levels of lipids and carotenoids, two biosynthetic pathways that can be leveraged to produce a wide range of bioproducts. While R. toruloides has great potential, it has a more limited set of tools for genetic engineering relative to more advanced yeast platform organisms such as Yarrowia lipolytica and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Significant advancements in the past few years have bolstered R. toruloides\u2019 engineering capacity. Here we expand this capacity by demonstrating the first use of CRISPR-Cas9-based gene disruption in R. toruloides. Transforming a Cas9 expression cassette harboring nourseothricin resistance and selecting transformants on this antibiotic resulted in strains of R. toruloides exhibiting successful targeted disruption of the native URA3 gene. While editing efficiencies were initially low (0.002%), optimization of the cassette increased efficiencies 364-fold (to 0.6%). Applying these optimi",

Engineering Cas9 Moreover, a grade modulation of genetic expression was reported by Deaner and Alper [58]. The range of genetic expression was related to the proximity of dCas9-based regulators to the core of the promoter. The grade modulation applicability represents a step forward to enable a fine tuning of metabolic pathways in S. cerevisiae. The possible applications of CRISPRi/a are massive, and they have already been used to improve a yeast cell factory to produce \u03b2-amyrin [71]. \n\nAnother possible approach, besides the use of a modified CRISPR protein, to guide effector molecules without creating a DSB, is by adjusting the gRNA molecule length. Truncated gRNAs, usually of 14 nt, proved to be able to guide the binding of Cas9 to the target sequence without the introduction of a DSB [72,73]. Hereupon, truncated gRNAs can be used for transcriptional regulation and, simultaneously, full-length gRNAs can be used for genome editing using a single Cas9 protein. This feature allowed researchers to develop multifunctional systems capable of one-pot CRISPRi, CRISPRa, or CRISPR editing. Lian et al. [74] reported the first trifunctional CRISPR system for simultaneous gene inactivation, activation, and editing in S. cerevisiae using truncated gRNAs for CRISPRa and CRISPRi, called CRISPR-AID. However, to avoid competition between gRNAs for the same Cas9 protein, three different PAM-recognizing CRISPR proteins were used. More recently, Dong et al. [59] established a trifunctional CRISPR system using a single Cas9 protein. \n\nThe system was named CRISPR-ARE and employed the use of a Cas9 fused to a VP64-p65-Rta (VPR) activation domain. The authors demonstrated the applicability of CRISPR-ARE by optimizing \u03b1-santalene biosynthesis.",

During the last two decades, in industrial settings, yeast has been the attractive host for genetic manipulations to produce molecules such as hybrid bioethanol, butanol, lactic acids, artemisinin, etc. [3][4][5][6][7]. Despite its wide use, challenges as well as more room for improvement remain in yeast engineering to achieve higher yields of existing products and obtain new products [8]. Advances in targeted genome manipulation tools for precise genome editing over the past few decades have revealed more significant opportunities for further improvements in cellular metabolic engineering. In this aspect, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) brought about a paradigm shift in genome editing with features such as high efficiency, accuracy, integrity, convenience, and cost-effectiveness [9]. \n\nCRISPR-Cas is an RNA-dependent tool for targeted genome editing that creates a double-strand break in DNA [10,11]. A synthetic single-stranded RNA (about 105 bases of single-stranded nucleotide) called guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 protein isolated from the Streptococcus pyogenes are the main two components of the CRISPR-Cas system. The gRNA binds the Cas9 protein to guide it to dock at the target-specific recognition site upstream of the genome's protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). Then, the Cas9 protein, which is an endonuclease, makes specific double-strand breaks (DSBs) three nucleotides before the PAM site. The double-strand break is repaired by Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Dependent Recombination (HDR).",

To this end, genome editing and expression control are performed by recruiting a series of genetic tools, including RecA-, Red-based homologous recombination, zincfinger nucleases (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) [1], transposon mutagenesis [2], RNA interference (RNAi) [3] and antisense RNA approaches [4]. Implementation of these approaches is laborious and time-consuming compared to the prevailing CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The emergence of CRISPR-Cas9 tools has augmented our ability to sculpt the genome and program the gene expression of model industrial microorganisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae [5]and Escherichia coli [6]. However, the growing interest in other microorganisms, whereby genome editing options remain limited, necessitates further research and development of such engineering tools. In this review, we portray a picture of CRISPR-Cas9-based tools for genome editing and transcription regulation of both model and non-model microbes. Additionally we propose strategies for further improvement and expansion of these tools toward overproduction of desired chemicals.",

However, problems such as toxicity of Cas9 and off-target effect restricts its exploitation in new microorganisms. \n\nIn order to more efficiently apply the CRISPR-Cas9 system to bacteria based on the foregoing basic introduction, this article introduces the mechanism and application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, this review details how to optimize CRISPR-Cas9 as genome editing tools, including but not limited to how to reduce off-target effects and Cas9 related Fig. 1.

            "text": "CRISPR genome editing in yeast typically involves transforming plasmids expressing the active Cas9 gene and a guide RNA (gRNA) along with the donor template (DiCarlo et al., 2013;Roy et al., 2018). Here we describe several practical considerations for performing successful CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing experiments in yeast, including optimizing gRNA design, expression, and delivery as well as expressing Cas9 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also provide an overview of several plasmid systems that have been developed to express Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 or other CRISPR enzymes in yeast, along with their corresponding gRNA. Moreover, we discuss how to overcome limitations in Cas9 targeting by using alternative Cas proteins. Typically, genome editing experiments, introduce both gRNA and Cas9 into yeast cells as either low copy (~1-4 copies per cell) or high copy (~30-60 copies per cell) plasmids, or through integration into the genome (Karim et al., 2013;Stovicek et al., 2017;Lian et al., 2018) (Figures 4,5). \n\nThe most common approach for gRNA design utilizes a chimeric single guide RNA (sgRNA), which fuses the targeting crRNA element with the activating tracrRNA element of the dual gRNA system employed by CRISPR systems in bacteria (Jinek et al., 2012). These sgRNAs allow for the formation of a stable complex with Cas9 endonuclease that is primed for DNA targeting (Jiang et al., 2015). Expression of an sgRNA in yeast typically is achieved by transcription of the sgRNA gene from an RNA polymerase III (Pol III) promoter, since using Pol III avoids transcript cleavage and polyadenylation associated with RNA polymerase II transcription, which would be detrimental to sgRNA function, and because Pol III promoters transcribe small RNAs at high levels (Kabadi et al., 2014).",

However, these systems are hindered by complicated development and limited applications. Thus, further development and optimization of CRISPR/Cas systems is needed. Here, we briefly summarize the mechanisms of different types of CRISPR/Cas systems as genetic manipulation tools and compare their features to provide a reference for selecting different CRISPR/Cas tools.

To overcome this, a CRISPR/nCas9 (D10A) system was developed as a rapid and precise genome editing tool for L. casei [59]. Effective single-gene deletions and insertions were achieved in 9 days, contributing to the fast and accurate genome editing of L. casei. \n\nIn E. coli, the CRISPR/nCas9 system could be used to form non-lethal single-strand nicks, conduct precise editing of targeted genes, and successfully delete genomic fragments with a size from 36 to 96 kb. Moreover, multiple targeting was used to delete 133 kb [17]. Researchers used the CRISPR/nCas9 and HDR systems to achieve genome editing in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC Sp dCas9 E. coli CRISPRi (1000-fold repression) [24] Sp dCas9 E. coli CRISPRi (10-fold repression) [21] Sp dCas9 E. coli CRISPRi [22] Sp dCas9 E. coli CRISPRi, investigation of gene function [68] 824 and Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052, with the highest efficiency reaching 100% [60]. \n\nIn Bacillus licheniformis, the CRISPR/nCas9 system was used to successfully delete the yvmC gene with a remarkable editing efficiency of practically 100%. However, the efficiency of simultaneously editing of two genes was only 11.6%. Nevertheless, the efficiency of largefragment deletion was 79.0%, and the insertion efficiency of the heterologous aprN gene for the expression of nattokinase reached 76.5% [61]. In Clostridium perfringens, application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system resulted in cell death. Nevertheless, the system was used to perform precise editing on the expected locus with an editing efficiency of over 95% [62].

            "text": "Then, the genetic editing started with cotransformation of donor DNA and gRNA plasmid into preceding cells. Comparing to the previously established system, this optimized system has a higher gene editing efficiency and less operating time, almost 100% for codon replacements and knockout genes within 2 days. It was noteworthy that using a double-strand DNA as a donor template has a better performance than a single-strand DNA in gene deletions. Subsequently, this optimized system was employed to strengthen the MEP pathway by substituting the promoters and ribosome binding sites, inserting a heterologous \u03b2-carotene biosynthetic pathway and optimizing the central carbon metabolism (Li et al., 2015). Finally, the best producer yielded 2.0 g/L \u03b2-carotene in fed-batch fermentation. This extensive work can hardly be completed without employing CRISPR-based tools, revealing their great potential for efficient and diverse manipulation of genomic DNA. The Cas9-recombineering method was further exploited with the development of the CRISPR-enabled trackable genome engineering (CREATE) tool (Garst et al., 2017). Application of this tool in E. coli allowed for simultaneous transformation of multiple libraries of plasmid-borne recombined templates (Garst et al., 2017). The CREATE strategy was employed to construct genome libraries of isopropanol pathway by introducing multiple ribosome binding site variations in E. coli, leading to the construction and testing of \u223c1,000 strains in a few days. The best performer reached a titer of 7.1 g/L isopropanol within 24 h (Liang et al., 2017). \n\nBesides the versatile applications in E. coli, the CRISPR-based tools also had satisfactory performances in other bacteria (Table 1). For instance, genetic engineering technologies for solventogenic Clostridium were still immature due to low transformation efficiency, inadequate endogenous homologous recombination, and poorly understood physiology and metabolism (Papoutsakis, 2008;Pyne et al., 2014;Bruder et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Efficient genome editing is a prerequisite of genetic engineering in synthetic biology, which has been recently achieved by the powerful CRISPR/Cas9 system. However, the toxicity of Cas9, due to its abundant intracellular expression, has impeded its extensive applications. Here we constructed a genetic cassette with triple controls of Cas9 activities at transcriptional, translational and protein levels, together with overexpression of the ATP synthase \u03b2-subunit AtpD, for the efficient genome editing in Streptomyces. By deletion of actII-ORF4 in Streptomyces coelicolor as a model, we found that constitutive expression of cas9 had about 90% editing efficiency but dramatically reduced transformation efficiency by 900-fold. However, triple controls of Cas9 under non-induction conditions to reduce its activity increased transformation efficiency over 250-fold, and had about 10% editing efficiency if combined with atpD overexpression. Overall, our strategy accounts for about 30-fold increased possibility for successful genome editing under the non-induction condition. In addition, about 80% editing efficiency was observed at the actII-ORF4 locus after simultaneous induction with thiostrepton, theophylline and blue light for Cas9 activity reconstitution. This improved straightforward efficient genome editing was also confirmed in another locus redD. Thus, we developed a new strategy for efficient genome editing, and it could be readily and widely adaptable to other Streptomyces species to improve genetic manipulation for rapid strain engineering in Streptomyces synthetic biology, due to the highly conserved genetic cassettes in this genus.",

The use of CRISPR-Cas9 to identify mutations that occur at low frequencies opens up the possibility to expand this selection approach to organisms with industrial and medical relevance with low efficiency engineering tools, including various lactobacilli and the majority of bifidobacteria. Also, our work combined with current developments in CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing makes the application of MAGE in lactobacilli and bifidobacteria tantalizing, yet not unreasonable (45,46). CRISPR-Cas9 may also complement more mainstream genetic approaches to engineer genomes, such as double crossover strategies to delete or insert genes. The protospacer may be designed such that only cells will be recovered if the deletion or insertion event has taken place, thereby eliminating unedited cells. Taken together, CRISPR-Cas9 selection combined with genetic engineering tools such as ss-DNA recombineering provides researchers with a toolset that widens the horizon of fine-tuned genome editing in a variety of organisms.",

            "text": "This system can be used to knock out LEU2, TRP1, URA3, and HIS3 in polyploid industrial yeast S. cerevisiae ATCC 4124 with efficiency of up to 60%, and a quadruple-deficient strain ( ura3, trp1, leu2, his3) was successfully constructed (Zhang et al., 2014). In order to further improve the genetic editing efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, the USER cloning technology was accordingly employed to assemble multiple sgRNAs in one plasmid for efficient gene disruption and promoter engineering of one to five target loci in one step (Jako\u010diunas et al., 2015a). This one-step maker-free genome editing approach achieved high efficiencies of 50-100% from single to quintuple edits. However, the low efficiency of cotransformation of gRNA plasmids and corresponding HR donors hindered largescale genome engineering applications (Lian et al., 2018). To solve this problem, a homology-integrated CRISPR (HI-CRISPR) system by fusing a 100-bp HR template to the 5 \u2032 end of the crRNA sequences was constructed, leading to 87% efficiency of multiplex knockout of CAN1, ADE2, and LYP1 (Bao et al., 2015). This HI-CRISPR system further improved the efficiency of multiplex genome editing and genomescale engineering. \n\nIn addition to gene knockout, the CRISPR/Cas9 system can also mediate gene insertion using the homologous arm of donor DNA to the target gene. To better control cellular levels of correctly folding sgRNA, HDV ribozyme was fused to the 5 \u2032 end of sgRNA to protect the 5 \u2032 end of the sgRNA from 5 \u2032 exonucleases. This HDV-gRNA expression strategy significantly increased the efficiency of multiplex genome editing in diploid yeast strains, in which the heterologous cellodextrin transporter (cdt-1) and endogenous \u03b2-glucosidase (gh1-1) were inserted.",

This has potentially limited its adoption in the biotechnological and pharmaceutical industry. Here, we present a MAD7 nuclease-based system for efficient and rapid genome engineering of E. coli cells with a special focus on reduced hands-on time and increased throughput, which are general requirements in an industrial research and development environment. \n\nWe demonstrate that the CRISPR-MAD7 system enables robust gene deletion and editing in E. coli (Figures 2-4). Using oligo or plasmid-encoded donor DNA, we achieve efficiencies ranging from 64 to 100%, approaching efficiencies reported for Cas9-based (ca. 85%-100% (Reisch & Prather, 2015)) and Cpf1-based genome editing (ca. 81%-100%, Yan et al., 2017) in E. coli. Lower efficiencies potentially result from different gRNA affinities to the respective loci or varying MAD7 processing efficiency of the direct repeats in the gRNA cassette. Testing alternative gRNAs for one locus might improve the efficiency if needed. Other explanations for low editing efficiency could be gene-specific editing propensities due to chromosome structure, locus position, or DNA methylation.",

Precise and maker free genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9 has shown great potential in synthetic biology and industrial biotechnology. To date, simultaneous multiple (locus or copy number) genetic editing and even accurate single base substitution have already accomplished in the model microbes such as S. cerevisiae, but lags behind in other non-conventional yeasts. Genome engineering in these non-conventional yeasts still relies on conventional genetic engineering tools. For example, the linearized plasmid was used to construct the de novo production pathway of monacolin J and lovastatin in K. phaffii [71], which is time consuming and limit the landscape for large scale genome modification. To overcome the obstacles, various CRISPR-Cas9 systems have been established and optimized for genome engineering by enhancing the HR process and developing more credible gRNA promoters, etc. Though the efficiency is still much lower than S. cerevisiae, the strategies or ideas that were developed in S. cerevisiae could shed light for optimizing the CRISPR-Cas9 systems in nonconventional yeasts. We believe that the genome editing system will be further refined and facilitate the creation of the desired phenotypes in non-conventional yeasts for industrial bioprocess. \n\n\u2022 fast, convenient online submission \u2022 thorough peer review by experienced researchers in your field \u2022 rapid publication on acceptance \n\n\u2022 support for research data, including large and complex data types \u2022 gold Open Access which fosters wider collaboration and increased citations maximum visibility for your research: over 100M website views per year",

            "text": "Since the initial finding of the mysterious repeats of the CRISPR array in E. coli in 1987 and in many other bacteria in 2000 [71,72,81], CRISPR/Cas9 has been shown  to target DNA specifically in vitro resulting in DSBs [82,83]. This led to the first reports of genome editing in eukaryotic cells in 2013 [84,85], and then, an explosive number of reports followed [79] (Table 2). The advantages of the CRISPR system for genome editing reside in the effector nucleases, for which the nucleases do not require the tedious and labor-intensive cloning of DNA binding domains for targeting specificity. In contrast to the predecessor nucleases ZFN and TALEN, the DNA specificity of CRISPR nucleases is provided by a guide RNA composed of crRNA and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), which were further simplified by the sgRNA [7]. This simple design and preparation of CRISPR enables multiplexed mutagenesis by simply adding up sgRNAs [86,87]. In addition, CRISPR nucleases appear to be more efficient and more precise compared to predecessors [88]. \n\nAnother advantage of CRISPR is the diverse nucleases which can be customized for individual needs. Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) was initially used for CRISPR-mediated genome editing in animal cells [82,83]. Lately, nucleases including CRISPR from Prevotella and Francisella 1 (Cpf1) and CRISPR from Campylobacter jejuni (CjCas9) have been introduced for genome editing with improved efficiency and specificity [41,89,90]. New class 2 CRISPR systems are being reported, and the number is increasing [74], and different types of nucleases will offer customization of the editing technique for individual research projects. \n\nBest of all, CRISPR appears to be most efficient in microalgal genome editing based on the number of papers reported so far, even though it debuted last in the genome editing field (Table 2).",

            "text": "Overexpression of the fusion protein enables observation of the protein in cells, but overproduction may lead to artifacts such as ectopic expression or dominant-negative effects. Recent methods based on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR allow for the knock-in of endogenous genes to achieve expression levels close to those observed endogenously. To knock-in GFP immediately after the start codon, we generated a SpRY-based CRISPR vector and donor DNA containing the GFP sequence and homology arms (Figure 5A). About half of the transformed cells exhibited bands \u223c700 bp larger than the parental strain when analyzed using mutation-detective PCR (Figure 5B), indicating that knock-in efficiency was high enough. However, when we tried to generate knock-in strains by combining the same donor DNA with other neighboring target sequence, we found that knock-in frequencies were less than 1%. Therefore, trying several target sequences is essential for the successful generation of knock-in strains. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR allows not only for knock-in of tag sequences but also the introduction of precise point mutations in the genome. When we transformed a CRISPR vector with ssODN, which contains substituted nucleotides in the middle of the sequence and 30-80 bp homology arms on each side (Figure 5C), PCR-positive nucleotide substitutions were observed in 6.8-97.7% of the clones. All clones were analyzed by sequencing to confirm correct knock-in and point mutation generation (Figures 5B,D). The use of several target sequences was also effective for obtaining the mutants, because efficiency depended on the position of the target sequence. \n\nGenome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 relies on the nuclease activity of Cas9. This limits its use in applications in which genetic perturbation needs to be controlled temporally; i.e., when it is desired to edit genes that induce strong side effects on growth or development. A drug-inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system allows for temporal control of genome editing. A doxycyclineinducible expression vector was constructed and high efficiency of expression induction was demonstrated in Dictyostelium (Veltman et al., 2009b).",

            "text": "The type II CRISPR-Cas9 system has been proven to be suitable for introducing various genome editing in B. subtilis, and was applied in the fields of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology [39]. Nevertheless, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing is still at the exploratory stage, especially because the necessary DSB caused by Cas9 may require longer incubation times for repair, or may even preclude the survival of cells after transformation with the CRISPR/Cas9 system. In this work, the alternative CRISPR/Cas9n-mediated genome editing system was established and characterized in B. subtilis, with the aim to overcome existing shortcomings of the classical CRISPR/Cas9 system. We, therefore, quantitatively compared and analyzed the effect of CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/Cas9n on editing efficiency. \n\nWe first systematically evaluated the ability of CRISPR-Cas9/Cas9n mediated gene editing to introduce various types of modifications including gene deletions, insertions and deletions of large-scale chromosomal regions (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3a, our system yielded at least 90% editing efficiency for 1-4 kb gene deletions with both CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/Cas9n. However, the efficiency for 6 kb and 8 kb gene deletions with Cas9 as editing tool decreased dramatically in our system. By contrast, the efficiency with Cas9n remained above 80%. The CRISPR/Cas9n system produced 98% correct 1 kb gene insertions and 92% 2 kb gene insertions, which was better than the results obtained with CRISPR/Cas9 (95% and 87%, respectively) (Fig. 3b). Moreover, the ability of the CRISPR/Cas9n system to introduce large genomic deletions was slightly better than that of CRISPR/Cas9 (Fig. 3c). Large DNA fragment deletions remain problematic with the traditional genome editing method. Recent large genomic deletion studies have reported low mutation efficiency [40] or were only feasible in specific strains containing antibiotic resistance markers [41].",

Bassalo et al. provided a recombination strategy based on the coupling of the CRISPR and \u03bb-red systems. They co-introduced a plasmid that containing Cas9 and a plasmid that containing \u03bb-red recombinase into E. coli, and found that Cas9 can work effectively in different genomic environments with \u03bb-red recombinase. Through this method, a 10 kb gene encoding the complete isobutanol production pathway can efficiently be labeled (less than 50%) in one day [79]. This powerful recombination ability makes rapid metabolic transformation of microorganisms a reality. Using this strategy, Cho et al. used CRISPR coupled with \u03bb-red quickly and efficiently knock out multiple genes in Streptomyces glutamine [29]. Therefore, this genomic engineering system strategy is generally applicable to the development of genomic engineering systems for other microorganisms. This genomic engineering system accelerates the pace of metabolic engineering of industrial strains. \n\nIn another work, Jiang et al. co-transformed donor DNA provided in fragments and sgRNAs contained in pTargetF into E. coli cells, using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to achieve various precision genome modification, including gene deletions and insertions, with a maximum efficiency of 100%. Multiple genes can be simultaneously edited, using this method so as to improve the efficiency of recombination while reducing the time and labor required for construction. Using this system they also successfully targeted Tatumella Citrea chromosome deletion with highest efficiency up to 100% [80].

            "text": "Traditional DNA editing techniques, such as transformation and deletion of genes by homologous recombination, have been readily feasible for many years in S. cerevisiae. The use of Cre recombinase or other recombination based approaches, like the 50:50 method [7], allow for marker recycling and performing delitti perfetti, leaving no foreign DNA in the yeast genome. Although such techniques are currently an important tool for synthetic biology, they are relatively time consuming and therefore not suitable for the introduction of whole heterologous metabolic pathways or deletions of several genes in a reasonably short time. In the last few years, new approaches like Zinc finger nucleases [8], Yeast Oligo-Mediated Genome Engineering (YOGE) [9], transcription activator like (TAL) effector nucleases [10] and the CRISPR-Cas system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) [11,12] have been developed for deleting or inserting genes and for controlling gene expression. The main advantages of these tools over traditional techniques lie in their efficiency, accuracy and speed. They all rely on site-specific endonucleases forming a double strand break that is repaired either with non-homologous end joining or homology-directed repair. The versatility of the methods stems from the ability to customize the DNA binding domains, allowing for site-specific genome editing. From the techniques mentioned, the use of CRISPR, together with the site specific Cas9 endonuclease, appears as the most promising tool for editing a genome at any number of different loci in a short time. Remarkably, DiCarlo et al. reported a close to 100% recombination efficiency of a linear dsDNA after transformation, together with a plasmid bearing the guiding RNA [11]. Similar approaches were already used for multiplex deletions of up to five genes [13,14]. Hence, the CRISPR/Cas9 tool makes the use of marker-flanked integration cassettes obsolete and paves the way for rapid and efficient genome editing.",

            "text": "PAM-containing sequences were edited in Bacillus subtilis [53] and Lactobacillus luteri [54]. The co-expression of bacteriophage \u03bb derived red-recombinase highly improved the genome editing efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated negative selection [26,[55][56][57]. Another Rac prophagederived RecT-mediated ssDNA recombineering approach also improved genome editing efficiency in C. glutamicum [51] and Lactobacillus plantarum [58]. Impairing the interaction between primase and replisome boosts ssDNA loading on the replication fork, thus improving recombination efficiency in the dnaG mutant of E. coli [59]. In Clostridium beijerinckii, a two-step single nucleotide modification method was established using artificial PAM or protospacers [60]. Similarly, alterations in the original protospacer achieved using artificial sequences were reverted back to the original sequences via point mutation [61]. \n\nVarious CRISPR systems have been discovered since their discovery and widespread adoption, which are generally divided into two classes and six types. Among them, the CRISPR/Cas12a system has a single polypeptide nuclease similar to Cas9, which can only induce DSBs in the target DNA when a crRNA is present. Therefore, both CRISPR/Cas12a and CRISPR/Cas9 have similar performances and applications [62]. This system is now generally referred to as Cpf1 (CRISPR from Prevotella and Francisella 1). Using a C. glutamicum industrial strain, 2 bp substitutions were introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and Cpf1 negative selection with a nearly 100% editing efficiency [63]. Similarly, 2 to 3 bp substitutions were also introduced in E. coli, Yersinia pestis, and Mycobacterium smegmatis with editing efficiencies of up to 90% [55].",

            "text": "E. coli is one of the most widely used host organisms for microbial cell factories and synthetic biology applications [86,87,[106][107][108]. In the past, a large number of tools have been established to edit genomic sequences to knock-in or knock-out genes, which are primarily based on homologous recombination-based systems (e.g., \u03bb-Red, Cre-lox, and FLP-FRT). To expand the capacity of such systems to large-scale genomic editing that can efficiently modify multiple genomic loci, multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) and conjugative assembly genome engineering (CAGE) have been developed [109,110]. While these tools greatly improved our capability to edit E. coli genome, they often require the expression of selection markers in the genome or need either screening or genome sequencing to identify the desired clone. In addition, a number of tools to control endogenous gene expression levels without modifying the genome are also available in E. coli. For example, zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) and antisense RNAs can be designed to mostly turn down expression [111,112]. However, these tools often require the introduction of heterologous sequence to the genome and thus leave scars, or have limited design consensus [113]. \n\nAlthough tools in E. coli is relatively abundant compared to many other host organisms, CRISPR-Cas still greatly propels our capability to engineer E. coli. Such capabilities have largely facilitated metabolic engineering and proved to improve the titers, productivities and yields for various chemicals. Compared to the previously available tools, CRISPR-Cas-based systems have a few advantages that have been exploited in various applications. First, CRISPR-Cas system is highly efficient in cleaving the target sequence and thus can be combined with \u03bb-Red recombineering to achieve precise, efficient, and marker-free editing. For example, Jiang et al. developed a two-plasmid system that allowed iterative genome editing of multiple targets and curing of the plasmids after completion [114]. These systems saved the efforts to recycle selection markers and enable multiple modifications to be introduced simultaneously, thus greatly improved the engineering throughput.",

They further showed that Cas9-directed DNA double stranded breaks greatly improved HR-mediated insertion of donor DNA [51]. Such single-target Cas9-mediated genetic knockouts are now used routinely in yeast, for instance to improve bioethanol production processes [8,52]. CRISPR/Cas9 has also been used to generate genomewide knockout libraries in S. cerevisiae. For instance, the homology directed-repair-assisted genome-scale engineering (CHAnGE) method, developed for targeted mutation, was validated by generating a large deletion collection that was screened for furfural tolerance [53]. CRISPR-Cas techniques can also be expanded to simultaneously targeting multiple genes in one experiment. For instance, a sgRNA-tRNA array allowed editing of up to 8 genes at a time with 87% efficiency in yeast [11].",

            "text": "Efficient genome editing is a prerequisite of genetic engineering in synthetic biology, which has been recently achieved by the powerful CRISPR/Cas9 system. However, the toxicity of Cas9, due to its abundant intracellular expression, has impeded its extensive applications. Here we constructed a genetic cassette with triple controls of Cas9 activities at transcriptional, translational and protein levels, together with over-expression of the ATP synthase \u03b2-subunit AtpD, for the efficient genome editing in Streptomyces. By deletion of actII-ORF4 in Streptomyces coelicolor as a model, we found that constitutive expression of cas9 had about 90% editing efficiency but dramatically reduced transformation efficiency by 900-fold. However, triple controls of Cas9 under non-induction conditions to reduce its activity increased transformation efficiency over 250-fold, and had about 10% editing efficiency if combined with atpD overexpression. Overall, our strategy accounts for about 30-fold increased possibility for successful genome editing under the non-induction condition. In addition, about 80% editing efficiency was observed at the actII-ORF4 locus after simultaneous induction with thiostrepton, theophylline and blue light for Cas9 activity reconstitution. This improved straightforward efficient genome editing was also confirmed in another locus redD. Thus, we developed a new strategy for efficient genome editing, and it could be readily and widely adaptable to other Streptomyces species to improve genetic manipulation for rapid strain engineering in Streptomyces synthetic biology, due to the highly conserved genetic cassettes in this genus.",

Homology directed DNA recombineering in E. coli can be mediated by expression of the \u03bb-Red system, consisting of inducible expression of the phage \u03bb recombinase proteins exonuclease Exo, the ssDNA binding protein Bet and the host-nuclease inhibitor protein Gam and supply of donor DNA containing DNA sequences homologous to the genome integration site (Datsenko & Wanner, 2000). Combination of CRISPR-Cas9 and \u03bb-Red activity achieves highly efficient genome editing (Pyne et al., 2015;Ronda et al., 2016). \n\nThese tools are thus in principle ideal for optimizing strains for industrial applications, but are considered to be part of an increasingly complex intellectual property landscape (Ledford, 2022). An alternative to Cas9 are the members of the Cas12a family, which combine the DNA endonuclease activity with the advantages of an additional RNase activity to process their own guide RNA (gRNA) and a smaller protein size compared to Cas9. \n\nHere, we describe an efficient genome editing system for E. coli based on the Cas12a-like nuclease MAD7 in combination with a \u03bb-Red recombination system (Datsenko & Wanner, 2000). We characterize the system with different donor DNA formats (ssDNA and dsDNA) and realize different modifications of multiple gene loci. Finally, we combine the modular design of the system with state-of-the-art donor DNA assembly to introduce two glucose-uptake altering modifications, thereby creating an E. coli strain with improved plasmid production. Altogether, this approach provides a flexible genome editing system that enables fast and efficient genetic engineering to optimize E. coli strains.",

            "text": "Recent studies have developed two different CRISPR-Cas systems for genome editing: one utilizing Cfp1 (Cas12a) from Francisella novicida, and the other utilizing Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogens (Jiang et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2017). Both approaches resulted in large nucleotide sequences deletions and integrations and singlenucleotide exchanges were realized. Jiang et al. also achieved double-locus editing (Liu et al., 2017). However, this system still requires optimization concerning editing efficiencies. To improve the homologous repair activity CRISPR systems combined with the recombinase RecT system were successfully established (Cho et al., 2017;Wang B. et al., 2018;Li et al., 2021). The recombineering efficiency reached the highest efficiency reported of 13,250 transformed cells/10 9 viable cells (Li et al., 2021). The CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) technology for gene repression has been widely used with the nuclease deactivated dCas9 and dCfp1 (Cleto et al., 2016;Zhang et al., 2016;Liu et al., 2019;Li et al., 2020;G\u00f6ttl et al., 2021;Li et al., 2022a). Other synthetic biology tools for controlling gene expression through static and dynamic regulation have also been investigated in C. glutamicum (Yim et al., 2013;Shi et al., 2020). Many synthetic promoter libraries were also generated (Zhang et al., 2015;2018;Duan et al., 2021). To regulate the metabolic flux in real-time, dynamic regulatory systems were employed (Tan et al., 2020;Ferrer et al., 2022;Lai et al., 2022). Finally, C. glutamicum counts different genome-metabolic models developed to guide metabolic engineering targets by improving experimental design (Kjeldsen and Nielsen, 2009;Mei et al., 2016;Feierabend et al., 2021;Niu et al., 2022;Zhang et al., 2022).",

            "text": "Plasmids can be usefully observed in bacteria, but only in a few yeast species. Generally, an episomal plasmid was not considered as an optimal choice to express the heterologous genes because of segregational instability in non-selective conditions, but it is an excellent choice regarding the expression of Cas9 (Pena et al., 2018). However, episomal plasmids for heterologous gene expression and the CRISPR/Cas9 system for genome editing have not been well developed in P. pastoris (Gu et al., 2019a). Based on previous attempts to apply the CRISPR/Cas9 system in P. pastoris, Yang et al. (2020) developed a CRISPR/Cas9 system that contained episomal sgRNA plasmid, which reached 100% genome editing efficiency in 14.7% of sgRNA. High multicopy gene editing and stable multigene editing efficiency were obtained which did not exhibit a sharp decrease due to the multi-sgRNA expression cassette. Besides HR efficiency, the vector carrying sgRNA expression cassette could be eliminated easily, benefiting the editing of other genes (Yang et al., 2020). It is necessary to identify two genetic elements, namely, the centromere and the autonomously replicating sequence (ARS), to engineer a steady episomal plasmid in a microorganism without carrying a plasmid (Piva et al., 2020;Schultz et al., 2021;Gatjen et al., 2022). Several recently identified ARS enable maintenance of episomal plasmids and efficient expression of recombinant proteins (Camattari et al., 2016;Schwarzhans et al., 2017;Nakamura et al., 2018;Gatjen et al., 2022). For instance, the episomal plasmids can be maintained in P. pastoris by a 452 bp DNA sequence (pan ARS) recovered from Kluyveromyces lactis (Camattari et al., 2016). The presence of ARS activity was found in a short fragment (111 bp) of chromosomal centromere 2 (PpARS2) (Nakamura et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Few discoveries transform a discipline overnight, but biologists these days can manipulate cells in ways impossible before, thanks to a peculiar form of prokaryotic adaptive immunity mediated by CRISPR. Many delicate studies performed and make clear how these immune systems function in bacteria and convince researchers about the technological potential of Cas9, an RNA-guided DNA cleaving enzyme, in genome engineering.(92) Precise genome engineering in live cells at any locus promises to facilitate basic research and to enable personalized medicine. In particular, the latest development of the CRISPR-Cas9 system into a versatile and easy-touse editing tool (43) has been celebrated as a scientific breakthrough in the field. As genome engineering is adapted to clinical applications, a high level of precision, especially the avoidance of editing at sites other than the intended target, will be indispensable.(93) chronic myelogenous leukemia, or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) (17,18,101), as well as in mouse cells (17). The expected alterations in the target DNA were detected, indicating that site-specific DSBs by RNA-guided\n\nCas9 had stimulated gene editing by non-homologous end joining repair or gene replacement by HDR. Targeting with multiple sgRNAs, also referred to as multiplexing, was successfully achieved. (17,18) RNA-programmable Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9-mediated editing has now been applied to various human cells and embryonic stem cells. (1,49,98,(102)(103)(104)(105). Although direct comparisons can be inconvenient to assess because of differences in target sites and protein expression levels, some analyses display that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated editing efficiencies can reach 80% or more depending on the target, which is as high as or higher than the levels observed using ZFNs or TALENs. (104,106) Detailed characterization of the Cas9-guide complex and its interference mechanism in the past (38,107) has led to a revolution of CRISPR-based genetic engineering (108,109). The revolution includes directed recombination in bacteria (110,111), transcriptional activation and repression of synthetic regulons (112,113) and genome editing in",

            "text": "The recombinant expression of GFP that was inserted into the target expression vector made it possible to evaluate the effect of the vector protein expression visually. After the transformation of GFP, bright green fluorescence was observed in the Trichoderma mycelium under 488 nm excitation light. Thus, the exogenous donor DNA plasmid PUC19-eGFP was co-transformed with the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid to increase knockdown efficiency in this work, and its knockout rate of the Thpyr4 gene reached 100%. In this study, the simultaneous transformation of two plasmids (CRISPR/Cas9 and PUC19-GFP) could significantly improve the knockout efficiency (89.1%). 17.3% of mutants belonged to Cas9 nuclease sheared between the dual sgRNA, indicating that GFP inserts randomly in the T. hamatum T21 genome. The CRISPR/Cas9 system illustrated feasibility, practicability, and stability combined with the phenotypic characterization and molecular identification of \u2206Thpyr4 and \u2206Thpks1 mutants. In addition, with the advantage of counterselection using 5-FOA, Thpyr4 could be utilized as a bidirectional selection marker to resolve the antibiotic screening marker deficiency and achieve continuous multigene knockout in the fungus [48]. \n\nCompared with conventional knockout methods, the CRISPR/Cas9 system had the advantages of simple construction, a specific target, and high knockout efficiency. The primary factors affecting knockout efficiency included fungal individual characteristics, promoter strength, transformation approaches, the length of the homology arms, the sgRNA target sequence C/G content, and gRNA expression [49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57]. Knockout efficiency varied with different genes and targets using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in the same strain. Katayama et al. chose the U6 promoter in the CRISPR/Cas9 system with an editing efficiency of 10-20%, 10%, and 100% for WA, pyrG, and yA genes, respectively, in A. oryzae [58].",

            "text": "In the past decade, the emergence of novel genome editing technologies, such as ZNF, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas9, has dramatically changed the rate of progress in current biomedical science. In 2012, Jinek et al. [43] found that Cas9, which is a component of the CRISPR/Cas system, is a DNA endonuclease dependent on RNA, which generates site-specific double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). In 2013, several groups succeeded in genome engineering of mammalian cultured cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system [44,45]. This technique allows deletion and displacement of a specific DNA sequence with high efficiency and ease. The genome editing by the CRISPR/Cas9 system is much simpler and easier than ZNF and TALEN, and shows high efficiency. It enables the generation of knockout animals using fertilized eggs of any species without established ES cells.\n\nCRISPR was discovered as an acquired immunity system (i.e., an exclusion system for foreign DNA) in Eubacterium and Archaebacterium. The Cas9 protein forms a complex with gRNA that has a homology sequence of target DNA and induces a site-specific DSB. In the CRISPR/Cas9 system, it is only 20 bases in the gRNA of approximately 100 bases, which prescribe the target sequence of the DSB. Therefore, only 20 bases need to be changed for each target and all other base sequences and Cas9 are common. Additionally, the gRNA can be easily obtained from a manufacturing company. As a result of these reasons, the CRISPR/Cas9 system underwent rapid widespread use, even by inexperienced researchers, in molecular biology experiments as a genome editing tool.\n\nThe genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9 has potential benefits to not only generate knockout animals, but also produce knock-in animals by gene integration into specific DSB sites of host DNA when the donor ssDNA (subject genetic sequence including the homology arm of both sides) is added to gRNA and Cas9 mRNA or Cas9 protein at microinjection into embryos. The integration of donor DNA was limited to the small single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) and the insertion efficiency was low at first, but the integration rate of kb",

            "text": "The oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is a prominent subject of biorefinery research due to its exceptional performance in oil production, exogenous protein secretion, and utilization of various inexpensive carbon sources. Many CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing systems have been developed for Y. lipolytica to meet the high demand for metabolic engineering studies. However, these systems often necessitate an additional outgrowth step to achieve high gene editing efficiency. In this study, we introduced the eSpCas9 protein, derived from the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9(SpCas9) protein, into the Y. lipolytica genome to enhance gene editing efficiency and fidelity, and subsequently explored the optimal expression level of eSpCas9 gene by utilizing different promoters and selecting various growth periods for yeast transformation. The results demonstrated that the integrated eSpCas9 gene editing system significantly enhanced gene editing efficiency, increasing from 16.61% to 86.09% on TRP1 and from 33.61% to 95.19% on LIP2, all without the need for a time-consuming outgrowth step. Furthermore, growth curves and dilution assays indicated that the consistent expression of eSpCas9 protein slightly suppressed the growth of Y. lipolytica, revealing that strong inducible promoters may be a potential avenue for future research. This work simplifies the gene editing process in Y. lipolytica, thus advancing its potential as a natural product synthesis chassis and providing valuable insights for other comparable microorganisms.",

            "text": "The least expensive, simplest, and fastest protein expression can be achieved in Escherichia coli. Nonetheless, large proteins are difficult to be synthesized with this bacterium. Moreover, E. coli is not the best system for S-S-rich proteins that require post-translational modifications. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris are the most frequently used yeast species for the production of such proteins. At a low cost, yeast systems typically generate high protein yields as well as proteins with a molecular weight greater than 50 kDa, along with the extraction of signal sequences and stimulation of glycosylation. The baculovirus system can incorporate more complex post-translational protein modifications. Most commonly, mammalian cells are used for the production of recombinant mammalian glycosylated proteins. Genetically engineered animals secrete recombinant proteins in their milk, blood, or urine. Similarly, several recombinant proteins can be produced from transgenic plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana. \n\nThe effectiveness of expressing a recombinant protein in E. coli primarily relies on the ability to prevent unfavorable interactions between newly expressed polypeptides. These interactions lead to the aggregation of intermediate folding substances instead of native protein production [6][7][8]11]. System efficiency can be improved by maintaining conditions that stabilize intermediate folding and promote mature structure formation. Various strategies can help prevent the aggregation of proteins by masking the hydrophobic patches on their external surfaces [12,13]. Such strategies involve the introduction of chaperone molecules, incorporation of detergents, or co-expression of interacting sub-units involved in large complexes. When the conditions are designed to maintain the mono-dispersion of the folding intermediates, speeding up the folding cycle becomes essential for the production of stable native structures and prevention of the accumulation of metastable configurations that are potentially vulnerable to aggregation [14]. Foldases and isomerases may improve the folding process considerably. In this review, we focus on the solutions that are available for improving the bacterial expression of proteins that rely on the formation of disulfide bonds in their native state.",

            "text": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the most extensively used biosynthetic systems for the production of diverse bioproducts, especially biotherapeutics and recombinant proteins. Because the expression and insertion of foreign genes are always impaired by the endogenous factors of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and nonproductive procedures, various technologies have been developed to enhance the strength and efficiency of transcription and facilitate gene editing procedures. Thus, the limitations that block heterologous protein secretion have been overcome. Highly efficient promoters responsible for the initiation of transcription and the accurate regulation of expression have been developed that can be precisely regulated with synthetic promoters and double promoter expression systems. Appropriate codon optimization and harmonization for adaption to the genomic codon abundance of S. cerevisiae are expected to further improve the transcription and translation efficiency. Efficient and accurate translocation can be achieved by fusing a specifically designed signal peptide to an upstream foreign gene to facilitate the secretion of newly synthesized proteins. In addition to the widely applied promoter engineering technology and the clear mechanism of the endoplasmic reticulum secretory pathway, the innovative genome editing technique CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated system) and its derivative tools allow for more precise and efficient gene disruption, site-directed mutation, and foreign gene insertion. This review focuses on sophisticated engineering techniques and emerging genetic technologies developed for the accurate metabolic regulation of the S. cerevisiae expression system.",

Derived from the bacterial adaptive immune system, CRISPR-Cas9 has been repurposed for many functions, including CRISPRi (Fig. 1B), CRISPRa (Fig. 1C) [10,11] and protein imaging [60]. Presumably, Cas9 cleavage, CRISPRa, CRISPRi, or a combination thereof could generate diverse phenotypes beyond imagination. Likewise, novel applications of CRISPR-Cas9 tools may emerge owing to ongoing interdisciplinary studies. Among numerous applications reported to date, multiplex pathway engineering may largely facilitate strain engineering. Towards genome editing and global regulation, a gRNA array directs Cas9/dCas9 to target multiple chromosomal sites, and the targeted sites can be visualized due to labeled Cas9/ dCas9 [61]. More surprisingly, the CRISPR-Cas-driven gene flow may occur across various microbial communities [62]. This CRISPRdriven ecological engineering is of great attractiveness for all walks of biologists. Evidently, CRISPR-Cas9 tools allow genetic engineering at all scales. As the pace of CRISPR study accelerates and grows in complexity, we envision that microbial genomes could be completely reprogrammed and partial mutants may overproduce desired metabolites.

The CRISPR-Cas9 system enables the precise and simultaneous modification of any genomic region of the yeast to a desired sequence by altering only a 20-nucleotide sequence within the guide RNA expression constructs. However, the conventional CRISPR-Cas9 system has several limitations. In this review, we describe the methods that were developed to overcome these limitations using yeast cells. We focus on three types of developments: reducing the frequency of unintended editing to both non-target and target sequences in the genome, inducing desired changes in the epigenetic state of the target region, and challenging the expansion of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to edit genomes within intracellular organelles such as mitochondria. These developments using yeast cells to overcome the limitations of the CRISPR-Cas9 system are a key factor driving the advancement of the field of genome editing.",

They are widely utilized in the production of enzymes crucial for food processing, pharmaceuticals, commodity chemicals, organic acids, and biofuels (F\u00fcting et al., 2021;L\u00fcbeck and L\u00fcbeck, 2022). Their remarkable metabolic diversity and ability to thrive in diverse environments have made fungi indispensable workhorses for large-scale fermentations, and fungi have helped drive innovation in biotechnological applications within industrial processes. Employing genetic engineering to understand and modify filamentous fungi is pivotal for enhancing productivity and creating customized strains for diverse biotechnological applications. However, genetic modifications in fungi have been significantly hampered by the scarcity of genetic tools, with traditional genome editing predominantly relying on low-efficiency homologous recombination (HR) and constrained selectable marker availability (N\u00f8dvig et al., 2015). Hence, there is a growing demand for the development of versatile methods that enable more efficient, easier, and flexible genetic manipulation of filamentous fungi. \n\nThe development of the clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated nucleases (CRISPR-Cas) genome editing systems have significantly improved the efficiency of introducing desired mutations into the genome compared to previous genome-editing tools, thereby accelerating both fundamental research and the application of fungi in industrial biotechnology (Cong et al., 2013;Ouedraogo and Tsang, 2020). The CRISPR-Cas system forms a complex with a guide RNA (gRNA), directing the nuclease to the target DNA. The type II CRISPR-Cas9 system, derived from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9), is among the most extensively studied and widely utilized categories of CRISPR-Cas systems due to their efficiency and simplicity in genome editing (Adli, 2018).

            "text": "Finally, yeast can also carry out some posttranslational modifications. \n\nDespite all these advantages, reconstructing complex specialized pathways in yeast is still hindered by two major factors. First, there are a limited number of selection markers for yeast transformation. Selection markers can be recycled, but this is time consuming. Secondly, due to plasmid instability and imbalance, it is often difficult to achieve consistent levels of recombinant proteins in individual cells, which can lead to different degrees of toxicity and metabolic burden in each yeast cell (Da Silva and Srikrishnan, 2012). Thus, the integration of heterologous genes into the yeast genome is preferred for stable expression. Gene integration techniques in yeast, such as in vivo homologous recombination and pre-CRISPR endonucleases-based systems (e.g., I-SceI, HO endonuclease, ZFNs, and TALENs), have been extensively developed. These techniques have been reviewed in several excellent articles (Da Silva and Srikrishnan, 2012;David and Siewers, 2015;Yang and Blenner, 2020). However, these integration techniques are relatively laborious as they require selection markers, and there is limited availability of efficient integration sites. \n\nIn the past decade, the emergence of endonuclease-based techniques, especially clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and its associated protein 9 (Cas9), has revolutionized the field of genome editing. This elegant and simple technique has been applied in various organisms, such as human cells, zebrafish, plants, and S. cerevisiae (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014). The simplicity, efficiency, and flexibility of CRISPR/Cas9 have allowed for the expansion of its application to include multiple simultaneous genomeediting events, termed \"multiplexing\" (Mali et al., 2013).",

Genome editing to achieve marker free knock-outs and knock-ins is routinely performed by homologous recombination (HR). However, time-consuming mutant selection and chromosomal segregation in cyanobacteria is often a hurdle for efficient genetic engineering. Multiplexed engineering, together with multiplexed gene silencing, would be advantageous to speed up development of new strains, and this true potential of CRISPR-based editing for bacterial engineering has not yet been explored in cyanobacteria to the extent observed in other heterotrophs. CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR associated protein) based tools for genome editing have lately gained attention (Pattharaprachayakul et al., 2020). In early reports, CRISPR/Cas9 was used, and demonstrated to work in SynUTEX2973, Syn7942 and Syn6803 (Li et al., 2016;Wendt et al., 2016;Xiao et al., 2018). CRISPR/Cas12a (Cpf1) was introduced into the cyanobacteria genetic toolbox more recently due to the reported toxicity of Cas9 in cyanobacteria (Ungerer & Pakrasi, 2016). Cas12a has proven useful for multiple genome editing, in the unicellular model species Syn6803, SynUTEX 2973, Syn7942, in the filamentous Nostoc7120, and in the recently characterized fast-growing strain Syn11801 (Sengupta et al., 2020;Ungerer et al., 2018;Ungerer & Pakrasi, 2016).",

            "text": "For instance, genetic engineering technologies for solventogenic Clostridium were still immature due to low transformation efficiency, inadequate endogenous homologous recombination, and poorly understood physiology and metabolism (Papoutsakis, 2008;Pyne et al., 2014;Bruder et al., 2016). Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 for Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4, a hyper-butanol-producing strain, was developed. The genome engineering efficiency was improved from 20 to 75% by selecting optimized promoter P J23119 from E. coli for gRNA expression. After deleting two essential genes of phosphotransacetylase (PTA) and butyrate kinase (BUK) for acetate and butyrate production, the butanol production reached 19.0 g/L, which is one of the highest levels ever reported from batch fermentations (Wang et al., 2017). This Cas9-based editing tool could be easily adapted for use in closely related microorganisms, paving the way for elucidating the mechanism of solvent production and constructing robust strains with desirable butanol-producing features. In addition, the Cas9-based editing tools have also been successfully employed for the production of bulk chemicals, such as succinate in Synechococcus elongatus (Li et al., 2016), isopropanolbutanol-ethanol in Clostridium acetobutylicum (Wasels et al., 2017), and \u03b3-amino-butyric acid (GABA) in Corynebacterium glutamicum (Cho et al., 2017). The wide application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in a variety of bacteria genera demonstrates that it plays a critical role in the prosperous development of bioindustrial.

            "text": "metabolism.\n\nHowever, the low rate of HR in Y. lipolytica limits the capacity of this yeast for homology-mediated DNA repair during site-specific CRISPR gene editing. This drawback has been addressed by a MIT research team who improved the CRISPR/Cas9-based methods using tRNA processing for sgRNA production (pCRISPRyl and derivatives) by redesigning the tRNA-sgRNA fusion system through the use of secondary RNA structure prediction. This strategy for improved sgRNA expression resulted in a higher efficiency of CRISPR/cas9 gene editing at chromosomal loci for which it failed or was ineffective when using previous methods [273].\n\nIn addition to Cas9, Cpf1 (aka Cas12a) is another nuclease that can be applied to designing CRISPR tools. In contrast to Cas9, which uses naturally two short CRISPR RNA instead of an artificially designed sgRNA, Cpf1 is naturally a single RNA-guided endonuclease. Cpf1 recognizes a less frequent T-rich PAM (protospacer-adjacent motif), instead of a G-rich one for Cas9, and generates sticky ends DSB more distal to the recognition site. These characteristics are expected to allow a more reliably targeted, and possibly repeated, genome editing, which prompted the design of a CRISPR-Cpf1 system for Y. lipolytica editing at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (USA) [274]. This CRISPR-Cpf1 system allowed to perform indel NHEJ-based gene knocking-out with an efficiency in the range of 95% and multiplex editing with a mean efficiency of 79% for double targets and 42% for triple ones [274].\n\nWhatever the CRISPR tool used, the choice of sgRNA sequences remains a crucial step for successful gene editing (or transcriptional control). A study of the relative efficiencies of six candidate sgRNA sequences for each Y. lipolytica gene has recently been performed by a consortium of American laboratories, who constructed a library of sgRNAs targeting the 300 first nucleotides of 7854 ORFs from Po1f strain and measured their individual DSB-promoting efficiency in a CRISPR-Cas9 editing assay [275].

Here, we developed and optimized a CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted recombineering system to facilitate genetic manipulation in bacteria. Using this system, point mutations, deletions, insertions, and gene replacements can be easily generated on the chromosome or native plasmids in Escherichia coli, Yersinia pestis, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Because CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted recombineering does not require introduction of an antibiotic resistance gene into the chromosome to select for recombinants, it is an efficient approach for generating markerless and scarless mutations in bacteria. IMPORTANCE The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been widely used to facilitate genome editing in many bacteria. CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1), a new type of CRISPR-Cas system, allows efficient genome editing in bacteria when combined with recombineering. Cas12a and Cas9 recognize different target sites, which allows for more precise selection of the cleavage target and introduction of the desired mutation. In addition, CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted recombineering can be used for genetic manipulation of plasmids and plasmid curing. Finally, Cas12a-assisted recombineering in the generation of point mutations, deletions, insertions, and replacements in bacteria has been systematically analyzed. Taken together, our findings will guide efficient Cas12a-mediated genome editing in bacteria.",

            "text": "Sch. pombe is a unicellular organism whose genome structure resembles that of higher eukaryotes. But compared to budding yeast, genomic engineering is more challenging because of lower homologous recombination efficiency and a higher background of non-specific integration (32). Here, in our study, we successfully implemented the CRISPR-Cas12a system in fission yeast with editing efficiencies of 20-40% for a single target and 17% for two targets using the strong constitutive pol II fba1 promoter to drive crRNA designed to form deletion mutants ade6\u03940 and leu1\u03940. Our results demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas12a system is an efficient means of genome editing, such as gene deletion or integration. Yeast cells with functional gRNA and Cas9 or Cas12a plasmids usually cannot survive with low background because of chromosome cleavage, unless they are repaired by homologous recombination with donor DNA (12,40,43). But fission yeast spends a majority of time in the G2 phase, leading to a more challenging 'lifestyle' for efficient genome editing (55). It was reported that synchro- nizing cells in G1 phase increased CRISPR-Cas9 editing efficiency (44). \n\nThe editing efficiency of CRISPR mainly depends on gRNA sequence design, genomic target accessibility and locations (56)(57)(58). But determining functional gRNAs with predictable editing efficiency remains a big challenge, especially for the CRISPR-Cas12a system. Algorithms to evaluate and predict CRISPR-Cas12a activity with gRNAs were reported (59,60). Large scale and high throughput screening of possible gRNA sequences in vivo, combined with a predictive algorithm and machine learning are still highly desired. In our study, we designed gRNAs using the online tool CRISPOR with TTTV as the PAM for FnCas12a but still ended up with one gRNA targeting at leu1 that was non-functional (41). \n\nIn our study, we showed that endogenous pol II promoters can be used to express crRNA for Cas12a.",

Zymomonas mobilis is a highly efficient ethanol-producing bacterium with a small genome size and desirable industrial characteristics, which makes it a promising chassis for biorefinery and synthetic biology studies. While classical techniques for genetic manipulation are available for Z. mobilis, efficient genetic engineering toolkits enabling rapidly systematic and high-throughput genome editing in Z. mobilis are still lacking.ResultsUsing Cas12a (Cpf1) from Francisella novicida, a recombinant strain with inducible cas12a expression for genome editing was constructed in Z. mobilis ZM4, which can be used to mediate RNA-guided DNA cleavage at targeted genomic loci. gRNAs were then designed targeting the replicons of native plasmids of ZM4 with about 100% curing efficiency for three native plasmids. In addition, CRISPR\u2013Cas12a recombineering was used to promote gene deletion and insertion in one step efficiently and precisely with efficiency up to 90%. Combined with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), CRISPR\u2013Cas12a system was also applied to introduce minor nucleotide modification precisely into the genome with high fidelity. Furthermore, the CRISPR\u2013Cas12a system was employed to introduce a heterologous lactate dehydrogenase into Z. mobilis with a recombinant lactate-producing strain constructed.ConclusionsThis study applied CRISPR\u2013Cas12a in Z. mobilis and established a genome editing tool for efficient and convenient genome engineering in Z. mobilis including plasmid curing, gene deletion and insertion, as well as nucleotide substitution, which can also be employed for metabolic engineering to help divert the carbon flux from ethanol production to other products such as lactate demonstrated in this work. The CRISPR\u2013Cas12a system established in this study thus provides a versatile and powerful genome-editing tool in Z. mobilis for functional genomic research, strain improvement, as well as synthetic microbial chassis development for economic biochemical production.",

Decades of fundamental research, together with the development of high-throughput toolkits and genome engineering capacities, have established yeast as an ideal model eukaryote for system genetics and synthetic biology. 1 In addition, the availability of many selectable genetic markers and simple conversion between haploid and diploid forms has provided avenues to easily combine pairs of genetically engineered loci to understand gene-gene interactions at a global scale. 2 For more extensive genetic alterations, yeast's highly efficient homologous recombination (HR) pathway even enables the synthesis of entire chromosomes, although this approach requires iterative use of selection markers and tedious repetitive procedures. 3 Nonetheless, the ability to alter large contiguous segments of genomic loci has many applications, such as genome minimization, 4 multiplex genome editing, 5 and the total synthesis of the Mycoplasma and E. coli and yeast genomes using yeast HR. [6][7][8][9] Despite the progress in whole-genome engineering, editing intermediate numbers of independent genomic loci-greater than two and in discontiguous regions of the genome-still presents a significant challenge. While strategies exist for E. coli 10 (e.g., multiplex automated genome engineering), diploid MOTIVATION Engineering entire biological processes in yeast, controlled for expression and genomic context, is challenging due to inefficient homology-directed repair (HDR) using linear exogenous repair templates, often resulting in non-quantifiable readouts. Thus, an inability to obtain the edit can be attributed to inefficient HDR or inviable genotype. Therefore, accomplishing multiplexed and scalable genomic editing necessitates compatible technology. We developed a CRISPR-Cas9-based combinatorial genome editing method (MERGE) that facilitates a fitness-driven combination of all individual genetic edits, eliminating the need for selection markers while using a quantitative readout of colony-forming units. organisms such as yeast present the additional editing challenge of multiple alleles for each (independently assorting) genomic locus.

Both MEP pathway and central metabolic pathways were optimized in the engineered strain, and the final strain was cultured in fed-batch, yielding 2.0 g/L of \u03b2-carotene (Li et al., 2015). A set of genomic loci of Y. lipolytica have been identified for targeted marker-less integration using CRISPR/Cas9 (Schwartz et al., 2017). An automated platform for multiplex genome-scale engineering in S. cerevisiae has been also developed based on CRISPR/Cas9 (Si et al., 2017). Plasmid-based expression of production pathway has a problem of segregational or structural instability of plasmids, which becomes worse in case of inhibitory products to host cells. Moreover, expensive antibiotics is required to exert a selection pressure on host cells for prevention of plasmid loss, which increases a production cost. However, genome-based expression of production pathway could deliver stable and reproducible production with no use of antibiotics, which is important for mass scale production of industry. The top portion of MVA pathway was integrated into genomic loci of adhE and ldhA in E. coli, and atpFH genes were deleted to increase glycolytic rate. The genome-engineered strain exhibited both high productivity (\u223c1.01 g/liter/h) and yield (86.1% of theoretical yield) after 48 h of shaking flask culture (Wang J. et al., 2016).

            "text": "Guo et al. (2018) created hundreds of mutated stains for 315 poorly characterized open reading frames (ORFs) using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, of which 68 were found to be vital for growth. Jakociunas et al. (2018) combined error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Cas9-mediated genome integration for proteindirected evolution. The large mutagenized DNA fragments generated by error-prone PCR were integrated into the genome for creating millions of mutants without any bias in mutation frequency. Two mutant enzymes were found, resulting in the increased production of isoprenoids close to 11-fold. Because of its simplicity, flexibility, and high efficiency in knock-in, the CRISPR/Cas9 system enabled the rapid economic development of a high-throughput industrial yeast cell factory that usually required a lot of genomic integration manipulations. \n\nThe aforementioned cases showed high precision and accuracy in gene editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Table 1). However, it is initially difficult for the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce mutations at single-nucleotide resolution due to its off-target effects (O'Geen et al., 2015). Various strategies have been reported to increase the fidelity and specificity, including well-designed gRNAs (Wang and Coleman, 2019), mutants of Cas proteins (Hu et al., 2018), paired nCas or fCas complexes (Shen et al., 2014;Tsai et al., 2014), and deaminase-dependent strategy (Gaudelli et al., 2017;Tan et al., 2019). For example, a two-step strategy using the CRISPR/Cas9 system was demonstrated to seamlessly introduce 17 precise single mutations in S. cerevisiae (Biot-Pelletier and Martin, 2016). Recently, a novel single-nucleotide resolution editing tool was reported (named as CHAnGE) by combining HDR and the CRISPR/Cas9 system that enabled the rapid engineering of S. cerevisiae for improved tolerance to growth inhibitors (Bao et al., 2018). Meanwhile, Tan et al. (2019) adopted a deaminase-dependent strategy that could selectively edit a single cytidine at a specific position.",

Thus far, the CRISPR-Cas9 system is a powerful and revolutionary tool for genome editing.\n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely used for eukaryotic genomes but its applications in bacterial genomes were less studied. CRISPR/Cas9 system was firstly exploited for bacterial genomic editing by Jiang et al., the work was a huge breakthrough for microbial genomic editing, however, high editing efficiency in E. coli was not achieved [10]. Recently, researchers achieved very good results in development of Cas9 based gnomic editing techniques [10][11][12]16]. While these methods improved the genome editing techniques, some aspects could be further improved, such as editing efficiency, lab hours, convenience of usage and standard protocols. To tackle these problems, we started the work of development of a simple and fast method for bacterial genome editing with high efficiency. For this purpose, multi-plasmid system was experimented and found to be relatively laborious and time consuming. Low editing efficiency was observed with the plasmid/linear DNA system, especially with wild type and E. coli cell factory strains. This was probably due to their strong restriction systems which degrade the linear donor DNAs before integration into chromosome [17]. To avoid these drawbacks, our strategy was designed to edit genome with only one plasmid, which carried all functional parts to make the technique very easy and fast to practice and achieve high efficiency.",

            "text": "Engineering methylotrophic microbes for methanol biotransformation provides a great opportunity in expanding the bio-manufacturing blueprint other than biomass-derived bio-refinery (Duan and Gao, 2018;Zhou et al., 2018). O. polymorpha is such a eukaryotic microbe that has been recognized as an attractive host for protein expression and ethanol fermentation due to its thermotolerance and methanol assimilation (Manfra \u02dco-Netto et al., 2019;Olson et al., 2015). However, the lack of genetic tools, especially the low HR activity, makes it challenging in expanding its product portfolio other than proteins and ethanol by engineering cellular metabolism. Here we thus established an efficient genetic platform in O. polymorpha by optimizing the CRISPR-Cas9 system and recombination machinery engineering (rME). We demonstrated the possible regulation of HR activity and NHEJ strength in this yeast, and the precise genome editing in the engineered strain may further promote its application as a cell factory for the biosynthesis of valuable products from methanol. Our CRISPR-Cas9 system, composed of an integrated Cas9 protein and the optimized episomal gRNA expression vector, enabled the highest genome editing efficiency in O. polymorpha so far (Juergens et al., 2018;Numamoto et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2018). This system showed good convenience and time-saving pattern for extensive metabolic engineering due to the adoption of RNA pol II promoter with the aid of ribozyme and constant N6 sequence. Besides, we found that functional gRNA expression is very essential for guiding Cas9 toward targeting sites. In spite of the extensive adoption in S. cerevisiae and many other non-conventional yeasts (Cao et al., 2017;Horwitz et al., 2015;Mitsui et al., 2019;Nambu-Nishida et al., 2017;Schwartz et al., 2015) (Table 1), RNA pol III promoter failed to drive efficient gRNA expression, or no suitable RNA pol III promoter has been identified in O. polymorpha so far.",

            "text": "Two CRISPR systems were evaluated by introducing codon replacements in the PAM sequences. The results showed that single-point mutations could be introduced with near 100% efficiency using either CRISPR/Cas9 or CRISPR/Cas9n. However, increasing the number of target sites in the CRISPR/Cas9 system, significantly decreased the editing efficiency, with only 19.5% correct clones for three-point mutations. In contrast to CRISPR/ Cas9, the CRISPR/Cas9n system maintained a more desirable editing efficiency for multiplex genome editing, with 90% efficiency for two mutations and 49% efficiency for three mutations (Fig. 4b). \n\nWe employed the CRISPR/Cas9n methodology to overcome some deficiencies of the DSB approach and introduce multiplex mutations. To our best knowledge, the 49% observed in this study is the highest efficiency for simultaneous modulation of multiple genes on the chromosome in B. subtilis reported to date. Recently, a CRISPR/Cas9-facilitated multiplex pathway optimization technique was developed in E. coli, by co-expressing \u03bb-Red recombineering system and Cas9 system, which yielded 70% efficiency for modulating three target loci simultaneously [44]. However, a similar CRISPR/Cas9medited system could not achieve satisfying efficiency for multiplex pathway modification in B. subtilis. We inferred that the low efficiency of multiplex mutations is due to the comparatively inefficient HDR without expressing an exogenous recombination system and the low cell survival rate due to the multiple Cas9-induced DSBs. Furthermore, the low plasmid transformation efficiency of B. subtilis compared to E. coli is also a reason for the low multiplexing efficiency. The determination of the positions of the PAM sequences and design of gRNAs greatly influenced the efficiency of CRISPR-based modulation [33,45,46]. The expression of an exogenous recombination system and optimization of gRNAs may further boost the frequency of homologous recombination and thus contribute to the efficiency of CRISPR/ Cas9n mediated gene editing. In addition, regulation of the nick repair mechanism may improve CRISPR/Cas9n mediated genome editing.",

            "text": "The CRISPR/Cas system, which serves as an adaptive immune system against invading mobile genetic elements (e.g., phages and plasmids), is widely distributed in archaea and bacteria [30]. CRISPR/Cas system-based genome editing technologies have revolutionized genome engineering [31]. These technologies have been widely employed for genome editing in all kingdoms, including animals [32], plants [33], and microbes [34]. Unlike Cre and I-SceI nuclease-based genome editing, CRISPR/Cas-based technology does not require the pre-integration of a unique enzyme recognition sequence into the genome, but employs a transcribed synthetic guide RNA (sgRNA, the chimera of crRNA and tracrRNA), or only crRNA, to direct Cas proteins to any site on the genome [35]. Of the diverse known Cas endonucleases, the Streptococcus pyogenes-derived Cas9, which belongs to Class 2 type II, is the most widely used in Streptomyces [36]. Recently, Cpf1 (also known as Cas12a) derived from Francisella novicida, which belongs to Class 2 type V, has also been used for engineering streptomycetes [37,38]. Compared to other genome editing technologies, the CRISPR/Cas-assisted technology has several advantages, such as higher efficiency, ease of operation, and lower operation time. The CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing technology has markedly promoted the genetic engineering of streptomycetes [39]. Additionally, several CRISPR/Cas-derived technologies, such as the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-mediated gene repression tool based on dCas9 (a nuclease-deficient Cas9 with two mutations of D10A and H840A) [40] or ddCpf1 (a nuclease-deficient Cpf1 with the mutation of E1006A) [37] and the base editors (BEs) for targeted base mutagenesis based on dCas9 or Cas9n (a nickase version of Cas9, with the mutation of D10A) have recently been developed [41,42].",

Gene editing using, e.g., Cas9-based systems, can be used to inactivate MGEs in eukaryotes by introducing specific mutations. ABSTRACT Defense against viruses and other mobile genetic elements (MGEs) is important in many organisms. The CRISPR-Cas systems found in bacteria and archaea constitute adaptive immune systems that can acquire the ability to target previously unrecognized MGEs. No CRISPR-Cas system is found to occur naturally in eukaryotic cells, but here, we demonstrate interference by a type I-E CRISPR-Cas system from Escherichia coli introduced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The designed CRISPR arrays are expressed and processed properly in S. cerevisiae. Targeted plasmids display reduced transformation efficiency, indicative of DNA cleavage. IMPORTANCE Genetic inactivation of viruses and other MGEs is an important tool with application in both research and therapy. Gene editing using, e.g., Cas9-based systems, can be used to inactivate MGEs in eukaryotes by introducing specific mutations. However, type I-E systems processively degrade the target which allows for inactivation without detailed knowledge of gene function. A reconstituted CRISPR-Cas system in S. cerevisiae can also function as a basic research platform for testing the role of various factors in the interference process.",

            "text": "A highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system was also implemented for the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris. 32 A human codon optimized CAS9 nuclease and ribozymeflanked gRNAs were expressed under the control of a bidirectional, constitutive RNA polymerase II promoter (Figure 1A). The ribozymes were required for the processing and functional production of gRNAs without additional 5\u2032/3\u2032 sequences (stemming from the 5\u2032/3\u2032 UTRs of the promoter/ terminators used). The CAS9/gRNA expression cassettes were provided on an episomal plasmid and were cured by growth on non-selective media. In P. pastoris the CRISPR/ Cas9 induced double strand breaks are repaired by the cellular NHEJ machinery, resulting in the formation of short insertions and deletions (indels) in the coding sequence (CDS), and frameshift mutations. The P. pastoris CRISPR/ Cas9 system enables gene deletions at targeting rates approaching 100% and also the simultaneous deletion of different genes by using multiple gRNAs. 32 However, specifically integrating donor cassettes via homologous recombination (HR) for replacement studies had proven difficult resulting in low efficiencies in correct integration using CRISPR/Cas9 in P. pastoris. \n\nHere, we expanded the existing CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering system for P. pastoris by overcoming these previous limitations. We demonstrate the integration of marker-free donor cassettes at efficiencies approaching 100% using a ku70 deletion strain previously reported. 23 Alternatively, in P. pastoris wildtype strains integration rates for marker-free donor cassettes of 50% were obtained by using stability donor cassettes with autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs). ARSs are typically placed on plasmids to allow episomal expression, which is beneficial for the production of selected proteins. 32 Depending on the ARS multiple copies of the plasmids are present in the cell (PARS1, 10 copies) and the plasmids are maintained in the presence of selective pressure. 33",

            "text": "In 2013, Zhang's and Church's team used the type II system (CRISPR/Cas9) derived from Streptococcus to successfully perform genome editing in mammalian cells (Cong et al., 2013;Mali et al., 2013). Since then, CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing technology has been extensively researched and applied, and many Cas9-based application tools have been developed. \n\nCRISPR/Cas9 is a system based on the endonuclease activity of Cas9 protein and the specific localization function of gRNA for the precise manipulation of foreign genomes. It can be used in many genetic engineering organisms, including animal cells, plant cells, and microalgae cells. The researchers introduced RNPs into C. reinhardtii cells by electroporation and successfully obtained CRISPR-/Cas9-induced mutations at the targeted sites of MAA7, CpSRP43, and ChlM genes (Shin et al., 2016). Compared with the first reported mutations induced by transgenic Cas9, the efficiency of delivered Cas9 RNPs has increased by 100 times, significantly improving gene knockout efficiency (Jiang et al., 2014). Researchers have successfully implemented CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology in microalgae such as Nannochloropsis spp, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and Thalassiosira pseudonana in the past 10 years (Hopes et al., 2016;Nymark et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2016). Recently, Nomura et al. (2019), Nomura et al. (2020) had successfully introduced Cas9 RNPs into E. gracilis through electroporation. Through a non-homologous end-repair mechanism, the mutation efficiency of the targeted gene EgGSL2 was as high as 90.1%. These two are the only research articles on the successful gene editing of E. gracilis using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and no successful reports have followed yet.",

Due to their robust physiology, yeasts could be cultivated in harsh growth conditions, such as low pH and elevated temperatures. Furthermore, yeasts can be introduced in complex eukaryotic post-translational modification systems, which are absent in bacterial hosts and often vital for biopharmaceuticals production (Thomas et al., 2013). Until now, a series of genetic engineering tools based on CRISPR/Cas9 had been exploited in yeast to improve the efficiency of genetic modification (Mitsui et al., 2019). \n\nFor decades, S. cerevisiae has been a well-known model organism in research and application areas (Jako\u010diunas et al., 2016). To verify the efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in S. cerevisiae, the endogenous genomic negative selectable marker CAN1 (encoding arginine permease) can be chosen as a target gene (Dicarlo et al., 2013). To further improve the gene knockout efficiency, 90-bp double-strand oligonucleotides (dsOligo) including homologous arms to the target site and an internal stop codon as the HR template were designed. The recombined frequency of mutations selected from the medium containing canavanine (a toxic arginine analog that can kill cells containing functional CAN1 gene) was almost 100%, providing foundations for simple and powerful genome engineering tools in yeasts. This system can be used to knock out LEU2, TRP1, URA3, and HIS3 in polyploid industrial yeast S. cerevisiae ATCC 4124 with efficiency of up to 60%, and a quadruple-deficient strain ( ura3, trp1, leu2, his3) was successfully constructed (Zhang et al., 2014).",

            "text": "biotic resulted in strains of R. toruloides exhibiting successful targeted disruption of the native URA3 gene. While editing efficiencies were initially low (0.002%), optimization of the cassette increased efficiencies 364-fold (to 0.6%). Applying these optimized design conditions enabled disruption of another native gene involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, CAR2, with much greater success; editing efficiencies of CAR2 deletion reached roughly 50%. Finally, we demonstrated efficient multiplexed genome editing by disrupting both CAR2 and URA3 in a single transformation. Together, our results provide a framework for applying CRISPR-Cas9 to R. toruloides that will facilitate rapid and high-throughput genome engineering in this industrially relevant organism. IMPORTANCE Microbial biofuel and bioproduct platforms provide access to clean and renewable carbon sources that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly than petroleum-based carbon sources. Furthermore, they can serve as useful conduits for the synthesis of advanced molecules that are difficult to produce through strictly chemical means. R. toruloides has emerged as a promising potential host for converting renewable lignocellulosic material into valuable fuels and chemicals. However, engineering efforts to improve the yeast\u2019s production capabilities have been impeded by a lack of advanced tools for genome engineering. While this is rapidly changing, one key tool remains unexplored in R. toruloides: CRISPR-Cas9. The results outlined here demonstrate for the first time how effective multiplexed CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption provides a framework for other researchers to utilize this revolutionary genome-editing tool effectively in R. toruloides.",

            "text": "Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author): \n\nThe manuscript reports the combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which three orthogonal CRISPR proteins simultaneously and independently modulate transcriptional activation, transcriptional interference, and gene deletion. Further, the authors demonstrate the usefulness of this strategy by applying to the improvement of carotenoid production and yeast surface display. This strategy will be available as the tools for combinatorial metabolic engineering, however, the simultaneous and independently targeted gene regulation and editing with orthogonal Cas9 proteins or single Cas9 protein have been already reported [ref. #33 (Esvelt KM et al, Nat. Methods 10, 1116-1121(2013)), #55 (Kiani, S. et al., Nat. Methods 12, 1051-1054(2015)), and #56 (Dahlman JE et al, Nat. Biotechnol.,33, 1159-1161(2015))]. Therefore, this reviewer believes that the system described in this manuscript does not advance the field significantly. In general, the manuscript is well written and easy to understand. A few exceptions that should be addressed are listed below. \n\nWe appreciate the reviewer's comments and considering CRISPR-AID as a useful tool for combinatorial metabolic engineering. Nevertheless, we would like to argue the novelty of our current work. \n\n1. Although dual functional CRISPR systems have been reported, there has been no attempt to develop a tri-functional CRISPR system, all of which are required for metabolic engineering applications. As described in this manuscript, a simple combination of previous strategies is not sufficient to develop an efficient tri-functional CRISPR system. The CRISPR proteins and effector domains must be carefully designed and engineered to achieve the optimal performance. 2. In addition, the previously reported dual-functional CRISPR systems were only demonstrated using reporters (such as fluorescent proteins), we applied CRISPR-AID for combinatorial metabolic engineering. As demonstrated in this manuscript, combinatorial optimization of the metabolic engineering targets is essential in developing optimal cell factories such as protein secretion and display on yeast surface.",

It is the preferred bacteria for large scale production of chemicals such as fatty acids and 1,4-butanediol, and about 30% of approved therapeutics proteins are industrially produced using E. coli [63][64][65][66][67]. To enhance productivity, several gene-editing tools have been developed, however, none of the developed tools allow precise single base editing except BEs [68]. \n\nZheng et al. used the BE3 system to develop pEcBE3 cytosine base editing system for E. coli [48]. The pEcBE3 consists of nCas9(D10A) fused to rAPOBEC1 and UGI. The editing system was used to induce a stop codon (TAA) by C-to-T conversion of Gln codon (CAA) with 100% efficiency in tetA in E. coli strain XL1-Blue. pEcBE3 system showed near 100% editing efficiency as it introduced base conversion at lacZ and rppH in E. coli [48]. Banno et al. [49] adopted another version of CBE, i.e., Target-AID which has a more distal activity window at \u221216 to \u221220 bases upstream of PAM compared to BE3, which shows activity at \u221212 to \u221216 bases upstream of PAM [22,23]. The authors initially used nCas9(D10A) but observed poor transformation efficiency and speculated growth defect or cell death similar to Cas9. Therefore, they adopted dCas9. The dCas9 was fused to PmCDA1, UGI, and protein degradation tag (LVA) developing dCas9-CDA-UL. The editing system successfully performed multiplex editing as six out of eight sequenced clones showed simultaneous editing of galK, xylB, manA, pta, adhE, and tpiA.",

            "text": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) is one of the most well studied, genetically tractable organisms. As a model eukaryote, it has provided critical insight into the basic biology of the cell cycle [1], endomembrane vesicular trafficking [2], autophagy [3], and many other cellular systems. Part of the success for the tractability of yeast in both industry and basic research stems from the ability to rapidly edit and manipulate genomes. This has led to the development of genome-wide libraries [4][5][6], synthetic genetic array (SGA \u2020) technology [7], and markerless integration methods [8], to name only a few. The recent interest and explosion of research into CRISPR/Cas9-based editing across many model systems has also finally reached the yeast community. \n\nCRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats) has evolved as a primitive immune system in prokaryotes with the ability to precisely target and edit any genome [9][10][11][12]. Briefly, the Cas9 endonuclease of the Class II CRISPR system (typically from Streptococcus pyogenes) is first bound to a single-stranded piece of RNA (sgRNA; single guide) containing a short stretch of nucleotides that bind and recruit the Cas9/RNA complex to the corresponding sequence within a target genome that is also marked with a \"PAM\" (protospacer adjacent motif) 5'-NGG-3' sequence [13]. The dual nuclease domains of Cas9 cause a double-stranded break (DSB) at the +3 position upstream of the PAM. Eukaryotes, including yeast, have evolved multiple DNA repair systems to handle the presence of DSBs, including repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) [14] and homology directed repair (HDR) [15]. Introduction of DSBs at genomic position(s) by Cas9 has allowed for gene replacement, gene deletions, pathway construction, and single base editing in many eukaryotic organisms including humans [16][17][18][19][20][21].",

            "text": "One of the most significant advantages of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is its flexibility and efficiency for operation with high accuracy. Cas9 protein is a \"scissor\" to introduce double-strand breaks (DSBs), and guide RNA (gRNA) can be regarded as a \"guide\" for target-specific recognition (Jinek et al., 2012). The formed DSBs required intrinsic DNA repair mechanisms for editing target loci (Lian et al., 2018a). The homology-dependent recombination (HDR) in yeast can repair DSBs with flexible donors containing desired sequences (Figure 1A), which allows various genetic manipulations, including gene deletion (e.g., whole coding sequence knockout) (Zhang et al., 2019), gene mutation or disruption (DiCarlo et al., 2013), and gene integration (Shi et al., 2016a;Roy et al., 2018). \n\nIn the aforementioned processes, strain engineering displayed a high editing efficiency (Table 1). For example, DiCarlo et al. (2013) first demonstrated in yeast that both gene disruption and insertion could be achieved with nearly 100% efficiency using a 90-bp dsOligo as the donor and the CRISPR/Cas9 1 https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2020/press-release/ system. Notably, DNA integration efficiency declined rapidly when the size of the target DNA increased, which could be considered as the limiting factor in integrating large DNA fragments. Using the CRISPR/Cas9, Shi et al. (2016a) developed a Di-CRISPR platform that realized the integration of a 24kb pathway for the production of (R,R)-2,3-butanediol. This was a significant achievement in the efficiency and multicopy integration of large DNA. \n\nThe high efficiency and flexibility also allowed the rapid generation of a mutant library (Table 1). Guo et al. (2018) created hundreds of mutated stains for 315 poorly characterized open reading frames (ORFs) using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, of which 68 were found to be vital for growth.",

The ability to precisely target DNA sequences and either remove, modify, or replace genetic sequences provides a new level of control in nearly all eukaryotic organisms, including budding yeast. Given the many discoveries made in Saccharomyces cerevisiae over the past decades spanning genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry, as well as the development of new technologies that have allowed high throughput screening, robotic automation, and a platform for synthetic genome engineering, the yeast community has also started to recognize the utility and complementary nature of CRISPR-based methodologies. Here we present and review a variety of recent uses of Cas9 in budding yeast\u2014both nuclease dependent and independent applications spanning traditional gene editing and replacement, to transcriptional modulation, to novel uses including the development of living circuitry or robotic platforms for synthetic genome construction. Yeast continues to serve as a powerful model system, yet it can still benefit from use of CRISPR for basic research, industrial application, and innovation of new Cas9-based applications.",

            "text": "However, establishing a general technique for removing unfavorable genomic regions from industrially important microorganisms is desirable but challenged due to low homologous recombination frequencies, especially in wild-type strains (Takahashi et al., 2008). Recent studies have demonstrated CRISPR/Cas9-induced large genomic deletions ranging from 20 kb to 5 Mb in Caenorhabditis elegans, maize, rabbit, human cell lines, and mouse (Chen et al., 2014;Essletzbichler et al., 2014;Zhou et al., 2014;Song et al., 2016;Kato et al., 2017;Li et al., 2023). However, it is noted that efficiency decreases as the size of the deleted fragment increases. \n\nDeveloping highly efficient genome editing systems is crucial for metabolic engineering, particularly for the refining and customization of industrial strains. These processes often entail multiple rounds of modification, highlighting the necessity for precise and effective genome editing tools. In this study, we introduce two vector-based CRISPR platforms, CRISPR-Cas9 (SpCas9) and CRISPR-Cas12a (LbCpf1), designed for highly efficient fungal CRISPR-mediated gene editing. Our findings demonstrate the versatility of both Cas9 and Cas12a systems in A. niger. Moreover, we showcase their efficacy in inducing large chromosomal segment deletions with up to 102 kb, further broadening their utility in genetic manipulation. These advancements offer promising avenues for accelerating strain optimization and advancing metabolic engineering strategies in industrial biotechnology.",

            "text": "Due to its ease of cultivation and availability of genetic manipulation tools, E. coli is often used as a host for the production of fine and bulk chemicals via metabolic engineering. The emergence of CRISPR/Cas technology has provided E. coli with more convenient and efficient genetic manipulation tools, which further promoted its use as an ideal industrial production platform. However, the currently available CRISPR/Cas technology still has certain shortcomings. New methods with reduced off-target rates are emerging, such as the fusion of dCas9 with FokI protein, which provides a new perspective for research, and more details on the off-target activities have been summarized in a recent review (Li et al., 2019). By continuously mining new Cas proteins and modifying existing Cas proteins, the limitations of PAM can be avoided as much as possible. With the discovery of new homologs, additional Cas proteins are becoming available for RNA editing when temporary changes are desirable or when DNA editing is challenging, such as programmable RNA targeting using the subtype III-E effector Cas7-11 (\u00d6zcan et al., 2021) or compact RNA editors based on the newly identified and characterized Cas13bt (Kannan et al., 2021). \n\nDiverse CRISPR/Cas systems have already enabled impressive applications in E. coli. However, many non-model bacteria still lack effective and efficient genome editing tools. The CRISPRbased tools for E. coli will further promote the development of genome editing tools for non-model microorganisms, and provide more options for the functional study of their genomes. \n\nThe future discovery and characterization of novel CRISPR/ Cas systems will lead to further expansion of CRISPR-based tools. The combination of detailed molecular studies and the development of molecular tools could further enhance the CRISPR/Cas toolkit for bacteria, which will further promote its applications.",

However, strain development remains slow and laborious because of difficulties anticipating the combined effect of different expression parts and conditions. Although the field of synthetic biology has advanced rapidly in recent years, the assortment of expression contexts currently used for heterologous gene expression is limited and poorly characterized. Native genes, on the other hand, are controlled by a large variety of gene expression parts allowing for dynamic responses to environmental signals. Therefore, the advancement of strain engineering relies on the provision of more diverse and characterized expression parts that can be easily combined so that a large number of expression contexts can be explored.\n\nPlasmid-based systems are routinely used in S. cerevisiae to express synthetic pathways. Specifically, 2-micron plasmids provide a convenient route for overexpression due to their high copy numbers. There are, however, significant problems associated with plasmids such as variability in plasmid copy number between cells and recombinational and segregational instability, which make it difficult to maintain stable unimodal cell populations (1,3). This heterogeneity can result subpopulations of cells that don't express the full pathway at optimal levels. Additionally, plasmid-based systems require selectable markers and media that can be too expensive for industrial applications. Genomic integration is therefore often the best method to ensure pathway stability and homogeneous expression in a population.\n\nThe recent refactoring of the type II CRISPR (Clustered Regularly InterSpaced Short Palindromic Repeats) Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) system for use in genome editing has enabled more efficient and accessible integration into the genome. In yeast, this system works by employing a Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 endonuclease that is directed to cleave at DNA sequences specified by a noncoding single-guide RNA (sgRNA) that works by base pairing with the DNA target sequence, enabling the endonuclease to introduce a site-",

            "text": "Methylotrophic yeasts like Komagataella phaffii (formerly known as Pichia pastoris) and Ogataea polymorpha find extensive use in both fundamental research and biotechnological applications, often in contexts necessitating genetic alterations [81,82]. Pichia pastoris is often used to produce heterologous proteins, in which CRISPR-Cas9 system using RNA pol II promoter was first established in 2016 [83]. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, K. phaffii predominantly relies on non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The efficiency of non-homologous recombination of NHEJ is nearly 100%, while the efficiency of specific integration of the homologous donor cassette by homologous recombination (HR) was only 20%. As Ku70p gene is related to the NHEJ repair pathway, with the Ku70p gene knocked out, the efficiency of HR specific integration was greatly improved [84]. Recently, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been established and fine-tuned in K. phaffii through the assessment of various codon-optimized Cas9 genes, sgRNAs, and promoters for the expression of Cas9 and sgRNA [83]. In K. phaffii, a CRISPR/Cas-based toolbox has also been developed [85]. It was found that panARS from Kluyveromyces lactis increased the editing efficiency by nearly 10 times, compared to the commonly used endogenous ARS in a previous report [86]. And sgRNA expression through the RNA pol III promoter (SER promoter, tRNA) was proved successful [87]. In addition, the CRISPR-Cas9 system containing free sgRNA plasmids and CRISPRi system has also been developed in K. phaffii [88]. \n\nIn regard to the applications of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, Hou and colleagues [89] edited the transcription activator Mxr1 on the genome, and precisely deleted or inserted specific bases at key amino acid positions.",

This system consists of an engineered fusion of Cas9 and a cytidine deaminase that does not introduce DNA double-strand breaks but instead converts cytosine to uracil, thereby effecting a C-to-T substitution at a target site defined by the guide   RNA (gRNA) (Komor et al., 2016). To adapt the base editor for use in yeast, we created a plasmid which contains the base editor under a galactose-inducible promoter, as well as a plasmid optimized for cloning of both gRNAs individually and gRNA libraries in bulk ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1). These plasmids were transformed into yeast cultures, and base editor expression was induced with galactose. First, we assessed base-editing efficiency and the target window in yeast by ampliconsequencing the genomic target loci of eight individual gRNAs after base editor expression was induced for 44 hr. We found that the target window and mutagenesis pattern are very similar to those described in human cells: 95% of edits are C-to-T transitions, and 89% of these occurred in a fivenucleotide window 13-17 base pairs upstream of the PAM sequence ( Figure 1A; Figure 1-figure supplement 2; Komor et al., 2016). Editing efficiency was variable across the eight gRNAs and ranged from 4% to 64% if considering only cases where all Cs in the window are edited; percentages are higher if incomplete edits are considered, too ( Figure 1B).\n\nTo assess base editing efficiency over time, we designed two gRNAs predicted to lead to lossof-function mutations in GFP. We expressed the base editor and these gRNAs in yeast cells with a genomically integrated GFP gene. Depending on the gRNA, cells lost the GFP signal at different rates; however, for both gRNAs, a majority of cells had lost the GFP signal after 24 hr (Figure 1figure supplement 3).",

Streptomyces is a genus of soil-dwelling filamentous bacteria rich in gene clusters and production of clinically used pharmaceuticals (Kieser et al., 2000), and synthetic biology has been highly developed for their precious natural products (Palazzotto et al., 2019).

The fungal photo-receptor Vivid is engineered into two proteins, positive Magnet (pMag) and negative Magnet (nMag), which hetero-dimerize upon exposure to blue light and have switch-off kinetics by four orders of magnitude .

            "text": "Rapid progress has been made in genetic engineering of LAB using recombineering and CRISPR-based systems. We can obtain desired mutant strains in several days, which accelerates fundamental research and functional exploitation. CRISPR-based editing tools will be further improved in LAB, including multilocus editing and Cas9-NHEJ repair, which have been achieved in E. coli [66] and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [67,68]. We can also learn from new achievements with CRISPR-Cas9based systems in eukaryotes. For example, new genetic information could be written into specified DNA sites using a dCas9 fused to an engineered reverse transcriptase in human cells [69]. Newly-reported insertion systems might also provide inspiration. CRISPR-associated transposases (CAST) have been explored in Vibrio cholerae and cyanobacteria. CAST were able to integrate foreign gene fragments directly into chromosomal target sites with frequencies of up to 80% without positive selection [70,71]. The CAST loci are approximately 20 kb long and contain a Tn7-like transposase, cargo genes and V-U CRISPR system. On the basis of these characteristics, approximately 30% type V-U putative Cas protein have been identified in 171 Lactobacillus species [72], suggesting the presence of genetic elements for the development of non-redundant and targeted genome integration systems in LAB. \n\nIn the future, the LAB genome editing platforms will be more complete. The cloning and identification of new recombinase and CRISPR systems will undoubtedly make the genetic modification of LAB faster and easier. Integration of CRISPR-based editing with synthetic biology approaches holds promise for the development of intelligent therapeutic delivery that responds to changes in the intestinal environment, such as using pH-dependent promoters, xylose-induced expression systems, and heat shock-responsive promoters [73][74][75]. Although there is a long way to go before we can efficiently and reliably engineer non-model gut microorganisms, the potential benefits are considerable, and would open up new avenues for the genesis of engineered probiotic strains to improve human health with unprecedented speed, ease, and scale.",

Here, we combine CRISPR/Cas9 and \u03bb Red recombineering based MAGE technology (CRMAGE) to create a highly efficient and fast method for genome engineering of Escherichia coli. Using CRMAGE, the recombineering efficiency was between 96.5% and 99.7% for gene recoding of three genomic targets, compared to between 0.68% and 5.4% using traditional recombineering. For modulation of protein synthesis (small insertion/RBS substitution) the efficiency was increased from 6% to 70%. CRMAGE can be multiplexed and enables introduction of at least two mutations in a single round of recombineering with similar efficiencies. PAM-independent loci were targeted using degenerate codons, thereby making it possible to modify any site in the genome. CRMAGE is based on two plasmids that are assembled by a USER-cloning approach enabling quick and cost efficient gRNA replacement. CRMAGE furthermore utilizes CRISPR/Cas9 for efficient plasmid curing, thereby enabling multiple engineering rounds per day. To facilitate the design process, a web-based tool was developed to predict both the \u03bb Red oligos and the gRNAs. The CRMAGE platform enables highly efficient and fast genome editing and may open up promising prospective for automation of genome-scale engineering.",

The approach involves generating CRISPR-Cas9-mediated double-strand breaks (DSBs) and highly efficient homology-directed repair (HDR) along with yeast mating and sporulation to randomly assort edited sites performing multi-site and marker-less combinations of engineered loci. This selective and successive elimination of specific yeast loci mimics a gene drive 21-24 and facilitates marker-less enrichment and recombination of genetically engineered yeast loci (MERGE).\n\nWe show that CRISPR-mediated selection operates similarly to classical selection markers, enabling MERGE to efficiently explore many combinations of genetically engineered loci, revealing a fitness-driven path to engineering any heterologous system in yeast. We further demonstrate that MERGE enables rapid assembly of an entire carotenoid biosynthesis pathway by performing a multi-site and marker-less combination of distinct engineered loci. Finally, using a multiplexed version of MERGE, we humanize a near-complete a-proteasome core (6 of 7 subunits) in yeast while revealing a fitness-driven path to the humanization of complex processes.",

            "text": "Moreover, longer flanking sequences of a selection marker also facilitate the higher HR efficiency [11]. Recently, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been successfully engineered in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes [12][13][14] and has proved to be a feasible, efficient, versatile, genome-engineering tool. This system consists of a Cas9 nuclease and a functional guide RNA (gRNA) [15]. The gRNA recognizes the target sequence in the genome, and the Cas9 nuclease cleaves the sequence to generate double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) [16]. Then, the cells repair these breaks via nonhomologous end-joining or HR using exogenous DNA (donor DNA), resulting in insertion or deletion mutagenesis at targeted genomic loci [17,18]. \n\nCRISPR/Cas9 systems can be established by either in vivo or in vitro strategies. In the in vivo strategy, cassettes expressing Cas9 and gRNA with appropriate promoters are introduced into cells to produce a functional Cas9/gRNA complex in vivo [19]. Recently, an approach for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in C. purpurea using in vivo expression of Cas9 and gRNA was described [20]. However, this strategy does not work well, since the editing efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair was only slightly better than HR-mediated knock-out of the TrpE gene (4/116 and 6/384, respectively). In the in vitro strategy, the purified Cas9 protein and in vitro transcript gRNA are assembled in vitro to generate a functional Cas9/gRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and then transformed into cells for genome editing. This strategy has obvious advantages over the in vivo strategy, as assembly of the Cas9/gRNA complex is not limited by the amount or rate of Cas9 translation or gRNA transcription in vivo. The editing efficiency reached 100% in the filamentous fungi Trichoderma reesei [11,21,22] and Cordyceps militaris [23,24] after optimizing the RNP-based method.",

            "text": "CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) genome editing systems have revolutionized biological research. The ability to target and modify genetic loci offers the potential to investigate the functional consequences of variants discovered through genome wide association studies (Gallagher and Chen-Plotkin, 2018;Chen et al., 2022) and to correct the >75,000 known human pathogenic variants listed in Clinvar (Landrum and Kattman, 2018). The original CRISPR/Cas9 system has been available for more than a decade and extensive research has characterized how CRISPR/Cas9 works and how this can be optimized for maximal efficiency, with over 18,000 publications related to the term \"CRISPR\" listed on PubMed. CRISPR/Cas9 components are widely commercially available as recombinant components and plasmids. It is possible to achieve efficiencies of up to 80% in human cells when utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 to disrupt the DNA sequence and generate gene knock-outs (Guo et al., 2018). However, when using CRISPR/Cas9 to substitute nucleotides (knock-in), the efficiency is far lower, often in the order of 1%, although efficiencies of up to ~50% are reported following protocol modifications (Paquet et al., 2016;Kwart et al., 2017;Guo et al., 2018;Okamoto et al., 2019;Maurissen and Woltjen, 2020) (reviewed in Liu et al., 2019a). More recently, it was demonstrated in yeast that retron-based CRISPR/Cas9 could boost multiplexing knock-in experiments, opening new possibilities for human cells (Zhao et al., 2022). Nevertheless nucleotide substitution by CRISPR/Cas9 relies on the non-dominant DNA repair pathway, homology directed repair (HDR). CRISPR/Cas9's reliance on DNA damage repair limits the efficiency of substituting nucleotides and can introduce off-target mutations.",

            "text": "The most common method of gene editing utilizes the Cas9 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes. The Cas9 protein is a dual RNA-guided DNA endonuclease able to cleave the target DNA in both strands through recognizing the hairpin loop architecture of the crRNA-tracrRNA complex [45]. Cas9 guided by multiple sgRNAs can bind to endogenous genes with high specificity. In 2013, the first CRISPR/Cas9 edited plants of Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana benthamiana, and Oryza sativa were obtained [46,47]. Different versions of Cas9 with high efficiency for gene editing have been identified and utilized in plants since then [48]. \n\nWhen compared to other gene-editing approaches, the CRISPR/Cas9 system exhibits high rates of editing efficiency, approximately 75% to 85% [49][50][51][52], surpassing those of ZFNs and TALENs [53]. However, the CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene editing has several drawbacks, including reduced editing efficiency due to PAM sequence mismatches, genetic mosaicism, and editing of non-targeted regions of the genome (i.e., off-target gene editing). To address these issues, a mutant version of Cas9 called Cas9 nickase (nCas9) has been engineered to generate single-strand DNA breaks and reduce off-target effects [54].",

            "text": "Biotechnology for Biofuels Bacillus subtilis, which was granted GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status by the US Food and Drug Administration, has long been widely used for the production of enzymes, drug precursors, platform compounds, biofuels and biopolymers [8]. It readily secretes products into the extracellular medium and can metabolize nearly any carbon source, making it an attractive biomanufacturing platform [9]. While B. subtilis is an ideal organism for metabolic engineering applications, the development of genetic tools is lagging behind popular production hosts such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, especially in multiplex genome editing. In E. coli and S. cerevisiae, efficient genome editing tools and a range of established multiplex pathway-optimization techniques (MAGE [10], YOGE [11], TRMR [12], RAGE [13], CREATE [14], CHAnGE [15], and so on) have been developed, which enabled the simultaneous modification of several loci, and greatly enhanced the ability to engineer complex pathways. Although a substantial collection of counter-selectable markers [16][17][18], or \u03bb-Red phage mediated singlestranded DNA recombination [19] tools are available for engineering B. subtilis, these techniques requires time-consuming sequential transformation steps and are unable to achieve highly efficient complex gene editing. The current genetic engineering tools, therefore, still represent a bottleneck for multiple genes modulation in B. subtilis. \n\nRecently, microbial genome editing techniques have progressed significantly due to the extensive research conducted on the CRISPR system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), derived from the RNA-guided immune systems found in many bacteria and archaea [1,20]. The introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system not only eliminated the need for selection markers in genome editing but also dramatically increased the editing efficiency [21][22][23][24]. Current genome editing applications based on the type II-CRISPR/Cas9 system in bacteria are classified into two categories: Cas9-mediated genome editing and Cas9 nickase (Cas9n)-mediated genome editing [25].",

            "text": "Various versions of CRISPR/Cas9 tools have been developed for fungi and each of these approaches may be the preferred method for a particular fungus ( Table 1). The yeast S. cerevisiae was the first fungus for which CRISPR/Cas9 was applied to modify the genome [20], and the ability of this fungus to stably maintain plasmids facilitated the development of tools for CRISPR/Cas9. Usually these plasmids contain the CAS9 gene under constitutive expression [20,21], and when coupled with transient sgRNA cassette transformation, generate DSBs thereby increasing homologous recombination rates [20]. Previously, gene manipulation in the clinically relevant yeast Candida albicans was tedious as the fungus is a diploid; however development of CRISPR/Cas9 methods has provided an efficient way to generate homozygous mutations and facilitated genome engineering in this organism [21][22][23].\n\nFollowing these initial CRISPR/Cas9 experiments with yeasts, the gene editing tool was adapted for both model and non-model filamentous fungi (Table 1; Fig. 2). A CRISPR/Cas9 system was first established in the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei using a codon-optimized CAS9 gene that was introduced into the genome using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation [24]. When the expression of CAS9 was under the control of either a constitutive or inducible promoter, there was no obvious alteration in the function of other proteins as observed by fungal morphology and various other phenotypes. The successful integration of Cas9 into the fungal genome generated a strain (a 'Cas9' strain) that requires only the sgRNA for genome editing through protoplast transformation, providing a method to rapidly target multiple genes simultaneously [24].\n\nThe random integration of the CAS9 gene into the host genome may induce undesired mutations, and obtaining a 'Cas9' fungal strain may require screening several transformants or optimizing the codon usage of the CAS9 gene to a different codon preference for each species. Another caveat is the constitutive expression of CAS9 and/or its long-time retention in host cells which may",

The system has three types: I, II, and III, and maintains high specificity through canonical Watson-Crick base pairing of guide RNAs to the target sites. Type II uses Cas9 nucleases and is the most useful system demonstrated so far [1] due to the unique properties of the enzymes. A Cas9 nuclease can be guided by CRISPR to a targeted protospacer region, located at the upstream of a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). Then, the Cas9 nuclease can induce precise cleavages at the endogenous genomic locus resulting in DNA deletion and other changes at the locus [4]. In addition, the Cas9 nuclease can be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology-directed repair with mutagenic activity [4]. These properties of CRISPR/Cas9 make the system a valuable and versatile tool for many research applications [5,6]. \n\nSuccessful examples of using the CRISPR/Cas9 system for various genome-editing purposes are accumulating at a fast pace. The system was used to introduce precise mutations into the genomes of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in 2013 [2], which demonstrated the effectiveness and versatility of the technique for bacterial genome engineering. Subsequently, the CRISPR/Cas9 system of prokaryotic Streptococcus pyogenes was employed as programmable RNA-guided endonucleases to cleave DNA in a targeted manner for genome editing in human and mouse cells [3,4]. Now, various tool kits with vectors carrying pGreen or pCAMBIA backbones, which can facilitate transient or stable expression of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, have been developed for multiplex gene editing in plants [5].",

            "text": "CRISPR (clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas (CRISPR associated protein) has recently emerged as an effective genome editing system for modifying genes in a wide range of organisms, including humans, animals, bacteria and plants [1][2][3]. The system has three types: I, II, and III, and maintains high specificity through canonical Watson-Crick base pairing of guide RNAs to the target sites. Type II uses Cas9 nucleases and is the most useful system demonstrated so far [1] due to the unique properties of the enzymes. A Cas9 nuclease can be guided by CRISPR to a targeted protospacer region, located at the upstream of a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). Then, the Cas9 nuclease can induce precise cleavages at the endogenous genomic locus resulting in DNA deletion and other changes at the locus [4]. In addition, the Cas9 nuclease can be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology-directed repair with mutagenic activity [4]. These properties of CRISPR/Cas9 make the system a valuable and versatile tool for many research applications [5,6]. \n\nSuccessful examples of using the CRISPR/Cas9 system for various genome-editing purposes are accumulating at a fast pace. The system was used to introduce precise mutations into the genomes of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in 2013 [2], which demonstrated the effectiveness and versatility of the technique for bacterial genome engineering. Subsequently, the CRISPR/Cas9 system of prokaryotic Streptococcus pyogenes was employed as programmable RNA-guided endonucleases to cleave DNA in a targeted manner for genome editing in human and mouse cells [3,4]. Now, various tool kits with vectors carrying pGreen or pCAMBIA backbones, which can facilitate transient or stable expression of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, have been developed for multiplex gene editing in plants [5].",

Cobb et al. generated two sets of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing systems, namely pCRISPomyces-1 and pCRISPomyces-2, and achieved the precise deletion of various DNA sizes (ranging from 20 bp-31.4 kb) (including individual genes, double genes simultaneously, and single antibiotic BGCs) with efficiency of 21-100% by homology-directed repair (HDR) in three different Streptomyces species [43]. Later, they applied this CRISPR/Cas9 technology to perform promoter knock-in for the activation of silent BGCs of different classes in five native Streptomyces hosts and achieved the identification of unique metabolites, including a novel pentangular type II polyketide in Streptomyces viridochromogenes [15]. We developed a similar CRISPR/Cas9-based editing system, namely, pKCcas9dO, in S. coelicolor. This system was applied for genetic engineering at different levels with high efficiency ranging from 60-100%, including deletion of individual genes (actII-orf4, redD, and glnR) and single antibiotic BGCs (with a size of 21.3, 31.6 and 82.8 kb, respectively) [44]. Furthermore, we achieved simultaneous deletion of two genes (actII-orf4 and redD) and two BGCs (21.3 and 31.6 kb) with an efficiency of 54% and 45%, respectively. Additionally, this system was applied to introduce point mutations into the rpsL gene with an efficiency of 64%. Around the same time, Tong et al. established the CRISPR/Cas9 editing system (pCRISPR-Cas9) for precise deletion of individual genes and multiple genes by HDR in S. coelicolor [45].",

            "text": "Specificity and kinetics of gene editing can be affected by the level of Cas9 protein (Ran et al., 2013a;Pattanayak et al., 2013;Fu et al., 2014). For example, five-time drop in the level of Cas9 protein increased its specificity seven-times by affecting the on-target efficiency for just two-times (Ran et al., 2013a). Despite extensive application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in plants for genome editing, there is variation in editing efficiencies, as the Cas9 expressing promoter, Cas9 codon optimization, and the positional effect can directly affect the Cas9 expression level and targeting efficiency (Wang et al., 2015a;Ma et al., 2015b;Yan et al., 2015;Mao et al., 2016). Constitutive Cas9 expression results in higher genome editing in mice (Platt et al., 2014), mammalian cells (Koike- Yusa et al., 2014), S. cerevisiae (DiCarlo et al., 2013), and rice (Mikami et al., 2015). In contrast to rice and some other higher plants, a higher Cas9 level reduces editing efficiency in mosaic Arabidopsis (Mao et al., 2013;Feng et al., 2014;Jiang et al., 2014;Ma et al., 2015b;Yan et al., 2015) and toxicity in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Shin et al., 2016) while no toxicity was observed in Aspergillus fumigatus with Cas9 constitutive expression (Fuller et al., 2015). Moreover, reduced search efficiency of Cas9 for heterochromatic regions indicates that access to DNA target site also contributes to specificity and efficiency (Knight et al., 2015). \n\nBesides constitutive Cas9 expression, induced (chemical and light) and tissue-specific expression has also been evaluated in various studies to improve genome editing efficiency and specificity. In the case of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, chemically induced expression is achieved by using either an inducible promoter (e.g., doxycycline) or a Cas9 variant.",

            "text": "The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) RNA-guided Cas9 nucleases (Cas9s) provide a revolutionary genome editing tool that offers distinct advantages over its predecessors, the ZFN and TALEN systems. Unlike ZFNs and TALENs, the CRISPR/Cas9 system does not require the intricate design of custom proteins for each target gene, thereby making it more versatile and cost-effective. The history of CRISPR/Cas9 dates back to the discovery of its role in bacterial immunity. In 2012, Doudna and Charpentier harnessed this natural mechanism to develop a powerful genome-editing tool [87]. The CRISPR/Cas9 system employs a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) to guide the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence. The sgRNA is a synthetic fusion of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and transactivating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), which simplifies the editing process [88]. \n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 system has been successfully applied for genome editing in zebrafish [89]. Targeted genetic modifications can be achieved by injecting either Cas9 mRNA or the Cas9 protein, along with sgRNA, into zebrafish embryos. Cas9 mRNA directs embryonic cells to produce the Cas9 enzyme, whereas delivering the Cas9 protein directly ensures immediate activity. Zebrafish embryogenesis occurs rapidly, thus making timely and efficient gene manipulation crucial. The use of the Cas9 protein for gene editing in zebrafish is important for optimizing editing efficiency. \n\nCRISPR/Cas9's incredible precision sometimes comes with off-target effects, such as unintended alterations to non-targeted DNA sequences [90]. Interestingly, F0-based genetic assays generally exhibit lower off-target rates (1.1-2.5%) in zebrafish embryos, thus making them a potent tool for precise in vivo genome engineering [91]. To address this concern, Cas9 variants such as D10A have been developed to minimize off-target effects [92], although they may have a lower editing efficiency. In addition, by mating edited zebrafish with wild-type zebrafish, the offspring inherit a combination of edited and wild-type alleles.",

Over the past 2 years, many studies have demonstrated that the CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful genome-editing method that facilitates genetic alterations in genomes in a variety of organisms. Until now, there have been no reports on the CRISPR/Cas9 system or other genome-editing approaches in filamentous fungi, even in the model organism Neurospora crassa, despite the successful application of this technique in yeast [2,7].\n\nThe filamentous fungus T. reesei, which is recognized by its Generally Recognized as Safe status by the US Food and Drug Administration, is the most widely used producer of commercial lignocellulolytic enzyme preparations [1] and is expected to be a potential cell factory for different heterologous proteins with its powerful ability to synthesize and secrete proteins with high quantities. However, the genetic basis of desired domestication traits is poorly understood, because robust genetic tools do not exist for this industrial host. The establishment of a genome-editing system can be used to develop T. reesei as a super cell factory for lignocellulolytic enzyme preparations and other heterologous proteins, as well as to characterize the regulatory mechanisms for induction, synthesis, and secretion of proteins in T. reesei.\n\nIn this study, we constructed a CRISPR/Cas9 system in T. reesei that allowed us to induce mutagenesis or introduce a new gene by homologous recombination into a target site of the T. reesei genome. In addition, it can be used to generate multiple genome modifications simultaneously by co-transforming gRNAs and donor DNAs (dDNAs) for different targets. This system demonstrates great potential as a tool for genome engineering in filamentous fungi, owing to userdesignated site specificity of Cas9 endonuclease activity and the simplicity of gRNA construction.",

            "text": "The recent development of the CRISPR/Cas9 system provides a simple, sequence-specific platform for genome engineering [14,15]. The widely used Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) type II CRISPR/Cas9 system, which requires a mature CRISPR RNA (crRNA), a trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), and a DNA endonuclease, Cas9, has been harnessed for targeted genome editing in many organisms [15][16][17]. The Cas9 protein is an RNA-guided endonuclease that cleaves target DNA; a 20 bp complementary region (N20) within the crRNA can guide Cas9 to its specific target [18,19]. The 20 nt sequence, known as the protospacer [20], contains a specific protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) at its 3\u2032 end [21]. The PAM sequence leads Cas9 to create a double-strand break (DSB) at the target sequence, and the DSB stimulates the DNA repair pathway by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homolog-directed repair (HDR) [22][23][24]. The crRNA and tracrRNA can be fused together to generate a single synthetic guide RNA (sgRNA), which simplifies genome editing design [25]. \n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 system, has been widely applied in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, such as E. coli [26][27][28], Saccharomyces cerevisiae [29], Staphylococcus aureus [25], Bacillus subtilis [30], Lactococcal Phages [17], higher-plants [31,32], and animal cells [21,33]. Moreover, the system has been used in C. glutamicum to manipulate the expression levels of specific genes [12], but not for genome editing, such as gene deletion or insertion, or the generation of point mutations.",

            "text": "BackgroundCorynebacterium glutamicum is an important industrial workhorse and advanced genetic engineering tools are urgently demanded. Recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and their CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) have revolutionized the field of genome engineering. The CRISPR/Cas9 system that utilizes NGG as protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and has good targeting specificity can be developed into a powerful tool for efficient and precise genome editing of C. glutamicum.ResultsHerein, we developed a versatile CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing toolbox for C. glutamicum. Cas9 and gRNA expression cassettes were reconstituted to combat Cas9 toxicity and facilitate effective termination of gRNA transcription. Co-transformation of Cas9 and gRNA expression plasmids was exploited to overcome high-frequency mutation of cas9, allowing not only highly efficient gene deletion and insertion with plasmid-borne editing templates (efficiencies up to 60.0 and 62.5%, respectively) but also simple and time-saving operation. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ssDNA recombineering was developed to precisely introduce small modifications and single-nucleotide changes into the genome of C. glutamicum with efficiencies over 80.0%. Notably, double-locus editing was also achieved in C. glutamicum. This toolbox works well in several C. glutamicum strains including the widely-used strains ATCC 13032 and ATCC 13869.ConclusionsIn this study, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox that could facilitate markerless gene deletion, gene insertion, precise base editing, and double-locus editing in C. glutamicum. The CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox holds promise for accelerating the engineering of C. glutamicum and advancing its application in the production of biochemicals and biofuels.",

            "text": "Recently, the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) system associated to the Cas9 endonuclease (CRISPR/Cas9) has been developed as a specific and effective tool for genome engineering. Compared to other genome editing technologies based on endonucleases such as Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) and Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease (TALEN) that are rather complex to design and need to be assembled for each target sequence, the CRISPR/Cas9 is inexpensive and easy to carry out 1-5 . This system is based on the base-pairing of the genomic sequence, adjacent to an obligate protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) NGG, with a short complimentary RNA sequence which is then cleaved by the Cas9 protein in a sequence-specific manner [5][6][7] . Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) induced by this system can be repaired in one of the two ways: Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology-Directed Repair (HDR), resulting in insertions or deletions in desired genomic regions. Deletions may result from introducing two sg-RNAs along with Cas9. The sgRNAs induce two DSBs and deletion of the intervening fragment may occur. There are several advantages of genomic deletions compared to single-site small indels including: 1) easy identification by conventional PCR, while identification of small indels or point mutations may require time consuming techniques such as Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), immunoblotting, T7 Endonuclease (T7EN1) cleavage assay and 2) predictability loss of gene function 8 .\n\nThe CRISPR-Cas system has been used for genome editing in several organisms 4,5,[9][10][11][12][13] and mammalian cell lines [14][15][16][17] . Although genome editing by CRISPR-Cas system has been demonstrated to be non-specific in some cases 18 , it can be improved in specificity if gRNAs are designed correctly.\n\nCurrently, a variety of animal models with natural immune system defects can be applied for the immunology and",

Although the CRISPR-Cas9-based toolkit has been used for plasmid clearance in Z. mobilis, there has not been any follow-up report on its application (17), indicative of uncertain factors for its further use in this species. Therefore, more readily useful high-throughput genetic engineering toolkits are needed for performing effective genome editing in Z. mobilis. \n\nIn recent years, several endogenous Type I CRISPR-Cas systems, including I-A (18), I-B (19)(20)(21), and I-E (22), have been harnessed as an alternative strategy to study prokaryotic engineering in archaea and bacteria. For example, the native Type I-B system of Clostridium pasteurianum facilitated efficient genome editing of around 4 folds more than that of the heterologously expressed Cas9 system (20). Very recently, the Type I-E system of Lactobacillus crispatus has been exploited for genome editing including gene knockout, knockin and point mutation (22), which further highlighted the usefulness of native Type I CRISPR-Cas system for in situ genome modification. In addition, the Type I-B of Haloferax volcanii (23) and Type I-E of Escherichia coli (24,25) systems were harnessed for efficient repression of transcription upon Cas3 depletion. However, to the best of our knowledge, very few native CRISPR-based toolkits were developed for non-model industrial microorganisms. Furthermore, to date there has not been any report on the exploitation of the Type I-F CRISPR-Cas, a close cousin of Type I-E, for genome manipulation application yet, although Type I-F is among the most well-studied CRISPR-Cas systems. \n\nIn this study, we characterized the DNA interference capability of the Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system in Z. mobilis ZM4.",

CRISPR-Cas editing efficiency can be influenced by various factors, notably the genetic sequence and chromatin 3D structure. 132,133 articularly, efforts are also being made to predict genome editing efficiency by integrating 3D genomics research data. 134 rokaryotic chromatin structures undergo dynamic changes due to processes such as cell division and gene expression. 135 RNA design tools trained with eukaryotic organism data do not accurately predict efficiency when applied to bacteria. 136 \u2212139 When optimally designed gRNAs for Cas nuclease are used in base editor-mediated editing, the editing efficiency is often not high. Notably, specific bacterial design tools for base editors and prime editors have not yet been developed. A gRNA efficiency prediction tool suitable for base editors has been developed, allowing for the prediction of base-editing efficiency and outcome product frequencies in the human genome. 140 For prime editors, a machine learning-based model has been developed to predict the editing efficiency of gRNA by considering factors such as the total length of the primerbinding site and editing template in pegRNA, as well as the GC ratio. 141 I-based protein structure engineering can also be used to enhance CRISPR editing tools to improve editing efficiency. Through the combination of a multidomain mutation library and the utilization of machine learning, the identified optimal Cas9 variant demonstrated a 7.5-fold increase in editing activity compared to the wild-type Cas9 nuclease. 142 In another study, by calculating the expected editing efficiency from combining Cas9 variants with deaminase variants, it was possible to obtain an enhanced base editor with up to a 20-fold efficiency improvement. 143 I technology is being used in the field of metabolic pathway engineering to increase the production of valuable substances. 144 Novel biosynthetic gene clusters in microbial genomes could be predicted, 145 and the process of designing and evaluating synthetic promoters could be facilitated by AIbased methods. 146,147 A deep learning-derived RBS\u2212phenotype prediction model enabled the screening of only 3% of the RBS library, reducing experimental efforts while enhancing limonene productivity in E. coli. 148",

            "text": "In most prokaryotes, missing and poorly active non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathways heavily restrict the direct application of CRISPR-Cas for DNA double-strand break (DSB)-based genome engineering without providing editing templates. CRISPR base editors, on the other hand, can be directly used for genome engineering in a number of bacteria, including E. coli, showing advantages over CRISPR-Cas9, since they do not require DSBs. However, as the current CRISPR base editors can only engineer DNA by A to G or C to T/G/A substitutions, they are incapable of mediating deletions, insertions, and combinations of deletions, insertions and substitutions. To address these challenges, we developed a Cas9 nickase (Cas9n)-reverse transcriptase (Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus, M-MLV) mediated, DSB-free, versatile, and single-nucleotide resolution genetic manipulation toolkit for prokaryotes, termed CRISPR-nRAGE (CRISPR-Cas9n Reverse transcriptase Assisted Genome Engineering) system. CRISPR-nRAGE can be used to introduce substitutions, deletions, insertions, and the combination thereof, both in plasmids and the chromosome of E. coli. Notably, small sized-deletion shows better editing efficiency compared to other kinds of DNA engineering. CRISPR-nRAGE has been used to delete and insert DNA fragments up to 97 bp and 33 bp, respectively. Efficiencies, however, drop sharply with the increase of the fragment size. It is not only a useful addition to the genome engineering arsenal for E. coli, but also may be the basis for the development of similar toolkits for other organisms.",

            "text": "The PE system based on CRISPR-Cas9 can be used for deletion, replacement and insertion of the targets in genome, and it shows extraordinary versatility, product purity and target specificity. Since this technology emerged 3 years ago, it has shown great potential in engineering the cell lines or strains with new functions or phenotypes and creating new platforms which are used for producing enzymes, chemicals and so on. As the most rapidly developing research field in life science, the development and application of the genome editing technologies, including PE, has brought the genetic engineering of organisms into an unprecedented depth and breadth. Genome editing technology based on CRISPR-Cas9 has become a powerful and widely used genetic tool. Recently, PE has added more powerful functions to genome editing. As mentioned in this review, these outstanding studies highlight characteristics of the PE system, such as high efficiency, less by-products and wide editing scope (Xu et al., 2020;Caso and Davies, 2022). It is believed that with the further optimization and updating of this technology, PE will have a farreaching impact on basic research, precision molecular breeding and disease treatments. \n\nComparing the BE system, the PE system is more efficient and has less by-products. However, in the classic base editing window, the BE system has higher editing efficiency and less risk of producing offtargeted indels. If the designed nucleotide location is poor, the PE system is more efficient because it is less dependent on the PAM sites (Anzalone et al., 2019;Marzec et al., 2020). Although the PE system has made some breakthroughs, there are still some deficiencies. First, the editing efficiency of PE needs to be improved further. Through constantly optimizing, the efficiency of PE system has been greatly increased compared with that of the original PE system. However, comparing the CRISPR-Cas system, the editing efficiency of PE is still very low. Meanwhile, it was reported that the editing efficiency of PE system was various in different species (Lu et al., 2022), which could be related to the expression level of PE effecter protein and pegRNA in different species. Second, the ratio of off-target editing is needed to be reduced and the mechanism of off-target editing is needed to be clarified.",

In CHAnGE, guide sequence and the homologous recombination (HDR) template were arranged and synthesized in a single oligonucleotide, and a oligonucleotide library of 24,765 unique guide sequences targeting 6,459 ORFs was synthesized on a chip and then assembled into a vector [pCRCT, harboring iCas9, tracrRNA expression cassettes and a promoter for sgRNA expression, as reported in HI-CRISPR system (Bao et al., 2015)] to build a pool of plasmids. This plasmid pool was then used to create a genome-wide gene disruption collection, in which more than 98% of target sequences were efficiently edited with an average  (Bao et al., 2018). In parallel, Jakociunas et al. employed error-prone PCR to generate DNA mutant libraries as donor, and used Cas9-mediated genome integration to introduce mutations at single-or multi-loci with efficiencies reaching 98-99%, for robust directed evolution (Jakociunas et al., 2018b). Besides, large chromosomal fragment deletion methods were developed based on CRISPR/Cas9 system. Easmin developed a guide RNA-transient expression system (gRNA-TES), where two sgRNA expression fragments (locating to each end of target region on genome) and DNA donor containing CgLEU2 were cotransformed into host for a replacement of up to 500-kb regions with efficiencies of 67-100% (Easmin et al., 2019). \n\nIn multi-loci editing using CRISPR systems, co-expression of many sgRNAs often requires repetitive DNA sequences (e.g., repeated promoters/terminators and guide RNA scaffolds), which possibly triggers genetic instability and phenotype loss.",

One exception to this occurs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where gene replacements (or 'editing') can be achieved by transforming into cells fewer than 40 nucleotides of sequence divided on either side of a selectable marker. The high proportion of homologous targeting of exogenous DNA into the S. cerevisiae genome is one reason why yeast is such a powerful experimental tool. Indeed, relatively soon after its genome sequence was completed, every gene in the organism was deleted and those sets of mutants made available to researchers [2,3]. Likewise, by using homologous integration all proteins were tagged with green fluorescent protein to understand subcellular protein localizations [4] and epitope-tagged to facilitate the global analysis of protein complexes [5]. Thus, it might be suggested that CRISPR-Cas9 is merely bringing other organisms up to the experimental levels enjoyed by the yeast research community; however, this gene editing system is already considerably beyond just a tool for making genetic changes. \n\nControversy resolves around CRISPR gene editing due to definitions about what constitutes 'genetic modification' . We have been eating or using genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for thousands of years, with those modifications introduced by classical plant and animal selection and breeding efforts or the more recent rise of using transgenes in organisms to alter their traits. Pharmaceutical products have been produced with recombinant DNA technology for many decades. However, because the end result of gene editing can be free of any foreign DNA, and, if generated using recombinant Cas9 protein and RNA, have been made without even the use of DNA, CRISPR challenges previous concepts of 'genetically modified' . Regulatory agencies are clearly scrambling to keep up with the technology.",

This has contributed to a 2.5-fold increase in \u03b2-carotene and an improved presence of endoglucanase on yeast surface. The ideal genome editing method for achieving any desired modification with minimal adverse effects is still a work in progress. Nevertheless, unlike previous methods, prime editing has implemented exogenous reverse transcriptase action to \"write\" DNA modifications directly to genomic DNA using a programmable RNA nickase linked to a reverse transcriptase and prime editing guide RNA (Anzalone et al., 2019). Both the genomic target and the sequence may be edited using approaches. By creating a powerful, inducible, broad-spectrum vector-based mutagenesis system that amplifies mutations above baseline and exceeds the mutation efficiencies and range of commonly used in vivo and in vitro approach, a mechanismdriven approach could have advantages over current methods as it offers improved random mutagenesis in cells with control, genomic stability, improved efficiency, and wider mutation spectra.",

The principle is based on the mechanism of bacterial resistance to the invasion of foreign phage DNA (Sander & Joung, 2014). Compared with ZFNs and TALENs, CRISPR/Cas has the advantages of simple operation, a short operating cycle and low technical requirements for the operator. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been successfully applied in diverse organisms including but not limited to humans (Drost et al., 2015), mice (Aida et al., 2015), zebrafish (Varshney et al., 2016), C. elegans (Shen et al., 2014), rice (Yin et al., 2017), E. coli (Jiang et al., 2013), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Brune, Kunze-Schumacher & Kolling, 2019), Chlamydomonas chloroplasts (Yoo et al., 2020).\n\nFor gene editing in E. coli, a three-plasmid system with highly efficient recombination was developed (Pyne et al., 2015). Subsequently, a two-plasmid system was constructed which included pCas containing the Cas9 protein and pTargetF containing the sgRNA (single guide RNA) (Jiang et al., 2015). However, the two-plasmid system still requires two steps in the process of curing the plasmid. To facilitate operation, a single-plasmid system was constructed which included Cas9 and sgRNA on one plasmid and it could be cured in one step by a temperature-sensitive element (Zhao et al., 2016). The CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing technology has been used in various articles for the purposes of deleting or replacing different virulence genes. However, we have not read any report on the editing of Escherichia coli virulence genes yet. At present, only genetic engineering model strains such as E. coli K12, DH5\u03b1 and BL21 have been selected for CRISPR research. ETEC is one of the leading causes of bacterial diarrhea in",

            "text": "Editing efficiency refers to the proportion of strains that achieve successful editing of target genes (Ruiping et al., 2019). Low editing efficiency is a common problem in the CRISPR/Cas9 system for edible fungi, which can be attributed to various reasons, including low transformation efficiency and regeneration efficiency of host material (Li et al., 2017), low expression level of Cas9 or sgRNA (Foster et al., 2018;Wang and Coleman, 2019), low targeting efficiency of sgRNA (Schuster et al., 2016;Xiao-tian et al., 2021) and low precision repair ratio (Yuan et al., 2017). \n\nThe optimization scheme can be considered from the following aspects: (1) Optimizing the genetic transformation system. It is necessary to establish stable and efficient genetic transformation systems (Li et al., 2017) given the complex cell wall structures of edible fungi. Combining multiple wall lytic enzymes under different digestion conditions may result in higher quality protoplasts (Liu X. et al., 2022). ( 2) Optimizing Cas9 expression and the sgRNA transcription strategy (Xuping et al., 2019). The insufficient expression of Cas9 is usually caused by the presence of rare codons. Therefore, codon optimization for target species is necessary (Liu et al., 2015;Ullah et al., 2020). Numerous facts prove that codon optimization makes the Cas9 gene more efficiently expressed in specific species (Schuster et al., 2016;Qin et al., 2017;Chen et al., 2018;Wang et al., 2021;Liu X. et al., 2022). In addition, incorporating a suitable nuclear localization sequence to Cas9 protein is conducive to the specific expression of Cas9 protein in the nucleus of edible fungi, thereby improving the editing efficiency to a certain extent (Shi et al., 2019;Ullah et al., 2020). \n\n(3) The targeting efficiency of sgRNA affects the editing efficiency of CRISPR. Currently, there are many online tools to assist in the design of sgRNA for reference to select the optimal sgRNA. The related websites are shown in Table 2. (4) Selecting the appropriate promoter.",

            "text": "\u22123 CRISPR/Cas9 is a part of the adaptive immunity of bacteria and archaea, which eliminates foreign genetic material (invading bacteriophages). 3 It is adapted from bacteria and is repurposed as a ground-breaking technique that allows scientists to edit regions of the genome by deleting, inserting, or modifying DNA sequences. CRISPR/Cas9 is a simple twocomponent system that consists of two RNAs (CRISPR RNA or crRNA, Tracer RNA or tracrRNA) and a single protein called Cas9. Engineering the crRNA only is sufficient to target particular DNA sequences using the CRISPR/Cas9 tool. 4,5 hus, contrary to other protein-guided genome-editing tools such as ZFNs and TALENs, which require intensive protein engineering, CRISPR/Cas9 is a simple, affordable, and, more importantly, efficient tool for genome editing. 1 Application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology can introduce site-specific mutations, knock out disease-causing genes, perform specific gene knock-ins, change gene expression levels, and much more. 1 These can be accomplished by using a single guide RNA (sgRNA: crRNA fused to the tracrRNA) that has exact complementarity to the gene of interest and a Cas9 endonuclease that cleaves the specific sequence of interest. 4,6 ne of the most remarkable applications of CRISPR/Cas9 technology was reported by He Jiankui in November 2018, when twin girls \"Lulu and Nana\" had their embryos genetically modified by the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-editing technique. 7 The girls were born to an HIV-positive father and an HIV-negative mother and were claimed to be resistant to HIV via editing of their chemokine receptor (CCR5) gene. 7 CR5 encodes a protein that HIV uses to invade host cells; therefore, specific mutations were introduced into the CCR5 gene that would confer innate HIV resistance to the bacteria. 7 Although this germline gene editing in humans raised ethical concerns, 8 the immense potential of CRISPR/Cas9 in curing genetic disease and thus improving human life in the future is undeniable.",

This precision is essential for therapeutic probiotic development. CRISPR-Cas9 is frequently utilized because it creates double-strand breaks at precise DNA locations, which are repaired by NHEJ or HDR processes. This method allows regulated genetic alterations to improve probiotic efficacy in various applications. Engineering probiotics with targeted genome editing addresses complex disease pathways. A type I-E CRISPR-Cas system has been added to Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), a model probiotic, to target and degrade antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and reduce gut microbiome ARG transmission. This change promotes therapeutic efficacy and clinical safety. CRISPR systems are tailored to reduce off-target effects, ensuring therapeutic safety. Beyond Cas9, other Cas proteins like Cas12 have wider protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) compatibility, making probiotic genome targeting more flexible. The diversity of CRISPR-Cas subtypes, including type I and type II systems, expands the toolkit for editing a wide range of probiotic species, supporting the idea of probiotics as \"living therapeutics\" that dynamically respond to host environmental cues.

Among various CRISPR-Cas systems, Cas9 and Cas12a are widely used in genetic and metabolic engineering. In filamentous fungi, both Cas9 and Cas12a have been utilized as CRISPR nucleases. In this work we first compared efficacies and types of genetic edits for CRISPR-Cas9 and -Cas12a systems at the polyketide synthase (albA) gene locus in Aspergillus niger. By employing a tRNA-based gRNA polycistronic cassette, both Cas9 and Cas12a have demonstrated remarkable editing efficacy. Cas12a demonstrated superiority over Cas9 protein when one gRNA was used for targeting, achieving an editing efficiency of 89.5% compared to 15% for Cas9. Moreover, when employing two gRNAs for targeting, both systems achieved up to 100% editing efficiency for single gene editing. In addition, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been reported to induce large genomic deletions in various species. However, its use for engineering large chromosomal segments deletions in filamentous fungi still requires optimization. Here, we engineered Cas9 and - Cas12a-induced large genomic fragment deletions by targeting various genomic regions of A. niger ranging from 3.5 kb to 40 kb. Our findings demonstrate that targeted engineering of large chromosomal segments can be achieved, with deletions of up to 66.7% efficiency. Furthermore, by targeting a secondary metabolite gene cluster, we show that fragments over 100 kb can be efficiently and specifically deleted using the CRISPR-Cas9 or -Cas12a system. Overall, in this paper, we present an efficient multi-gRNA genome editing system utilizing Cas9 or Cas12a that enables highly efficient targeted editing of genes and large chromosomal regions in A. niger.",

Daily routine benefits from a fast and affordable technique that is additionally easy in application. Thus, the \"yeast community\" has developed a number of variants of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology that allow for a convenient application of the system [1].\n\nA functional CRISPR/Cas9 system consists of two components-the Cas9 endonuclease and a guide RNA (gRNA). The Cas9 protein binds the gRNA, which contains a 5'-terminal 20 bp targeting sequence, to form a functional protein-RNA complex. By this means, Cas9 is enabled to scan DNA targets such as genomic DNA in a gRNA-guided manner for sequences (so-called protospacer sequences) that are identical to the specific gRNA-targeting sequence. Identified target sequences are cleaved by the Cas9 endonuclease if a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) follows the protospacer sequence within the genome. Early plasmid-based approaches employed separate vectors for expressing Cas9 and the gRNA. Thereby, gRNA cassette-encoding plasmids had to be cloned every time from scratch to target a new gene locus, resulting in an inconvenient overall procedure. Consecutive transformations of the Cas9 expression plasmid and the gRNA-encoding plasmid (plus donor DNA where applicable) were necessary to yield efficient gene disruption or genomic integration of the donor DNA since the overall efficiency suffers from the multiplicative linking of the efficiency of the PCR applications or any other conventional in vitro cloning method. A second improvement should help to overcome limitations of transformation efficiency that result from co-transforming of multiple system components (donor DNA and gRNA/Cas9 encoding elements) which is an essential step of all so far published CRISPR/Cas9 technology variants. In our system, we introduce the gRNA protospacer sequence into the plasmid by in vivo recombination-based cloning and use yeast cells derived from a single clone for a second transformation with the respective donor DNA. Thus, every single yeast cell used for this second transformation should be already preloaded with all",

            "text": "While, the endogenous type I Cas systems are most frequent present in bacterial genomes [16]. Thus, the development of endogenous type I CRISPR-Cas systembased genome-editing tools might help to improve the efficiencies. Recently, heterologous CRISPR-Cas9 system [17], CRISPR-Cpf1 [18] and endogenous subtype I-F CRISPR-Cas system [19] have been used to edit Z. mobilis genome. The endogenous I-F system showed higher efficiency than the heterogenous CRISPR-Cas9 or Cpf1 systems in Z. mobilis [19], providing a powerful toolkit for diverse genome engineering purposes, including gene mutation, large-fragment deletion, and simultaneous multiple gene editing, which greatly benefit further study in this species. \n\nIn general, target DNA cleaved by CRISPR nucleases can be repaired via homology-directed repair (HDR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway [20] or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathway [21][22][23]. The error-prone NHEJ repair system is often most prevalent in eukaryotes rather than prokaryotic genomes [24]. Therefore, HDR pathway is widely used for genome-editing in prokaryotes, but requiring cloning of additional homologous arms in editing plasmids, which hinders quick assessment of the gene functions in vivo. Recently, we have demonstrated that a MMEJ pathway present in Z. mobilis efficiently repaired the endogenous CRISPR-mediated genomic DNA damage [25]. In this study, we developed a genetic tool based on the endogenous CRISPR-Cas system and the MMEJ pathway to manipulate the genes in vivo by transformation of a shuttle vector only carrying the \"Repeat-Spacer-Repeat\" expression cassette, providing a simple and quick method to evaluate the gene functions in vivo.",

            "text": "CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) systems are adaptive immune systems widely distributed across bacteria and archaea, designed to destroy DNA of invading mobile genetic elements (1). These immune systems, in which endonucleases are guided by single stranded RNA to find their target DNA, have been turned into powerful genome editing tools over the past few years (2,3). The rapid implementation of CRISPRbased DNA editing systems has tremendously improved molecular toolboxes for a broad spectrum of organisms, ranging from simple prokaryotes to metazoan animals (4). By increasing the speed of genetic engineering, CRISPRbased systems have already impacted the field of microbial biotechnology (5)(6)(7). The push towards sustainable alternatives to oil-derived chemicals requires the construction of powerful microbial cell factories that can produce new chemicals, using unnatural substrates at high yields and rates, under harsh industrial conditions. Constructing such advanced cell factories requires extensive and fast genetic engineering strategies, that enable to test various designs in search of the optimal genetic configuration. Even the tractable and genetically accessible model and industrial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has rapidly adopted CRISPR-aided DNA editing, making it a standard practice for strain construction (8)(9)(10). \n\nTwo classes of CRISPR systems have been identified based on the architecture of the CRISPR locus (11)(12)(13). Class II, to which the very popular Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) belongs, has been favoured for heterologous genome editing mainly due to the structural simplicity of its endonuclease formed of a single subunit (2). Like all CRISPR-based systems, SpCas9 requires an RNA molecule, called CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) to guide the nuclease towards the editing site (Figure 1). In addition, to target and edit DNA, SpCas9 requires another RNA fragment, the trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA), that binds to the crRNA and to SpCas9 (Figure 1).",

In S. coelicolor, the actlorf1 and redX genes were successfully knocked out using HDR in conjunction with CRISPR/Cas12a technology, and the single-gene editing efficiency ranged from 90 to 95% [93]. \n\nA CRISPR/Cas12a-based genome editing tool achieved multiple genome editing with high efficiency and was the first system that was applied for multiple genome editing in C. difficile [94]. Using the CRISPR/ Cas12a system to promote recombination via dsDNA cleavage together with \u03bb-Red recombinase, up to 3 heterologous genes were simultaneously inserted into multiple sites of the E. coli genome [95]. \n\nAlthough the S. pyogenes (Sp) CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used in various bacteria, expressing the system in some species results in bacterial cell death [96]. Hence, it is necessary to use CRISPR/Cas12a-mediated genome editing technology for some bacteria. In C. glutamicum, researchers successfully induced a 50 bp deletion in the crtYf gene through CRISPR/Cas12a-assisted recombination engineering, with an editing efficiency of approximately 15%. Moreover, the editing efficiency for a 17 bp deletion increased to 40%, and that of 2 nucleotide substitutions in argR was 100%. However, this method failed to produce a 500 bp deletion (Table 3).",

            "text": "The CRISPR/Cas9 system enables the editing of genomes of numerous organisms through the induction of the double-strand breaks (DSB) at specific chromosomal targets. We improved the CRISPR/Cas9 system to ease the direct introduction of a point mutation or a tagging sequence into the chromosome by combining it with the noncanonical homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) based genome editing in fission yeast. We constructed convenient cloning vectors, which possessed a guide RNA (gRNA) expression module, or the humanized Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 gene that is expressed under the control of an inducible promoter to avoid the needless expression, or both a gRNA and Cas9 gene. Using this system, we attempted the short-homology-mediated genome editing and found that the HDR pathway provides high-frequency genome editing at target loci without the need of a long donor DNA. Using short oligonucleotides, we successfully introduced point mutations into two target genes at high frequency. We also precisely integrated the sequences for epitope and GFP tagging using donor DNA possessing short homology into the target loci, which enabled us to obtain cells expressing N-terminally tagged fusion proteins. This system could expedite genome editing in fission yeast, and could be applicable to other organisms.",

            "text": "A knock-in can be used for more efficient disruption of the target gene or stable expression of a gene at a specific location of the genome [45,61], which will be discussed in more detail. CRISPR/Cas9 has gained much attention not only from biologists who are actually working on it but also from the social media including the economic, legal, and industrial sectors [62], which is reflected by the heated legal battles for the patent of CRISPR/Cas9 [63,64]. This unprecedented attention is mainly due to its excellent potential as the next generation genome editing technique. CRISPR/Cas9 is simple, accurate and efficient compared to other editing techniques [7,61]. In addition, recombinant Cas9 protein can be assembled with single guide RNA (sgRNA) and delivered as ribonucleoproteins (Cas9 RNPs) into the cells [60,65]. Delivery of Cas9 RNPs can minimize off-targeting and thus cytotoxicity, and avoid the hassles of cloning markers and sgR-NAs. More importantly, the Cas9 nuclease activity can be assessed prior to the lengthy transformation process [60,65,66]. Cas9 RNPs, in contrast to vector-driven expression of Cas9 and sgRNAs, may also avoid conflicts from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) depending on the different legal systems [67][68][69]. Given the advantage of CRISPR/Cas9, this review will focus on it as the choice of genome editing techniques in microalgae. Lately many variations of different classes and types of CRISPR/ Cas9 have been reported [70], and thus, CRISPR will be reserved for the general term for all or any variations.",

            "text": "The efficiency of generating knockout cells was often low, necessitating significant effort and time for making knockout cell lines. To overcome this problem, Jin-Soo Kim's group at Seoul National University and our group developed and tested a reporter for zinc finger nuclease activity [1]. Using this reporter we were able to enrich for cells in which the target gene was disrupted by up to 92-fold. We next improved this reporter [2] and applied it to gene editing mediated by the CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease and again achieved enrichment using this system (often more than 10-fold) [3]. \n\nOur group also showed the possibility of \"safer\" genome editing using cell-penetrating peptides to achieve plasmidfree delivery of Cas9 protein and guide RNA. This approach reduces off-target effects and avoids mutagenesis caused by insertion of delivery vectors [4]. Based on these experiences in genome editing, Jin-Soo and I wrote a review article entitled \"A guide to genome engineering with programmable nucleases\" [5]. Our group also showed, using TALENs, that this gene-disruption approach can convert the blood group of erythroblasts from RhD positive to RhD negative [6]. \n\nCurrently, we are trying to improve and/or develop genome-wide nuclease libraries for disruption of coding and noncoding elements. Other ongoing projects in the lab include potential therapeutic applications of CRISPR-Cas9 to genetic eye and liver diseases. We are also interested in high-throughput approaches for evaluating the activity of CRISPR-Cas9 based on target sequences. We will continue our research to improve or develop genome editing tools for biomedical research and biotechnology and apply these advanced genome editing methods as therapeutic modalities for various diseases. \n\nWhat are your predictions for the field over the next 5 years? I expect that genome-editing technology will be continuously improved. The efficiency of genome editing will be enhanced and the range of tools will be widened. Currently, CRISPR-Cas9 is the dominant method for genome editing. However, new genome editing tools may emerge, which could be alternative or complementary to CRISPR-Cas9. \n\nI expect that issues associated with off-target nuclease activity may be a less significant problem in the future.",

            "text": "Abstract While CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing has transformed yeast research, current plasmids and cassettes for Cas9 and guide-RNA expression are species specific. CRISPR tools that function in multiple yeast species could contribute to the intensifying research on non-conventional yeasts. A plasmid carrying a pangenomic origin of replication and two constitutive expression cassettes for Cas9 and ribozyme-flanked gRNAs was constructed. Its functionality was tested by analyzing inactivation of the ADE2 gene in four yeast species. In two Kluyveromyces species, near-perfect targeting (\u226596%) and homologous repair (HR) were observed in at least 24% of transformants. In two Ogataea species, Ade\u2212 mutants were not observed directly after transformation, but prolonged incubation of transformed cells resulted in targeting efficiencies of 9% to 63% mediated by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). In an Ogataea parapolymorpha ku80 mutant, deletion of OpADE2 mediated by HR was achieved, albeit at low efficiencies (<1%). Furthermore the expression of a dual polycistronic gRNA array enabled simultaneous interruption of OpADE2 and OpYNR1 demonstrating flexibility of ribozyme-flanked gRNA design for multiplexing. While prevalence of NHEJ prevented HR-mediated editing in Ogataea, such targeted editing was possible in Kluyveromyces. This broad-host-range CRISPR/gRNA system may contribute to exploration of Cas9-mediated genome editing in other Saccharomycotina yeasts.",

            "text": "A. oryzae has been widely used to efficiently produce organic acids, industrial enzymes, and secondary metabolites, due to its efficient protein expression ability and posttranslational modification functions [29]. However, the problem of low expression of heterologous proteins is a bottleneck that cannot be ignored in the development and application of A. oryzae expression systems, and the complex and multi-level regulatory mechanisms are still unclear [30]. Therefore, establishing efficient genome editing tools is conducive to the faster and better development of A. oryzae cell factories and the analysis of their high-efficiency expression mechanisms. \n\nEstablishing an efficient genetic transformation system plays a fundamental role. According to the main components of the cell wall of A. oryzae, the types of mixed enzymes used in the preparation of protoplasts were optimized. Coupled with the optimization of the relevant conditions for protoplast preparation, good and high-quality protoplasts were finally obtained. \n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 editing system has an outstanding application prospect in A. oryzae. Currently, the editing efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in wild-type A. oryzae is 50-100% under screening pressure conditions [15]. However, in the construction of the A. oryzae expression system, the genes that need to be edited often do not have unique screening pressures. The acquisition of positive transformants still takes a lot of time and effort. In our study, the editing efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 system in single gene and double gene in A. oryzae was 17.5-37.6% under the condition of no screening pressure. Likewise, the editing efficiency can be increased to 100% by color or resistance-aided screening. Notably, the morphological gene yA can be used as an indicator marker for other gene editing, which is of great help for the rapid and precise acquisition of positive transformants in the gene editing of A. oryzae. \n\nAchieving simultaneous editing of multiple genes is beneficial to improve the use efficiency of selection markers and analyze the cooperation of many related genes [31]. Currently, the CRISPR/Cas system has progressed in multi-gene editing in filamentous fungi.",

An open-source tool (http://yeastriction.tnw.tudelft.nl) is presented for identification of suitable Cas9 target sites in S. cerevisiae strains. A transformation strategy, using in vivo assembly of a guideRNA plasmid and subsequent genetic modification, was successfully implemented with high accuracies. An alternative strategy, using in vitro assembled plasmids containing two gRNAs, was used to simultaneously introduce up to six genetic modifications in a single transformation step with high efficiencies. Where previous studies mainly focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene inactivation, we demonstrate the versatility of CRISPR/Cas9-based engineering of yeast by achieving simultaneous integration of a multigene construct combined with gene deletion and the simultaneous introduction of two single-nucleotide mutations at different loci.

            "text": "Table 1 provides an overview of the existing literature on phage genome editing using various CRISPR-Cas systems. Among the 14 studies listed in the table, the majority (10 studies) employed the DPMSR strategy, which utilizes the CRISPR system to enhance the recombination process and achieve higher editing efficiency. Notably, the VI-A (Cas13a) CRISPR system, which targets RNA (Gootenberg et al., 2017), was utilized in two related studies employing the SPMAR strategy for counter-selection purposes (Adler et al., 2022;Guan et al., 2022). However, no significant differences in editing efficiency have been reported when using these two different strategies for DNA-targeting CRISPR systems. Zhang et al. successfully used both strategies to delete a 292 bp gene fragment in the bacteriophage genome using an exogenous CRISPR-Cas9 system in V. natriegens TT4. The editing efficiency obtained with both strategies was high and similar (Zhang X. et al., 2022). \n\nFive types of CRISPR systems, namely II-A (CRISPR-Cas9), I-E (CRISPR-Cas3), III-A (CRISPR-Cas10), V (CRISPR-Cas12a), and VI-A (CRISPR-Cas13a), have been utilized for phage genome modifications (Table 1). The CRISPR systems II-A (CRISPR-Cas9) and I-E (CRISPR-Cas3) represent early-stage CRISPR systems that have undergone extensive research and development. They were  among the first CRISPR systems employed for gene editing in phages. \n\nThe CRISPR-Cas3 system involves multiple genes and proteins that interact with each other (Yosef et al., 2015), and it is characterized by low efficiency and operational challenges. Consequently, research on its application for phage gene editing remains limited. Kiro et al. introduced the Type I-E CRISPR-Cas System into Escherichia coli for engineering bacteriophages using the counter-selection method (SPMAR), resulting in a relatively low editing efficiency of 17 out of 44 plaques exhibiting the desired gene deletion (Kiro et al., 2014).",

            "text": "A type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system of Streptococcus pyogenes, derived from the bacterial adaptive immune system has been developed into convenient genome engineering tools for diverse organisms, such as Escherichia coli (Jiang et al., 2015), Streptomyces spp. (Cobb et al., 2014), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (DiCarlo et al., 2013), mice (Shen et al., 2013), Bomyx mori (Wang et al., 2013), Drosophila (Bassett et al., 2013), crop plants (Shan et al., 2013), and human cell lines (Mali et al., 2013). The CRISPR/Cas9 system requires the CRISPR-associated protein (Cas9), a trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), and a CRISPR RNA (crRNA). A synthetic single guide RNA (sgRNA) is constructed by fusing together the tracrRNA and the crRNA. The endonuclease Cas9 and sgRNA, including a 20 bp target sequence, which is decided by protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), are enough to make a double-strand DNA break (DSB) in a specific region of the genome (Jinek et al., 2012;Barrangou and Marraffini, 2014). The DSB can be repaired using two mechanisms-the homology directed repair (HDR) and the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). For the HDR pathway, donor DNA fragment that is homologous to the region flanking DSB site is required to repair the cleavage site. The NHEJ system repairs the broken end without the donor DNA and results in the insertion or deletion (indel) mutations. The CRISPR/Cas9 systems can provide an efficient tool for editing the genome (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014). \n\nSeveral types of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing system have been reported in B. subtilis, including chromosomeintegrated method, single-, or two-plasmid systems (Hong et al., 2018).",

            "text": "The strong inducibility of P 1,2-PD made it an ideal candidate for genetic engineering. \n\nBased on the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system established by Huang et al., the promoter P thl controlling the expression of cas9 was replaced with P 1,2-PD (10) (Fig. 2A). This substitution enabled the efficient construction and propagation of gene deletion plasmids in E. coli, offering immediate results. To assess the editing efficiency of the modified system, four genes, namely, pyrE (CLJU_RS17570, encoding an oro tate phosphoribosyltransferase), pduS (CLJU_RS19590, Table 1), aor2 (CLJU_RS09915, encoding an aldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase), and eutT (CLJU_RS19610, Table 1), were individually targeted for gene knockout (Table 2). The presence of gene dele tion mutants in the transformant colonies was confirmed by colony PCR and further sequencing. All the four genes were deleted with 100% efficiency (Fig. 2B through E). \n\nNotably, we employed two gRNAs targeting the acsA gene (CLJU_RS18495) for gene deletion. One gRNA demonstrated an editing efficiency of 100%, whereas the other resulted in no edited cells among the three clones tested (Fig. 2F). This observation highlighted the importance of gRNA targeting efficiency for successful gene editing. Furthermore, to address the issue of the large sizes of all-in-one plasmids and facilitate gene insertion, the cas9 gene was integrated into the genome under the tight control of P choline1 . For the cas9 integration plasmid, the gRNA targeting the P choline1 was under the control of the P araE promoter (10). The cas9 gene as part of the donor  DNA was cloned between the relevant LHA and RHA (Fig. 3A). Additionally, to prevent the cleavage of the donor DNA by Cas9, the RBS of the P thl instead of the native RBS of P choline1 was used.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is one of the most widely used cellular factories for the production of biofuels and bulk chemicals, such as ethanol, higher alcohols, fatty acids, amino acids, shikimate-derivatives, terpenoids, polyketides and polymer precursors such as 1,4-butanediol (Yang et al., 2021). Metabolic engineering for the production of these biochemicals requires extensive modulation of cellular metabolism for increased productivity. Genome editing requires efficient tools to perform timesaving sequential or multiplex manipulations. \n\nMany gene-editing tools are available for E. coli, but all of them have specific strengths and shortcomings. Recombineering using double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) for genetic engineering often needs selectable markers, which should be eliminated in the following step for subsequent modifications (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000;Sharan et al., 2009). Compared with dsDNA, the efficiency of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-mediated recombineering is much higher, and it has been further developed into gene editing tools for multiplex editing such as Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) (Wang et al., 2009) and trackable multiplex recombineering (TRMR) (Warner et al., 2010). However, these methods are not suitable for multiple targeted gene insertions over 20 bp without selectable markers, and usually require robust high-throughput screening methods (Li et al., 2015). \n\nThe recently developed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/ CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) system is widely used for genetic engineering of E. coli, which has greatly promoted its application. A mature CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) duplex (or a single synthetic guide RNA, sgRNA), or only a crRNA, guides the Cas nuclease(s) to cleave a target DNA sequence with a required protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) (Jiang et al., 2013). The mechanisms of different types of CRISPR systems have been summarized in our previously article (Liu et al., 2020).",

            "text": "Work in budding yeast has been instrumental in the field of synthetic genome engineering. The S. cerevisiae 2.0 project (Sc2.0) aims to create the entire yeast genome de novo with a variety of designed modifications (removal of introns, grouping of tRNAs, introduction of loxP recombination sites, telomere modifications, etc.) [57]. While this project has relied mainly on traditional HRdirected integration of artificial chromosomal segments in place of the native sequence, CRISPR/Cas9 allowed for repair of mutations found during this construction process [58]. Moreover, entire 1 Mb bacterial genomes (Mycoplasma and Escherichia) have been edited in vivo in yeast cells using CRISPR [59,60] (Figure 1E). Recent work in S. cerevisiae has also demonstrated the ability to utilize a combination of high-throughput automation, genome-scale engineering, and Cas9-based gene editing [61]. This group created standardized fragments of native yeast genes (either overexpression or knockdown using either sense or antisense transcripts in an RNAi active yeast background) and these constructs were all integrated at repetitive DNA sequences in the yeast genome using Cas9. However, this system is (currently) unable to target native loci; the development of genomewide collections of sgRNAs would provide the option to manipulate endogenous genomic sites. \n\nAt the interface of engineered yeast genomes and CRISPR-based editing, the first use of introduced artificial Cas9 target sites into the budding yeast genome was recently performed [28]. This application will likely have great utility as the use of synthetic genes (and",

A wide range of organisms have been probed, regulated, and manipulated for the creation of genetic KI, KO, and genetic modifications [91]. For example, E. coli and S. cerevisiae, the preferred model organisms when researchers investigate genome engineering have offered substantial benefits owing to their available whole genome sequences [92]. The most updated advances using the recombination systems are summarized. \n\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 system, originating from prokaryotes, has quickly become a revolutionary tool in genome engineering and made great difference in other organisms including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, plants, and mammalian cells [93][94][95][96][97]. In 2014, Bao et al. optimized CRISPR-Cas9 system for one-step multiple gene disruption in the model organism S. cerevisiae. A 100 bp dsDNA mutagenizing homologous recombination donor was inserted between two direct repeats for each target gene in a CRISPR array consisting of multiple donor and guide sequence pairs. This system is composed of a variant of wild-type Cas9, multi-copy plasmids, a homologyintegrated crRNA cassette, and tracrRNA. As a result, three genes of ade2 (encoding phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase), can1 (encoding plasma membrane arginine permease), and lyp1 (encoding lysine permease) were disrupted within 4 days simultaneously with the efficiency ranging from 27 to 87%. Then, another three genes of gcy1, atf2, and ypr1 (involved in an artificial hydrocortisone biosynthetic pathway) were disrupted simultaneously within 6 days with 100% efficiency, which demonstrated the high efficiency for multiple gene knock-outs [98]. One year later, an easier and faster strain construction method was developed for simultaneous introduction of multiple genetic modifications in S. cerevisiae. This method was consisted of assembled plasmids containing two gRNAs and several genetic modifications.",

            "text": "Technologies enabling efficient and precise genome editing render powerful tools for studying biology, and open new avenues for explorative endeavors in biomedicine and translational research. Until recently, genome engineering in cell and animal models relied on random mutagenesis, random insertion of transgenes, or inefficient targeting, which greatly limited scientific progress (Stanford et al. 2001;Yu and Bradley 2001;Austin et al. 2004;Gondo 2008). Over the past decade, genome editing technologies have undergone a rapid procession of improvements in efficiency and precision with the development of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) (Kim et al. 1996;Bibikova et al. 2003;Maeder et al. 2008), and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) (Christian et al. 2010;Boch 2011;Cermak et al. 2011). These tools are based on customizable DNA binding modules attached to nucleases for targeted chromosome breaks. More recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) associated protein 9 (Cas9) has emerged with great potential. In contrast to ZFNs and TALENs, which depend on protein-DNA interactions, the CRISPR/Cas9 system is based on the principle of engineering a single guide RNA (sgRNA) for base pairing with complementary DNA sequences for site-specific cleavage by the associated Cas9 protein complex (Gaj et al. 2013;Mali et al. 2013a, b;Sander and Joung 2014;Jiang and Marraffini 2015). \n\nThe inherent simplicity and flexibility imbued in the CRISPR/Cas9 architecture has propelled the system as the ideal genome engineering tool (Horvath and Barrangou 2010;Marraffini and Sontheimer 2010;Jinek et al. 2012;Wiedenheft et al. 2012;Cong et al. 2013;Mali et al. 2013a, b). As such, the system has been particularly useful for applications aimed at direct or conditional knockout of gene functions.",

            "text": "Biofuels are considered a valuable source for replacing fossil fuels, since it reduces the various undesirable impacts of fossil fuels. Biofuels offer the security, sustainability, and regional development, and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions [44]. The CRISPR-Cas system has been used to improve biofuel production. In this regard, CRISPR has been mainly used to inhibit the competitive metabolism pathways, improve the substrate utilization capacity, and reduce the metabolic flux towards enhancement in solvent production [103]. However, the heterologous CRISPR-Cas systems are frequently difficult to introduce into the prokaryote systems, since most of the microbes have native CRISPR-Cas that can potentially disrupt the exogenous CRISPR-Cas systems [80]. The idea of multiplex genome editing by CRISPR-Cas systems has emerged as a key step in this area of science, and in yeast, the initial multiplex genome editing was successfully reported shortly after the first application of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing [142,124]. Generally, there are several approaches to designing a CRISPR-Cas system for multiplex genome editing: (1) expression of several guide RNAs in a single guide RNA expression cassette, (2) expression of several of guide RNAs in multiple guide RNA expression cassette, and (3) expression of a single specific guide RNA to target and edit multiple sequences in the genome [83]. \n\nZhang et al., [140] introduced a novel technique for using CRISPR-Cas to edit the spo0A and pyrF, dehydrogenase (adhE1 or adhE2), and cat1 genes in Clostridium tyrobutyricum. Using this approach and to guarantee a successful transformation with higher editing efficiency, the Type I-B CRISPR-Cas of C. tyrobutyricum (PAM= TCA or TCG at the 5 \u2032 -end) under control of a lactose inducible promoter for CRISPR array expression (30-38 nt spacers) was used to reduce the toxicity of CRISPR-Cas. This novel multiplex genome editing system successfully deleted the spo0A and pyrF genes (editing efficiency =100%).",

CRISPR-Cas technology opens new avenues in genetic engineering applications by increasing expediency and efficiency in the generation of desired mutations, potentially without the necessity of plasmid integration, extensive screening, or counterselection (38). So far, CRISPR-Cas9 systems have been applied in a few bacterial species to edit their genomes, with more systems rapidly becoming available. Initially, the natural dual-RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 was used for genome editing (19,23), but recently, the engineered sgRNA CRISPR-Cas9 has been employed. In different approaches, the two components, Cas9 and sgRNA, can be either in two different plasmids (39) or in a single plasmid (40), and efficient genome editing has been achieved, such as deletions, insertions, and introduction of point mutations in Escherichia coli (39) and in Bacillus subtilis (40). In Streptomyces, a single-plasmid system with a temperature-sensitive pSG5 replicon was used for curing the plasmid after a successful series of deletions (41). Similarly, in Staphylococcus aureus, a temperature-sensitive two-vector system enables conditional recombineering and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated counterselection (42). To date, a number of studies have established CRISPR-Cas9 tools for genetic engineering in different bacteria, and this catalogue likely will continue to expand, enabling an increasing number of applications with advantages and limitations. In S. pneumoniae, a dual-RNA: Cas9 system, integrated in the chromosome, has been shown to perform insertions, deletions, or scarless single-nucleotide substitutions (19).\n\nIn this study, we have developed a replicative plasmid with a broad-host-range temperature-sensitive origin of replication carrying a concise CRISPR-Cas9-based system for advanced and markerless genome engineering in the bacterium S. pneumoniae. In particular, we demonstrate that we have successfully deleted genes and large chromosomal regions",

In S. cerevisiae, another dual-plasmid-based system was employed using a centromeric plasmid and a 2\u00b5 plasmid. In the centromeric plasmid, Cas9 can be expressed upon galactose induction. The gRNA containing 2\u00b5 plasmid can be eliminated by culturing the cells in nonselective medium (DiCarlo et al., 2013) for continuous genome editing. However, the current F. fujikuroi CRISPR-Cas system is a one-off system. For multi-gene editing, multiple gRNA expression cassettes have to be cloned into one plasmid to execute genetic engineering one time for all gene targets. The multi-gene disruption efficiency was also tested by Shi et al. The disruption efficiencies were 79.2, 10.8, and 4.2% for single, double and triple gene disruption, respectively. This result indicates that genetic manipulation for 3 genes or more would be very difficult in F. fujikuroi by this system. \n\nAnother type of CRISPR-Cas system has been developed for several non-fujikuroi fusaria, using the in vitro prepared Cas9 protein/gRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Transformation of in vitro prepared Cas9/gRNA RNPs has been claimed to be able to reduce the specific integration of the donor DNA, while the CRISPR elements can be degraded naturally after genetic manipulation (Wang et al., 2018). However, compared to the plasmid-transformation method, this RNPs-transformation method is more complicated in handling, as the Cas9 protein needs to be additionally purified and concentrated before the transformation. Ferrara et al. (2019) developed a CRISPR-Cas9 system for F. proliferatum by transforming in vitro-assembled dual Cas9 RNPs.",

            "text": "In this study, we targeted the development and evaluation of broad-host-range CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing tools in order to enhance the genetic-engineering capabilities of an industrially relevant methanotrophic biocatalyst. The CRISPR/Cas9 system developed in this study expands the genetic tools available to define molecular mechanisms in methanotrophic bacteria and has the potential to foster advances in the generation of novel biocatalysts to produce biofuels, platform chemicals, and high-value products from natural gas- and biogas-derived methane. Further, due to the broad-host-range applicability, these genetic tools may also enable innovative approaches to overcome the barriers associated with genetically engineering diverse, industrially promising nonmodel microorganisms. ABSTRACT Methanotrophic bacteria play a crucial role in the Earth\u2019s biogeochemical cycle and have the potential to be employed in industrial biomanufacturing processes due to their capacity to use natural gas- and biogas-derived methane as a sole carbon and energy source. Advanced gene-editing systems have the potential to enable rapid, high-throughput methanotrophic genetics and biocatalyst development. To this end, we employed a series of broad-host-range expression plasmids to construct a conjugatable clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene-editing system in Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). Heterologous coexpression of the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 endonuclease and a synthetic single guide RNA (gRNA) showed efficient Cas9 DNA targeting and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cleavage that resulted in cell death. We demonstrated effective in vivo editing of plasmid DNA using both Cas9 and Cas9D10A nickase to convert green fluorescent protein (GFP)- to blue fluorescent protein (BFP)-expressing cells with 71% efficiency. Further, we successfully introduced a premature stop codon into the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) hydroxylase component-encoding mmoX gene with the Cas9D10A nickase, disrupting sMMO function. These data provide proof of concept for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene",

These advances are of particular relevance in the case of multicellular organisms such as Trichoderma, given that genetic modification based on traditional methods is rarely as straightforward as that in unicellular microorganisms (including bacteria and yeasts), owing to complex cellular differentiation, thick chitinous cell walls, and lack of self-replicating vectors (Jiang et al., 2013). \n\nAmong the more recent advances in genetic engineering, the use of artificially engineered nucleases is an effective approach for investigating the function of genes and proteins (Tomico-Cuenca et al., 2021). In Trichoderma, these nuclease-based editing tools mainly include clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) RNA-guided Cas9 (CRISPR-Cas9; de Souza Maia Filho et al., 2017) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENS; Liu et al., 2015). Compared to TALENs and other editing strategies, CRISPR-Cas gene editing methods are currently the most efficient, convenient, and widely used for genome engineering (Burgess, 2013). \n\nThe discovery and manipulation of CRISPR and Cas genes has accelerated recent developments in flexible, cost-effective genomic engineering toolkits based on the programmable targeting of CRISPR-Cas technologies (Deveau et al., 2010). Researchers have employed CRISPR-Cas to modify the genomes of a diverse range of organisms by introducing double-strand breaks (DSBs; Burgess, 2013), which activate sequence variations (insertions, deletions, and rare substitutions near DNA cleavage sites) conducted by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ); precise sequence alterations conducted by homology-directed repair (HDR) with the endogenous repair pathways (artificial supply of repair template; Horwitz et al., 2015).",

            "text": "However, acceptable rates of recombination only occur when long homology regions (0.5-1 kb) are used, making this method less efficient in the absence of the KU70 gene deletion (Madzak, 2015). Another hurdle in efficient genome-editing in Y. lipolytica lies in the fact that it has a lessdefined non-coding RNA processing system. To solve this challenge, Schwartz et al. (2016) has used a hybrid tRNA promoter to express gRNA, allowing for efficient CRISPR-Cas9 targeting in Yarrowia. Alternatively, Gao et al. (2016) demonstrated that the Type II RNA polymerase, in combination with the highly efficient hammerhead ribozyme and HDV ribozyme, could efficiently deliver gRNA and achieved multiplex genome-editing in Y. lipolytica. \n\nIn addition to genome-editing tools, advances have been made to develop a multi-copy, plasmid-based gene expression system, which is suitable for gene-expression fine-tuning due to the simplicity of plasmid construction and high transformation efficiency compared to the laborious and time-consuming genome manipulation process (Liu et al., 2014;Madzak, 2015). For example, Liu et al. engineered the low-copy CEN plasmid by fusing different promoters upstream of the centromeric region and improved both the copy number and gene expression level (Liu et al., 2014). \n\nIn light of these advances, there is a pressing need for development of facile genetic tools that are tailored for modular and combinatorial pathway engineering in Y. lipolytica (Xu et al., 2013a;Xu and Koffas, 2013). Indeed, metabolic engineering community has embraced the concepts of standardization and modularization to enable rapid construction of large pathway libraries covering a broad range of gene expression space (Xu et al., 2013b(Xu et al., , 2014a(Xu et al., , 2014b)). This is often achieved by creating interoperable genetic parts with well-defined gene expression metrics.

            "text": "The majority of studies discussed in this review relied on naturally occurring CRISPR-Cas variants for genome editing. Although being efficient at knocking-out targeted genes, some studies reported certain non-desired effects, such as impaired cell growth characteristics [24,83,101,118]. One of the possible reasons could be the off-target effects of utilized Cas9 nuclease which is commonly observed in other mammalian cell lines [162]. Several different approaches can overcome this issue. The use of a preassembled Cas9 and sgRNA complex in CHO cells reported by Lee et al. [163] offers an alternative approach with natural Cas9 variants but with minimized risk of random integration into unwanted genome regions together with reduced off-target effects [164]. Recent developments of synthetic Cas variants, such as CRISPR base editors, provide CRISPR tools with enhanced precision in editing DNA. CRISPR base editors represent a combination of catalytically impaired Cas nuclease, gRNA, and a base modification enzyme operating on single-stranded DNA without generating DSBs [165]. \n\nAlthough not yet extensively used in CHO cell line engineering, the reported improved efficiency and lower cytotoxicity of Cas9 nickase and dCas9 PmCDA1-mediated base editing compared to Cas9 KO [34] may lead to the broader exploitation of this approach in CHO cell line engineering in the future. Moreover, the CRISPR toolbox in CHO cell line engineering has recently been expanded to include the engineered Cas variants Mad7, also known as ErCas12a, in CHO cells [166]. \n\nThe increasing complexity of therapeutic proteins requires an enhanced performance of expression systems. Therefore, the development of systems allowing efficient modulation of multiple cellular pathways is foreseen in CHO cell line engineering. Simultaneous use of orthogonal Cas variants possessing different PAM sequence requirements, as shown by Schmieder et al. [23], will likely broaden the number of genes targeted within the same cell. Moreover, Cas12a is capable of processing its pre-crRNA, making it suitable for multiplexed genome editing and genome screening [154,167]. Similarly, RNA ribonuclease Cas13 can process crRNA array making it applicable for multiplex gene knockdown [36].",

            "text": "Putative BGCs can be evaluated either through activation in the native producer or expression in a heterologous host. In-situ activation of putative BGCs has been greatly advanced by recently developed multiplexed genome editing tools (Table 2). The new generation of genome editing tools based on the CRISPR-Cas technology has the advantages of high efficiency, fast operation and high fidelity. It is the mainstream technology of multiplexed genome engineering at present, especially using the type II CRISPR-Cas9 or CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) gene editing technology. For example, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knock-in of the kasOp* for activation of silent BGCs has been reported and successfully discovered several novel pathways and NPs in Streptomyces species [30]. Moreover, multiplexed automated genome engineering has been reported with the capacity to simultaneously regulate the expression levels of twenty genes, and generate 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic mutations per day [31]. However, the use of CRISPR-Cas technology in most chassis cells requires the introduction of external sources of Cas protein, which can cause cytotoxicity. In order to solve this problem, researchers have developed genome editing technology based on the microbe's endogenous CRISPR-Cas system in multiple microorganisms, such as Sulfolobus islandicus, Haloarcula hispanica, Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Clostridium pasteurianum, Lactobacillus crispatus and Zymomonas mobilis [32]. These systems allow fast genome engineering including gene insertion, deletion, regulation and single base editing, with the editing efficiency in some cases reaching 100%, and will not be affected by the toxicity of exogenous Cas protein [33].",

Both lines of research require an effective editing of the native genetic elements or the inclusion of heterologous pathways into the yeast genome. Although S. cerevisiae is a well-known host with several molecular biology tools available, a more precise tool is still needed. The clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats\u2013associated Cas9 (CRISPR-Cas9) system is a current, widespread genome editing tool. The implementation of a reprogrammable, precise, and specific method, such as CRISPR-Cas9, to edit the S. cerevisiae genome has revolutionized laboratory practices.

            "text": "A multitude of genetic tools discussed above have accelerated metabolic engineering and the understanding of basic acetogen physiology. The majority of developed tools, however, still have some bottlenecks associated with a time-consuming mutant isolation process caused by low HR efficiency as well as inevitable scars left in the genome [30,31,36]. Recently, the CRISPR-Cas system has been extensively used as a tool for rapid, highly efficient, and markerless genetic editing in several model organisms [76][77][78]. Among the five CRISPR types [79], type II CRISPR-Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized system and has been successfully applied in C. autoethanogenum [40], C. ljungdahlii [32,41,43], and E. limosum [44,45]. \n\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of a Cas9 effector protein, which recognizes a 20 bp DNA sequence adjacent to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), \"NGG\", guided by an RNA duplex composed of fused CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) or engineered single guide RNA (sgRNA). When directed to a target site within the genome, Cas9 introduces double-stranded breaks (DSBs). In most prokaryotes, DSBs can be repaired by HR based on the donor DNA plasmid (Figure 1D). To fully exploit this system, Cas9 and sgRNA should be expressed at appropriate levels because Cas9 has intrinsic toxicity and the resulting DSBs can lead to cell death before recombination can occur. Due to the limited availability of well-established genetic parts or inducible promoters for acetogens, some studies have screened inducible promoters to tightly control Cas9 expression. For example, in C. autoethanogenum, the initial attempt to express Cas9 under a native strong constitutive promoter was not successful, likely due to toxicity caused by its uncontrolled expression.",

The new IPL12 tetracycline-inducible promoter significantly increased the efficiency of Cas9-mediated genome editing. Even with screening a relatively small library, promoters with a wide range of expression strengths ranging between the original tet3no to the strong IPL12 promoter were obtained. The developed promoter library has the added potential of expanding the prospective applications of this approach in the metabolic engineering of acetogens. \n\nWith our modifications, we achieved >50 % efficiency in gene deletion, which is comparable to the efficiencies reported in other Clostridia. The efficiency of CRISPR/ Cas9 system adapted for Clostridium beijerinckii is unclear [15,27]. However, Li et al. reported editing efficiencies of up to 100 % in C. beijerinckii and Clostridium acetobutylicum with the use of nickase variant of cas9 [18]. In Clostridium cellulolyticum, gene deletions were only possible with an engineered nickase variant of cas9 as the wild-type cas9 could not be introduced in C. cellulolyticum [14]. The use of an inducible promoter to control the expression of wild-type cas9 would have probably been sufficient to overcome the problem of expressing wild-type cas9 in C. cellulolyticum. Likewise, combining an engineered nickase with the inducible promoter may add additional benefit. In Clostridium ljungdahlii, gene deletions with 50-100 % efficiency have been reported with a single-plasmid system comprising both cas9 and guide RNA expression cassettes with Pthl and ParaE constitutive promoters driving the expression of cas9 and guide RNA, respectively [17].",

            "text": "While for laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae several molecular methods have allowed extensive interpretation of gene functionality, industrial and wild yeast strains are still poorly studied; indeed, the genetic manipulation of latter yeasts can be time consuming because of they are usually recalcitrant to some molecular techniques and they are characterized by complex genomes (i.e., diploid and polyploid species). For this reason, the development of a rapid and efficient gene-targeting system based on the type II bacterial Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR associated protein (CRISPR-Cas9) system is gaining attention in several industrial fields. Taking advantage of the high efficiency of homologous recombination (HR) in yeast, this system allows for double strand breaks and simultaneous gene editing of all copies of the target sequence (Gratz et al., 2013).\n\nThe CRISPR/Cas system, first discovered in Escherichia coli, is present in many eubacteria and archaea where it can provide resistance to bacteriophage or conjugative plasmids (Barrangou et al., 2007;Hryhorowicz et al., 2017). Foreign invading genetic material that is incorporated between CRISPR repeat sequences is transcribed and processed into CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that correspond to both foreign and CRISPR repeat DNA. The crRNAs hybridize with transactivating CRISPR RNAs (tracrRNAs) and the resulting crRNA/tracrRNA complex acts as a guide for the endonuclease Cas9, which cleaves invading nucleic acid sequences (Brouns, 2012;DiCarlo et al., 2013).\n\nThe main elements of the CRISPR/Cas9 system we used are a bacterial CRISPR-associated protein nuclease (Cas9), from Streptococcus pyogenes, and a short RNA guide. This latter element combines with Cas9 to target a specific DNA locus composed by 20 nucleotides and a NGG sequence, called protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), where the cleavage occurs in the nuclease domains RuvC and HNH (Mahfouz et al., 2014).

CRISPRi systems served as robust tools for transcriptional regulation of the essential cell cycle genes in Lb. plantarum [41,42].

After introduced the three plasmids (pCDF-GFPplus, pPEgRNA, and pCRISPR-PE) into E. coli, the nCas9-M-MLV2:PEgRNA complex binds to the targeted sequence guided by sgRNA. The PBS recognizes and hybridizes to the single stranded DNA, and starts the reverse transcription of new DNA containing the designed edits based on the RTT. application in Penicillium chrysogenum, Trichoderma reesei, Neurospora crassa, Acremonium chrysogenum and so on (Liu et al., 2015;Matsu-Ura et al., 2015;Pohl et al., 2016;Chen and Chu, 2019;Chen et al., 2020). Recently, the base editing system fusing cytidine deaminase and Cas9 nickase was developed and applied in A. niger (Huang et al., 2019). However, the problems such as its natural narrow editing window and off-target still exist in filamentous fungal genome editing using the BE system. \n\nAs a model microbial material, E. coli has been widely used in basic research and applications in agriculture and industry. Although many tools have been developed for the genetic manipulation of E. coli, the efficient and convenient genome editing tools are still insufficient. Due to lack of non-homologous end junction (NHEJ) system in most prokaryotes, the early genome editing based on the CRISPR-Cas9 system depends on the existence of the homologous DNA donors, which increases the difficulty in the E. coli genome editing. Recently, a genome editing kit for the prokaryotic microorganisms such as E. coli based on the PE system was developed (Tong et al., 2021). This genome editing kit included a three-plasmid system (pCDF-GFPplus, pPEgRNA, and pCRISPR-PE), in which pCDF-GFPplus was used as a report plasmid to detect the editing efficiency of PE in E. coli (Figure 2).",

Targeted double-strand breaks are controlled by a guide RNA (gRNA), a chimeric RNA containing a structural segment for Cas9 binding and a 20-mer guide sequence that hybridises to the genomic DNA target. Introducing the 20-mer guide sequence into gRNA expression vectors often requires complex, time-consuming, and/or expensive cloning procedures. We present a new plasmid for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in S. cerevisiae, pCEC-red. This tool allows to (i) transform yeast with both Cas9 and gRNA expression cassettes in a single plasmid and (ii) insert the 20-mer sequence in the plasmid with high efficiency, thanks to Golden Gate Assembly and (iii) a red chromoprotein-based screening to speed up the selection of correct plasmids. We tested genome-editing efficiency of pCEC-red by targeting the ADE2 gene. We chose three different 20-mer targets and designed two types of repair fragments to test pCEC-red for precision editing and for large DNA region replacement procedures. We obtained high efficiencies (\u223c90%) for both engineering procedures, suggesting that the pCEC system can be used for fast and reliable marker-free genome editing.",

Briefly, CRISPR/Cas9 is based on the mechanism of 'adaptive immunity', which is naturally found in bacteria and archaea, and comprises two components: the chimeric guide RNA (gRNA) and the RNA-guided DNA endonuclease (e.g., Cas9); the CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox can be used for precise genome editing of any organism [54]. The applications of the toolbox in the food industry are numerous, and it has been applied to improve the strains of starter cultures by producing marker-less, genetically stable strains with improved properties [50]. \n\nThe technology was first applied in 2013 for genome engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an industrially important yeast and starter strain for several fermented products [55]. Since then, several applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox to improve the applicability of S. cerevisiae have followed. Recently, engineering yeast for the reduction of production of urea, the precursor of ethyl carbamate, and the modulation of glycerol production in wine have been successfully implemented [56][57][58]. The application of the CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox has been explored for improving fermented food and beverage starter microbes along with yeast. Kimchi-associated Leuconostoc citreum was engineered using the CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox for elimination of cryptic plasmids and this process was suggested as a food-grade method to develop a safe lactic acid bacterial strain without residual antibiotic markers [59].",

            "text": "Yeast Genome editing CRISPR-Cas9 Target-AID Base editing Loss of function screens Chromosomal fusions\n\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system has been engineered to create a comprehensive experimental toolkit (Jinek et al. 2012;Qi et al. 2013;Sander and Joung 2014). One of the principal applications of the system is for gene loss of function (LOF) via DNA repair errors within the coding sequence of a gene after creating targeted double stranded breaks (DSBs). The scalability of this technique allowed for the development of CRISPR-Cas9 LOF experiments at the genome scale Bassett et al. 2015;Sidik et al. 2016), greatly facilitating systems biology and genomics experiments in models in which they were difficult so far. Despite yeast being a usual frontrunner in technological developments for systems biology, low CRISPR-Cas9 LOF efficiency in yeast (DiCarlo et al. 2013) has so far made the application of this approach impractical. In the same experiments, mutagenesis using CRISPR-Cas9 and donor DNA via the Homology Directed repair pathway (HDR) was shown to be very efficient, but technical challenges prevented large-scale applications until recently. Both the MAGESTIC workflow (Roy et al. 2018) and the CHAnGE workflow (Bao et al. 2018) rely on mass co-synthesis of the guide sequence and of donor DNA to perform pooled mutagenesis of thousands of variants at the same time in haploid cells. While these methods show remarkable promise, they may be limited for some applications. As synthesis error rates increase with fragment length, these methods require additional experimental resources (e.g.: supplementary NGS sequencing) to compensate for the high error rates both in guide sequences and donor DNA. The high toxicity of DSBs (Roy et al. 2018) also enriches the pooled populations for cells in which genome editing was not successful, further increasing the amount of sequencing resources required to accurately assess the impact on fitness of engineered mutants. Furthermore, these two workflows require a haploid background, which is rare in wild yeast: many wild and industrial strains are diploid and would therefore require genetic manipulation before they can be used in these high throughput experimental workflows. Therefore, a promising alternative would be to rely",

When Cas9 was constitutively expressed with a transitory gRNA cassette, the direct mutagenesis of CAN1 through NHEJ repair increased the mutation rate up to 140-fold. When a 90 bp double-stranded donor was added, the recombination rate of ADE2 through HR repair increased up to 130-fold. When the gRNA was constitutively expressed from a plasmid, the recombination rate of donor DNA reached as high as 100% [22]. \n\nIn addition to S. cerevisiae, the CRISPR-Cas9 mediated multigene integration tool is also employed in the stress-tolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus. This system could successfully integrate a 5 kb insert consisting of three genes with 60% efficiency at the ABZ1 locus. The engineered strain with high expression of KmARO4 K221L , KmARO10 and KmPHA2, moderate expression of KmARO7G141S, and disruption of KmEAT1 could produce as high as 766 \u00b1 6 mg/L 2-phenylethanol after 5 days of fed-batch cultivation [23]. \n\nWith the expansion of CRISPR-Cas family endonucleases, another novel endonuclease called Cpf1 (also known as Cas12a, Fig. 4) has been used for genome editing in S. cerevisiae. Cpf1 cleaves DNA distal from the PAM and generates staggered ends. This protein does not need a tracrRNA since it harbors a distinct endoribonuclease domain [24].

Additionally, they have a clear genetic background and use diverse genetic modification methods, such as CRISPR/Cas9 technology, making it easy to optimize recombinant protein production [ 8 , 14 ]. Importantly, as a eukaryotic model organism, yeast can efficiently complete the posttranslational modification process [15] . S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris have been used to produce many FDA-approved recombinant protein drugs [ 16 , 17 ], including insulin and insulin analogs, human serum albumin, hepatitis vaccines, and virus-like particles for vaccination against human tumor viruses [ 18 , 19 ]. Furthermore, S. cerevisiae is often used to produce industrial enzymes, including -amylase and cellulase [20][21][22][23][24] . \n\nSecretion of recombinant proteins does not require cell lysis, resulting in fewer interfering proteins. This simplifies the separation and purification processes and reduces production costs, making it a widely used method for recombinant protein production. The surface-display of recombinant proteins has extensive applications in vaccine and antibody development, library screening, biosensor detection systems, biodegradation, and biofuels [25] . Therefore, it has become a powerful tool for biotechnological and biomedical applications [ 26 , 27 ]. However, production of secreted or surface-displayed proteins by S. cerevisiae is often limited to low amounts. Consequently, various approaches, such as optimizing gene transcription levels and engineering secretory pathways, have been explored to enhance recombinant protein production. In this review, we summarize the function of these strategies for improving the production of recombinant proteins in S. cerevisiae .",

Moreover, while high-throughput cloning strategies and the reduced cost of de novo DNA synthesis now allow swapping entire heterologous pathways or protein complexes into yeast, such efforts frequently require the deletion of corresponding yeast loci, such as in the case of efforts to systematically humanize yeast genes, 11,12 which may entail replacing genes at their corresponding genomic loci to retain native regulation. Beyond these aspects, the expression of each new gene often reveals incompatibilities associated with the engineered pathway. Thus, there is a need for rapid, multi-site, progressive genome editing strategies to address these issues.\n\nThe efficiency and speed of CRISPR-Cas9-based genome engineering allow straightforward editing of multiple yeast loci in a single strain, eliminating the need for markers. [13][14][15][16][17] However, the approach gets progressively more challenging for multi-gene systems when the fitness of the intermediate genotypes is unknown. Therefore, rationally building heterologous genetic modules in a yeast surrogate requires a highly scalable and combinatorial genome editing technology.\n\nSynthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis permits the combination of loci in a fitness-driven manner, requiring markers linked to the modified loci and haploid-specific selections. 18 Using an SGA-like strategy to build a heterologous multigene system would need several unique markers linked to each gene. However, the lack of adequate selection markers limits its application. The Green Monster (GM) method bypasses the marker dependency by using green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression as a readout to combine engineered loci. 19 However, implementing the GM strategy can be challenging for heterologous pathway engineering, with an added burden of expressing fluorescent cassettes. 20 Thus, accomplishing large-scale combinatorial genome editing in yeast necessitates genetic tools that circumvent these requirements.\n\nThis work describes a CRISPR-Cas9-based method to readily combine genetically engineered loci without requiring markers",

            "text": "The budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, is one of the best studied eukaryotic model organism and a valuable tool for all aspects of basic research and industrial application, some of which date back several thousands of years [39]. Because of its extensive tolerance to harsh vegetative growth conditions and ease of genetic manipulation, S. cerevisiae has become the most comprehensive cell model for producing a wide range of chemicals, biofuels, and natural products [44][45][46]. It is a premier genetically controllable organism, allowing for accessible and experimental approaches based on classical and molecular genetics. \n\nIn this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of genetic engineering of Baker's yeast using the recently emerging gold-standard CRISPR-Cas9 tool. Two target sites, one in the coding region (TRP1) and another one in the non-coding region (CS8), were engineered for targeted chromosomal integration with the help of a single plasmid (pML-107) (containing expression cassette of Cas9 nuclease and cloned target gRNA) and homologous constructs. Phosphoribosyl-anthranilate isomerase (TRP1) mainly catalyzes the third step in the production of tryptophan. The sequence of TRP1 of the strain S228C has been altered by replacing the annotated stop codon (TAA) with serine (TCA), which helps to increase yeast growth at both low and high temperatures [47,48]. The primary reason for selecting the TRP1 site is to facilitate the screening of auxotrophic mutants after mutagenesis with CRISPR-Cas9-gRNA targeting the TRP1 gene. The knock-out of the TRP1 was confirmed by Sanger sequencing the genomic PCR of the target site (Figure 1b). CRISPR-Cas9-based targeted genome perturbation in yeast has several advantages compared to the traditional genome modification methods, such as CRISPR-Cas9 technology for genomic modifications can be done rapidly with almost percent efficiency [49,50].",

Inactivation of the E. coli lacZ gene with homologous donor dsDNA increased the gene editing efficiency of pCas-SSB/pTargetF by 21.4% compared to pCas/pTargetF. Inactivation of the E. coli lacZ gene via NHEJ increased the gene editing efficiency of pCas-SSB/pTargetF by 33.2% compared to pCas-T4L/pTargetF. Furthermore, the gene-editing efficiency of pCas-SSB/pTargetF in E. coli (\u0394recA, \u0394recBCD, \u0394SSB) with or without donor dsDNA did not differ. Additionally, pCas-SSB/pTargetF with donor dsDNA successfully deleted the wp116 gene in Pseudomonas sp. UW4. These results demonstrate that E. coli SSB repairs DSBs caused by CRISPR/Cas9 and effectively improves CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in E. coli and Pseudomonas.",

            "text": "The Cas9 protein breaks the double strand (DSB) into three nucleotides upstream of the PAM site (adjacent protospacer motif). The introduction of the DSB must be repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or alternatively, homology-directed repair, to prevent the death of the host [18,116]. \n\nThe CRISPR-Cas based editing systems can be utilized for high throughput, multiplex genome editing technologies for genotype-phenotype discovery. Array-based oligo technologies enable creating hundreds of thousands of cassettes containing a donor template and a genome-targeting gRNA and a pooled plasmid library generates designed mutations in parallel. After CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, each plasmid can be served as a genetic barcode and the frequency of each designed mutation can be tracked by next-generation sequencing (NGS). This approach was applied to improve ethanol tolerance and production in S. cerevisiae by perturbing 25 regulatory genes with 43,020 mutations [117]. Also, genetic parts encoding overexpression and knockdown mutations of >90% yeast genes were iteratively integrated into the repetitive genomic sequences in a modular manner based on multiplex integration by CRISPR/Cas9. This approach with the aid of robotic automation allowed functional mapping and multiplex optimization on a genome scale for diverse phenotypes such as acetic acid tolerance [118]. A unique advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is that multiple gRNAs can be combined with Cas9, achieving efficient multiplex genome editing. The system could accelerate future genome-scale engineering in polyploid industrial strains [118]. Furthermore, the use of lab-on-chip, ultra-low volume nanoreactors allows for high index of selection of variants [119]. If the variant library is pooled and a growth selection to enrich for improved variants is not available for the desired phenotype, other methods for high throughput screening or selection are required. \n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been applied to non-model yeasts, based on the foundation of S. cerevisiae systems.",

            "text": "with no evidence of undesired sequence change, which confirmed the safety of CRISPR-Cas9 tools for gene editing in Y. lipolytica [272].\n\nSome CRISPR-Cas9 tools compatible with the GGA method (cf. Section 4.1.3) have also been designed recently for Y. lipolytica. A consortium of Austrian laboratories developed a GoldenMOCS-Yali toolkit for expression and CRISPR-Cas9-based metabolic engineering in Y. lipolytica, explicitly aimed at leveraging natural biodiversity [265]. Their vectors are compatible with previous GoldenMOCS tools, corresponding to a rapid GG cloning strategy used in multiple species. A CRISPR-Cas9 GoldenMOCS-Yali vector was used for knocking-out a gene into different Y. lipolytica wild-type strains, with an efficiency ranging from 6% to 25%, depending on the genetic background [265]. Similarly, the stated intention of valorizing the biodiversity of wild-type Y. lipolytica strains prompted the design at INRAE of a series of five GGA-compatible CRISPR-Cas9 vectors, derived from the pCRISPRyl vector, with different loxP-excisable selection markers that include the dominant Hyg R and NTC R [260]. These CRISPR tools are notably compatible with the pool of GG bricks described in Section 4.1.3 [219]. As a proof of concept of the possibility for wild-type strain genome editing, the knocking-out a gene was assayed in nine wild-type isolates and was achieved in seven of them, with a high efficiency in four strains and a 100% success rate in two [260]. These two new sets of CRISPR tools, both available from Addgene, are expected to allow leveraging Y. lipolytica natural biodiversity by allowing to select the more appropriate wild-type isolate for each intended application and then to engineer rapidly and easily its metabolism.\n\nHowever, the low rate of HR in Y. lipolytica limits the capacity of this yeast for homology-mediated DNA repair during site-specific CRISPR gene editing. This drawback has been addressed by a MIT research team who improved the CRISPR/Cas9-based methods using tRNA processing",

In addition, emerging genomic technologies based on CRISPR/Cas9 systems that contain a self-splicing sgRNA or a single multifunctional gRNA contribute to the simplification of repeated genomic edits that always require several rounds of repetitive screening processes. Because of its role in the conserved post-transcription modification processes, cell surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchoring technology is expected to aid the construction of novel functional yeast cells with oriented protein transportation and accurate colocalization. Their construction depends on the functional proteins that reside on the plasma membrane (Inokuma et al., 2021;Aguilera-Romero and Mu\u00f1iz, 2023). \n\nNewly developed technologies, including DPESs, fusion strategies, fast and simple genome editing, metabolic engineering, and codon optimization can be expected to facilitate genetic manipulation procedures and enrich the gene editing library not only for yeast, but also for other fungi. For example, DPESs achieve precise up-and down-regulation of heterologous metabolic synthetic pathways in B. subtilis and E. colithat enhancer-proteinproduction. The stability of the mRNA level, translation efficiency, and expression level of heterologous genes could be enhanced by using optimized codons in filamentous fungi (Liu et al., 2023). Also, CRISPR/ Cas9 systems have been extensively used to perform efficient gene modification in filamentous fungi of the Aspergillus genus for the biosynthesis of natural and recombinant bioproducts (Jin et al., 2022). Further, promising fusion strategies combined with different synthetic effectors are expected to have wide application prospects in a variety of scenarios. These strategies contribute to the construction of multifunctional or specific modules for genetic manipulation and metabolic regulation, thus facilitating editing procedures and a more accurate modulation of metabolic networks.",

            "text": "Among all the CRISPR-Cas systems, the type I system accounts for 95% and is the most widely distributed. In many cases, heterologous proteins, such as Cas9 and Cpf1, are difficult to transform into bacteria and archaea due to their intrinsic toxicity, leading to a low genome editing efficiency. Thus, the type I CRISPR-Cas system was harnessed as an endogenous RNA-guided machinery for multiplex genome editing in prokaryotes [27][28][29]. The type II CRISPR-Cas9 system is the most popular genome editing tool and has been successfully applied in a broad range of organisms, such as bacteria, yeasts, plants, animals and human cells [30][31][32][33]. The type V CRISPR-Cpf1 system has emerged as an alternative to the CRISPR-Cas9 technology [34]. The genome editing activity of CRISPR-Cpf1 is not as robust as CRISPR-Cas9, but has higher targeting efficiency [35,36]. Given its powerful RNA recognition and cleavage ability, the type VI CRISPR-C2c2 system has been harnessed as a toolkit for RNA base editing, RNA knockdown, nucleic acid detection and transcript tracking [37]. Although lots of biochemical and structural studies have been reported concerning the composition and functional activities of these CRISPR-Cas systems, a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the diverse interference mechanisms of these genetic silencing systems is still lacking. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge related to these CRISPR-Cas effector complexes, which will deepen our understanding of the architecture of distinct types of CRISPR-Cas systems, and how crRNA-guided Cas proteins recognize and cleave invading nucleic acids. Furthermore, it will enhance the application of CRISPR-Cas systems as genome editing tools.",

            "text": "A three-plasmid system approach in the E. coli DH5\u03b1 strain, reported the use of pCas9 and pCRISPR plasmids (Jiang et al., 2013), as well as pKD46 to deliver \u03bb red recombination genes in trans (Pyne et al., 2015). Besides single point mutagenesis, other modifications such as large deletions (up to \u223c19.4 Kbp) were achieved by combining recombineering using dsDNA editing substrates with Cas9 selection, generally achieving efficiencies ranging from few percentages to about 50% of the colonies following outgrowth. Once successful genome engineering is achieved, the curing of the original helper plasmids is desired, particularly when multiple chromosomal manipulations are performed in the same strain. For example, a plasmid carrying sgRNA sequences, the \u03bb red genes and a conditional replicating origin can be cured at nonpermissive temperatures of 37 \u2022 C (Reisch and Prather, 2017). Moreover, plasmid pCas9cr4 elimination was effectively achieved by p15A ori Cas9-directed cleavage, by delivering pKDsg-p15A (Reisch and Prather, 2017). Another nuclease, CRISPR-Cas12a, was also successfully coupled to recombineering in E. coli, as comparable efficiencies to those reported for Cas9 were observed when attempting to perform site-directed mutagenesis of lacZ or gene specific deletions (\u223c1000 bp). Although to obtain high efficiencies, and despite co-expression of the Gam, Exo and Bet proteins, efficient insertion with this system required recombineering substrates with 500 bp flanking homologies (Yan et al., 2017). \n\nTaken together, CRISPR-Cas specific gene targeting enhances the efficiency of recombineering, making it a preferred strategy for introducing multiple genome edits as it does not require recycling of selection markers (Jiang et al., 2015;Ronda et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Studies in E. coli have shown the DSB can enhance homologous recombination in bacteria, whereby homology directed repair (HDR) occurs after a break has been induced (Jiang et al., 2013). However, studies in different Clostridium species suggest that HDR efficiency in these species is too low to select for successful HDR events (Wang et al., 2015(Wang et al., , 2016a;;Li Q. et al., 2016). The use of CRISPR/Cas9 represents a major advancement in Clostridium gene editing in Clostridium as scarless edits are enabled. \n\nThe limited number of characterized genetic parts for Clostridium poses a challenge with CRISPR/Cas9 engineering. For example, simultaneous constitutive expression of the sgRNA and Cas9 protein often resulted in few to no transformed colonies in the presence of a homologous repair donor vector, as DSBs result in cell death before recombination can occur (Bruder et al., 2016;Li Q. et al., 2016;Nagaraju et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2016a). This can be addressed by placing Cas9 expression under the control of an inducible promoter (Nagaraju et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2016a;Wang S. et al., 2017;Wasels et al., 2017). Another strategy is to use a two-plasmid system, where the donor DNA and sgRNA are introduced separately from the Cas9 gene. This method avoids the transformation of very large plasmids, which have reduced transformation efficiency, but it requires two separate transformation events (Wasels et al., 2017). Using these methods, successful recombinants were isolated at a rate up to 100% (Wasels et al., 2017) with commonly observed efficiencies of greater than 50% (Table 1). \n\nCas9 nickase (Cas9n) systems exploit CRISPR gene editing while circumventing the lethality associated with the coexpression of a guide RNA with Cas9. This method utilizes Cas9n, a mutated form of the Cas9 protein, with the ability to only cut one DNA strand.",

            "text": "The use of functional CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid delivery is crucial, especially in LAB that lack active CRISPR-Cas9 systems, such as L. acidophilus. Several Cas9-nucleases and CRISPR-Cas systems are being explored for use in bacterial genome engineering, with the goal of achieving wider applicability, precision, stability, and lower toxicity [1]. An overview of CRISPR applications in genome editing is shown in Figure 4. \n\nLeenay et al. [122] determined that the outcome of genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 in L. plantarum is dependent on the method and strain used. This variation was attributed to features that differentiate comparable strains, including the efficiency of transformation, DNA repair protein expression and activity, or the likelihood of genomic excision events. CRISPR-Cas systems are designed to prevent the transfer of exogenous DNA into host genomes [131]. This can be exploited to precisely prevent the spread of genetic elements, such as antibiotic-resistance markers, toxins, and other detrimental genes between bacterial strains. It could also be designed to control the spread of mobile genetic elements like insertion sequences and transposons within cells, ensuring greater genetic stability [135]. Although the CRISPR-Cas system is a potent tool for genome engineering, it is frequently challenging to optimise in non-model bacteria [90]. CRISPR-mediated genome editing is typically coupled with other techniques to optimise the efficiency of genome editing. In a study by Huang et al. [98] RecE/T-assisted CRISPR-Cas9 editing was found to be highly efficient in L. plantarum WCFS1 and it was inferred that this system could be applied to other Lactobacillus species (Table 2).",

            "text": "The CRISPR/Cas system can be used as an efficient and precise gene-editing vehicle for multiplexed genome editing, i.e., the simultaneous targeting of multiple genes with a single molecular construct uses multiple sgRNAs as a separate transcription unit or in polycistronic form. This is one of the major advantages of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, as compared to previous genome editing tools, e.g., ZFNs and TALENs. It is easy and simple to use more gRNAs on the similar or other T-DNA construct. Multiplex genome-editing can be achieved by using multiple promoters, but a single promoter is preferable in order to express each gRNA and to fit the entire system into smaller vectors, provided the effectiveness of the mutations is maintained. This was seen with a polycistronic gene spacing the gRNAs with tRNA genes, Cys4 recognition sites and ribozyme sites [4,105]. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated targeted editing by the ribozyme-gRNA-ribozyme (RGR) system in the case of Arabidopsis and yeast has been reported [158]. The RGR system has been used to describe the single promoter-driven CRISPR/Cas9 mediated mutagenesis in mammalian cells [158,159]. Recently, it has been reported that hammerhead ribozyme, one of the RNA processing machineries, could be used to produce functional gRNAs to express CRISPR/Cas system in plants [160]. The Cys4 processing system that utilizes the CRISPR type III RNase, Cys4, to cut the 20 bp sequences flanking the gRNAs can be used for successful CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis in plants [67]. Besides, multiplex gRNAs has been generated from a single transcript using the polycistronic tRNA-gRNA genetic system in plants [161]. Various facts suggest that the methods of tRNA and Cys4 using the cestrum yellow leaf curling virus (CmYLCV) promoter are unsurpassed in inducing mutations, as compared to the gRNAs expressed from individual Pol promoters [67].",

            "text": "Compared with ZFN and TALEN systems, the CRISPR/ Cas9 system has several advantages. (1) The CRISPR/Cas9 system is widely used: the requirement for the selection of target sites in this system is to have a PAM sequence, which is widely present in the genome and can find several target sites in any gene, so that almost all genes can be edited. (2) The CRISPR/Cas9 system consists of simple components: sgRNA and Cas9 proteins are the two major components of the system. They can be placed on a transformation vector as needed, or placed on different transformation vectors, or assembled directly in vitro. (3) The CRISPR system can reduce the selection of markup applications: For example, a limiting factor in mutagenesis in A. fumigatus stems from a limited number of dominant selection markers. When we need to mutate three or more genes in a row, the only selection markers available for A. fumigatus are hph, ble, and ptrA. The CRISPR/Cas9 system can edit multiple genes at the same time, and it is possible to obtain mutants with multiple site mutations in one transformation, which greatly improves the efficiency of genome editing. \n\nHowever, at present, there are still deficiencies in this technology, such as off-target effect, needs to improve editing efficiency, and need to construct a carrier system that is applicable to various fungi. There is also a risk that the system will not stop the genome editing function after the error gene is repaired, but may continue to modify the normal gene to cause off-target effects. To address this problem, Nagy et al. (2017) developed the CRISPR-Cas9 system specifically for transient expression. This system not only evaluates the target cleavage efficiency of different sgRNAs in vitro but also reduces the possibility of integration of genetic material into non-targeted regions of the genome. These advantages greatly reduce offtarget effects of the CRISPR system. Cho et al. (2014) has proposed that Cas9 inhibitory protein can be used to disable the runaway editing function by inhibiting its activity when Cas9 completes genome editing, but it is in its early stage and further experiments are needed to verify and identify better techniques.",

One advantage is that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can potentially edit almost all genes containing a PAM in their target sequences owing to its simplicity and modularity. Only two components are required in this system: a Cas9 endonuclease and sgRNA (Song et al., 2019). Indeed, there remain challenges and limitations to utilize this approach, such as off-target effects and the need to perform precise editing. As research advances, a well-designed gRNA sequence and specific Cas9 variants can be developed to avoid off-target effects, as can control the amount of intracellular Cas9 or enhance Cas9 for higher specificity through protein engineering (Cho et al., 2014;Tong et al., 2019). For example, Pohl et al. (2016) adopted a strategy for assembling the Cas9-gRNA complex in vitro and co-transformed it with a donor DNA into Penicillium chrysogenum, which proved to be effective in reducing off-target effects. With regard to precise editing, the biggest hurdle is the native NHEJ that intensely affects the efficiency of HDR despite the presence of a homologous template (Tong et al., 2019). By employing the inhibitor Scr7, Maruyama et al. (2015) successfully targeted the DNA ligase IV responsible for the NHEJ pathway, causing suppression of the native NHEJ activity, thus improving the efficiency of precise genome editing. Additionally, several advanced strategies like CRISPRi and FokI-dCas9 have been applied to optimize the Cas9 system to perform more precise gene-editing (Guilinger et al., 2014;Kao and Ng, 2017). \n\nThe potential of fungal biosynthetic capabilities in generating secondary metabolites seems virtually unlimited.",

            "text": "Although high frequencies of the desired mutants were obtained using CRISPRassociated HR technologies, foreign donor DNA templates that contain the homologous and edited regions must be accompanied to yield the desired mutations (11) via homology-directed repair. In addition, the CRISPR-Cas system kills nonedited bacterial cells, which caused occasional escapers to avoid DNA cleavages up on the toxicity of the Cas9 nuclease at elevated expression (9,12,13). Potential escapers limit the identification of the desired mutant with highly efficient genome engineering (9). Previously, we and other groups harnessed original CRISPR effectors, including CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR-Cas12a, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) for engineering various industrial bacteria species such as Corynebacterium glutamicum, E. coli, and Streptomyces coelicolor. Following those original CRISPR effectors, new genetic engineering tools such as DNA base editors (BEs) have been developed to promote genome engineering without foreign DNA insertions and with less toxic Cas nickase. \n\nBEs, involving cytosine base editors (CBEs) and adenine base editors (ABEs), can induce point mutations at desired sites in the absence of donor DNA templates without generating DSBs (13,14). In particular, CBE-mediated CG-to-TA conversion can introduce a premature termination codon (PTC) to the coding strand of a desired gene, causing early translational termination and resulting in gene inactivation (previously named CRISPR-STOP [15] or i-STOP [16]). Given these advantages, bacterial genome engineering using BEs has been expected to play a key role in building efficient microbial cell factories for producing value-added bioproducts. To date, a few studies have applied CBEs such as BE3 and Target-AID for genetic engineering in microbial cells (10,17).",

            "text": "Just as recombinant DNA technology has benefited from basic research on restriction enzymes from microorganisms, the latest generation of Cas9-based genome engineering tools is also based on components of antiphage defense system from microorganisms. In recent years, the CRISPR-Cas9 system and various technologies derived from it, such as precise editing, multi-gene editing, and precise regulation, have catapulted innovation to provide integrated solutions, and have provided us with increased flexibility in bacterial genetic engineering. It plays an important role in the fields of single-stranded RNA editing and high-throughput gene screening. Nevertheless, the problems such as off-target rate and cytotoxicity should not be ignored. Since the DSB caused by the Cas9 protein is lethal to host cells, DNA base editor that does not introduce DSB has been developed. It is reported that an evolved Cas9 variant containing 7 mutations has relaxed the PAM requirement to NG or NNG [81]. The application of these variants is expected to significantly increase the number of targeted nucleotides in the genome. The existing base editor can only realize the base conversion between pyrimidine and between purine. Zhao et al. designed and constructed the cytosine deaminase-nCas9-Ung protein complex, creating a new glycosylase base editor (GBE). They developed a singlebase gene editing system that can realize the transversion between pyrimidine and purine. Based on this system, it is the first time in the world to achieve arbitrary base editing in microorganisms and specific transversion of C-G bases in mammalian cells [82]. This is important in the construction of synthetic biological systems and modification of biological traits. As microbial cell factories are increasingly used to produce biochemical products, it will be a trend to use the CRISPR-Cas9 system to optimize the genome of microbial cells in a modular, parallel, and high-throughput manner to increase the yield of target products. Considering the striking progress of CRISPR-Cas9 system in eukaryotes, we anticipate that discoveries in the near future will expand its application in more microorganisms.",

            "text": "Rewiring of metabolic network of host strain is required for a full performance of an engineered pathway for product synthesis, when potential of the engineered production pathway is restricted due to a metabolic characteristics of the host. Many genetic tools are available for genome engineering in E. coli and yeasts. Homologous recombination is the most popular method for deletion and replacement of genetic parts. The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate supply was rebalanced by tuningdown of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate synthase, which led to a two-fold increase in lycopene production via the MEP pathway in E. coli (Jung et al., 2016). The central pathway was rewired in S. cerevisiae to synthesize acetyl-CoA with reduced losses of carbon and ATP. As acetyl-CoA was the substrate of the MVA pathway, rewiring of the central carbon metabolism in S. cerevisiae resulted in an increase in farnesene production by 25% along with a reduced requirement of oxygen by 75% (Meadows et al., 2016). Genome engineering tools have been developed to simultaneously target multiple genomic loci like as multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE), and to precisely edit a specific genomic locus without a scar based on the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system (Figure 2A). MAGE was applied to optimizing MEP pathway in E. coli for lycopene production (Wang et al., 2009). A modified method of MAGE was also successfully applied for \u03b2-carotene production in S. cerevisiae (Barbieri et al., 2017). As MAGE generates a vast of combinatorial variants in genome, it could be an effective genome engineering tool only when it is combined with a high-throughput screening (colorimetric or fluorescent) system enabling a selection of variants with desired traits. It is also difficult to incorporate large genetic parts (>1 kb) into genome by MAGE. CRISPR/Cas9 is currently powerful and popular genetic tool for precise genome editing (Jiang et al., 2013;Jessop-Fabre et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Recently, there has been growing evidence that the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing approach enables efficient, intricately controlled gene expression and versatile cross-species genome editing in various micro-organisms [5,113,114]. Briefly, the action mechanism of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is that the complex of small crRNAs produced by the coordinated action of a small, trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), the Cas9 nuclease, and the host RNaseIII directs Cas9 to cleave the target DNA, which is followed by an adjacent protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). The target DNA is recognized by its alignment with the 12-15 nucleotides at the 3 end of the crRNA guide sequence as well as the NGG sequence of PAM. Unlike the effort to manipulate other transcription factors, the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be simply applied to genome editing and metabolic pathway engineering by only altering the target sequence without any protein engineering. For example, Jiang et al. reported the introduction of point mutations and codon changes in the E. coli genome using the CRISPR/Cas9 method [5]. For instance, the \u03b2-carotene biosynthetic pathway, the methylerythritol-phosphate pathway, and the central metabolic pathways in E. coli were systematically optimized for \u03b2-carotene production by iterative editing of the 2-day editing cycle, and the best production was 2.0 g/L \u03b2-carotene (fed-batch fermentation) [92]. \n\nWith respect to the regulation of gene expression, CRISPRi-based interference (CRISPRi) has also been applied to metabolic engineering using a nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) that contains two point mutations, one each in the RuvC (D10A) and HNH (H840A) domains [4,113]. Due to the gRNA binding ability of dCas9, it has been used as a programmable transcription repressor by circumventing the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter sequence or as a transcription terminator by binding to the target gene.",

            "text": "T he development of CRISPR/Cas9-based technologies has enabled quick, precise and scarless genomic modifications, which shows a great potential for microbial strain design and bioproduction. In particular, the metabolic engineering of yeasts is one of the fastest growing areas in engineering biology, enabling the sustainable production of chemicals, fuels, materials, foods and pharmaceuticals 1 . While having the large metabolic potential of eukaryotic cells, due to their single cell nature and rapid growth, yeasts are easier to engineer and cultivate at scale. \n\nBecause of that, CRISPR systems have been developed for yeasts [2][3][4] . One of the most important advantages of CRISPR is that, due to its high efficiency, it allows markerless genomic modifications. During traditional strain engineering, the elimination of selectable markers from the genome, known as marker recovery, is a common bottleneck 5 . Even fast-growing yeast cultures require at least five days for marker recovery 6 , while integrative transformation itself takes only two or three. Therefore, in the past years several marker-free integration techniques facilitated by CRISPR have been developed [6][7][8][9] . In spite of these developments, many current metabolic engineering projects still rely on marker-based approaches, which may limit or delay success in strain optimization. In this work, we have identified 3 improvements of CRISPR/Cas9 systems which may facilitate the use of Cas9-based yeast engineering, (1) the easy swap between marker and markerless modifications (2) the quick exchange of homology arms to target different integration locations and (3) an easy method to clone gRNAs. \n\nConvenient return to marker-based integration. During CRISPR-based marker-free integration, the only selective factor is the double strand break (DSB) induced by Cas9. To proliferate, cells need to repair this lesion. This may happen either by using a template (donor) that is integrated via homologous recombination (HR) or by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), i.e. without integration. NHEJ activity is observed in most fungal species including baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 5,10 .",

For example, the presence and potential role of small RNAs (sRNAs) in Z. mobilis was investigated by computational prediction and molecular biology experimental approaches. Fifteen novel sRNAs were confirmed with three sRNAs (Zms2, Zms6 and Zms18) differentially expressed under ethanol stress (Cho et al., 2014). This result suggests the regulatory role of sRNAs in ethanol production or tolerance in Z. mobilis, as well as the potential application of RNAassociated mechanisms for metabolic engineering practice.\n\nFinally, CRISPR-Cas systems in Z. mobilis has been investigated recently and the results showed that Z. mobilis type I-F CRISPR-Cas system was expressed and active in immune interference under normal growth conditions (Dong et al., 2016). Dunn reported in her thesis that a type II CRISPR/Cas expression system was constructed in Z. mobilis and that small RNAs can direct the Cas9 nuclease to target the Z. mobilis genome for genome editing (Dunn, 2015). These findings suggest that the existence of endogenous type I-F CRISPR-Cas system in Z. mobilis will not affect the exogenous type II CRISPR/Cas expression system for genome engineering, such as editing, interfering, tagging, screening and visualizing (Sander and Joung, 2014). In addition, a DNA-guided nuclease Natronobacterium gregoryi Argonaute (NgAgo) was reported recently, which can introduce targeted double strand breaks, and is suitable for genome editing (Gao et al., 2016). Compared with the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, the NgAgo system could be a very exciting genome-editing technique, which uses DNA instead of RNA as the guide without the requirement of a protospacer adjacent motif site. Moreover, several features could indicate higher fidelity of this system relative to that of CRISPR-Cas systems including the longer DNA guide (24 nucleotides versus 20 nucleotides) for Cas9 gRNA, higher sensitivity to",

The rapid development of molecular genetic toolbox allows for and speeds up the realization of knowledge-driven, comparative omics-driven, and model-driven target predictions, thereby increasing the implement speed of systems metabolic engineering cycles. However, as described above, several key genes and metabolic pathways have been modified through the traditional transformation techniques to modulate the citric acid production and productivity. Although the gene targeting efficiency is improved in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) deficient strains [80,81], the first step for NHEJ deficient host construction, especially for industrially relevant isolates, and modifying genes in a high throughput manner is still very experimentally challenging and time-consuming. \n\nClustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) systems have become a very powerful genome editing technique [82,83]. Recently, several CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing systems were established in A. niger (Fig. 2, Table 2) [84][85][86][87][88][89]. Nodvig et al. [84] reported the first CRIPSR/Cas9 system in Aspergilli sp. (Fig. 2a). They developed all-in-one single plasmid system combined the Cas9 expression cassette with sgRNA expression cassette using RNA polymerase II promoter PgpdA in a single vector. To ensure the matured structures of sgRNA, two ribozymes were added the 5\u2032-end and 3\u2032-end of sgRNA. \n\nAlthough the system enables the NHEJ-mediated gene disruption, more cloning efforts and experimental workload are required due to the utilization of ribozymes Fig. 2 CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing systems used in A. niger. a CRISPR/Cas9 system based on RNA polymerase II promoters for sgRNA expression enables the NHEJ-mediated gene disruption in A. niger [84]. b CRISPR/Cas9 system utilizing in vitro transcription for sgRNA synthesis enables the HR-mediated gene deletion with 1.5 kb homologous arm as donor DNA [85,86].",

            "text": "Developing a food-grade selection marker without antibiotic resistance genes in food-grade microorganisms is vital for constructing genetically modified LAB products that meet biosafety standards. The construction of a food-grade nutritionally-deficient screening marker has an effective application in a non-resistance screening system [37]. However, the use of traditional plasmid targeting systems to manipulate the genome of LAB has raised numerous concerns, such as the difficulty of knocking out or inserting foreign genes, low expression efficiency and reorganization efficiency, and residues of transposon plasmids and other element sequences. CRISPR-Cas9 technology relies on Cas9 and sgRNA to achieve precise cutting, simplify the experimental steps, and reduce the experimental costs. Genome-editing tools mediated by the CRISPR-Cas9 system have been used in Lactobacillus bacteria [38][39][40][41][42]. Oh et al. [43] used Cas9 protein to knock out unedited cells of wild strain, which significantly improved the genome editing efficiency of ssDNA for Lactobacillus reuteri. Guo et al. [44] combined ssDNA with a modified CRISPR-Cas9 counter-selection to successfully knock out the Lactococcus lactis UPP gene with a genome editing efficiency of 75%. However, Cas9 can cause dsDNA breakage (DSB) in the bacterial genome, leading to bacterial death [45,46]. To overcome this, Song et al. [41] used the Cas9D10A-Nickase mutant to replace the wild-type Cas9 protein and optimized the sgRNA and Cas9D10A promoter, which not only achieved precise knockout of gene segments and insertion of foreign genes into the genome of L. casei but also demonstrated that the Cas9D10A-Nickase system is an effective tool to overcome DSB-induced bacterial lethality. \n\nIn this study, we used the CRISPR-Cas9D10A gene editing system to cut the singlestranded genomic DNA of L. casei W56, thereby knocking out the alr gene, and the auxotrophic strain L. casei \u2206alr W56 can be stably passaged without mutation reversion.",

However, when Cre recombinase is integrated into the genome, its insertion position hassome limitations, which may affect the expression of endogenous genes. In conditional knockout, the Cre promoter must be effective and specific, which requires pre-screening of Cre promoter genes with high expression levels [9]. Besides, genetic modification will leave scars on the genome. The CRISPR-Cas system has been widely used in the genetic modification of various organisms in recent years because of its precise, fast, and traceless operation [10]. The classic CRISPR-Cas9 technology generates a DNA double-strand break (DSB) at the target site, inducing intracellular homologous recombination (Homologydirected repair, HDR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway to achieve genetic modification such as site-specific knockout, replacement, and insertion of genomic DNA [11]. In lactic acid bacteria (LAB), CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology can be used to clarify and enhance beneficial characteristics. Oh et al. combined CRISPR-Cas9 with recombination technology in the genetic engineering of Lactobacillus reuteri [12]. This is the first time that CRISPR technology has been applied to the genetic engineering of LAB. Research by Leenay et al. showed that CRISPR system could be used for genetic modification of L. plantarum WCFS1 and successfully site-directed mutation from D480Y to rpoB [13]. Subsequently, Huang et al. established a RecE/T-assisted CRISPR genome editing toolbox that could be used in L. plantarum WCFS1 and L. brevis ATCC367, which easily achieved gene knockout in Lactobacillus [14]. Song et al. established a gene editing plasmid pLCNICK for Lactobacillus casei based on CRISPR-Cas9 D10A . The independent gene knockout and green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene insertion efficiency of this system was 25-62%, which proved that the pLCNICK gene editing system could be used as a",

            "text": "So far, genetic transformation systems are only available for model strains and some industrial stains [122,123]. Thus, establishing and optimizing efficient genetic transformation systems in more fungal strains is necessary for expanding the field of CRISPR-based fungal genetic engineering. \n\nCRISPR/Cas systems can also be used for RNA editing. Recently, a number of CRISPR/Cas systems with RNA-targeting activity have been identified, including type II (Cas9), type III (Cmr/Csm), and type VI (Cas13). Novel CRISPR-based RNA-targeting tools that are developed from Type II, III, and VI systems have already been harnessed for endogenous RNA knockdown, site-specific RNA editing, and RNA tracking in many organisms, including fungi [124][125][126][127][128][129][130]. In yeast, a range of Cas 13 proteins, including Cas13a from Leptotrichia shahii (LshCas13a), Cas13a from Leptotrichia wadei (LwaCas13a), Cas13d from Ruminococcus flavefaciens (RfxCas13d), and Nme1Cas9 from Neisseria meningitidis, have been used for gene knockdown via triggering mRNA degradation [124,130]. Moreover, an engineered RNA editing system consisting of dCas13a fused with the catalytic domain of a human adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 2 (hADAR2d) and a crRNA/pRNA construct was applied in fission yeast for precise base editing [130]. Compared with CRISPR-based DNA-targeting, RNA-targeting systems hold exciting potential to dissect the roles of lethal genes and avoid generating permanent off-target genetic changes. However, the application of CRISPR-based transcriptomic manipulation in fungi is limited to only a few species. Future applications of CRISPR-based RNA-targeting systems along with the already-established CRISPR-based platforms are expected to significantly advance our understanding of fungal secondary metabolism.",

Here we improved its on-target editing efficiency by simply incorporating 2-aminoadenine (base Z, which alters canonical Watson-Crick base pairing) into the crRNA to increase the binding affinity between crRNA and its complementary DNA target. The resulting CRISPR-Cas12a (named zCRISPR-Cas12a thereafter) shows an on-target editing efficiency comparable to that of the CRISPR-Cas9 system but with much lower off-target effects than the CRISPR-Cas9 system in mammalian cells. In addition, zCRISPR-Cas12a can be used for precise gene knock-in and highly efficient multiplex genome editing. Overall, the zCRISPR-Cas12a system is superior to the CRISPR-Cas9 system, and our simple crRNA engineering strategy may be extended to other CRISPR-Cas family members as well as their derivatives.",

A plasmid based CRISPR-Cas9 system was successfully developed in the nonconventional yeast C. parapsilosis [28]. Transient expression of Cas9 using a plasmid with an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) obtained from the genome of C. parapsilosis has enabled the efficient multiple editing of target genes. Unlike these strains, Cas9 expression vectors of S. cerevisiae were directly used for genome engineering of C. glabrata without modifications [29]. Our initial approach using a plasmid system of S. cerevisiae in C. aaseri SH14 was not successful. There might be many unknown factors determining the efficiency of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 in nontraditional Candida yeasts due to the broad spectrum of Candida spp. Consequently, it is necessary to develop species-specific CRISPR-Cas9 systems for efficient genome engineering of C. aaseri SH14. \n\nHere, we have developed a CRISPR-Cas9 system for genetic manipulation of C. aaseri SH14. The system consists of Candida-compatible Cas9 gene, ARS, gRNA expression cassette and nourseothricin (NTC) resistance selection marker in a single episomal plasmid. Multiple gene disruption, targeted integration of expression cassette and rapid curing of CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid were successfully demonstrated.",

            "text": "Over the past decade, genetic engineering has witnessed a revolution with the emergence of a relatively new genetic editing tool based on RNA-guided nucleases: the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Since the first report in 1987 and characterization in 2007 as a bacterial defense mechanism, this system has garnered immense interest and research attention. CRISPR systems provide immunity to bacteria against invading genetic material; however, with specific modifications in sequence and structure, it becomes a precise editing system capable of modifying the genomes of a wide range of organisms. The refinement of these modifications encompasses diverse approaches, including the development of more accurate nucleases, understanding of the cellular context and epigenetic conditions, and the re-designing guide RNAs (gRNAs). Considering the critical importance of the correct performance of CRISPR/Cas9 systems, our scope will emphasize the latter approach. Hence, we present an overview of the past and the most recent guide RNA web-based design tools, highlighting the evolution of their computational architecture and gRNA characteristics over the years. Our study explains computational approaches that use machine learning techniques, neural networks, and gRNA/target interactions data to enable predictions and classifications. This review could open the door to a dynamic community that uses up-to-date algorithms to optimize and create promising gRNAs, suitable for modern CRISPR/Cas9 engineering.",

            "text": "In recent years, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology is applied not only in model Streptomyces strains, but also in more and more other NP producers, such as non-model Streptomyces (Jia et al., 2017;Qin et al., 2017), Micromonospora (Braesel et al., 2019;Cohen and Townsend, 2018;Wolf et al., 2016), Myxococcus (Yang et al., 2017), Clostridium (Q.

Wang et al., 2016b), and even Yarrowia (Gao et al., 2016) and Cyanobacteria (Li et al., 2016a;Wendt et al., 2016). \n\nAlthough the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely applied to different hosts, it also has some limitations. The toxicity of Cas9 expression in some industrial Streptomyces strains and the requirement of complex expression constructs for targeting multiple genomic loci have limited its scope of application. Lu and coworkers employed another CRISPR system from Francisella novicida to Streptomyces and successfully developed a high-efficiency CRISPR/Cpf1 system for multiplex genome editing and transcriptional repression (Li et al., 2018). The authors engineered BGCs of three pigments (cryptic polyketone, prodiginine and actinorhodin) with CRISPR/Cpf1 technology and proved that it is a powerful alternative to CRISPR/Cas9 for industrial strains that cannot utilize the CRISPR/Cas9 system. \n\nA combination of CRISPR/Cas9 technology and \u03bb Red recombineering based Multiplex Automated Genomic Engineering technology, termed CRMAGE, was shown to achieve extremely high recombineering efficiency between 96.5% and 99.7% for the gene recoding of three genomic targets, while traditional recombineering could only achieve between 0.68% and 5.4% efficiency (Ronda et al., 2016). CRMAGE utilizes two USER-cloned plasmids to quickly and cost-efficiently introduce more than two mutations in a single recombineering round.",

After successful adaptation and efficient use of CRISPR-Cas9 for genome engineering in methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii, a broader variety of employable endonucleases was desired to increase the experimental flexibility and to provide alternatives in case there are specific legal restrictions in industrial research due to the intellectual property rights (IPRs) of third parties. MAD7, an engineered Class 2 Type V Cas nuclease, was promoted as a royalty-free alternative for academic and industrial research and developed by Inscripta (Pleasanton, CA, USA). In this study, for the first time, CRISPR-MAD7 was used for genome editing in K. phaffii with a high gene-editing rate (up to 90%), as demonstrated for the three targeted genes coding for glycerol kinase 1 (GUT1), red fluorescence protein (DsRed), and zeocin resistance gene (Sh ble). Additionally, the genome-editing efficiencies of the CRISPR-MAD7 and CRISPR-Cas9 systems were systematically compared by targeting 259 kinase genes in K. phaffii. In this broad testing, the CRISPR-Cas9 had a higher genome-editing rate of about 65%, in comparison to the applied CRISPR-MAD7 toolbox (about 23%).",

Based on the URA3 gene-coding region sequence, three gRNAs were designed on the CRISPRdirect website (http://crispr. dbcls.jp/) with low off-target rate in different positions of the URA3 gene. The complementary oligonucleotide (oligo) with the gRNA sequence was annealed and ligated into the BspQI single-stranded linearized p425-SapI-TEF1p-Cas9-CYC1t-2xSapI vector and transformed into E. coli. The positive clone was identified and acquired to obtain URA3 gene targeting the CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid. Plasmids were extracted by using the Axygen Plasmid Mini Kit. The URA3target Cas9 plasmid was transformed into S. cerevisiae W303-1A cells, and the product was coated on an SD-Leu-plate and cultured for 2-3 days at 30 C. We found that the colony number on the plate can serve as a preliminary indicator the gRNA editing efficiency. Five to 10 single colonies were picked from each plate and lysed in 0.2% SDS. The URA3 gene was amplified, and a small amount of PCR product was electrophoresed.",

            "text": "However, the published method necessitates an additional 144\u2212168 h induction period with arabinose to achieve editing efficiencies of 78\u2212100%, which is comparable to the efficiency of our recombineering approach. 18 Shorter induction times significantly reduce the observed editing efficiency for CRISPR/Cas9. Furthermore, the current electroporation-based CRISPR/Cas9 method only allows for gene deletions but still does not provide a working strategy for (marker-free) targeted insertion of recombinant DNA. Similarly, the RalsTron method, which utilizes group II introns for target-specific integration, only enables gene knockouts and exhibits a modest editing efficiency of 12.5%. 71 In contrast, our lambda Red recombineering approach provides a quick and more versatile alternative. Furthermore, the licensing complexities associated with CRISPR/Cas9 make freedom-to-operate methods, such as the one described in this study, a more attractive choice. \n\nIn summary, our adapted lambda Red recombineering system offers a reliable and powerful tool for genome editing in C. necator. It enables efficient deletions and insertions, significantly reducing the time required for genome editing compared to the traditional conjugation methods and available CRISPR/Cas9 systems. The introduction of cassettes via electroporation further accelerates the process and minimizing the risk for genetic instability. Additionally, efficient marker recycling facilitates complex genome engineering, which is especially relevant in a bacterial host with significant potential in modern biotechnology.",

            "text": "By exploiting the relative ease of editing its genome, the fission yeast has offered many insights into critical cellular processes. Fission yeast is also a suitable model organisms for optimizing the conditions of genome editing mediated by the noncanonical HDR. Its merits, including rapid growth, single colony formation, and uniform genetic background, facilitate the determination of the optimal lengths of homologous sequences required for precise genome editing. It has been reported that MMEJ takes place at S/G2 phase and requires Exo1, Rad52, and Pol4 but not Ku proteins, suggesting that the MMEJ pathway in fission yeast is related with the HR pathway and the SSA pathway (Decottignies 2007). \n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system has been applied to fission yeast (Jacobs et al. 2014;Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez et al. 2017;Fernandez and Berro 2016;Zhang et al. 2018). However, using the prevalent CRISPR/ Cas9 system in fission yeast remains laborious particularly because of the complicated gRNA expression vector construction. The gRNA expression vector has inefficient restriction sites for inserting the gRNA target sequence, resulting in the difficulty of preparing the gRNA expression vector. To avoid this cloning difficulty, it has been recently reported the cloning-free system that assembled gRNA-Cas9 expression vector by in vivo gap repair process (Zhang et al. 2018). Overexpression of Cas9 protein by a constitutive promoter inhibits the cell growth (Jacobs et al. 2014). In addition, preparing long donor DNA is labor-intensive. The use of synthetic oligonucleotides as donor DNA for knock-in has an advantage to save the labor for donor DNA preparation, and it has been reported that the synthetic oligonucleotides could introduce the genome editing using 45 bp of homology arms in fission yeast (Zhang et al. 2018). However, it takes a cost to prepare the long oligonucleotides. \n\nTo implement the short-homology-mediated genome editing, we improved the CRISPR/Cas9 system by generating more convenient vectors to express gRNA and the Cas9 protein in fission yeast. Using this system, we optimized the length of homologous sequences required for the precise genome editing.",

            "text": "The CRISPR-Cas system has been extensively used for multifunctional genome editing and transcription regulation in various species since 2013. Most of these applications are based on the type II CRISPR-Cas9 system derived from Streptococcus pyogenes. However, the expression of heterologous Cas9 is highly toxic to a multitude of microorganisms [65,66], resulting in low transformation efficiency and failure of genome editing. Therefore, researchers proposed to use endogenous CRISPR-Cas system to reduce the toxicity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system [67]. At present, the endogenous CRISPR-Cas system has been used for genome editing and transcription regulation in a few bacteria and archaea [67], its transformation efficiency proved to be considerable. After several attempts to use CRISPR-Cas9 systems for genome editing, Zhang et al. successfully reused the IB-type CRISPR-Cas system in butyric-acid bacteria for genome editing and realized 100% efficiency for multiple genome editing [28]. Specifically, they replaced the leader sequence with a lactose-inducible promoter to drive the expression of the endogenous CRISPR-Cas system, resulting in a total transformation efficiency of 1.7 cfu/mL donor. In addition, any plasmid containing these heterologous nuclease (or nickelase) proteins such as Cas9 or nCas9 driven by the same inducible promoter could not be successfully transformed. This indicates that the endogenous CRISPR-Cas system can be applied to avoid toxicity caused by heterologous CRISPR-Cas9/nCas9 system. Finally, they replaced cat1 by the alcohol dehydrogenase gene adhE1 or adhE2 using the endogenous CRISPR-Cas system, resulting in a butanol production mutant with a butanol titer of 26.2 g/L, which is the highest level been reported. [68] for the construction of crRNA arrays, and achieved 100% efficiency of double genes in-frame knocking out, multiple point mutations (up to six), or single gene insertion using this tool.",

            "text": "Because of its great efficacy, and simplicity of usage, the type II CRISPR/Cas9 system is mostly used in gene editing [70]. A wide range of species and cell types, including human cells, bacteria, mice, fruit flies, yeast, zebrafish, roundworms, rats, and pigs have been successfully genetically edited with the help of the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), which recognizes the 5 -NGG-3 protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, where N is any nucleotide [71]. The range of genetically tractable model species is also being considerably expanded by SpCas9 day by day. \n\nCas9 is a multifunctional protein with two putative nuclease domains, HNH and RuvC [72]. HNH and RuvC have the ability to cleave both the complementary strand and non-complementary strand of DNA, respectively. Additionally, a chimeric sgRNA is needed to activate the CRISP/Cas9 DNA repair machinery, which is composed of a target specific 17-20-nucleotide CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a 85-nucleotide transactivating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), which stabilizes the ribonucleoprotein complex system (RNPC) [73][74][75]. DNA repair machinery is initiated in the order of PAM recognition, sgRNA binding and RNPC formation, which direct the two catalytic nuclease domains to induce double-stranded DNA break (DSB) ~3 to 4-nucleotide upstream of the PAM site. Therefore, by designing specific crRNA that recognizes the viral DNA sequence, Cas9 is able to target DNA in the genome, initiate DSBs and interfere with the production of the target genes [72,76]. \n\nCRISPR and Cas proteins have revolutionized genomic engineering through novel applications, such as the investigation of developmental pathways, gene expression regulation, and animal behavior. In addition, CRISPR/Cas9 has also been used to recruit functional domains that alter gene expression or mark specific genomic regions in organisms or living cells. However, genome engineering is limited in realizing large-scale genome editing with numerous genes or large DNA fragments due to the relatively complicated process for creating DNA-editing templates.",

By utilizing an endogenous U6 promoter, we expressed the target RNA and the bacterial tracrRNA scaffold, which were fused to form a single gRNA transcript. Our data showed that the human codon-optimized Cas9 endonuclease functioned properly in this yeast when driven by the native ACT1 promoter. Additionally, the nuclear translocation signal peptides suitable for human cells containing Cas9 functioned efficiently in C. neoformans. We successfully performed several editing tasks with this system in this fungus, including the creation of indel mutations at the target loci and the modification of the gene encoding Scientific RepoRts | 6:31145 | DOI: 10.1038/srep31145 the ribosomal protein L41. Most importantly, we conducted a targeted gene deletion of ADE2 and Tsp2-1 at a high frequency (over 80% of all transformants). Although the indel efficiencies and homologous recombination rates for different target sites differed, the efficiency was still high (approximately 40-90% for indel and 20-90% for HR as assessed by summarizing all of the genome targeting efficiencies and homologous recombination rates). In addition, we found that optimizing the target sites by sgRNAcas9 software and shortening the distance (< 30 nt) between the Cas9 cut site and the proximal ends of the homologous arms could increase the frequencies of indeland homology-directed repair. We expect that the CRISPR-Cas9 editing system could become a valuable tool for facilitating gene targeting and perhaps for multiplex gene mutagenesis in C. neoformans because of the difficulty of gene disruption in basidiomycetous fungi. This work represents the first report in a basidiomycete, and our findings expand the robust CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome engineering technique to higher fungi.\n\nWe have shown the",

            "text": "CRISPR/Cas9-meditated genome editing techniques were increasingly used in biotechnology, some disadvantages still existed (Zhang et al., 2019). First, the offtarget effect is still a main issue needed to be solved. The designed sgRNAs may form mismatches with non-target DNA sequences, resulting in unexpected gene mutations. These unexpected gene mutations may cause genomic instability and disrupt the function of other normal genes. Although a variety of methods have optimized off-target effects, further improvement is still needed. Hence, conformational changes associated with sgRNA and DNA recognition need to be further explored to obtain higher genome editing accuracy (Mir et al., 2017). In addition, time-dependent control of Cas9 protein activity and the ratio of Cas9 to sgRNA also require further investigation. High expression of Cas9 protein, whether in gene knockout or gene insertion, will affect the growth and recovery rate of host bacteria after transformation, and cause fatal damage to cells in most cases. The existing methods to increase the HR frequency are not suitable to many non-conventional industrial microorganisms. Hence, exploitation of novel approaches to improve homologous recombination efficiency in these strains is critical for precise and efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic engineering. Besides, the intellectual property and scientific ethics issues also hindered the wide application of CRISPR/Cas9. The patent dispute has come to an end in the United States, but the war is continuing in Europe and other countries, delaying its adaptation for industrial biotechnology and pharmaceutical applications. Just like the first test-tube baby that appeared in 1978, employing CRISPR/Cas9 for gene therapy also caused some controversies. Therefore, if the laws in the application of the CRISPR/Cas system were completed, it would promote rapid development in the fields of medicine, genomics, agriculture, and so on.",

            "text": "Because of its marker-free, cost-efficient, simple genome manipulation, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been developed as a genome engineering tool in a wide range of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including (but not limited to) Escherichia coli [29], Clostridium cellulolyticum [30], Streptomyces species [31], Bacillus subtilis [32], Yarrowia lipolytica [33], Saccharomyces cerevisiae [34], mammalian cells [35], and zebrafish [36]. Recently, Aparicio et al. [37] developed a CRISPR/ Cas9-based three-plasmid system in P. putida, and gene deletion or single nucleotide substitution can be achieved. However, this three-plasmid system has challenges regarding plasmid-curing, especially for continual genome editing, and other versatile characteristics of type II CRISPR system have not been fully explored in P. putida KT2440. \n\nCpf1 is a newly discovered single RNA-guided nuclease [38] that belongs to type V-A CRISPR systems [39]. In contrast with the chimeric sgRNA-associated Cas9, in the CRISPR-Cpf1 system, Cpf1 recognizes 'TTN' PAM sequence. The PAM sequence is located at the 5\u2032-end of the target sequence, and the spacer sequence follows a 19-nt CRISPR RNA (crRNA) direct repeat. Aside from the different recognition mechanism compared with Cas9, the staggered cutting style of Cpf1 could facilitate gene insertion for NHEJ repair mechanisms [38]. Taken together, these characteristics make CRISPR-Cpf1 an attractive complementary tool to the well-established CRISPR-Cas9 system. \n\nBecause of the versatile functions and simple manipulation of CRISPR-Cas9, we developed a CRISPR-Cas9 based genome editing system to overcome major limitations of the known gene editing technologies of P. putida KT2440. Here, we tested Cas9 toxicity and analyzed sgRNA off-target effect; multiple genes were targeted for integration or deletion by our two-plasmid system.",

            "text": "This particular fact underlies the observed variation in the expression level of transgenes among the individually constructed transgenic plants [5]. The existing technologies for the production of recombinant proteins in plant expression systems comprise the routine stage of selection of the most favorable transformation events associated with a high yield of the recombinant protein [6]. \n\nThe development of molecular biological and genetic engineering methods and their enhancement as well as the rapid development of the genome editing techniques utilizing CRISPR/Cas allows researchers to set forth the targeted gene delivery to almost any selected constitutively transcribed genomic regions. This will further make it possible to dispense with the laborious screening of a large number of transgenic lines to purposefully construct highly efficient producers of recombinant proteins carrying the target genes delivered to transcriptionally active regions. The site-specific endonucleases (Cas9 being the best known) can make double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) in a specified genomic region, which can be further repaired according to one of the two main mechanisms existing in eukaryotes: nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous DNA repair (HDR). The repair in all eukaryotes except for yeasts prevalently follows one of the variants of NHEJ pattern [7,8]. If a template carrying a transgene is present nearby during the repair, there is a certain probability that this transgene will be knocked-in in a DSB, providing the insertion of an additional gene into the specified genomic region [9][10][11][12]. \n\nIt becomes obvious that the modern method of delivering target genes to specific regions of the genome using the CRISPR/Cas system should be accompanied by preliminary work to identify the regions that are most optimal for targeting editing tools. This approach has opened up the possibility of avoiding some negative phenomena associated with the conventional transgenesis, such as variability in target gene expression, T-DNA-induced mutations, and gene silencing. This has stimulated researchers to search for suitable regions in the plant genome for site-specific delivery of target genes.",

The thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast Ogataea thermomethanolica TBRC 656 is an alternative host for heterologous protein production. However, the limited secretory capability of this yeast is a bottleneck for protein production. Here, we refined CRISPR-based genome engineering tools for simultaneous mutagenesis and activation of multiple protein secretory pathway genes to improve heterologous protein secretion. We demonstrated that multiplexed CRISPR-Cas9 mutation of up to four genes (SOD1, VPS1, YPT7 and YPT35) in one single cell is practicable. We also developed a multiplexed CRISPR-dCas9 system which allows simultaneous activation of multiple genes in this yeast. 27 multiplexed gRNA combinations were tested for activation of three genes (SOD1, VPS1 and YPT7), three of which were demonstrated to increase the secretion of fungal xylanase and phytase up to 29% and 41%, respectively. Altogether, our study provided a toolkit for mutagenesis and activation of multiple genes in O. thermomethanolica, which could be useful for future strain engineering to improve heterologous protein production in this yeast.",

CRISPR-Cas systems are categorized into two distinct classes (six types) based on effector module organizations. In particular, the type II CRISPR system from Streptococcus pyogenes has been extensively studied and well characterized [28,29], and it is also the most commonly used in yeast genetic engineering. The Cas9 protein is a RNA-mediated endonuclease, cleaving the double DNA strands with two active parts-HNH domain and RuvC domain (Fig. 2). Since Cas9 was identified from bacterium, a nucleus localization sequence loxP Fig. 1 Comparing the conventional genome engineering with CRISPR-mediated genome editing. Conventional genome editing methods heavily rely on the use of selection markers for validation and maintenance of the integrated sequences. Furthermore, conventional techniques need multiple rounds of selection and screening to create and identify positive clones, which is time consuming, leave scars in the genome and reduce the genome stability. CRISPR-mediated genome editing system involve genome cutting and repair, which avoid selection marker integration and recycling. In addition, CRISPR-Cas9 system has the power of multiplex genome editing by cell native repair system. Besides, dCas9 system can be used to regulate the gene expression in metabolic engineering (NLS) needs to be fused to Cas9 to allow targeting the eukaryotic nucleus genomes [15]. Another necessary component is single guide RNA (sgRNA) that guides Cas9 to target sites. The canonical sgRNA consists of a CRISPR targeting RNA (crRNA) and a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA). The first 20 base pairs complementary sequence at 5\u2032 end of crRNA is indispensable for Cas9 endonuclease function, and three nucleotides protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) NGG must be found immediately at 3\u2032 end of the desired locus in genome [30]. The sgRNA has a specific secondary structure to recruit Cas9 to form a functional complex.",

            "text": "The potential applicability of CRISPR/Cas9 as a genome-editing tool based on in vivo cleavage activity [7] has allowed for genetic modification in living organisms [15,16]. Various novel genome editing techniques were later developed, including gene disruption using a drug marker [26], gene deletion [41], and point mutation [42]. In Streptomyces sp., gene deletion was performed using a single plasmid harboring the cas9 gene, sgRNA, and donor DNA with homologous arms [43]. CRISPR/Cas9 system has been also used for engineering of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters in Streptomyces [44]. A method to achieve seamless genomic DNA deletions or insertions was established in Lactococcus lactis, which exceeded a 75% editing efficiency within 72 h [45]. Plasmid-based gene integration and deletion were achieved in Pseudomonas putida within 5 days using a plasmid that harbored a homolog sequence and I-SceI sites [46]. A double gene deletion method was developed in Streptomyces species using a single plasmid [47]. Further, four E. coli loci were simultaneously edited with a >30% efficiency using three plasmids harboring \u03bb-red recombinases, multiplex donor DNA, and multiplex gRNA, respectively [48]. However, the excision or insertion of several-kilobase sequences may affect the physiology of the modified organism [49] or lead to genome instability [50]. Therefore, these challenges highlight the need for precise and scarless genome editing capable of modifying only a few essential bases. \n\nRepresentative case studies on CRISPR-mediated pinpoint microbial genome editing are summarized in Table 1. Base-editings by CRISPR scissors were screened and confirmed by phenotypic changes in C. glutamicum [51] and Synechococcus UTEX 2973 [52], respectively. PAM-containing sequences were edited in Bacillus subtilis [53] and Lactobacillus luteri [54].",

Together with constitutive expression of Cas9, this system achieves selection-free specific mutagenesis with efficiencies approaching 100%. The rrk1 CRISPR-Cas9 method enables rapid and efficient genome manipulation and unlocks the CRISPR toolset for use in fission yeast. The fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is a valuable model organism, but the lack of a portable RNA Pol III promoter has prevented the implementation of the CRISPR/Cas9 system.

            "text": "As a gram-positive bacterium with good genomic stability, C. glutamicum is more difficult to engineer than genetically tractable hosts such as E. coli [40,48]. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ssDNA recombineering was developed for deleting 400 bp chromosomal fragment in C. glutamicum in the time this manuscript was being prepared [35]. However, gene deletion and insertion with plasmid-borne editing templates that are key enabling techniques for reconstruction and integration of metabolic pathways are still in demand. In this study, a tailormade CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox was developed for efficient and comprehensive engineering of C. glutamicum. Notably, gene deletion and insertion with plasmid-borne editing templates were efficiently implemented. Moreover, single-nucleotide editing and double-locus editing were achieved at efficiencies of 90.0 and 40.0%, respectively, which will considerably accelerate precise genome editing of C. glutamicum. S. pyogenes Cas9 is suggested to be toxic to C. glutamicum and difficult to be introduced into C. glutamicum [35,36]. As an alternative, F. novicida CRISPR/Cpf1 system was recruited to perform genetic manipulation of C. glutamicum recently [36]. Compared to the CRIPSR/Cpf1 tool, the present CRISPR/Cas9 tool has some distinct advantages. First, the efficiencies of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene deletion and insertion using plasmid-borne editing templates were higher than those obtained by CRIPSR/Cpf1. Second, the CRISPR/Cas9 system is more suitable for genome-wide scale engineering of C. glutamicum. Because Cpf1 utilizes a T-rich PAM and Cas9 utilizes NGG as PAM [36,37,49], Cas9 has considerably more editing targets in C. glutamicum. A bioinformatics analysis of the genome sequence of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 revealed 332,289 Cas9 targets in coding sequences, which is 169.6% of the number of Cpf1 targets (195,978) (Additional",

However, the bases that can be edited by this system have been limited to those within the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and guide RNA-targeting sequences. In this study, we developed a genome-wide base editing technology, \u201cCRISPR Nickase system\u201d that utilizes a single Cas9 nickase. This system was free from the limitation of editable bases that was observed in the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and was able to precisely edit bases up to 53\u2009bp from the nicking site. In addition, this system showed no off-target editing, in contrast to the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Coupling the CRISPR Nickase system with yeast gap repair cloning enabled the construction of yeast mutants within only five days. The CRISPR Nickase system provides a versatile and powerful technology for rapid, site-specific, and precise base editing in yeast.",

            "text": "Take the construction of Sc382 for example, we randomly picked 36 single colonies for verification by colony PCR. Among them, 22 colonies (about 61.1%) were successfully transformed by linearized DNA. And no wild type endogenous 2\u00b5 plasmid remained in these colonies. The yeast plasmids extracted from strain Sc438 and Sc382 could be successfully transformed to E. coli and obtain the plasmid pE2\u00b5RAF1 and pE2\u00b5REP2. The sequencing result of the 2\u00b5 related part of pE2\u00b5RAF1 and pE2\u00b5REP2 were consistent with reported endogenous 2\u00b5 plasmid of CEN.PK113-7D (GenBank: CP025735.1) (Piroon et al., 2018), and the editing process was further proved to be successful. \n\nAlthough CRISPR/Cas9 system has been successfully applied in genome editing, it was the first attempt to edit the multicopy plasmid. Comparing with the efficiency of genome editing which was almost 100% (Jakounas et al., 2015;Generoso et al., 2016), the efficiency of multi-plasmid editing was not as high as that. Multi-copy target sequences and the special amplification system of endogenous 2\u00b5 plasmid (Gn\u00fcgge and Rudolf, 2017) made the work of CRISPR/Cas9 system not easy. Some strategies for optimization CRISPR/Cas9 system increasing might be helpful for increasing the efficiency of 2\u00b5 plasmid editing, such as increasing activity of cleavage by using Cas9 variants (Bao et al., 2014), changing the promoter for optimization of gRNA expression (Gao and Zhao, 2013), and facilitating gRNAtransient expression system (Easmin et al., 2019). Anyway, the method for plasmid editing applied in this work had been proved to be viable and successful to insert the target DNA element into the pE2\u00b5 to form a new recombinant multi-copy plasmid and eliminate the original pE2\u00b5 plasmid.",

            "text": "Currently, the CRISPR/Cas tools used in bacteria still face challenges, such as the high off-target rate of Cas9, weak cleavage activity of Cas12a, and insufficient development of endogenous systems. Therefore, in view of the problems and challenges, we offer some perspectives in the following aspects. \n\nTo reduce the off-target rate, researchers modified the Cas9 protein by replacing positively charged residues with neutral amino acids, and obtained eSpCas9 (K810A/ K1003A/R1060A or K848A/K1003A/R1060A) [111] as well as a new hyper-accurate Cas9 variant (N692A/ M694A/Q695A/H698A, named HypaCas9) with no effect on targeted activity [112]. Furthermore, in order to improve cleavage activity, researchers focused on the CRISPR/Cas12a systems based on AsCas12a and LbCas12a, and inserted a HDV ribozyme at the 3\u2032 end of the crRNA [113], which increased the editing efficiency by 1.1-to 5.2-fold. To further expand the editing toolkit, researchers optimized existing Cas proteins, such as AsCas12a (enAsCas12a) [114] and FnCas12a [115], which can identify a wide range of PAM sequences. Additionally, researchers characterized new so-called CasX proteins, such as Cas12b and Cas12e. Cas12b showed a lower frequency of off-target effects in eukaryotes, along with a broader PAM sequence specificity [91,116]. Recently, CasX was identified as a new RNA-directed DNA endonuclease in E. coli that uses a specific structure to cleave targeted genes [117]. \n\nIn bacteria, the main single-base editor type is CBE, which causes a termination of gene expression and inactivation of protein function by introducing a stop codon. This approach greatly simplifies functional gene identification and metabolic engineering studies. Phage-assisted continuous evolution of the base editor (BE-PACE) was established to increase the editing efficiency and target gene compatibility without GC target limitation [118].",

Additionally, the emerging significance of genetically modified chickens as a potential bioreactor system for producing protein-based drugs is highlighted. The avian bioreactor enables the expression of target genes in ovarian cells, resulting in the production of corresponding gene expression products in egg whites. This production method boasts advantages such as a short cycle, high production efficiency, low research costs, and the expression products being closer to their natural state and easier to purify. It demonstrates immense potential in production applications, scientific research, and sustainable development. The utilization of advanced gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas9, has revolutionized the precision and efficiency of generating genetically modified chickens.

            "text": "The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae serves as a powerful model system with its facile genetics, wellcharacterized genomics, and a vast array of biochemical assays and tools [1][2][3][4]. Yeast research has provided key insights into the mechanisms underlying fundamental cellular processes (e.g., gene expression, DNA repair and proteolysis) and facilitated the development of numerous techniques including DNA transformation, genome manipulation and synthetic biology [1,3,4]. Nevertheless, existing approaches for the incorporation of specific mutations in the yeast genome remain tedious, laborious and inefficient [5][6][7] as they often require specialized systems (e.g., plasmids or conditions) and/or manipulating selectable markers, which introduces additional sequences that may have unintended effects [6,7]. \n\nThe clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system is emerging as a powerful geneediting tool in various organisms from yeast to human [8][9][10]. The RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 can be targeted to specific genomic locus to generate a double-strand break, which allows the introduction of precise mutations by providing a DNA template for homologous repair. With its high efficacy and marker-free exercise, the CRISPR-Cas9 system overcomes many existing limitations and is becoming a preferred method for in vivo genome manipulation [9,[11][12][13]. Among several yeast CRISPR approaches [11][12][13] derived from the work of DiCarlo et al. which first demonstrated the utility of CRISPR in the yeast [9], the protocol developed by Laughery et al. stood out with its higher efficiency and relative simplicity [11]. Nevertheless, one time-consuming step in Laughery's approach involves the cloning of the single-guide RNA (sgRNA), which target Cas9 to relevant chromosomal loci [11], into the vectors (e.g., pML104, pML107) with unique restriction sites (SwaI and BclI).",

Here, we first discuss how the components of the CRISPR-Cas9 system affect the gene editing efficiency, including Cas9, sgRNA and the editing template/ donor DNA in B. subtilis. Regarding gene regulation, we explain the principle of CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) systems in B. subtilis and how these robust systems have been utilized to improve the production or titers of proteins, vitamins, functional sugars or other biochemicals as well as the advantages and disadvantages of these systems (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Substituting fossil raw materials with biological resources is an indispensable component of a forward-looking climate change policy. Second generation (2G) bioethanol and other biofuels, produced from lignocellulosic materials; biomass unsuited for food and feed applications, will continue to play an important role towards the bioeconomy where renewable biological resources are used to produce food, energy and industrial goods. In order for biofuels to become a competitive alternative to fossil based fuels, the production needs to be significantly more efficient and cost competitive. The selection or development of novel, more efficient production strains for biocommodities is one way to improve the competitiveness of biorefineries.\n\nSynthetic biology, automation, and affordable DNA synthesis has substantially decreased the time needed for strain construction and allows for multiple strain variants to be made simultaneously. Metabolic engineering of production strains has recently seen great progress through the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology (Stovicek et al., 2017). CRISPR/Cas9 technologies have been developed for different industrial strains, allowing simultaneous disruption of two alleles of a gene or several genes simultaneously (Stovicek et al., 2015). Various CRISPR/Cas9 systems have been developed for industrial biotechnology applications and this is expected to increase the number of chemicals and products that can be produced by microorganisms and broaden the diversity of strains suitable for industrial production (as reviewed by Donohoue et al., 2018). We have recently established the CRISPR interference technology in industrial yeast (C\u00e1mara et al., 2020). This technology for modulating endogenous gene expression without promoter engineering simplifies the manipulation of strains for bioproduction (as reviewed by Donohoue et al., 2018). Therefore, the bottleneck in developing production hosts is moving forward from generation of strain variants into testing these under relevant conditions.\n\nIn order to accelerate testing of large numbers of strains or clones under different conditions, a number of microbioreactor systems have been developed and commercialized. As one example, the Biolector\u00ae system, allows quantitative detection of biomass concentrations via scattered light. This platform has been used for evaluating growth of bacteria and yeast (Back et al., 2016;Kensy et al., 2009;Toeroek et al., 2015",

The FISC system still needs to be improved by developing a vector with expanded packing capacity and small construct size to ensure efficient delivery in vivo (102). \n\nComparison of the advantages and disadvantages of SSR and CRISPR-Cas9 system SSR and CRISPR-Cas9 are the two ubiquitously used systems to achieve genome editing. SSRs are most suitable for insertion, deletion, or rearrangement of large fragments (e.g., hundreds or thousands of base pairs), rather than exquisitely targeted modifications such as point mutations. The off-site activity of SSRs is very low because they could tolerate minor variations of the site sequence. Under optimized conditions, the SSRs can complete site-specific recombination fast and efficiently in vivo and in vitro. Site-specific recombination requires only the SSRs and the two target sites. No other cofactors are required. In summary, the advantages of SSRs are specificity, simplicity, high efficiency, and fidelity. Nevertheless, there are some disadvantages such as toxicity, inefficiency, and off-target activity that can limit the applications of SSRs. Low levels of off-target recombination can be promoted by SSR such as Phi31 recombinase at a number of \"pseudosites\". Low level but genome-wide off-target recombination could lead to manifold potential problems such as mutation, insertion, or deletion and failure of chromosome to segregate properly. SSRs expression in vivo can be toxic or even lethal. Persistence of recombination intermediates with strand break and DNA damage caused by covalent SSR-DNA linkages might also result in toxicity. Recombination reaction may be slow or incomplete because of inherent nature of the SSR or incompatibility with the condition of experimental system such as temperatures (103). \n\nCRISPR/Cas (CRISPR-associated protein) is a novel and efficient genome editing tool. The widely used CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of two components: the Cas9 enzyme and a guide RNA (gRNA). The advantages of CRISPR-Cas9 system are simplicity and efficiency.",

            "text": "Synthetic Biology (SynBio) consists of deliberate alterations to achieve desired functions or the creation of specific components that, through transcription and translation, enable organisms to function as expected under multiple stress conditions in biological systems. To accomplish this, the combination of principles from biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science drives these modifications. Another technique that is part of SynBio is Artificial Intelligence (AI), as it incorporates various genetic model algorithms that contribute to faster, more efficient, and more precise improvements, with neural networks and support vector machines being two prominent models. Furthermore, gene editing mediated by CRISPR is a genetic engineering tool that enhances crop yield and tolerance [168]. Among the available tools in SynBio, the CRISPR-Cas system enables more precise genetic editing, which will be discussed below. \n\nThe set of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) associated with a protein (Cas) (CRISPR-Cas) recognizes and cleaves exogenous viruses and plasmid DNA in bacteria, forming the acquired immune system of prokaryotes. CRISPR-Cas is divided into two subtypes: Class I includes an effector protein with a specific function in the CRISPR system, while Class II has an effector protein with multiple functions within the CRISPR system. Subtype II corresponds to CRISPR-Cas9 [169] and CRISPR-Cpf1 (also known as CRISPR-Cas12a). These two gene-editing systems have been applied to filamentous fungi, with studies showing that Cpf1 was more efficient in Aspergillus niger, whereas Cas9 was more effective in Fusarium venenatum. Single-gene editing involves small and large insertions/deletions (indels) and substitutions. To increase cellulase production through Rasamsonia emersonii, Cas9 was used to edit small indels, targeting the ACE1 gene and leading to the deletion of 1-2 bp of the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence, rendering ACE1 non-functional. In large indels, the CRISPR-Cas system introduces two double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, which are repaired through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), leading to chromosomal fragment deletions.",

Extensive human genetic and epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that this condition is associated with one of several specific point mutations or deletions that lead to expression of \u03b3-globin, resulting in upregulation of HbF. Our strategy is to use the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology in human primary CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to efficiently re-create specific genetic variants associated with elevated HbF and to evaluate their safety, effectiveness and durability as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat SCD and \u03b2-thal. We have optimized CRISPR/Cas9 editing of human primary HSPCs mobilized from healthy donors to routinely achieve editing efficiencies of greater than 80%. Improved viability with no reduction in editing efficiency was achieved with Cas9 delivered as a recombinant protein as compared to Cas9 delivered as mRNA. We have further optimized the process at clinical scale in our manufacturing facility to achieve similar viability and editing efficiency with a GMP-compatible process. The high rate of editing in human primary HSPCs mobilized from healthy donors was associated with robust HbF expression following erythroid differentiation. In patient samples, clinically relevant increases in \u03b3-globin mRNA to 39% (as a ratio of \u03b3/\u03b1) in one \u03b2-thal patient sample and to 38\u00b15% (Mean\u00b1SD, as a ratio of \u03b3/(\u03b3+\u03b2)) in six SCD patient samples were observed. Similarly high rate of editing was observed in the CD34+CD38-CD90+CD45RA- long-term repopulating subset of human primary HSPCs, as in the overall HSPC population (88\u00b16% vs 90\u00b14% Mean\u00b1SD, n=4). We have demonstrated the long-term persistence of transplanted cells in a NOD-SCID-Gamma (NSG) xeno-transplant mouse model at 16 weeks (44\u00b112% of cells in controls versus 44\u00b114% and 41\u00b113% for two target modifications, Mean\u00b1SD, n=44-47 for each), and that the proportion of the various hematopoietic lineages derived from the transplanted edited human primary HSPCs was not affected by the editing process. Finally, the high editing rate of 85-90% persisted in human bone marrow cells at 16 weeks, demonstrating durability of the edited cells. Because the NSG model does not appropriately replicate erythroid development, we have also demonstrated normal erythroid potential of the engrafted human CD34+ cells isolated from mouse bone marrow in ex vivo differentiation assays, and the editing level is maintained in the erythroid lineage. In-depth analysis confirmed no detectable off-target sequence disruption at over 5,000 candidate off-target sites that were identified bioinformatically through homology to the on-target site or experimentally through a double strand break identification method. In vivo safety and toxicology studies are ongoing. Taken together, these findings show that a CRISPR/Cas9-based therapy has the potential to upregulate HbF and treat diseases of b-globin. We have optimized editing conditions to achieve high efficiency and viability of editing in human primary HSPCs without detectable off-target sequence disruption, and in turn, demonstrate the durability of this approach in vivo.

T. cruzi is considered one of the least studied and most poorly understood tropical disease-causing parasites, in part because of the relative lack of facile genetic engineering tools. This situation has improved recently through the application of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\u2013CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) technology, but a number of limitations remain, including the toxicity of continuous Cas9 expression and the long drug marker selection times. In this study, we show that the delivery of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes composed of recombinant Cas9 from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9), but not from the more routinely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), and in vitro-transcribed single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) results in rapid gene edits in T. cruzi and other kinetoplastids at frequencies approaching 100%. The highly efficient genome editing via SaCas9/sgRNA RNPs was obtained for both reporter and endogenous genes and observed in multiple parasite life cycle stages in various strains of T. cruzi, as well as in T. brucei and Leishmania major. RNP complex delivery was also used to successfully tag proteins at endogenous loci and to assess the biological functions of essential genes. Thus, the use of SaCas9 RNP complexes for gene editing in kinetoplastids provides a simple, rapid, and cloning- and selection-free method to assess gene function in these important human pathogens. IMPORTANCE Protozoan parasites remain some of the highest-impact human and animal pathogens, with very limited treatment and prevention options. The development of improved therapeutics and vaccines depends on a better understanding of the unique biology of these organisms, and understanding their biology, in turn, requires the ability to track and manipulate the products of genes. In this work, we describe new methods that are available to essentially any laboratory and applicable to any parasite isolate for easily and rapidly editing the genomes of kinetoplastid parasites. We demonstrate that these methods provide the means to quickly assess function, including that of the products of essential genes and potential targets of drugs, and to tag gene products at their endogenous loci.

The current strategies are centered on preventing its spread or developing resistant varieties. However, very little is known about the genetic machinery used by the fungus to infect and kill banana plants. Therefore, research should the focused also in understanding the plant-pathogen molecular interaction by targeting virulent genes for knock-out in Fusarium. This study aims to standardize a gene editing protocol using CRISPR Cas9 technology in Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense race 1 (Foc1); specifically, to induce targeted mutations on a particular effector gene, SIX9, of Foc1.

            "text": "Introduction Fusarium wilt of bananas (Musa spp.), a threat to sustainable banana production worldwide, necessitates immediate action to control the disease. The current strategies are centered on preventing its spread or developing resistant varieties. However, very little is known about the genetic machinery used by the fungus to infect and kill banana plants. Therefore, research should the focused also in understanding the plant-pathogen molecular interaction by targeting virulent genes for knock-out in Fusarium. This study aims to standardize a gene editing protocol using CRISPR Cas9 technology in Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense race 1 (Foc1); specifically, to induce targeted mutations on a particular effector gene, SIX9, of Foc1.

The emergence of CRISPR-Cas9 technology has significantly improved the efficiency of gene manipulations of non-conventional species including K. phaffii. Yet, improvements in gene-editing methods are desirable to further accelerate engineering of industrially and scientifically relevant K. phaffii strains. In this study, we have developed a versatile one vector-based CRISPR-Cas9 method and showed that it works efficiently at different genetic loci using linear DNA fragments with very short targeting sequences. Importantly, we show that by using our setup it is possible to catalyze single-stranded oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis and marker-free gene integrations. Notably, we performed site-specific point mutations and full gene deletions using single stranded 90-mers at very high efficiencies. Lastly, we present a strategy for transient inactivation of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, where KU70 gene is disrupted by a visual marker (uidA gene). The latter system enables precise CRISPR-Cas9 based editing (including multiplexing) and accelerates selection of the mutants that have simultaneously undergone a desired genetic modification(s) and restored NHEJ-proficient genotype. In conclusion, the tools presented in this study can be applied for easy and efficient engineering of K. phaffii strains and could potentially be coupled with high-throughput automated workflows.",

                "snippets": "Recently, there has been growing evidence that the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing approach enables efficient, intricately controlled gene expression and versatile cross-species genome editing in various micro-organisms (Jiang et al., 2016)(Jako\u010di\u016bnas et al., 2016)(Sander et al., 2014). Briefly, the action mechanism of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is that the complex of small crRNAs produced by the coordinated action of a small, trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), the Cas9 nuclease, and the host RNaseIII directs Cas9 to cleave the target DNA, which is followed by an adjacent protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). The target DNA is recognized by its alignment with the 12-15 nucleotides at the 3 end of the crRNA guide sequence as well as the NGG sequence of PAM. Unlike the effort to manipulate other transcription factors, the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be simply applied to genome editing and metabolic pathway engineering by only altering the target sequence without any protein engineering. For example, Jiang et al. reported the introduction of point mutations and codon changes in the E. coli genome using the CRISPR/Cas9 method (Jiang et al., 2016). For instance, the \u03b2-carotene biosynthetic pathway, the methylerythritol-phosphate pathway, and the central metabolic pathways in E. coli were systematically optimized for \u03b2-carotene production by iterative editing of the 2-day editing cycle, and the best production was 2.0 g/L \u03b2-carotene (fed-batch fermentation) (Li et al., 2015).",

Briefly, the action mechanism of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is that the complex of small crRNAs produced by the coordinated action of a small, trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), the Cas9 nuclease, and the host RNaseIII directs Cas9 to cleave the target DNA, which is followed by an adjacent protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). The target DNA is recognized by its alignment with the 12-15 nucleotides at the 3 end of the crRNA guide sequence as well as the NGG sequence of PAM. Unlike the effort to manipulate other transcription factors, the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be simply applied to genome editing and metabolic pathway engineering by only altering the target sequence without any protein engineering. For example, Jiang et al. reported the introduction of point mutations and codon changes in the E. coli genome using the CRISPR/Cas9 method (Jiang et al., 2016). For instance, the \u03b2-carotene biosynthetic pathway, the methylerythritol-phosphate pathway, and the central metabolic pathways in E. coli were systematically optimized for \u03b2-carotene production by iterative editing of the 2-day editing cycle, and the best production was 2.0 g/L \u03b2-carotene (fed-batch fermentation) (Li et al., 2015)."

However, especially when multiple genetic manipulations are required, strain construction is still a time-consuming process. This study describes new CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches for easy, fast strain construction in yeast and explores their potential for simultaneous introduction of multiple genetic modifications. An open-source tool (http://yeastriction.tnw.tudelft.nl) is presented for identification of suitable Cas9 target sites in S. cerevisiae strains. A transformation strategy, using in vivo assembly of a guideRNA plasmid and subsequent genetic modification, was successfully implemented with high accuracies. An alternative strategy, using in vitro assembled plasmids containing two gRNAs, was used to simultaneously introduce up to six genetic modifications in a single transformation step with high efficiencies. Where previous studies mainly focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene inactivation, we demonstrate the versatility of CRISPR/Cas9-based engineering of yeast by achieving simultaneous integration of a multigene construct combined with gene deletion and the simultaneous introduction of two single-nucleotide mutations at different loci. Sets of standardized plasmids, as well as the web-based Yeastriction target-sequence identifier and primer-design tool, are made available to the yeast research community to facilitate fast, standardized and efficient application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system.",

First proposed by Jiang and co-workers, the strategy has been subsequently fine-tuned by several authors who demonstrated, by using few selected loci, that the efficiency of mutagenesis (number of mutant colonies over total number of colonies analyzed) can be extremely high (up to 100%). However, from published data it is difficult to appreciate the robustness of the technology, defined as the number of successfully mutated loci over the total number of targeted loci. This information is particularly relevant in high-throughput genome editing, where repetition of experiments to rescue missing mutants would be impractical. This work describes a \u201cbrute force\u201d validation activity, which culminated in the definition of a robust, simple and rapid protocol for single or multiple gene deletions.ResultsWe first set up our own version of the CRISPR/Cas9 protocol and then we evaluated the mutagenesis efficiency by changing different parameters including sequence of guide RNAs, length and concentration of donor DNAs, and use of single stranded and double stranded donor DNAs. We then validated the optimized conditions targeting 78 \u201cdispensable\u201d genes. This work led to the definition of a protocol, featuring the use of double stranded synthetic donor DNAs, which guarantees mutagenesis efficiencies consistently higher than 10% and a robustness of 100%. The procedure can be applied also for simultaneous gene deletions.ConclusionsThis work defines for the first time the robustness of a CRISPR/Cas9-based protocol based on a large sample size. Since the technical solutions here proposed can be applied to other similar procedures, the data could be of general interest for the scientific community working on bacterial genome editing and, in particular, for those involved in synthetic biology projects requiring high throughput procedures."

Array-based oligo technologies enable creating hundreds of thousands of cassettes containing a donor template and a genome-targeting gRNA and a pooled plasmid library generates designed mutations in parallel. After CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, each plasmid can be served as a genetic barcode and the frequency of each designed mutation can be tracked by next-generation sequencing (NGS). This approach was applied to improve ethanol tolerance and production in S. cerevisiae by perturbing 25 regulatory genes with 43,020 mutations (Liu et al., 2019). Also, genetic parts encoding overexpression and knockdown mutations of >90% yeast genes were iteratively integrated into the repetitive genomic sequences in a modular manner based on multiplex integration by CRISPR/Cas9. This approach with the aid of robotic automation allowed functional mapping and multiplex optimization on a genome scale for diverse phenotypes such as acetic acid tolerance (Zhao et al., 2018). A unique advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is that multiple gRNAs can be combined with Cas9, achieving efficient multiplex genome editing. The system could accelerate future genome-scale engineering in polyploid industrial strains (Zhao et al., 2018). Furthermore, the use of lab-on-chip, ultra-low volume nanoreactors allows for high index of selection of variants (Vervoort et al., 2017).",

Optogenetic tools are ideal for achieving such precise control, as light can be applied and removed instantly without complex media changes.

We introduce new optogenetic circuits to shift cells from a light-induced growth phase to a darkness-induced production phase, which allows us to control fermentation with only light. Furthermore, optogenetic control of engineered pathways enables a new mode of bioreactor operation using periodic light pulses to tune enzyme expression during the production phase of fermentation to increase yields. Using these advances, we control the mitochondrial isobutanol pathway to produce up to 8.49\u2009\u00b1\u20090.31\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 of isobutanol and 2.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 of 2-methyl-1-butanol micro-aerobically from glucose.

Array-based oligo technologies enable creating hundreds of thousands of cassettes containing a donor template and a genome-targeting gRNA and a pooled plasmid library generates designed mutations in parallel. After CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, each plasmid can be served as a genetic barcode and the frequency of each designed mutation can be tracked by next-generation sequencing (NGS). This approach was applied to improve ethanol tolerance and production in S. cerevisiae by perturbing 25 regulatory genes with 43,020 mutations (Liu et al., 2019). Also, genetic parts encoding overexpression and knockdown mutations of >90% yeast genes were iteratively integrated into the repetitive genomic sequences in a modular manner based on multiplex integration by CRISPR/Cas9. This approach with the aid of robotic automation allowed functional mapping and multiplex optimization on a genome scale for diverse phenotypes such as acetic acid tolerance (Zhao et al., 2018). A unique advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is that multiple gRNAs can be combined with Cas9, achieving efficient multiplex genome editing. The system could accelerate future genome-scale engineering in polyploid industrial strains (Zhao et al., 2018). Furthermore, the use of lab-on-chip, ultra-low volume nanoreactors allows for high index of selection of variants (Vervoort et al., 2017)."

However, especially when multiple genetic manipulations are required, strain construction is still a time-consuming process. This study describes new CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches for easy, fast strain construction in yeast and explores their potential for simultaneous introduction of multiple genetic modifications. An open-source tool (http://yeastriction.tnw.tudelft.nl) is presented for identification of suitable Cas9 target sites in S. cerevisiae strains. A transformation strategy, using in vivo assembly of a guideRNA plasmid and subsequent genetic modification, was successfully implemented with high accuracies. An alternative strategy, using in vitro assembled plasmids containing two gRNAs, was used to simultaneously introduce up to six genetic modifications in a single transformation step with high efficiencies. Where previous studies mainly focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene inactivation, we demonstrate the versatility of CRISPR/Cas9-based engineering of yeast by achieving simultaneous integration of a multigene construct combined with gene deletion and the simultaneous introduction of two single-nucleotide mutations at different loci. Sets of standardized plasmids, as well as the web-based Yeastriction target-sequence identifier and primer-design tool, are made available to the yeast research community to facilitate fast, standardized and efficient application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system.",

We further report an accelerated Lightning GTR-CRISPR that avoids the cloning step in Escherichia coli by directly transforming the Golden Gate reaction mix to yeast. This approach enables disruption of 6 genes in 3 days with 60% efficiency using reported gRNAs and 23% using un-optimized gRNAs. Moreover, we applied the Lightning GTR-CRISPR to simplify yeast lipid networks, resulting in a 30-fold increase in free fatty acid production in 10 days using just two-round deletions of eight previously identified genes. The GTR-CRISPR should be an invaluable addition to the toolbox of synthetic biology and automation. Strain engineering is increasingly the bottleneck step in synthetic biology workflows.

The targeting of specific DNA sequences by ZNFs and TALENs depends on the protein-DNA interaction, and then the DNA break is introduced by FokI. However, the construction of specific DNA binding proteins is still a laborious and time-consuming task. \n\nRecently, the CRISPR/Cas system has revolutionized genome editing technology due to its efficiency, accuracy, and convenience (Hsu et al., 2014). This system essentially comprises a DNA endonuclease (e.g. Cas9 or Cpf1) which can bind to the target DNA sequence by the guidance of sgRNA, and then generating DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), and later the repair mechanism including HR, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is activated (Zetsche et al., 2015)(Burstein et al., 2016) (Figure 1A).

The programmable nature of these minimal systems has enabled researchers to repurpose them into a versatile technology that is broadly revolutionizing biological and clinical research. However, current CRISPR\u2013Cas technologies are based solely on systems from isolated bacteria, leaving the vast majority of enzymes from organisms that have not been cultured untapped. Metagenomics, the sequencing of DNA extracted directly from natural microbial communities, provides access to the genetic material of a huge array of uncultivated organisms. Here, using genome-resolved metagenomics, we identify a number of CRISPR\u2013Cas systems, including the first reported Cas9 in the archaeal domain of life, to our knowledge. This divergent Cas9 protein was found in little-studied nanoarchaea as part of an active CRISPR\u2013Cas system. In bacteria, we discovered two previously unknown systems, CRISPR\u2013CasX and CRISPR\u2013CasY, which are among the most compact systems yet discovered.

Here, we exploit the four prevalent TAL repeats and their DNA recognition cipher to develop a \u2018modular assembly\u2019 method for rapid production of designer TALENs (dTALENs) that recognize unique DNA sequence up to 23 bases in any gene. We have used this approach to engineer 10 dTALENs to target specific loci in native yeast chromosomal genes. All dTALENs produced high rates of site-specific gene disruptions and created strains with expected mutant phenotypes. Moreover, dTALENs stimulated high rates (up to 34%) of gene replacement by homologous recombination. Finally, dTALENs caused no detectable cytotoxicity and minimal levels of undesired genetic mutations in the treated yeast strains. These studies expand the realm of verified TALEN activity from cultured human cells to an intact eukaryotic organism and suggest that low-cost, highly dependable dTALENs can assume a significant role for gene modifications of value in human and animal health, agriculture and industry."

The targeting of specific DNA sequences by ZNFs and TALENs depends on the protein-DNA interaction, and then the DNA break is introduced by FokI. However, the construction of specific DNA binding proteins is still a laborious and time-consuming task. \n\nRecently, the CRISPR/Cas system has revolutionized genome editing technology due to its efficiency, accuracy, and convenience (Hsu et al., 2014). This system essentially comprises a DNA endonuclease (e.g. Cas9 or Cpf1) which can bind to the target DNA sequence by the guidance of sgRNA, and then generating DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), and later the repair mechanism including HR, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is activated (Zetsche et al., 2015)(Burstein et al., 2016) (Figure 1A). The CRISPR/Cas system relies on the DNA-RNA recognition for inducing precise DNA cleavage, which is markerfree and capable of simultaneous multi-loci editing, thus greatly accelerates the genome editing."

By combining several metrics we developed a method for global classification of these gene clusters into families (GCFs) and analyzed the biosynthetic capacity of Actinobacteria in 830 genome sequences, including 344 obtained for this project. The GCF network, comprised of 11,422 gene clusters grouped into 4,122 GCFs, was validated in hundreds of strains by correlating confident mass spectrometric detection of known small molecules with the presence/absence of their established biosynthetic gene clusters. The method also linked previously unassigned GCFs to known natural products, an approach that will enable de novo, bioassay-free discovery of novel natural products using large data sets. Extrapolation from the 830-genome dataset reveals that Actinobacteria encode hundreds of thousands of future drug leads, while the strong correlation between phylogeny and GCFs frames a roadmap to efficiently access them."

CRISPR technology is the newest and most advanced gene-editing tool that allows researchers to modify and alter gene functions for transcriptional regulation, gene targeting, epigenetic modification, gene therapy, and drug delivery in the animal genome. The applicability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in gene editing and modification of genomes in the avian species is still emerging. Up to date, substantial progress in using CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been made in only two poultry species (chicken and quail), with chicken taking the lead. There have been major recent advances in the modification of the avian genome through their germ cell lineages. In the poultry industry, breeders and producers can utilize CRISPR-mediated approaches to enhance the many required genetic variations towards the poultry population that are absent in a given poultry flock. Thus, CRISPR allows the benefit of accessing genetic characteristics that cannot otherwise be used for poultry production. Therefore CRISPR/Cas9 becomes a very powerful and robust tool for editing genes that allow for the introduction or regulation of genetic information in poultry genomes. However, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology has several limitations that need to be addressed to enhance its use in the poultry industry. This review evaluates and provides a summary of recent advances in applying CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology in poultry research and explores its potential use in advancing poultry breeding and production with a major focus on chicken and quail. This could aid future advancements in the use of CRISPR technology to improve poultry production."

Genetic engineering in industrial yeasts is undergoing major changes due to Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) engineering approaches. Here we apply the CRISPR/Cas9 system to two commercial \u201cstarter\u201d strains of S. cerevisiae (EC1118, AWRI796), eliminating the CAN1 arginine permease pathway to generate strains with reduced urea production (18.5 and 35.5% for EC1118 and AWRI796, respectively). In a wine-model environment based on two grape musts obtained from Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon cultivars, both S. cerevisiae starter strains and CAN1 mutants completed the must fermentation in 8\u201312 days. However, recombinant strains carrying the can1 mutation failed to produce urea, suggesting that the genetic modification successfully impaired the arginine metabolism. In conclusion, the reduction of urea production in a wine-model environment confirms that the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been successfully established in S. cerevisiae wine yeasts."

To enable stable integration of multiple marker\u2010free overexpression cassettes in the genome of S. cerevisiae, we have developed a vector toolkit EasyClone\u2010MarkerFree. The integration of linearized expression cassettes into defined genomic loci is facilitated by CRISPR/Cas9. Cas9 is recruited to the chromosomal location by specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) expressed from a set of gRNA helper vectors. Using our genome engineering vector suite, single and triple insertions are obtained with 90\u2013100% and 60\u201370% targeting efficiency, respectively. We demonstrate application of the vector toolkit by constructing a haploid laboratory strain (CEN.PK113\u20107D) and a diploid industrial strain (Ethanol Red) for production of 3\u2010hydroxypropionic acid, where we tested three different acetyl\u2010CoA supply strategies, requiring overexpression of three to six genes each. Among the tested strategies was a bacterial cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which was integrated into the genome in a single transformation. The publicly available EasyClone\u2010MarkerFree vector suite allows for facile and highly standardized genome engineering, and should be of particular interest to researchers working on yeast chassis with limited markers available.",

Komagataella phaffii) is a widely used generally recognized as safe host for heterologous expression of proteins in both industry and academia. Recently, it has been shown to be a potentially good chassis host for the production of high-value pharmaceuticals and chemicals. Nevertheless, limited availability of selective markers and low efficiency of homologous recombination make this process difficult and time-consuming, particularly in the case of multistep biosynthetic pathways. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an efficient and marker-free multiloci gene knock-in method in P. pastoris.ResultsA non-homologous-end-joining defective strain (\u0394ku70) was first constructed using the CRISPR\u2013Cas9 based gene deficiency approach. It was then used as a parent strain for multiloci gene integration. Ten guide RNA (gRNA) targets were designed within 100\u00a0bp upstream of the promoters or downstream of terminator, and then tested using an eGFP reporter and confirmed as suitable single-locus integration sites. Three high-efficiency gRNA targets (PAOX1UP-g2, PTEF1UP-g1, and PFLD1UP-g1) were selected for double- and triple-locus co-integration. The integration efficiency ranged from 57.7 to 70% and 12.5 to 32.1% for double-locus and triple-locus integration, respectively. In addition, biosynthetic pathways of 6-methylsalicylic acid and 3-methylcatechol were successfully assembled using the developed method by one-step integration of functional genes. The desired products were obtained, which further established the effectiveness and applicability of the developed CRISPR\u2013Cas9-mediated gene co-integration method in P. pastoris.ConclusionsA CRISPR\u2013Cas9-mediated multiloci gene integration method was developed with efficient gRNA targets in P. pastoris. Using this method, multiple gene cassettes can be simultaneously integrated into the genome without employing selective markers. The multiloci integration strategy is beneficial for pathway assembly of complicated pharmaceuticals and chemicals expressed in P. pastoris.",

It is generally recognized as an efficient and safe cell factory in fermentative productions of chemicals, biofuels and other bio-products. However, it is difficult to genetically engineer for the deficiency of an efficient and versatile genome editing technology.ResultsIn this study, we developed a CRISPR\u2013Cas9-assisted multiplex genome editing (CMGE) approach including multiplex genes knock-outs, multi-locus (ML) and multi-copy (MC) integration methods in yeasts. Based on CMGE, various genome modifications, including gene deletion, integration, and precise point mutation, were performed in O. polymorpha. Using the CMGE-ML integration method, three genes TAL from Herpetosiphon aurantiacus, 4CL from Arabidopsis thaliana and STS from Vitis vinifera of resveratrol\u00a0biosynthetic\u00a0pathway were simultaneously integrated at three different loci, firstly achieving the biosynthesis of resveratrol in O. polymorpha. Using the CMGE-MC method,\u2009\u223c\u200910 copies of the fusion expression cassette PScTEF1-TAL-PScTPI1-4CL-PScTEF2-STS were integrated into the genome.

Moreover, the biosynthesis of human serum albumin and cadaverine were achieved in O. polymorpha using CMGE-MC to integrate genes HSA and cadA, respectively. In addition, the CMGE-MC method was successfully developed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.ConclusionsAn efficient and versatile multiplex genome editing method was developed in yeasts.

Dendrobium officinale is a special orchid species that can grow without seed vernalization. Because the whole-genome sequence of D. officinale is publicly available, this species is poised to become a convenient research model for the evolutionary, developmental, and genetic studies of Orchidaceae. Despite these advantages, the methods of genetic manipulation are poorly developed in D. officinale. In this study, based on the previously developed Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation system, we identified several highly efficient promoters for exogenous gene expression and successfully applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system for editing endogenous genes in the genome of D. officinale. These two basic techniques contribute to the genetic manipulation toolbox of Orchidaceae. The pCambia-1301-35SN vector containing the CaMV 35S promoter and the \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) and Superfolder green fluorescence protein (SG) as reporter genes were introduced into the plant tissues by the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system. Fluorescence emission from the transformed plants confirmed the successful transcription and translation of SG genes into functional proteins. We compared the GUS activity under different promoters including four commonly used promoters (MtHP, CVMV, MMV and PCISV) with CaMV 35S promoter and found that MMV, CVMV, and PCISV were as effective as the 35S promoter. Furthermore, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system successfully in D. officinale. By selecting five target genes (C3H, C4H, 4CL, CCR, and IRX) in the lignocellulose biosynthesis pathway, we showed that, for a given target, this system can generate edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) at a rate of 10 to 100%. These results showed that our two genetic manipulation tools can efficiently express exogenous genes and edit endogenous genes in D. officinale. These efficient research tools will not only help create novel D. officinale varieties, but will also facilitate the molecular genetic investigation of orchid biology."

The main advantages of these tools over traditional techniques lie in their efficiency, accuracy and speed. They all rely on site-specific endonucleases forming a double strand break that is repaired either with non-homologous end joining or homology-directed repair. The versatility of the methods stems from the ability to customize the DNA binding domains, allowing for site-specific genome editing. From the techniques mentioned, the use of CRISPR, together with the site specific Cas9 endonuclease, appears as the most promising tool for editing a genome at any number of different loci in a short time. Remarkably, DiCarlo et al. reported a close to 100% recombination efficiency of a linear dsDNA after transformation, together with a plasmid bearing the guiding RNA (DiCarlo et al., 2013). Similar approaches were already used for multiplex deletions of up to five genes (Jako\u010di\u016bnas et al., 2015)(Mans et al., 2015). Hence, the CRISPR/Cas9 tool makes the use of marker-flanked integration cassettes obsolete and paves the way for rapid and efficient genome editing.",

However, especially when multiple genetic manipulations are required, strain construction is still a time-consuming process. This study describes new CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches for easy, fast strain construction in yeast and explores their potential for simultaneous introduction of multiple genetic modifications. An open-source tool (http://yeastriction.tnw.tudelft.nl) is presented for identification of suitable Cas9 target sites in S. cerevisiae strains. A transformation strategy, using in vivo assembly of a guideRNA plasmid and subsequent genetic modification, was successfully implemented with high accuracies. An alternative strategy, using in vitro assembled plasmids containing two gRNAs, was used to simultaneously introduce up to six genetic modifications in a single transformation step with high efficiencies. Where previous studies mainly focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene inactivation, we demonstrate the versatility of CRISPR/Cas9-based engineering of yeast by achieving simultaneous integration of a multigene construct combined with gene deletion and the simultaneous introduction of two single-nucleotide mutations at different loci. Sets of standardized plasmids, as well as the web-based Yeastriction target-sequence identifier and primer-design tool, are made available to the yeast research community to facilitate fast, standardized and efficient application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system.",

The CRISPR-Cas components, Cas9 gene and a designer genome targeting CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA), show robust and specific RNA-guided endonuclease activity at targeted endogenous genomic loci in yeast. Using constitutive Cas9 expression and a transient gRNA cassette, we show that targeted double-strand breaks can increase homologous recombination rates of single- and double-stranded oligonucleotide donors by 5-fold and 130-fold, respectively. In addition, co-transformation of a gRNA plasmid and a donor DNA in cells constitutively expressing Cas9 resulted in near 100% donor DNA recombination frequency.

Through a combination of overexpression and knockouts of relevant genes and optimization of transformation and oligonucleotide designs, we achieve high gene-modification frequencies at levels that only require screening of dozens of cells. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach in three divergent yeast strains, including those involved in industrial production of biobased chemicals. Furthermore, YOGE can be iteratively executed via cycling to generate genomic libraries up to 10 (5) individuals at each round for diversity generation. YOGE cycling alone or in combination with phenotypic selections or endonuclease-based negative genotypic selections can be used to generate modified alleles easily in yeast populations with high frequencies."

The main advantages of these tools over traditional techniques lie in their efficiency, accuracy and speed. They all rely on site-specific endonucleases forming a double strand break that is repaired either with non-homologous end joining or homology-directed repair. The versatility of the methods stems from the ability to customize the DNA binding domains, allowing for site-specific genome editing. From the techniques mentioned, the use of CRISPR, together with the site specific Cas9 endonuclease, appears as the most promising tool for editing a genome at any number of different loci in a short time. Remarkably, DiCarlo et al. reported a close to 100% recombination efficiency of a linear dsDNA after transformation, together with a plasmid bearing the guiding RNA (DiCarlo et al., 2013). Similar approaches were already used for multiplex deletions of up to five genes (Jako\u010di\u016bnas et al., 2015)(Mans et al., 2015). Hence, the CRISPR/Cas9 tool makes the use of marker-flanked integration cassettes obsolete and paves the way for rapid and efficient genome editing."

MAGE was applied to optimizing MEP pathway in E. coli for lycopene production (Wang et al., 2009). A modified method of MAGE was also successfully applied for \u03b2-carotene production in S. cerevisiae (Barbieri et al., 2017). As MAGE generates a vast of combinatorial variants in genome, it could be an effective genome engineering tool only when it is combined with a high-throughput screening (colorimetric or fluorescent) system enabling a selection of variants with desired traits. It is also difficult to incorporate large genetic parts (>1 kb) into genome by MAGE. CRISPR/Cas9 is currently powerful and popular genetic tool for precise genome editing (Jiang et al., 2013;Jessop-Fabre et al., 2016). The endonuclease Cas9 combined with guide RNA (gRNA) specifically recognizes a target site in genome, and facilitates sitespecific nucleotide base-pair mutations, gene deletions, or large DNA fragment (around 8 kb at least) insertions (Figure 2A). \u03b2-Carotene synthesis pathway was integrated into E. coli genome by CRISPR/Cas9-based method. Both MEP pathway and central metabolic pathways were optimized in the engineered strain, and the final strain was cultured in fed-batch, yielding 2.0 g/L of \u03b2-carotene (Li et al., 2015).

                            "In the last few decades, several new, better, and more accurate genetic tools have been developed to improve the efficiency of genome editing, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) (Doyon et al., 2011) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENS) (Li et al., 2011). The targeting of specific DNA sequences by ZNFs and TALENs depends on the protein-DNA interaction, and then the DNA break is introduced by FokI. However, the construction of specific DNA binding proteins is still a laborious and time-consuming task. \n\nRecently, the CRISPR/Cas system has revolutionized genome editing technology due to its efficiency, accuracy, and convenience (Hsu et al., 2014). This system essentially comprises a DNA endonuclease (e.g. Cas9 or Cpf1) which can bind to the target DNA sequence by the guidance of sgRNA, and then generating DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), and later the repair mechanism including HR, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is activated (Zetsche et al., 2015)(Burstein et al., 2016) (Figure 1A). The CRISPR/Cas system relies on the DNA-RNA recognition for inducing precise DNA cleavage, which is markerfree and capable of simultaneous multi-loci editing, thus greatly accelerates the genome editing."

                            "Recent studies indicate that the DNA recognition domain of transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors can be combined with the nuclease domain of FokI restriction enzyme to produce TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) that, in pairs, bind adjacent DNA target sites and produce double-strand breaks between the target sequences, stimulating non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination. Here, we exploit the four prevalent TAL repeats and their DNA recognition cipher to develop a \u2018modular assembly\u2019 method for rapid production of designer TALENs (dTALENs) that recognize unique DNA sequence up to 23 bases in any gene. We have used this approach to engineer 10 dTALENs to target specific loci in native yeast chromosomal genes. All dTALENs produced high rates of site-specific gene disruptions and created strains with expected mutant phenotypes. Moreover, dTALENs stimulated high rates (up to 34%) of gene replacement by homologous recombination. Finally, dTALENs caused no detectable cytotoxicity and minimal levels of undesired genetic mutations in the treated yeast strains. These studies expand the realm of verified TALEN activity from cultured human cells to an intact eukaryotic organism and suggest that low-cost, highly dependable dTALENs can assume a significant role for gene modifications of value in human and animal health, agriculture and industry."

                            "A variety of techniques for strain engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have recently been developed. However, especially when multiple genetic manipulations are required, strain construction is still a time-consuming process. This study describes new CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches for easy, fast strain construction in yeast and explores their potential for simultaneous introduction of multiple genetic modifications. An open-source tool (http://yeastriction.tnw.tudelft.nl) is presented for identification of suitable Cas9 target sites in S. cerevisiae strains. A transformation strategy, using in vivo assembly of a guideRNA plasmid and subsequent genetic modification, was successfully implemented with high accuracies. An alternative strategy, using in vitro assembled plasmids containing two gRNAs, was used to simultaneously introduce up to six genetic modifications in a single transformation step with high efficiencies. Where previous studies mainly focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene inactivation, we demonstrate the versatility of CRISPR/Cas9-based engineering of yeast by achieving simultaneous integration of a multigene construct combined with gene deletion and the simultaneous introduction of two single-nucleotide mutations at different loci. Sets of standardized plasmids, as well as the web-based Yeastriction target-sequence identifier and primer-design tool, are made available to the yeast research community to facilitate fast, standardized and efficient application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system."

                            "BackgroundThe exploitation of the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery coupled to lambda (\u03bb) recombinase-mediated homologous recombination (recombineering) is becoming the method of choice for genome editing in E. coli. First proposed by Jiang and co-workers, the strategy has been subsequently fine-tuned by several authors who demonstrated, by using few selected loci, that the efficiency of mutagenesis (number of mutant colonies over total number of colonies analyzed) can be extremely high (up to 100%). However, from published data it is difficult to appreciate the robustness of the technology, defined as the number of successfully mutated loci over the total number of targeted loci. This information is particularly relevant in high-throughput genome editing, where repetition of experiments to rescue missing mutants would be impractical. This work describes a \"brute force\" validation activity, which culminated in the definition of a robust, simple and rapid protocol for single or multiple gene deletions.ResultsWe first set up our own version of the CRISPR/Cas9 protocol and then we evaluated the mutagenesis efficiency by changing different parameters including sequence of guide RNAs, length and concentration of donor DNAs, and use of single stranded and double stranded donor DNAs. We then validated the optimized conditions targeting 78 \"dispensable\" genes. This work led to the definition of a protocol, featuring the use of double stranded synthetic donor DNAs, which guarantees mutagenesis efficiencies consistently higher than 10% and a robustness of 100%. The procedure can be applied also for simultaneous gene deletions.ConclusionsThis work defines for the first time the robustness of a CRISPR/Cas9-based protocol based on a large sample size. Since the technical solutions here proposed can be applied to other similar procedures, the data could be of general interest for the scientific community working on bacterial genome editing and, in particular, for those involved in synthetic biology projects requiring high throughput procedures."

                "text": "\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 system operates through a distinct molecular mechanism that contributes to its exceptional utility in microbial systems. The system's functionality depends on small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that work in conjunction with trans-activating crRNAs (tracrRNAs) to guide the Cas9 nuclease to target DNA sequences, which must be adjacent to a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) with the sequence NGG. Recognition occurs through alignment of 12-15 nucleotides at the 3' end of the crRNA with the target DNA sequence. <Paper corpusId=\"104386515\" paperTitle=\"(Lee et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nUnlike previous genome editing technologies like zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) that rely on protein-DNA interactions, CRISPR/Cas9 utilizes RNA-DNA recognition.

                            "Recently, there has been growing evidence that the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing approach enables efficient, intricately controlled gene expression and versatile cross-species genome editing in various micro-organisms (Jiang et al., 2016)(Jako\u010di\u016bnas et al., 2016)(Sander et al., 2014). Briefly, the action mechanism of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is that the complex of small crRNAs produced by the coordinated action of a small, trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), the Cas9 nuclease, and the host RNaseIII directs Cas9 to cleave the target DNA, which is followed by an adjacent protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). The target DNA is recognized by its alignment with the 12-15 nucleotides at the 3 end of the crRNA guide sequence as well as the NGG sequence of PAM. Unlike the effort to manipulate other transcription factors, the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be simply applied to genome editing and metabolic pathway engineering by only altering the target sequence without any protein engineering. For example, Jiang et al. reported the introduction of point mutations and codon changes in the E. coli genome using the CRISPR/Cas9 method (Jiang et al., 2016). For instance, the \u03b2-carotene biosynthetic pathway, the methylerythritol-phosphate pathway, and the central metabolic pathways in E. coli were systematically optimized for \u03b2-carotene production by iterative editing of the 2-day editing cycle, and the best production was 2.0 g/L \u03b2-carotene (fed-batch fermentation) (Li et al., 2015)."

However, the construction of specific DNA binding proteins is still a laborious and time-consuming task. \n\nRecently, the CRISPR/Cas system has revolutionized genome editing technology due to its efficiency, accuracy, and convenience (Hsu et al., 2014). This system essentially comprises a DNA endonuclease (e.g. Cas9 or Cpf1) which can bind to the target DNA sequence by the guidance of sgRNA, and then generating DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), and later the repair mechanism including HR, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is activated (Zetsche et al., 2015)(Burstein et al., 2016) (Figure 1A). The CRISPR/Cas system relies on the DNA-RNA recognition for inducing precise DNA cleavage, which is markerfree and capable of simultaneous multi-loci editing, thus greatly accelerates the genome editing."

                            "The CRISPR-Cas9 system appeared as a \"Swiss army knife\" (Mans et al., 2015) in the researcher's molecular toolbox because it allowed the performance of several genetic modifications in a fast and efficient way. Furthermore, the requirement of a constant selective pressure during fermentation is negated since CRISPR-Cas9 allows a markerless genetic manipulation. In addition, several design-build-test cycles are always necessary, which increases the number of modifications required [6](Rodrigues et al., 2017). By using CRISPR-Cas9 systems, genetic editing has become multiplex possible, which may significantly decrease the time to perform the designed genetic modifications for a cell factory construction. The flexibility of CRISPR-Cas9 allied with the researcher's inventiveness resulted in the development of systems that facilitate and accelerate metabolic engineering processes. Researchers are not only focused on developing new CRISPR-based strategies for direct genome engineering but also on applying CRISPR-Cas9 to improve other conventional molecular biology lab practices, speeding up the strain building process. For example, Li et al. (Li et al., 2019) developed a CRISPR system capable of sequential rounds of gene targeting with simultaneous gRNA plasmid curing mediated by CRISPR-Cas9. Moreover, in Zhang et al.'s work (Zhang et al., 2019), the developed CRISPR method skips the Escherichia coli transformation and verification steps."

                            "A variety of techniques for strain engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have recently been developed. However, especially when multiple genetic manipulations are required, strain construction is still a time-consuming process. This study describes new CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches for easy, fast strain construction in yeast and explores their potential for simultaneous introduction of multiple genetic modifications. An open-source tool (http://yeastriction.tnw.tudelft.nl) is presented for identification of suitable Cas9 target sites in S. cerevisiae strains. A transformation strategy, using in vivo assembly of a guideRNA plasmid and subsequent genetic modification, was successfully implemented with high accuracies. An alternative strategy, using in vitro assembled plasmids containing two gRNAs, was used to simultaneously introduce up to six genetic modifications in a single transformation step with high efficiencies. Where previous studies mainly focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene inactivation, we demonstrate the versatility of CRISPR/Cas9-based engineering of yeast by achieving simultaneous integration of a multigene construct combined with gene deletion and the simultaneous introduction of two single-nucleotide mutations at different loci. Sets of standardized plasmids, as well as the web-based Yeastriction target-sequence identifier and primer-design tool, are made available to the yeast research community to facilitate fast, standardized and efficient application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system."

This will further make it possible to dispense with the laborious screening of a large number of transgenic lines to purposefully construct highly efficient producers of recombinant proteins carrying the target genes delivered to transcriptionally active regions. The site-specific endonucleases (Cas9 being the best known) can make double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) in a specified genomic region, which can be further repaired according to one of the two main mechanisms existing in eukaryotes: nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous DNA repair (HDR). The repair in all eukaryotes except for yeasts prevalently follows one of the variants of NHEJ pattern [7,(Demirci et al., 2018). If a template carrying a transgene is present nearby during the repair, there is a certain probability that this transgene will be knocked-in in a DSB, providing the insertion of an additional gene into the specified genomic region (Huang et al., 2019)(Rozov et al., 2019)(Collonnier et al., 2017)[12]."

The knock-ins of genes or their parts, i.e., the insertion of them into a target genome region, are between one and two orders of magnitude less frequent. First and foremost, this is associated with the specific features of the repair systems of higher eukaryotes and the availability of the donor template in accessible proximity during double-strand break (DSB) repair. This review briefs the main repair pathways in plants according to the aspect of their involvement in genome editing. The main methods for increasing the frequency of knock-ins are summarized both along the homologous recombination pathway and non-homologous end joining, which can be used for plant objects."

During traditional strain engineering, the elimination of selectable markers from the genome, known as marker recovery, is a common bottleneck (Tsai et al., 2015) . Even fast-growing yeast cultures require at least five days for marker recovery (Jessop-Fabre et al., 2016) , while integrative transformation itself takes only two or three. Therefore, in the past years several marker-free integration techniques facilitated by CRISPR have been developed (Jessop-Fabre et al., 2016)(Wang et al., 2018)(Liu et al., 2019)(Holkenbrink et al., 2018) ."

To enable stable integration of multiple marker\u2010free overexpression cassettes in the genome of S. cerevisiae, we have developed a vector toolkit EasyClone\u2010MarkerFree. The integration of linearized expression cassettes into defined genomic loci is facilitated by CRISPR/Cas9. Cas9 is recruited to the chromosomal location by specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) expressed from a set of gRNA helper vectors. Using our genome engineering vector suite, single and triple insertions are obtained with 90\u2013100% and 60\u201370% targeting efficiency, respectively. We demonstrate application of the vector toolkit by constructing a haploid laboratory strain (CEN.PK113\u20107D) and a diploid industrial strain (Ethanol Red) for production of 3\u2010hydroxypropionic acid, where we tested three different acetyl\u2010CoA supply strategies, requiring overexpression of three to six genes each. Among the tested strategies was a bacterial cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which was integrated into the genome in a single transformation. The publicly available EasyClone\u2010MarkerFree vector suite allows for facile and highly standardized genome engineering, and should be of particular interest to researchers working on yeast chassis with limited markers available."

                            "In the last few years, new approaches like Zinc finger nucleases (Carroll, 2011), Yeast Oligo-Mediated Genome Engineering (YOGE) (DiCarlo et al., 2013), transcription activator like (TAL) effector nucleases (Bogdanove et al., 2011) and the CRISPR-Cas system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) (DiCarlo et al., 2013)[12] have been developed for deleting or inserting genes and for controlling gene expression. The main advantages of these tools over traditional techniques lie in their efficiency, accuracy and speed. They all rely on site-specific endonucleases forming a double strand break that is repaired either with non-homologous end joining or homology-directed repair. The versatility of the methods stems from the ability to customize the DNA binding domains, allowing for site-specific genome editing. From the techniques mentioned, the use of CRISPR, together with the site specific Cas9 endonuclease, appears as the most promising tool for editing a genome at any number of different loci in a short time. Remarkably, DiCarlo et al. reported a close to 100% recombination efficiency of a linear dsDNA after transformation, together with a plasmid bearing the guiding RNA (DiCarlo et al., 2013). Similar approaches were already used for multiplex deletions of up to five genes (Jako\u010di\u016bnas et al., 2015)(Mans et al., 2015). Hence, the CRISPR/Cas9 tool makes the use of marker-flanked integration cassettes obsolete and paves the way for rapid and efficient genome editing."

                            "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems in bacteria and archaea use RNA-guided nuclease activity to provide adaptive immunity against invading foreign nucleic acids. Here, we report the use of type II bacterial CRISPR-Cas system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for genome engineering. The CRISPR-Cas components, Cas9 gene and a designer genome targeting CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA), show robust and specific RNA-guided endonuclease activity at targeted endogenous genomic loci in yeast. Using constitutive Cas9 expression and a transient gRNA cassette, we show that targeted double-strand breaks can increase homologous recombination rates of single- and double-stranded oligonucleotide donors by 5-fold and 130-fold, respectively. In addition, co-transformation of a gRNA plasmid and a donor DNA in cells constitutively expressing Cas9 resulted in near 100% donor DNA recombination frequency. Our approach provides foundations for a simple and powerful genome engineering tool for site-specific mutagenesis and allelic replacement in yeast."

We further report an accelerated Lightning GTR-CRISPR that avoids the cloning step in Escherichia coli by directly transforming the Golden Gate reaction mix to yeast. This approach enables disruption of 6 genes in 3 days with 60% efficiency using reported gRNAs and 23% using un-optimized gRNAs. Moreover, we applied the Lightning GTR-CRISPR to simplify yeast lipid networks, resulting in a 30-fold increase in free fatty acid production in 10 days using just two-round deletions of eight previously identified genes. The GTR-CRISPR should be an invaluable addition to the toolbox of synthetic biology and automation. Strain engineering is increasingly the bottleneck step in synthetic biology workflows.

Among these animals, is the poultry species. CRISPR technology is the newest and most advanced gene-editing tool that allows researchers to modify and alter gene functions for transcriptional regulation, gene targeting, epigenetic modification, gene therapy, and drug delivery in the animal genome. The applicability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in gene editing and modification of genomes in the avian species is still emerging. Up to date, substantial progress in using CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been made in only two poultry species (chicken and quail), with chicken taking the lead. There have been major recent advances in the modification of the avian genome through their germ cell lineages. In the poultry industry, breeders and producers can utilize CRISPR-mediated approaches to enhance the many required genetic variations towards the poultry population that are absent in a given poultry flock. Thus, CRISPR allows the benefit of accessing genetic characteristics that cannot otherwise be used for poultry production. Therefore CRISPR/Cas9 becomes a very powerful and robust tool for editing genes that allow for the introduction or regulation of genetic information in poultry genomes. However, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology has several limitations that need to be addressed to enhance its use in the poultry industry. This review evaluates and provides a summary of recent advances in applying CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology in poultry research and explores its potential use in advancing poultry breeding and production with a major focus on chicken and quail. This could aid future advancements in the use of CRISPR technology to improve poultry production."

CRISPR/Cas9 has dramatically improved these metrics, with DiCarlo et al. reporting nearly 100% recombination efficiency when using linear DNA co-transformed with a guide RNA plasmid in yeast. <Paper corpusId=\"665503\" paperTitle=\"(DiCarlo et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> This extraordinary efficiency has made it possible to achieve double-strand break-mediated homologous recombination at rates 5-fold higher for single-stranded oligonucleotides and 130-fold higher for double-stranded donors. <Paper corpusId=\"665503\" paperTitle=\"(DiCarlo et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nIn E. coli, researchers have developed optimized CRISPR/Cas9 systems that significantly improve editing efficiency while reducing operational time. One such system combines the \u03bb-Red recombineering machinery with Cas9 under control of an inducible promoter, enabling nearly 100% efficiency for both codon replacements and gene knockouts within just two days. <Paper corpusId=\"210921434\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> These improved systems use triple-plasmid approaches that coordinate expression of Cas9, guide RNAs, and donor DNA templates to minimize metabolic burden while maximizing editing efficiency.\n\nFor Saccharomyces cerevisiae, recent optimization efforts have yielded impressive results. Singh et al. reported a CRISPR-Cas9 strategy for targeted chromosomal integration with 74% efficiency across multiple genomic loci, while also demonstrating that even short 15 bp microhomology arms are sufficient to achieve 50% knock-in efficiency. <Paper corpusId=\"255475133\" paperTitle=\"(Singh et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper> Beyond Cas9, other CRISPR-associated nucleases have been adapted for genome editing, including the Cas12a-like MAD7 nuclease, which enables efficient generation of single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene deletions in E. coli. <Paper corpusId=\"257581463\" paperTitle=\"(Mund et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of CRISPR-based editing is the elimination of selectable markers.

Here, we report the use of type II bacterial CRISPR-Cas system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for genome engineering. The CRISPR-Cas components, Cas9 gene and a designer genome targeting CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA), show robust and specific RNA-guided endonuclease activity at targeted endogenous genomic loci in yeast. Using constitutive Cas9 expression and a transient gRNA cassette, we show that targeted double-strand breaks can increase homologous recombination rates of single- and double-stranded oligonucleotide donors by 5-fold and 130-fold, respectively. In addition, co-transformation of a gRNA plasmid and a donor DNA in cells constitutively expressing Cas9 resulted in near 100% donor DNA recombination frequency. Our approach provides foundations for a simple and powerful genome engineering tool for site-specific mutagenesis and allelic replacement in yeast."

                            "The CRISPR/Cas9 system greatly improved the efficiency of genetic engineering. To improve the genetic engineering efficiency, Jiang et al. construct a triple-plasmid system as mentioned above. This novel genetic engineering tool significantly improved the efficiency of genetic modification and thus accelerated the development of industrial biology. In previous studies, Cas9 and gRNA were expressed in two plasmids, respectively, as the simultaneous expression would burden the organism metabolism and cause cell death. Hence, Cas9 or gRNA should be repressed before a genome editing event. Cas9 and gRNA can be assembled into one plasmid containing a pBAD promoter, which is repressed by glucose and induced by arabinose and a temperature-sensitive replicon repA101ts, so that transformed E. coli could grow on glucoseamended plates and be edited under the induction with 2 g/L of arabinose. This fast and easy procedure for genome editing could perform continuously, as multiple loci only required one plasmid construction and one step of transformation. To further improve the simultaneous editing efficiency of multiple loci, a CRISPR/Cas9-assisted multiplex genome editing technique was developed. The CRISPR/Cas9-assisted multiplex genome editing technique contained three plasmids: pRedCas9 containing both \u03bb-Red recombineering and Cas9 system under the control of pBAD promoter, pMgRNAs containing gRNAs, and pDonorDNAs carrying multiple donor DNA cassettes (Feng et al., 2018)",

                            "One of the most important advantages of CRISPR is that, due to its high efficiency, it allows markerless genomic modifications. During traditional strain engineering, the elimination of selectable markers from the genome, known as marker recovery, is a common bottleneck (Tsai et al., 2015) . Even fast-growing yeast cultures require at least five days for marker recovery (Jessop-Fabre et al., 2016) , while integrative transformation itself takes only two or three. Therefore, in the past years several marker-free integration techniques facilitated by CRISPR have been developed (Jessop-Fabre et al., 2016)(Wang et al., 2018)(Liu et al., 2019)(Holkenbrink et al., 2018) ."

To enable stable integration of multiple marker\u2010free overexpression cassettes in the genome of S. cerevisiae, we have developed a vector toolkit EasyClone\u2010MarkerFree. The integration of linearized expression cassettes into defined genomic loci is facilitated by CRISPR/Cas9. Cas9 is recruited to the chromosomal location by specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) expressed from a set of gRNA helper vectors. Using our genome engineering vector suite, single and triple insertions are obtained with 90\u2013100% and 60\u201370% targeting efficiency, respectively. We demonstrate application of the vector toolkit by constructing a haploid laboratory strain (CEN.PK113\u20107D) and a diploid industrial strain (Ethanol Red) for production of 3\u2010hydroxypropionic acid, where we tested three different acetyl\u2010CoA supply strategies, requiring overexpression of three to six genes each. Among the tested strategies was a bacterial cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which was integrated into the genome in a single transformation. The publicly available EasyClone\u2010MarkerFree vector suite allows for facile and highly standardized genome engineering, and should be of particular interest to researchers working on yeast chassis with limited markers available."

Here, we report a gRNA-tRNA array for CRISPR-Cas9 (GTR-CRISPR) for multiplexed engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using reported gRNAs shown to be effective, this system enables simultaneous disruption of 8 genes with 87% efficiency. We further report an accelerated Lightning GTR-CRISPR that avoids the cloning step in Escherichia coli by directly transforming the Golden Gate reaction mix to yeast. This approach enables disruption of 6 genes in 3 days with 60% efficiency using reported gRNAs and 23% using un-optimized gRNAs. Moreover, we applied the Lightning GTR-CRISPR to simplify yeast lipid networks, resulting in a 30-fold increase in free fatty acid production in 10 days using just two-round deletions of eight previously identified genes. The GTR-CRISPR should be an invaluable addition to the toolbox of synthetic biology and automation. Strain engineering is increasingly the bottleneck step in synthetic biology workflows. Here the authors present GTR-CRISPR for rapid, multiplexed engineering of yeast metabolic pathways."

Such single-target Cas9-mediated genetic knockouts are now used routinely in yeast, for instance to improve bioethanol production processes (Xue et al., 2018)(Chin et al., 2016). CRISPR/Cas9 has also been used to generate genomewide knockout libraries in S. cerevisiae. For instance, the homology directed-repair-assisted genome-scale engineering (CHAnGE) method, developed for targeted mutation, was validated by generating a large deletion collection that was screened for furfural tolerance (Bao et al., 2018). CRISPR-Cas techniques can also be expanded to simultaneously targeting multiple genes in one experiment.

                            "The CRISPR-Cas based editing systems can be utilized for high throughput, multiplex genome editing technologies for genotype-phenotype discovery. Array-based oligo technologies enable creating hundreds of thousands of cassettes containing a donor template and a genome-targeting gRNA and a pooled plasmid library generates designed mutations in parallel. After CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, each plasmid can be served as a genetic barcode and the frequency of each designed mutation can be tracked by next-generation sequencing (NGS). This approach was applied to improve ethanol tolerance and production in S. cerevisiae by perturbing 25 regulatory genes with 43,020 mutations (Liu et al., 2019). Also, genetic parts encoding overexpression and knockdown mutations of >90% yeast genes were iteratively integrated into the repetitive genomic sequences in a modular manner based on multiplex integration by CRISPR/Cas9. This approach with the aid of robotic automation allowed functional mapping and multiplex optimization on a genome scale for diverse phenotypes such as acetic acid tolerance (Zhao et al., 2018). A unique advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is that multiple gRNAs can be combined with Cas9, achieving efficient multiplex genome editing. The system could accelerate future genome-scale engineering in polyploid industrial strains (Zhao et al., 2018). Furthermore, the use of lab-on-chip, ultra-low volume nanoreactors allows for high index of selection of variants (Vervoort et al., 2017)."

                            "Orchidaceae is the second largest family of flowering plants, which is highly valued for its ornamental purposes and medicinal uses. Dendrobium officinale is a special orchid species that can grow without seed vernalization. Because the whole-genome sequence of D. officinale is publicly available, this species is poised to become a convenient research model for the evolutionary, developmental, and genetic studies of Orchidaceae. Despite these advantages, the methods of genetic manipulation are poorly developed in D. officinale. In this study, based on the previously developed Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation system, we identified several highly efficient promoters for exogenous gene expression and successfully applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system for editing endogenous genes in the genome of D. officinale. These two basic techniques contribute to the genetic manipulation toolbox of Orchidaceae. The pCambia-1301-35SN vector containing the CaMV 35S promoter and the \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) and Superfolder green fluorescence protein (SG) as reporter genes were introduced into the plant tissues by the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system. Fluorescence emission from the transformed plants confirmed the successful transcription and translation of SG genes into functional proteins. We compared the GUS activity under different promoters including four commonly used promoters (MtHP, CVMV, MMV and PCISV) with CaMV 35S promoter and found that MMV, CVMV, and PCISV were as effective as the 35S promoter. Furthermore, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system successfully in D. officinale. By selecting five target genes (C3H, C4H, 4CL, CCR, and IRX) in the lignocellulose biosynthesis pathway, we showed that, for a given target, this system can generate edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) at a rate of 10 to 100%. These results showed that our two genetic manipulation tools can efficiently express exogenous genes and edit endogenous genes in D. officinale. These efficient research tools will not only help create novel D. officinale varieties, but will also facilitate the molecular genetic investigation of orchid biology."

                            "The introduction of CRISPR-Cas systems has greatly boosted probiotic engineering by allowing targeted gene insertions, deletions, or alterations. This precision is essential for therapeutic probiotic development. CRISPR-Cas9 is frequently utilized because it creates double-strand breaks at precise DNA locations, which are repaired by NHEJ or HDR processes. This method allows regulated genetic alterations to improve probiotic efficacy in various applications. Engineering probiotics with targeted genome editing addresses complex disease pathways. A type I-E CRISPR-Cas system has been added to Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), a model probiotic, to target and degrade antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and reduce gut microbiome ARG transmission. This change promotes therapeutic efficacy and clinical safety. CRISPR systems are tailored to reduce off-target effects, ensuring therapeutic safety. Beyond Cas9, other Cas proteins like Cas12 have wider protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) compatibility, making probiotic genome targeting more flexible. The diversity of CRISPR-Cas subtypes, including type I and type II systems, expands the toolkit for editing a wide range of probiotic species, supporting the idea of probiotics as \"living therapeutics\" that dynamically respond to host environmental cues."

These high-throughput approaches have transformed strain engineering through array-based technologies, pooled libraries, and automated platforms that dramatically accelerate the development of optimized production strains. (10 sources)",
                "text": "\nThe transformative impact of CRISPR/Cas systems in microbial engineering is perhaps most evident in their multiplexing capabilities, which extend far beyond what was possible with traditional genetic engineering approaches. CRISPR-based technologies have enabled researchers to simultaneously regulate the expression of up to twenty genes and generate an astonishing 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic mutations per day <Paper corpusId=\"244390593\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This remarkable capability represents a quantum leap in genetic engineering throughput compared to pre-CRISPR methodologies.\n\nIn E. coli and S. cerevisiae, researchers have developed a suite of multiplex pathway-optimization techniques that leverage CRISPR systems, including MAGE, YOGE, TRMR, RAGE, CREATE, and CHAnGE. These approaches have dramatically enhanced the ability to engineer complex pathways by enabling simultaneous modification of multiple genetic loci <Paper corpusId=\"203437687\" paperTitle=\"(Liu et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>. For instance, the CHAnGE system utilizes CRISPR/Cas9 and single-nucleotide-mediated homology-directed repair to rapidly evolve yeast strains on a genome-wide scale, significantly improving tolerance to growth inhibitors <Paper corpusId=\"276697152\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nTo improve efficiency while reducing operational complexity, researchers have developed sophisticated plasmid systems for multiplex genome editing. One notable approach is the triple-plasmid system in E. coli that combines \u03bb-Red recombineering machinery with Cas9 under an inducible promoter. This optimized system achieves nearly 100% efficiency for both codon replacements and gene knockouts within just two days <Paper corpusId=\"210921434\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. The system uses separate plasmids for Cas9/\u03bb-Red (pRedCas9), guide RNAs (pMgRNAs), and donor DNA cassettes (pDonorDNAs), enabling simultaneous editing of multiple loci with a single transformation step <Paper corpusId=\"210921434\" paperTitle=\"(Zhang et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe multiplexing capabilities of CRISPR systems have been extended through innovative approaches like homology-integrated CRISPR (HI-CRISPR), which enables insertion of 100-bp mutagenized homologous recombination donors for multiple gene knockouts and genome evolution <Paper corpusId=\"276697152\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, the CasPER system combines error-prone PCR with Cas9-mediated genome editing to integrate large-scale donor-mediated variant libraries into multiple genomic sites with efficiencies approaching 100% <Paper corpusId=\"276697152\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nPerhaps most exciting is the development of high-throughput CRISPR-based technologies for genotype-phenotype discovery. Array-based oligonucleotide technologies now enable the creation of hundreds of thousands of cassettes containing donor templates and genome-targeting gRNAs. These pooled plasmid libraries generate designed mutations in parallel, with each plasmid serving as a genetic barcode that can be tracked through next-generation sequencing <Paper corpusId=\"227168518\" paperTitle=\"(Lacerda et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach has been successfully applied to improve ethanol tolerance in S. cerevisiae by simultaneously perturbing 25 regulatory genes with over 43,000 mutations <Paper corpusId=\"227168518\" paperTitle=\"(Lacerda et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThe scalability of CRISPR-based multiplexing has led to the development of fully automated platforms for genome-scale engineering. Si et al. developed an automated system that uses CRISPR-Cas and a full-length cDNA library to perform multiplex genome engineering in a completely automated manner <Paper corpusId=\"276697152\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2025)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, genetic parts encoding overexpression and knockdown mutations of more than 90% of yeast genes have been iteratively integrated into repetitive genomic sequences using multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 integration, allowing functional mapping and optimization on a genome scale for diverse phenotypes such as acetic acid tolerance <Paper corpusId=\"227168518\" paperTitle=\"(Lacerda et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"4461675\" paperTitle=\"(Zhao et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nBeyond traditional strain engineering applications, CRISPR-based multiplexing has been leveraged for novel natural product discovery. For example, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knock-in of kasOp* has been used to activate silent biosynthetic gene clusters in Streptomyces species, successfully uncovering several novel pathways and natural products <Paper corpusId=\"244390593\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> <Paper corpusId=\"6821899\" paperTitle=\"(Doroghazi et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nA key advantage of CRISPR-based multiplexing is the ability to perform marker-free, iterative genome editing. Traditional approaches required selection markers for each modification, whereas CRISPR systems allow multiple edits without marker integration or recycling, dramatically improving engineering throughput <Paper corpusId=\"53020678\" paperTitle=\"(Yao et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. The efficiency, precision, and marker-free nature of CRISPR-Cas systems have made them invaluable for metabolic engineering applications, particularly for optimizing the MEP pathway for compounds like lycopene and \u03b2-carotene in E. coli and S. cerevisiae <Paper corpusId=\"52962258\" paperTitle=\"(Wang et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAdditionally, emerging CRISPR technologies featuring self-splicing sgRNAs or multifunctional gRNAs are further simplifying repeated genomic edits that traditionally required multiple rounds of screening processes <Paper corpusId=\"263721852\" paperTitle=\"(Wu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. These advances, along with dynamic promoter expression systems (DPESs), have facilitated precise up- and down-regulation of heterologous metabolic pathways not only in yeast but also in other microbial systems like Bacillus subtilis and E. coli <Paper corpusId=\"263721852\" paperTitle=\"(Wu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.",

                            "The CRISPR/Cas9 system greatly improved the efficiency of genetic engineering. To improve the genetic engineering efficiency, Jiang et al. construct a triple-plasmid system as mentioned above. This novel genetic engineering tool significantly improved the efficiency of genetic modification and thus accelerated the development of industrial biology. In previous studies, Cas9 and gRNA were expressed in two plasmids, respectively, as the simultaneous expression would burden the organism metabolism and cause cell death. Hence, Cas9 or gRNA should be repressed before a genome editing event. Cas9 and gRNA can be assembled into one plasmid containing a pBAD promoter, which is repressed by glucose and induced by arabinose and a temperature-sensitive replicon repA101ts, so that transformed E. coli could grow on glucoseamended plates and be edited under the induction with 2 g/L of arabinose. This fast and easy procedure for genome editing could perform continuously, as multiple loci only required one plasmid construction and one step of transformation. To further improve the simultaneous editing efficiency of multiple loci, a CRISPR/Cas9-assisted multiplex genome editing technique was developed. The CRISPR/Cas9-assisted multiplex genome editing technique contained three plasmids: pRedCas9 containing both \u03bb-Red recombineering and Cas9 system under the control of pBAD promoter, pMgRNAs containing gRNAs, and pDonorDNAs carrying multiple donor DNA cassettes (Feng et al., 2018)",
                            "Comparing to the previously established system, this optimized system has a higher gene editing efficiency and less operating time, almost 100% for codon replacements and knockout genes within 2 days."

                            "The CRISPR-Cas based editing systems can be utilized for high throughput, multiplex genome editing technologies for genotype-phenotype discovery. Array-based oligo technologies enable creating hundreds of thousands of cassettes containing a donor template and a genome-targeting gRNA and a pooled plasmid library generates designed mutations in parallel. After CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, each plasmid can be served as a genetic barcode and the frequency of each designed mutation can be tracked by next-generation sequencing (NGS). This approach was applied to improve ethanol tolerance and production in S. cerevisiae by perturbing 25 regulatory genes with 43,020 mutations (Liu et al., 2019). Also, genetic parts encoding overexpression and knockdown mutations of >90% yeast genes were iteratively integrated into the repetitive genomic sequences in a modular manner based on multiplex integration by CRISPR/Cas9. This approach with the aid of robotic automation allowed functional mapping and multiplex optimization on a genome scale for diverse phenotypes such as acetic acid tolerance (Zhao et al., 2018). A unique advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is that multiple gRNAs can be combined with Cas9, achieving efficient multiplex genome editing. The system could accelerate future genome-scale engineering in polyploid industrial strains (Zhao et al., 2018). Furthermore, the use of lab-on-chip, ultra-low volume nanoreactors allows for high index of selection of variants (Vervoort et al., 2017)."

Optogenetic tools are ideal for achieving such precise control, as light can be applied and removed instantly without complex media changes. Here we show that light-controlled transcription can be used to enhance the biosynthesis of valuable products in engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We introduce new optogenetic circuits to shift cells from a light-induced growth phase to a darkness-induced production phase, which allows us to control fermentation with only light. Furthermore, optogenetic control of engineered pathways enables a new mode of bioreactor operation using periodic light pulses to tune enzyme expression during the production phase of fermentation to increase yields. Using these advances, we control the mitochondrial isobutanol pathway to produce up to 8.49\u2009\u00b1\u20090.31\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 of isobutanol and 2.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 of 2-methyl-1-butanol micro-aerobically from glucose.

By combining several metrics we developed a method for global classification of these gene clusters into families (GCFs) and analyzed the biosynthetic capacity of Actinobacteria in 830 genome sequences, including 344 obtained for this project. The GCF network, comprised of 11,422 gene clusters grouped into 4,122 GCFs, was validated in hundreds of strains by correlating confident mass spectrometric detection of known small molecules with the presence/absence of their established biosynthetic gene clusters. The method also linked previously unassigned GCFs to known natural products, an approach that will enable de novo, bioassay-free discovery of novel natural products using large data sets. Extrapolation from the 830-genome dataset reveals that Actinobacteria encode hundreds of thousands of future drug leads, while the strong correlation between phylogeny and GCFs frames a roadmap to efficiently access them."

                            "Although tools in E. coli is relatively abundant compared to many other host organisms, CRISPR-Cas still greatly propels our capability to engineer E. coli. Such capabilities have largely facilitated metabolic engineering and proved to improve the titers, productivities and yields for various chemicals. Compared to the previously available tools, CRISPR-Cas-based systems have a few advantages that have been exploited in various applications. First, CRISPR-Cas system is highly efficient in cleaving the target sequence and thus can be combined with \u03bb-Red recombineering to achieve precise, efficient, and marker-free editing. For example, Jiang et al. developed a two-plasmid system that allowed iterative genome editing of multiple targets and curing of the plasmids after completion [114]. These systems saved the efforts to recycle selection markers and enable multiple modifications to be introduced simultaneously, thus greatly improved the engineering throughput."

                            "Genome engineering tools have been developed to simultaneously target multiple genomic loci like as multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE), and to precisely edit a specific genomic locus without a scar based on the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system (Figure 2A). MAGE was applied to optimizing MEP pathway in E. coli for lycopene production (Wang et al., 2009). A modified method of MAGE was also successfully applied for \u03b2-carotene production in S. cerevisiae (Barbieri et al., 2017). As MAGE generates a vast of combinatorial variants in genome, it could be an effective genome engineering tool only when it is combined with a high-throughput screening (colorimetric or fluorescent) system enabling a selection of variants with desired traits. It is also difficult to incorporate large genetic parts (>1 kb) into genome by MAGE. CRISPR/Cas9 is currently powerful and popular genetic tool for precise genome editing (Jiang et al., 2013;Jessop-Fabre et al., 2016). The endonuclease Cas9 combined with guide RNA (gRNA) specifically recognizes a target site in genome, and facilitates sitespecific nucleotide base-pair mutations, gene deletions, or large DNA fragment (around 8 kb at least) insertions (Figure 2A). \u03b2-Carotene synthesis pathway was integrated into E. coli genome by CRISPR/Cas9-based method. Both MEP pathway and central metabolic pathways were optimized in the engineered strain, and the final strain was cultured in fed-batch, yielding 2.0 g/L of \u03b2-carotene (Li et al., 2015). A set of genomic loci of Y. lipolytica have been identified for targeted marker-less integration using CRISPR/Cas9 (Schwartz et al., 2017). An automated platform for multiplex genome-scale engineering in S. cerevisiae has been also developed based on CRISPR/Cas9 (Si et al., 2017)."

Although this has widely contributed to the interpretation of gene functionality within haploid laboratory isolates, the genetics of metabolism in commercially-relevant polyploid yeast strains is still poorly understood. Genetic engineering in industrial yeasts is undergoing major changes due to Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) engineering approaches. Here we apply the CRISPR/Cas9 system to two commercial \"starter\" strains of S. cerevisiae (EC1118, AWRI796), eliminating the CAN1 arginine permease pathway to generate strains with reduced urea production (18.5 and 35.5% for EC1118 and AWRI796, respectively). In a wine-model environment based on two grape musts obtained from Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon cultivars, both S. cerevisiae starter strains and CAN1 mutants completed the must fermentation in 8\u201312 days. However, recombinant strains carrying the can1 mutation failed to produce urea, suggesting that the genetic modification successfully impaired the arginine metabolism. In conclusion, the reduction of urea production in a wine-model environment confirms that the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been successfully established in S. cerevisiae wine yeasts."

                            "In the last few decades, several new, better, and more accurate genetic tools have been developed to improve the efficiency of genome editing, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) (Doyon et al., 2011) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENS) (Li et al., 2011). The targeting of specific DNA sequences by ZNFs and TALENs depends on the protein-DNA interaction, and then the DNA break is introduced by FokI. However, the construction of specific DNA binding proteins is still a laborious and time-consuming task. \n\nRecently, the CRISPR/Cas system has revolutionized genome editing technology due to its efficiency, accuracy, and convenience (Hsu et al., 2014). This system essentially comprises a DNA endonuclease (e.g. Cas9 or Cpf1) which can bind to the target DNA sequence by the guidance of sgRNA, and then generating DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), and later the repair mechanism including HR, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is activated (Zetsche et al., 2015)(Burstein et al., 2016) (Figure 1A). The CRISPR/Cas system relies on the DNA-RNA recognition for inducing precise DNA cleavage, which is markerfree and capable of simultaneous multi-loci editing, thus greatly accelerates the genome editing."

                            "Recent studies indicate that the DNA recognition domain of transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors can be combined with the nuclease domain of FokI restriction enzyme to produce TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) that, in pairs, bind adjacent DNA target sites and produce double-strand breaks between the target sequences, stimulating non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination. Here, we exploit the four prevalent TAL repeats and their DNA recognition cipher to develop a \u2018modular assembly\u2019 method for rapid production of designer TALENs (dTALENs) that recognize unique DNA sequence up to 23 bases in any gene. We have used this approach to engineer 10 dTALENs to target specific loci in native yeast chromosomal genes. All dTALENs produced high rates of site-specific gene disruptions and created strains with expected mutant phenotypes. Moreover, dTALENs stimulated high rates (up to 34%) of gene replacement by homologous recombination. Finally, dTALENs caused no detectable cytotoxicity and minimal levels of undesired genetic mutations in the treated yeast strains. These studies expand the realm of verified TALEN activity from cultured human cells to an intact eukaryotic organism and suggest that low-cost, highly dependable dTALENs can assume a significant role for gene modifications of value in human and animal health, agriculture and industry."

                            "Genome engineering tools have been developed to simultaneously target multiple genomic loci like as multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE), and to precisely edit a specific genomic locus without a scar based on the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system (Figure 2A). MAGE was applied to optimizing MEP pathway in E. coli for lycopene production (Wang et al., 2009). A modified method of MAGE was also successfully applied for \u03b2-carotene production in S. cerevisiae (Barbieri et al., 2017). As MAGE generates a vast of combinatorial variants in genome, it could be an effective genome engineering tool only when it is combined with a high-throughput screening (colorimetric or fluorescent) system enabling a selection of variants with desired traits. It is also difficult to incorporate large genetic parts (>1 kb) into genome by MAGE. CRISPR/Cas9 is currently powerful and popular genetic tool for precise genome editing (Jiang et al., 2013;Jessop-Fabre et al., 2016). The endonuclease Cas9 combined with guide RNA (gRNA) specifically recognizes a target site in genome, and facilitates sitespecific nucleotide base-pair mutations, gene deletions, or large DNA fragment (around 8 kb at least) insertions (Figure 2A). \u03b2-Carotene synthesis pathway was integrated into E. coli genome by CRISPR/Cas9-based method. Both MEP pathway and central metabolic pathways were optimized in the engineered strain, and the final strain was cultured in fed-batch, yielding 2.0 g/L of \u03b2-carotene (Li et al., 2015). A set of genomic loci of Y. lipolytica have been identified for targeted marker-less integration using CRISPR/Cas9 (Schwartz et al., 2017). An automated platform for multiplex genome-scale engineering in S. cerevisiae has been also developed based on CRISPR/Cas9 (Si et al., 2017)."

                            "In the last few years, new approaches like Zinc finger nucleases (Carroll, 2011), Yeast Oligo-Mediated Genome Engineering (YOGE) (DiCarlo et al., 2013), transcription activator like (TAL) effector nucleases (Bogdanove et al., 2011) and the CRISPR-Cas system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) (DiCarlo et al., 2013)[12] have been developed for deleting or inserting genes and for controlling gene expression. The main advantages of these tools over traditional techniques lie in their efficiency, accuracy and speed. They all rely on site-specific endonucleases forming a double strand break that is repaired either with non-homologous end joining or homology-directed repair. The versatility of the methods stems from the ability to customize the DNA binding domains, allowing for site-specific genome editing. From the techniques mentioned, the use of CRISPR, together with the site specific Cas9 endonuclease, appears as the most promising tool for editing a genome at any number of different loci in a short time. Remarkably, DiCarlo et al. reported a close to 100% recombination efficiency of a linear dsDNA after transformation, together with a plasmid bearing the guiding RNA (DiCarlo et al., 2013). Similar approaches were already used for multiplex deletions of up to five genes (Jako\u010di\u016bnas et al., 2015)(Mans et al., 2015). Hence, the CRISPR/Cas9 tool makes the use of marker-flanked integration cassettes obsolete and paves the way for rapid and efficient genome editing."

                            "High-frequency oligonucleotide-directed recombination engineering (recombineering) has enabled rapid modification of several prokaryotic genomes to date. Here, we present a method for oligonucleotide-mediated recombineering in the model eukaryote and industrial production host Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which we call yeast oligo-mediated genome engineering (YOGE). Through a combination of overexpression and knockouts of relevant genes and optimization of transformation and oligonucleotide designs, we achieve high gene-modification frequencies at levels that only require screening of dozens of cells. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach in three divergent yeast strains, including those involved in industrial production of biobased chemicals. Furthermore, YOGE can be iteratively executed via cycling to generate genomic libraries up to 10 (5) individuals at each round for diversity generation. YOGE cycling alone or in combination with phenotypic selections or endonuclease-based negative genotypic selections can be used to generate modified alleles easily in yeast populations with high frequencies."

Array-based oligo technologies enable creating hundreds of thousands of cassettes containing a donor template and a genome-targeting gRNA and a pooled plasmid library generates designed mutations in parallel. After CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, each plasmid can be served as a genetic barcode and the frequency of each designed mutation can be tracked by next-generation sequencing (NGS). This approach was applied to improve ethanol tolerance and production in S. cerevisiae by perturbing 25 regulatory genes with 43,020 mutations (Liu et al., 2019). Also, genetic parts encoding overexpression and knockdown mutations of >90% yeast genes were iteratively integrated into the repetitive genomic sequences in a modular manner based on multiplex integration by CRISPR/Cas9. This approach with the aid of robotic automation allowed functional mapping and multiplex optimization on a genome scale for diverse phenotypes such as acetic acid tolerance (Zhao et al., 2018). A unique advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is that multiple gRNAs can be combined with Cas9, achieving efficient multiplex genome editing. The system could accelerate future genome-scale engineering in polyploid industrial strains (Zhao et al., 2018).

Optogenetic tools are ideal for achieving such precise control, as light can be applied and removed instantly without complex media changes. Here we show that light-controlled transcription can be used to enhance the biosynthesis of valuable products in engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We introduce new optogenetic circuits to shift cells from a light-induced growth phase to a darkness-induced production phase, which allows us to control fermentation with only light. Furthermore, optogenetic control of engineered pathways enables a new mode of bioreactor operation using periodic light pulses to tune enzyme expression during the production phase of fermentation to increase yields. Using these advances, we control the mitochondrial isobutanol pathway to produce up to 8.49\u2009\u00b1\u20090.31\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 of isobutanol and 2.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 of 2-methyl-1-butanol micro-aerobically from glucose.

Furthermore, the requirement of a constant selective pressure during fermentation is negated since CRISPR-Cas9 allows a markerless genetic manipulation. In addition, several design-build-test cycles are always necessary, which increases the number of modifications required [6](Rodrigues et al., 2017). By using CRISPR-Cas9 systems, genetic editing has become multiplex possible, which may significantly decrease the time to perform the designed genetic modifications for a cell factory construction. The flexibility of CRISPR-Cas9 allied with the researcher's inventiveness resulted in the development of systems that facilitate and accelerate metabolic engineering processes. Researchers are not only focused on developing new CRISPR-based strategies for direct genome engineering but also on applying CRISPR-Cas9 to improve other conventional molecular biology lab practices, speeding up the strain building process.

                            "A variety of techniques for strain engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have recently been developed. However, especially when multiple genetic manipulations are required, strain construction is still a time-consuming process. This study describes new CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches for easy, fast strain construction in yeast and explores their potential for simultaneous introduction of multiple genetic modifications. An open-source tool (http://yeastriction.tnw.tudelft.nl) is presented for identification of suitable Cas9 target sites in S. cerevisiae strains. A transformation strategy, using in vivo assembly of a guideRNA plasmid and subsequent genetic modification, was successfully implemented with high accuracies. An alternative strategy, using in vitro assembled plasmids containing two gRNAs, was used to simultaneously introduce up to six genetic modifications in a single transformation step with high efficiencies. Where previous studies mainly focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene inactivation, we demonstrate the versatility of CRISPR/Cas9-based engineering of yeast by achieving simultaneous integration of a multigene construct combined with gene deletion and the simultaneous introduction of two single-nucleotide mutations at different loci. Sets of standardized plasmids, as well as the web-based Yeastriction target-sequence identifier and primer-design tool, are made available to the yeast research community to facilitate fast, standardized and efficient application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system."

Here, we report a gRNA-tRNA array for CRISPR-Cas9 (GTR-CRISPR) for multiplexed engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using reported gRNAs shown to be effective, this system enables simultaneous disruption of 8 genes with 87% efficiency. We further report an accelerated Lightning GTR-CRISPR that avoids the cloning step in Escherichia coli by directly transforming the Golden Gate reaction mix to yeast. This approach enables disruption of 6 genes in 3 days with 60% efficiency using reported gRNAs and 23% using un-optimized gRNAs. Moreover, we applied the Lightning GTR-CRISPR to simplify yeast lipid networks, resulting in a 30-fold increase in free fatty acid production in 10 days using just two-round deletions of eight previously identified genes. The GTR-CRISPR should be an invaluable addition to the toolbox of synthetic biology and automation. Strain engineering is increasingly the bottleneck step in synthetic biology workflows. Here the authors present GTR-CRISPR for rapid, multiplexed engineering of yeast metabolic pathways."

                            "The introduction of CRISPR-Cas systems has greatly boosted probiotic engineering by allowing targeted gene insertions, deletions, or alterations. This precision is essential for therapeutic probiotic development. CRISPR-Cas9 is frequently utilized because it creates double-strand breaks at precise DNA locations, which are repaired by NHEJ or HDR processes. This method allows regulated genetic alterations to improve probiotic efficacy in various applications. Engineering probiotics with targeted genome editing addresses complex disease pathways. A type I-E CRISPR-Cas system has been added to Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), a model probiotic, to target and degrade antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and reduce gut microbiome ARG transmission. This change promotes therapeutic efficacy and clinical safety. CRISPR systems are tailored to reduce off-target effects, ensuring therapeutic safety. Beyond Cas9, other Cas proteins like Cas12 have wider protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) compatibility, making probiotic genome targeting more flexible. The diversity of CRISPR-Cas subtypes, including type I and type II systems, expands the toolkit for editing a wide range of probiotic species, supporting the idea of probiotics as \"living therapeutics\" that dynamically respond to host environmental cues."
